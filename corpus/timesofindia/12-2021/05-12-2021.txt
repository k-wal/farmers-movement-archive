"The omicron variant is here, and as anticipated we are seeing the beginning of community spread," state Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said in a news release. Seven of the cases have been found in New York City and one in Suffolk County. The arrival of omicron comes as hospitals statewide continue to strain under a surge in coronavirus cases, most traced to the delta variant, along with staffing shortages. The number of people testing positive statewide each day for the virus has doubled in the last 30 days. Gov. Kathy Hochul in recent days has authorized the Health Department to limit nonessential, non-urgent procedures at hospitals close to running out of beds and deployed National Guard teams to relieve healthcare workers at facilities dealing with staffing issues and surging caseloads. Fifteen members of the National Guard arrived at Monroe Community Hospital in Rochester on Saturday, WROC reported. Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin said Wednesday the state would send 13 National Guard teams to the western New York county, where County Executive Adam Bello has declared a state of emergency. New York's omicron cases so far appear to be unrelated, Hochul said. One of the known cases involved a man from Minnesota who was among 50,000 people who attended a three-day anime festival in New York City in November. Authorities have urged anyone who attended the conference to get tested for COVID-19 and wear a mask in public. Much remains unknown about omicron, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it can thwart vaccines and whether it makes people as sick as the original strain. The variant has been detected in a handful of states so far, including Nebraska, Minnesota, California, Hawaii, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Utah, Missouri, New Jersey and Georgia. "We knew the omicron variant was coming and we expect to see more cases. But let me be clear: We are not defenseless,'' Hochul said. "We have the tools to help prevent the spread of this deadly virus: Get your vaccine, get your booster, and wear your mask."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/more-omicron-detected-as-hospitals-in-us-strain-under-virus-surge/articleshow/88096951.cms||---

The warning came a day after Washington hit out at Iran, saying talks with world powers had stalled because Tehran "does not seem to be serious." "We can't accept a situation in which Iran accelerates its nuclear program and slow walks its nuclear diplomacy," said a senior US administration official -- echoing a recent warning by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The official said Washington was not yet planning to walk away from the indirect talks that it resumed with Tehran last week in Vienna, but hoped Iran would return "with a serious attitude." "Iran did not show the posture of a country that is seriously thinking of a rapid return" to the 2015 accord aimed at putting curbs on its nuclear program, said the official, speaking to reporters after returning from the Austrian capital. The seventh round of nuclear talks ended Friday after five days in Vienna, with delegations returning to their national capitals and expected to go back to Austria next week. Iran had paused the talks in June following the election of ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi. The official argued that the United States had shown patience in allowing a five-month break in the process, but that during that time the Iranians were "continuing to accelerate their nuclear program in particularly provocative ways." When Tehran finally returned to the table on Monday, he said, it was "with proposals that walked back any of the compromises that Iran had floated during the six rounds of talks." He accused Iran of seeking to "pocket all of the compromises that others -- the US in particular -- had made and then ask for more." The official said it was not yet known when the European Union coordinator would reconvene the parties, but that the date "matters far less to us than whether Iran will come back with a serious attitude, prepared to negotiate seriously. " At this stage, he said the United States will pursue its efforts at diplomacy -- but reasserted it has "other tools" at its disposal should negotiations fail. The landmark 2015 nuclear accord -- initially agreed between Britain, China, France, Germany Iran, Russia and the United States -- began unravelling in 2018 when then president Donald Trump pulled out and reimposed sanctions, prompting Iran to start exceeding limits on its nuclear program the following year. President Joe Biden has said he wants to re-enter the deal, and the United States has been participating in this week's talks indirectly. Iran has always insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-warns-it-will-not-let-iran-slow-walk-nuclear-talks/articleshow/88097093.cms||---
---||World||Amid Omicron fears, Rio cancels huge New Year's celebration||RIO DE JANERIO: Rio de Janeiro has decided "with sadness" to cancel its huge New Year's celebration amid rising concerns over the spread of the new Covid-19 variant known as Omicron. The move also raises doubts about the city's iconic Carnival in February. "We are going to cancel the official celebration of the New Year's party in Rio," Mayor Eduardo Paes announced Saturday on Twitter. He added the decision was made "with sadness," but in view of the rapid spread of Omicron. Six cases of the variant have been confirmed in Brazil to date. The decision followed intensive debate between city officials and Brazilian health experts, with Omicron arriving after months in which the virus situation in the country had been substantially improving. But in the end, Paes said, "Let us respect science" and take a cautious approach. More than 20 other Brazilian cities, including populous Sao Paulo, have already canceled year-end festivities. On Thursday, Paes said people would now need Covid-19 vaccination certificates to enter beauty salons, restaurants, bars and hotels. They were previously required in cinemas, theaters, gyms, museums and sports stadiums. The city's New Year's festivities, involving joyous dance music and extravagant fireworks displays, typically bring some three million people to famed Copacabana beach. But even without the fireworks, Paes later told reporters, "the city remains magical, incredible, welcoming," and "vaccinated tourists will be very welcome." He also sought to project optimism about the Carnival, noting that it is still three months away. In the meantime, Rio's famous samba schools are continuing the work of preparing -- practicing dance moves, preparing floats and creating exotic costumes. Covid-19 has claimed more than 615,000 lives in Brazil -- trailing only the United States.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/amid-omicron-fears-rio-cancels-huge-new-years-celebration/articleshow/88097157.cms||---

This takes India's tally of confirmed Omicron cases so far to four. Both patients are in a stable condition, health officials in Mumbai and Ahmedabad said. Two people who had accompanied the septuagenarian to Jamnagar by road after he landed at Ahmedabad airport on November 28 have since tested negative. They remain in isolation and under observation. The Dombivli resident, a merchant navy engineer, had travelled to Mumbai from Cape Town via Delhi on November 24. Health officials said he wasn't vaccinated against Covid but did not have any symptoms. Sixty of the patient’s primary and secondary contacts, including 25 co-passengers on the Delhi-Mumbai flight, have been traced and found negative for Covid, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani Kakani said one more person with a possible Omicron infection was quarantined during the day. Mumbai currently has another 17 potential cases of the variant — including 13 travellers and four of their contacts. An equal number are spread out across the state, said a health official.

This has been happening for the past many years, the comparative analysis of reports shows. Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari this week informed Rajya Sabha that 23,483 pedestrians lost their lives in road crashes in 2020. On the other hand, the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) mentioned that 11,901 pedestrians were killed in road crashes in the same year, which is 51% less than the number quoted by the transport ministry. Both the NCRB and the Transport Research Wing (TRW) come out with road accident reports annually. The TRW is yet to publish the road accident report for 2020. Both “only compile” data received from “state police departments”, the yearly reports published by the agencies specifically mention.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); A comparative analysis of the past reports published by the two agencies shows that the data mismatch has been a legacy issue despite several attempts to bring uniformity. While there is a minor difference in the total road death figures in the two reports, there is an unbelievable difference in numbers when it comes to deaths under different categories of road users such as pedestrians, occupants in trucks and bicyclists. Sources said while the NCRB gets data every year from the State Crime Records Bureaus (SCRBs), the TRW gets monthly numbers from state police departments and verifies them again before publishing them. The improper capture of data has been the biggest impediment for framing right policies and measures to address any problem across the globe and this is far more important in the Indian context considering that a maximum number of road deaths is reported from India. “This has been a perennial problem and has been flagged several times. But there is hardly any improvement so far and has a direct impact on the policy making or making any other intervention to reduce road crashes and fatalities,” said Navdeep Asija, traffic advisor to the Punjab government. Prof Venkatesh Balasubramanian from the engineering design department of IIT Madras, who has played a key role in the roll out of a new IT-based data capture of road crashes by the road transport ministry, said, “There are many reasons for discrepancy in the road accident data reported. This is one of the motivations for the road transport ministry to launch the integrated road accident database (iRAD). Having a good quality of triangulated data can help in the analysis of causes, developing interventions and impact assessment of interventions.” So far, at least 14 states and Union territories have joined the iRAD platform for real time and online capture of road crashes and all details relating to the incidences. Balasubramanian said he is confident almost all states will be on board by the end of 2022 and from 2023 the government will be able to get all the real time data without any scope of manipulation or human error. How two agencies collect dataThe ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides’ report of NCRB says, “The information published in this report has been obtained from states/ UTs police. NCRB has only compiled and collated the data and presented it in the form of this report.” The TRW in its report ‘Road Accidents in India’ mentions, “With a view to providing relevant and reliable data on accidents, TRW under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways collects accident data from the state police departments in standardized formats as provided by the UNESCAP under the Asia Pacific Road Accident Data (APRAD) base project.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/51-difference-in-road-death-numbers-from-2-departments/articleshow/88097299.cms||Dipak K Dash

Another task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit, said that it has to be back to the basics of tracing, testing and treating. “As we have seen previously, cases take a month or two to rise after a new variant is found to be in circulation,” he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that there is no cause for panic in Mumbai at the moment. “We have adequate medical infrastructure needed to handle any increase in cases we may see,” he said. Kalyan Dombivli Municpal Corporation Commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi said people should compulsorily observe safety measures of social distancing and wearing a face mask outside home. “I have asked hotel associations and commercial establishments and unions to adhere all safety norms of wearing masks.

---||India||Covid-19: Centre flags rise in cases & deaths in 5 states, Jammu and Kashmir||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday raised concern over a sharp increase in daily cases of Covid-19 and rising mortality rates, particularly in five states of Odisha, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Mizoram and the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir, an alert heightened by the emergence of the Omicron variant. Among the states that were flagged, J&K’s Kathua district reported a staggering 727% increase — though on a relatively low pool of cases — in infections between November 26 and December 2, as compared to a week earlier. Thrissur and Malappuram in Kerala are reporting increasing deaths, a more significant cause of worry. Underlining the threat of the Omicron variant, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan wrote to all these states and J&K urging immediate steps to enhance surveillance of foreign arrivals (particularly from ‘at risk’ countries), monitor emerging hotspots and ensure that all samples from Covid patients are sent for genome sequencing. The Centre has also been pushing states to expand vaccination coverage. Apart from Kerala and J&K, Bhushan also pointed out big surges in weekly caseloads in four districts of Mizoram, including Saiha (237%), and six Odisha districts, including Dhenkanal (667%). In Karnataka’s Tumkur district, cases spiked by 152% in a week, and three Tamil Nadu districts also reported a large increase in new cases. Overall, daily Covid-19 cases in India have been on a steady decline since the peak of the second wave in May, when over four lakh new cases were reported in a day. However, the Centre has been studying the cluster of cases reported from some states, which is seen as a worrying trend particularly in the wake of Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-centre-flags-rise-in-cases-deaths-in-5-states-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/88097495.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: ‘Night vaccination’ drive in Maoist hotbed so no one misses out||NAGPUR: The tribal population of Masandi village, 14 km from Pendhri’s primary health centre (PHC) in Dhanora, Gadchiroli, was surprised when a zilla parishad (ZP) health team arrived in the evening offering to vaccinate them. The village on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border is a known Maoist den. Sixty-seven people from Masandi village were inoculated by the team of health and revenue officials as part of a special "night vaccination" drive in the Maoist-affected district, one of various micro-planning measures undertaken by district collector Sanjay Meena and ZP CEO Kumar Ashirwad. Through this drive across 12 talukas, 12,764 persons have been vaccinated in 124 remote villages. Ashirwad said a survey across 100 villages in the district showed that 23 reasons were cited for not taking a jab. "One of the reasons was the ongoing harvest season and the forest produce collection, which would keep villagers away from their houses during morning hours," he said. The night vaccine drive is undertaken only in far-flung places and not in the towns of Wadsa or Armori. Ashirwad said the drive revolved around the "door-to-door" and "ease of vaccine" visions. "The daytime engagements of the tribals forced the teams to kick-start the drive, even if it meant stepping into the Maoist stronghold, after sunset in places without motorable roads," he said. In one instance, the teams waded through the Indravati river and Karjeli nullah after sunset to reach Kopela village, around 25-30 km from Jhinganoor PHC in Sironcha taluka. The team managed to inoculate 148 people. Ashirwad also said the night vaccine plan was fruitful in talukas like Bhamragarh, Korchi, Etapalli and Sironcha. "It earned the goodwill of the population as it did not affect their daytime engagement for livelihoods. They got health benefits in the evening at their doorsteps," said the ZP CEO. Till Friday, 75.78% of the population had received the first dose, while 39.52% had been administered the second dose. The drive in Gadchiroli district was also monitored by divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma. Ashirwad said the teams faced resistance in the talukas adjoining the Chhattisgarh border and in places like Korchi, Dhanora, Bhamragarh and Etapalli. "During the survey, it was revealed that due to the deaths of some Covid patients in Chhattisgarh after taking the vaccine, their relatives and friends had spread panic in Gadchiroli. Impotency was another fear. We prepared responses for the 23 listed fears and clarified them to the villagers," said Ashirwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-night-vaccination-drive-in-maoist-hotbed-so-no-one-misses-out/articleshow/88097539.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||India||India aims to be net exporter of defence equipment in a few years, says Rajnath||NEW DELHI: Noting that India has exported weapon systems and equipment worth over Rs 38,000 crore in the last seven years, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said the country aims to become an overall net exporter from a net importer in the coming years. "We have an estimated Rs 85,000 crore industry of aerospace and defence. The contribution of the private sector in this has increased to Rs 18,000 crore. Our vision is to make India a global defence manufacturing hub,” said Singh, addressing a MSMEs conclave organised by the Department of Defence Production and the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM). The minister urged the MSMEs to invest more in R&D research to help strengthen the nation's security. "You should bring new technologies, new products. You should not think that just because of your small size, you cannot do great innovation," he added. Around 12,000 MSMEs have joined the defence industry due to the government's initiatives. Innovation, R&D and the number of start-ups have increased in the defence industry due to these initiatives, Singh said. Reiterating the government's focus on encouraging exports, the minister said, "The government aims to achieve the export target of Rs 35,000 crore by 2024-25. Presently, India is exporting defence equipment to around 70 countries. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 2020 report, India is in the list of top 25 countries in defence exports.” Stressing that the armed forces were fully backing the government’s self-reliance drive, he said, "Therefore, the number of contracts given to indigenous defence industry has increased.” "Big defence platforms are assembled from numerous small parts and most of them are provided by the MSMEs. Therefore, I believe that the term ‘industry' really means MSMEs as they are not only responsible for economic activities but also for societal progress," he added. “Today, there is a sizeable number of MSMEs in our country, which contribute 29% to our GDP through their national and international trade. After the agriculture sector, it is the biggest source of providing employment to about 100 million people,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-aims-to-be-net-exporter-of-defence-equipment-in-a-few-years-says-rajnath/articleshow/88097559.cms||---

The rifles will be manufactured in partnership with Russia, sources said on Saturday. The 7.62x39mm caliber AK-203 rifles will replace the in-service INSAS rifle, which was inducted over three decades ago, government sources said. With an effective range of 300 metres, AK-203 modern assault rifles are lightweight, robust and easy to use. The technology of these assault rifles will enhance the combat potential of soldiers to adequately meet, present and envisage operational challenges. AK-203 assault rifles will enhance the operational effectiveness of the Indian Army in counter-insurgency/counter-terrorism operations. Sources said the project would be implemented by a special purpose joint venture called Indo-Russian Rifles Private Ltd (IRRPL). The joint venture is between Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Ltd and Munitions India Limited of India, and Rosoboronexport and Kalashnikov of Russia. The project will provide business opportunities to various MSMEs and other defence industries for the supply of raw material and components, which will lead to job creation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-approves-manufacturing-of-ak-203-rifles-in-amethi/articleshow/88097604.cms||---

This was the first formal confirmation by a senior BJP leader about what Singh has claimed several times since he quit Congress and floated his own political outfit. “We are talking to Captain saab (Amarinder Singh) as well as Dhindsa saab. It is possible that we will have an alliance with both (their) parties. We are talking to both parties with a positive mind,” Shah said during an interaction, which followed his keynote address at the HT Leadership Summit. Sources said Singh will reach the national capital on Monday and meet Shah and BJP president JP Nadda after which the three parties are likely to formally announce their alliance. Shah also ruled out the possibility of farmers’ protests impacting elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, saying after the repeal of the farm laws, no other issue remains. “The PM showed a big heart to end the farmers' protests... Now I don’t think any issue is left in Punjab. The elections will be fought on merit,” he said. Asked if there had been any changes in the electoral atmosphere in western UP, he said the impact of farmers’ protests was even less in the state. Shah also said the Indian economy is the fastest in the world to come out of the impact of Covid because of policy decisions taken by the Modi government. “PM Modi had envisioned that India would have great opportunities in the post-corona world. He visualised that economic slump would affect the globe but policy decisions by the government ensured that the global economic slowdown did not touch the country,” Shah said. On the new Covid variant Omicron, he said the government is keeping a close watch . “People who ridiculed lamp-lighting, bell-ringing and masks are now silent because the corona war was fought by 130 crore people along with state and central governments unlike the rest of the world where only governments were tackling the pandemic...,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-talks-with-capt-ex-sad-neta-for-punjab-alliance-amit-shah/articleshow/88097621.cms||---

In conversation with a television channel, Azad said, “no one can say what will happen next in politics. Like no one knows when he will die. In politics, no one can predict what will happen next, but I have no intention to form a party." Azad, however, lamented that disagreement and pointing out flaws in the running of the party these days are seen as rebellion by the leadership, though it was not so under Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. “Now if you say no, you are nobody,“ he said. Azad is the leader of G-23, a group of congress dissidents who are demanding a change in congress leadership style and strategy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-launching-party-but-cannot-predict-future-says-ghulam-nabi-azad/articleshow/88097662.cms||---

A witness, ACP Sanjay Patil, allegedly said during a meeting with hotel and bar owners that Waze had said Param Bir Singh had given him a target of collecting Rs 2 crore daily. The witness said that “Number 1” was Param Bir. The chargesheet said witnesses have said that Waze was a special aide of Singh. Also, part of the chargesheet is the statement of Narayan Mundada who had alleged that Waze had told him that from the collection made from bookies across Mumbai, Singh would keep 75% while the remaining 25% would be given to Waze. The chargesheet also invoked three new charges, including criminal conspiracy. This was done in light of the statement of a witness from whom Rs 35 lakh was extorted by Waze. The witness, Manan Nayak, alleged he paid up Rs 35 lakh in October 2020 to another accused Alpesh Patel at Waze’s behest after he was threatened to be implicated in a case relating to bookies. The chargesheet said it was established that on August 31, 2020, Waze had conducted a meeting on extorting bookies at crime branch. Statements of five bar owners said they were present in the meeting, and that money was being collected for Number 1. Witness Mahesh Shetty and two others said that Number 1 was the police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/param-bir-singh-set-extortion-target-for-sachin-waze-chargesheet/articleshow/88097781.cms||Rebecca Samervel

BJP tried to normalise ties with Pakistan, and then had Pathankot and Uri attacks. The government asked Pakistan’s ISI to probe its own handiwork. There were Uri surgical strikes, but did it change Pakistan’s behaviour? If it had, then Pulwama wouldn’t have happened. When you initiated a more aggressive response in Balakot, you went on an escalatory ramp and it had no off-ramps. It didn’t escalate then, but there is no guarantee it won’t next time. You have lauded the government for Doklam confrontation, but accused it of caving in later... Unfortunately, 2014 onwards, ties with China have been steadily going down. During UPA, to Prime M Manmohan Singh’s credit, he managed the relationship with China in a mature and sensitive manner. In 2013, there was an intrusion into Depsang, but it was ensured that it was vacated in 13 days. But in 2014, during President Xi Jinping’s visit, the first after Narendra Modi became PM, the Chumar transgression occurred concurrently. In Doklam, while the Chinese agreed to disengage, China has since taken substantial control of the Doklam plateau. What did India gain? If at the end of four years, China is better placed in Doklam, what was that confrontation all about? The other example is the all-party meeting after the Galwan clashes where the PM made the statement that no Chinese have transgressed into Indian territory. So, did India transgress? The book has already made headlines for your comments that the UPA government should have responded militarily to 26/11 attacks... The reference to 26/11 is not really a criticism of UPA, and much less of Manmohan Singh. The Modi government can pat itself on the back on Uri or Balakot strikes, but has it brought about a behavioural change in Pakistan on terror? No. To that extent, 26/11 represented a time when a kinetic response to the depredations of the Pakistan “deep state” would have resonated with influential countries around the world. Why do you say that Wuhan-Mammallapuram Xi-Modi summits created a false sense of security?They have exposed the limits of personalised summitry. If they were a success, then we would not have seen the subsequent events (Galwan and Ladakh intrusions). It’s time for us to look beyond conflict and find a more substantive modus vivendi with China and Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ndas-national-security-response-has-been-more-optical-than-substantial/articleshow/88097845.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Addressing the gathering at the Parade Ground in Doon, the PM made a strong pitch for voting the BJP back to power in the state, “We have a young face in the form of CM Dhami and a strong team with vast experience. Those who are being scattered away throughout the country can do nothing for Uttarakhand. With the blessings of the people, the ‘double engine government’ at the state and Centre will continue to work for Uttarakhand in the future.” Continuing his attack on the opposition, the PM said, “With time, a new form of politics has emerged, in which parties tend to pamper one caste, religion and discriminate in development policies. Such parties don’t allow people to become strong but make them dependent on the government. We follow a path that is difficult but in the interest of the country. We do not practice vote-bank politics, but follow ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.” The PM said the previous governments “did not work on infrastructure of border areas in hills as seriously as they should have.” He added that the BJP government had to “make up for lack of development during the UPA tenure.” “Parties questioning the performance of the 'double engine' government need to realise that between 2007 and 2014, the then government constructed national highway roads of 288 km in length and spent only Rs 600 crore. In contrast, we spent Rs 12,000 crore on 2,000 km of highways.” He added that in the last five years, the Centre released over Rs 1 lakh crore for Uttarakhand’s development. Laying the foundation for the Rs-8,600 crore Delhi-Dehradun Expressway economic corridor, the PM said that the 175-km-long highway will not only cut travel time between the two cities from six to two and a half hours, but also benefit residents of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Haridwar, Shamli and Baghpat, as there will be major interchanges for these cities on the stretch. The PM also announced that “Asia’s biggest elevated wildlife corridor, which will be 12 km long, will be built on the highway and reduce man-animal conflict by allowing safe passage to wildlife”. Notably, the e-way has triggered protests among residents and concern among environmentalists, as 11,000 trees would need to be chopped for it, leaving Shivalik slopes prone to landslides and the wildlife vulnerable. Several protests have been organised by citizens on this and some activists have moved court to stop the tree felling. On December 2, the NGT asked two petitioners to submit a list of mitigation measures in a week and said it will pronounce its judgement thereafter. The PM also claimed that infrastructural development at the four Char Dham shrines has made the pilgrimage smooth, while laying the foundation for Rs 220-crore development projects at Badrinath and Rs 54-crore development at Gangotri and Yamunotri. Apart from these, the PM laid foundations for a Rs 2,082-crore road project to link Haridwar with the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, the Rs 1,602-crore Haridwar ring road project, Rs 69-crore bridge next to Lakshman Jhula, Rs 1,695-crore Dehradun-Paonta Sahib 50-km route and the Najibabad-Kotdwar (NH-119) road widening worth Rs 86 crore. Modi also laid foundations for the Rs 538-crore Haridwar Medical College, Rs 724-crore water supply, road and drainage infrastructure in Dehradun and a Rs 58-crore Child Friendly City Project in Dehradun. The PM also inaugurated seven projects worth a total of Rs 2,573 crore. These included the 120 MW Vyasi hydro electricity project with a 86-metre-high dam, worth Rs 1,777 crore. He said the 415 million units of power that will be produced at the hydel plant will include around 353 million units of green energy per year. Besides, he inaugurated the Integrated Himalayan Cultural Centre, worth Rs 67 crore, to exhibit the state’s cultural wealth and six essential perfume oil and aromatics laboratories covering 20,560 square feet, constructed in Dehradun at a cost of Rs 40 crore. The PM reiterated that “the third decade of the century belongs to Uttarakhand.” Concluding his speech, he recited a poem that he said he had composed for Uttarakhand a few years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pms-dig-at-congress-those-falling-apart-cant-develop-uttarakhand/articleshow/88097888.cms||Kautilya Singh

The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, a pro-farmer outfit, on Saturday filed a police complaint against him for hurting the sentiments of police force and the state’s image but no case was registered. In a viral video clip, Jnanendra, on the phone, took a police officer to task on Thursday in connection with recent incidents of alleged cattle smuggling in Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts. Karnataka is already armed with a new law banning cow slaughter in the state. In the clip, he can be purportedly heard saying, “You people take bribe from cattle smugglers and sleep like dogs, allowing them to operate with impunity.

Gupta (38) couldn’t cushion the shock and was tossed off the bed and fell on the floor, bleeding profusely from his nose and temple. He died before he could receive medical aid, said a highly-placed source. Investigators hammered out the report after analysing sequence of events established by forensic experts, who recreated the crime scene in the presence of Gupta’s two friends — Pradeep Chauhan and Hardeep Chauhan — who were present in the hotel room on the fateful night before being bundled out by police. The crime sequence was matched with autopsy report, which detailed the injuries suffered by Gupta. On November 2, CBI registered a case of murder against six policemen, including Ramgarhtal inspector JN Singh, Phalmandi police post in charge Akshay Mishra, sub inspector Vijay Yadav and three others, who had barged into the hotel room where Gupta was staying with friends. Elaborating the sequence of events, a highly-placed source said, “First, policemen entered the room and demanded identity cards from the trio. An argument ensued and all three were assaulted by cops. Gupta’s friends were bundled out of the room, before he was kicked in the head by a cop, which proved fatal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-businessmans-head-smashed-against-bed-after-cops-kick/articleshow/88097953.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

But there is no need. People have already given Goa that title,” he said. Reddy said people come to Goa for casinos. “They are either here or in Sikkim (both places where casinos are allowed),” he said in the presence of Union minister of state for tourism and North Goa MP Shripad Naik. Although Goa has six offshore casinos and a dozen onshore casinos in starred hotels, the state is yet to come out with a policy to regulate their operations. The offshore casinos are in the Mandovi, and the ports department is looking at alternative sites to relocate them but have failed to do so for years.  Former CM Manohar Parrikar had launched an agitation against casinos in 2012. BJP had fought the election on the issue of removing offshore casinos from the Mandovi, but over the past 10 years, theparty has failed to relocate them. Every six months, the state government takes a decision to grant an extension to them. Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, in his election manifesto, had promised to move casinos out of the Mandovi within 100 days of getting elected, but later said they were required in the river for the business community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-open-to-calling-goa-casino-capital/articleshow/88097998.cms||---

Rifleman Sukanta Das (38) turned himself in after the fragging incident, which comes less than a month after a CRPF constable suspected to be battling emotional stress killed four sleeping colleagues in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma. The victims were Subedar Marka Singh Jamatia (49) and Naib Subedar Kiran Jamatia (37) — both attached to the 5th Battalion. Sukanta had applied for leave some days ago, but it wasn’t immediately approved because the dates clashed with that of a refresher course, sources said. He was subsequently advised to approach Marka Singh, officiating as company commander. On Saturday, Sukanta requested Marka Singh that his leave be sanctioned. The Rifleman allegedly argued with him and Naib Subedar Kiran before opening fire with his service rifle at point-blank range. Marka Singh was killed instantly while his colleague died on way to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/denied-leave-tripura-state-rifles-jawan-kills-2-jcos/articleshow/88098021.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

Justice R Suresh Kumar made the observation while staying a Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department order leasing out 400sqft of a prime land belonging to Arulmighu Nithya Kalyana Perumal Temple on East Coast Road (ECR) in Thiruvidanthai to a private individual. The land was given on lease for three years to Mermaid Properties which wanted access to the property located behind the temple land, despite objections raised by the temple. “Even an inch of land of the temple need not be given to the petitioner by way of lease. The reason being that, if at all the petitioner wants the land for the purpose of approach road towards ECR since a big development has been made in the land belonging to the petitioner, such kind of approach is not a temporary phenomenon as it can be a permanent affair,” the HC said. Therefore, if at all lease is granted for three years, the petitioner would definitely require the lease to be extended for a longer period as it can be a perennial requirement on the part of the petitioner, it added. The HC also made it clear that the reason the land was kept vacant for decades does not mean it could not be made use for any useful purpose in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/progress-is-crucial-but-not-at-cost-of-gods-properties-hc/articleshow/88098024.cms||---

Without them, a parliamentary democracy would be rendered incomplete. It is through the PAC that citizens keep a check on government finances,” the President said while inaugurating the centennial year celebrations of the PAC in the central hall of the Parliament. Invoking Mahatma Gandhi, Kovid said the PAC has lived up to Gandhian ideals and expectations. “Its record over the decades has been commendable and exemplary and its functioning has been praised by independent experts too,” he said. Vice-president and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu called for a wider debate on the “freebies” being doled out to ensure the most effective utilisation of the scarce resources in the country. He called for harmonising the expenditure on freebies under welfare obligations of governments with developmental needs and urged the PAC to examine this aspect to enable wider public discussion. Naidu said the PAC’s constant pursuit of action taken by the government creates the “fear of scrutiny” among all the concerned and this results in systemic improvement and prevention of “financial murders (large scale irregularities and wasteful expenditure)” Highlighting the role of democratic institutions in nation building, Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla said that these institutions are being seen as platforms to solve the problems of the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pacs-help-citizens-keep-a-check-on-govt-finances-president-kovind/articleshow/88098429.cms||---

There were 83 lakh traffic rule violations in the city in 2020. So, in order to save both money and time, Bengaluru traffic police has decided to send the challans digitally — via SMSes — to the vehicle owner’s registered mobile number. A pilot project has already been initiated, where the electronically generated SMS challan will not only describe the type of violation, but also the fine amount as well as a link displaying a picture or video of the offence. The SMS will also have a link facilitating online payment of fines. ‘SMS proposal will save money, time’Traffic police have tied up with the transport department and sourced details pertaining to vehicle ownership and contact details. Since it is mandatory for vehicle buyers to give their contact numbers, there won’t be any difficulty in tracking the offenders. If the mobile number of the vehicle owner is not available, traffic cops will physically visit the address mentioned in the documents and deliver the challan. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda said it costs Rs 4.5 per challan when sent via post. Each day, at least 20,000 such challans are produced for traffic violations, taking the number to 6 lakh a month and 72 lakh per year. “It costs just 20 paise per SMS. Not only money but also time and energy of police as well as the postal staff, will be saved,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/soon-traffic-challans-via-sms-in-bengaluru/articleshow/88098454.cms||---

HM: Some cops hand in glove with smugglersKarnataka police have earned a good name in the country but there were some shortcomings.

I was deeply hurt. This is inhumane,” Jnanendra said, adding that some policemen were hand in glove with the smugglers. He alleged that smugglers target cattle owners in Malnad region and forcibly take away their cattle. Reacting to the controversy, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said Jnanendra had already given a clarification. “His comment was only about a few specific cases, not in general.

Steps will be taken to test, treat and fully vaccinate all members of such clusters,” CM Basavaraj Bommai told reporters. A cluster is declared primarily to restrict the movement of people placed in quarantine so that the infection spread is checked. They cannot have any visitors either.

---||Bengaluru||Omicron scare: Experts advise booster doses for health workers||BENGALURU: Seven doctors recently testing positive for Covid-19 in Bengaluru, including the one infected with the Omicron variant, has left medical professionals worried. What has set the alarm bells ringing is the fact that all seven had taken the second shot of Covid vaccine in February. This concern was raised in a recent meeting of BBMP and an expert panel of doctors. “Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the most vulnerable, and this is evident with a doctor being infected with Omicron. Why has the government delayed booster doses when vaccines are available in abundance?” said a doctor who’s a member of the panel. The government’s silence on children’s vaccination was also discussed at the meet. Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, state Covid Technical Advisory Committee, said there’s a clear need for booster doses for HCWs. “If the state government involves frontline workers in contact tracing, then they must also be given booster doses,” he said. Dr Sudarshan added all those who are vulnerable, like HCWs, frontline workers and persons with comorbidities, should be vaccinated. “We have seen five doctors testing positive recently in our hospital. It has been over eight months since they were jabbed with two doses. The time has come for booster doses. In the UK, the government is giving booster doses three months after the second shot,” said Dr CN Manjunath, director, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research. According to Dr US Vishal Rao, member of state committee for whole genome sequencing, the immune system requires a reminder once in six months to realign itself to the incoming potential invasion. That’s the reason why the US, UK and other European countries have started booster doses, he says. However, the global inequality concerns Dr Rao. “Three doses are being administered per person in some countries and none or just one in some others. Booster doses should be used optimally by covering the most vulnerable like HCWs, frontline staff and senior citizens with comorbidities,” he opined. “Detection of the Omicron variant in a doctor reiterates the need for booster doses for HCWs,” said Dr Jagadish Hiremath, chairman of Aasra hospital, who feels every eligible Indian should get them.. K Anil Kumar, principal secretary, health and family welfare department, said the central government has to take a call on the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/omicron-scare-experts-advise-booster-doses-for-health-workers/articleshow/88098458.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC: No student, staff can be allowed entry without vax dose||BENGALURU: No students, teachers or staff will be permitted to attend school or college without being vaccinated, the high court said on Saturday, dismissing the PIL that challenged the government order in this regard. “We are of the considered view that no students, teachers or staff who have not received vaccines shall be permitted to attend school or college where students gather in large numbers. As such no directions can be issued to permit teachers, students or staff who have not received at least one dose to attend colleges in terms of the government order dated July 16, 2021,” a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said. Dr Srinivasa B Kakkilaya, a medical practitioner from Mangaluru, a couple of professors teaching in Ayurveda colleges and a student had challenged the circular/GO seeking directions for modification. The petitioners had claimed the circular makes the Covid-19 vaccination process mandatory in nature and further discriminates on the basis of status of vaccination of a person, thus violating the fundamental rights of citizens. Contending that the circular is coercive in nature, they pointed out even the World Health Organisation (WHO) has held that vaccines do not prevent spread of the disease from person to person and thus had little potential of stopping the pandemic or preservation of the public health. The circular violates the dictum of the Supreme Court in Common Cause Vs Union of India (2018) case which recognised the right, choice and liberty of an individual to prefer the medicine of his/her choice, it was argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-says-no-student-staff-can-be-allowed-entry-without-vax-dose/articleshow/88098459.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Private labs try to procure RT-PCR kits which can spot Omicron variant||BENGALURU: Private labs in the city have been trying to procure RT-PCR test kits targeting the S gene, following concerns over the Omicron variant. Currently available RT-PCR kits can detect Covid-19 positivity in a person, but can’t specifically say if it is Omicron or some other variant, say experts. Testing kits look for specific genes to confirm the presence of SARS-Co-V2 in a sample. While N gene points to the presence or absence of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-Co-V2 in a given swab sample, the ORF1 gene searches for the polyprotein. Mutations in the latest variant — B.1.1529 — have occurred in the S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. If a sample is negative for S gene, then it is an indicative marker of the presence of Omicron variant, which needs to be further confirmed through genomic sequencing. Dr Sujay Prasad, medical director, Neuberg Diagnostics, said conventional Covid RT-PCR test kits in use at present have reagents that detect the presence of N and ORF1 genes, but not the S gene. “It is now established that the Omicron variant escapes the S gene. But RT-PCR testing kits that we have now don’t contain the reagent for S gene. If the test shows negative for the presence of S gene in a given sample, it is an indicator that the person may have been infected by the Omicron variant,” said Dr Prasad. “We need to find out if a given sample shows negative or positive for S gene. If negative, such samples must be immediately sent for genomic sequencing,” said Prasad. Dr HM Venkatappa, chairman of Bangalore Diagnostics Centres’ Association, said labs will now have to procure test kits with S gene. “We are in the process of finding out test kits that help us in early identification of the Omicron variant. But if we use the new kits, the government’s price cap of Rs 800 at private labs and hospitals can’t be adhered to...,” he said. ‘Genomic sequencing can point to specific strain’Dr CN Manjunath, nodal officer for Covid testing, said the currently available kits are good enough to detect viral positivity in a patient and it is genomic sequencing that can point to the specific variant. Only one testing kit produced by Thermo Fisher has a Covid-19 diagnostic product with S gene detection, which is being highly sought after by private laboratories now. Some of the government laboratories in Karnataka are using the kit, where swab samples of vulnerable persons from clusters and those of international passengers are being tested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-labs-try-to-procure-rt-pcr-kits-which-can-spot-omicron-variant/articleshow/88098460.cms||Sunitha Rao R

But the court rejected his plea on Thursday.In February, the court had awarded simple imprisonment of six years each to Gangadhar Ramappa Kolkar in the two cases. Chikkodi police in Belagavi district had registered a case against Kolkar and other suspects on August 7, 2018. The second was registered by Madanayakanahalli police on the outskirts of Bengaluru on November 6, 2018, based on information provided by National Investigation Agency. Later, NIA took up both the cases, investigated them and filed the chargesheets. The court held Kolkar guilty of the offence in the Chikkodi case and awarded six years jail on February 3 this year. He was awarded a similar sentence in the Madanayakanahalli case on February 20.“He (Kolkar) failed to bring the same (first sentence) to the notice of this court, while the second sentence was awarded. This court having already passed an order of sentence long ago, it is not permissible to pass such an order,” Dr Kasanappa Naik, judge of NIA special court observed. In both the cases, the suspects smuggled fake currency into India through the Bangladesh border and later circulated the notes in Karnataka with the help of local syndicates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/court-rejects-convicts-request-to-run-two-sentences-concurrently/articleshow/88098463.cms||---

Later in the afternoon, Bhosale and the left-handed Bavisetti, seeded No.1 in the doubles, beat Vaidehi Chaudhari and Mihika Yadav 6-0, 6-3 to clinch the title.The singles final will pit the 27-year-old Bavisetti against the fourth-seeded Pranjala Yadlapalli, who saved a matchpoint and escaped to a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory over Hyderabadi qualifier Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipaty. Bhamidipaty, soon-to-be 20, armed with a big serve and forehand, swept to a 3-0 lead in the opening set before Yadlapalli, 22, working her way back from an injury-enforced break, settled into the contest. By then Bhamidipaty’s stellar powerplay had helped her wrap up the opening set.Yadlapalli, the senior pro in the contest, checked the pace of play, varying the length of her shots to level set scores. Both players came on court with their shoulders taped and took medical time-outs in the semifinal clash. When Yadlapalli, riding on momentum, broke in the opening game of the deciding set, it looked like she was on course for the final, but the talented Bhamidipaty was not done. She won the next four games to take a 4-1 lead.The fourth seed once again mixed up her play and Bhamidipaty, who came through the qualifying draw here, was unable to handle the highballs from her opponent, going over the lines time and again as Yadlapalli levelled at 4-4. Bhamidipaty then did well to pull off a tough hold, coming back from 15-40 to take a 5-4 lead. In the tenth game, she even had a match point on her opponent’s serve which Yadlapalli saved with a daring dropshot. There was no coming back from there as Yadlapalli showed greater mental and physical reserves to move into the final. Results (Indians unless mentioned): Singles (semifinals): Sowjanya Bavisetti bt Rutuja Bhosale 4-6, 6-4, 6-2; Pranjala Yadlapalli bt Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipaty 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: When students wept for teacher who took a transfer||BENGALURU: Emotions ran high at government higher primary school in Lakkuru of Nelamangala taluk in Bengaluru Rural on Friday as teary-eyed kids pleaded with their teacher, who took a transfer to another institution, to stay back. The teacher, though overwhelmed, expressed helplessness as he had to live close to his aged parents. With a heavy heart, the children bid adieu to their beloved tutor Gangamallaiah C. He had applied for transfer to a school near his native village and his request was approved. Gangamallaiah had been working at the Lakkuru school, which has a strength of 124, since 2014 and taught Kannada and social science to students of classes 1-8. School headmaster Venkatesh N said: “Gangamallaiah used to take care of his students at an individual level. He used to come to school on his two-wheeler and pick up kids on the way if they were unable to reach the institution for some reason.” He added: “If he was on leave, he used to tell me to pick up the students from Madenahalli near Dobbaspete and would call to remind me so that they don’t miss classes.” The children too were attached to him. Venkatesh said: “Without telling the students, we (staff members) gave Gangamallaiah a farewell last Wednesday. After the students learnt he was transferred to another school, they requested me to call him and tell him to meet them on Friday.” When Gangamallaiah came visiting, the kids cried and requested him not to leave them. Class 7 student Harshitha N told STOI: “If we didn’t come to school, he would call our parents to know the reason. We liked his teaching and moral stories.” Class 8 student Sumayya chipped in: “He never allowed our parents to scold or beat us. In fact, he would even guide them if they had any problem.” The students said they’ll miss Gangamallaiah as he took care of them even more than their parents. Gangamallaiah said: “After witnessing the love and affection of my students, I’m happy that I became a teacher. Due to poverty, some brilliant kids used to work with their parents to support them financially. I used to go to their houses and convince such parents to send their children to school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/when-students-wept-for-teacher-who-took-a-transfer/articleshow/88098466.cms||---

The government is hoping to have at least 50,000 acres ready before the GIM. KIADB officials apprised industries minister Murugesh Nirani about land availability. The minister instructed officials to complete the survey of identified land and start acquisition at the earliest.Creating a land bank is Nirani’s initiative who feels having land ready for allotment would impress investors and speed up their decisions. Nirani said losing the Tata Nano car manufacturing unit to Gujarat in 2010 due to non-availability of land with the government was the reason for him to push for a land bank.Land brandingTo help investors visualise the locality of the land, Nirani suggested that officials brand the land with nearby popular cities instead of villages. For example, land in Ramanagara district’s Harohalli industrial estate should be identified as located in Bengaluru North.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/50k-acre-land-bank-to-be-created-ahead-of-gim-2022/articleshow/88098467.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka MLC polls: 'Candidates paying Rs 25k- Rs 1L for each vote'||BENGALURU: The upcoming MLC elections for 25 seats seem to be emerging as the costliest one the state has ever witnessed, with candidates going the extra mile to woo voters. According to gram panchayat members, who are voters in these polls in different districts, candidates are spending around Rs 25,000 to Rs 60,000 per vote. In one constituency in North Karnataka, where there are two strong contenders, there are reports that the rate for a single vote has touched Rs 1 lakh. Since the number of electorates is also small as it comprises only members of rural and urban local bodies, the candidates do not mind spending such huge amounts. The number of voters in each constituency is in the range of 4,000 to 9,000. This apart, they also organise sumptuous late-night parties and offer freebies to voters. “The trend of offering cash in MLC polls started from the past two elections and the price is seeing a quantum jump from one election to another. Last time, the price of one vote was in the range of Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000. It has gone up three-fold now,” said a Congress functionary from Belagavi district. According to sources, candidates strike a deal with voters by making them swear on their family members or the local deities they believe in before giving the money. Many politicians believe the preferential voting system in these elections is the reason for this trend. “Every candidate wants to get as many first-preference votes as possible so that he/she stands a better chance to win. This competition has resulted in jacking up prices,” said a senior BJP functionary, adding that this happens not in all constituencies. The growing price for votes has forced parties to field candidates who are resourceful. “If you go by the selection of candidates by all parties, the majority are moneybags who don’t mind splurging money,” said another Congress functionary. Majority of candidates in these elections have declared their assets worth more than Rs 30 crore, with the Congress candidate from Bengaluru Urban leading in the group with Rs 1,753 crore assets. The fact that there is no expenditure limit for candidates unlike in the assembly and Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission is also not keeping a watch on such practices. This has given political parties a free run.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-candidates-paying-rs-25000-rs-1-lakh-for-each-vote-allege-gram-panchayat-members/articleshow/88098468.cms||Anil Gejji
---||Bengaluru||Christians targeted in states with anti-conversion laws: Bengaluru archbishop||BENGALURU: Attacks on Christians have increased in states that passed anti-conversion laws, archbishop of Bengaluru Rev Peter Machado said on Saturday. “The first anti-conversion law was passed in Odisha in 1967. Attacks on Christians began in the 70s, culminating in the Kandhamal violence in 2008. The law gave a justification for attacks on Christians. After Odisha, the anti-conversion law was passed in six other states. Not much resistance was put up against such an undemocratic law,” said Machado, who is also president of All-Karnataka United Christian Forum for Human Rights. On Saturday, members of the Christian community staged a protest against the proposed Karnataka anti-conversion bill at St Francis Xavier Cathedral grounds, east Bengaluru. “The state government says the draft of the bill will be ready on December 5 and tabled during the legislature session starting December 13. So where is the time and space for a public discussion? In crucial matters in a democracy, no bill should be tabled without proper public discourse,” Machado said. “The issue of forced conversion is highly exaggerated. Many of our BJP leaders have studied in Christian schools and they have also chosen Christian hospitals for medical treatment. None of them was forcefully converted,” he said. “BJP MLA from Hosadurga Goolihatti Shekhar claimed 15,000 to 20,000 people, including his own mother, were converted to Christianity in his constituency. The Hosadurga taluk administration conducted an inquiry into the allegations and found there were no such attempts, and those who converted did so out of their own willingness and conviction,” the archbishop said. “If there was rampant conversion, as claimed by the MLA and others, the Christian population should have seen an increase. According to the census, the all-India percentage of Christians in 2001 was 2.34%; in 2011, it shrunk to 2.3%. It was no different in Karnataka, which recorded a Christian population of 1.91% in 2001 and 1.87% in 2011,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/christians-targeted-in-states-with-anti-conversion-laws-bengaluru-archbishop/articleshow/88098469.cms||---

I am ready to work 24 hours to achieve this goal,’’ he said at Karnataka — Infinite Opportunities, an interactive session with corporate leaders. He said many may raise eyebrows about his dream, but he has his math right. “One per cent growth in agriculture translates into four per cent growth in the manufacturing sector and 10 per cent in services. So, by achieving good growth in agriculture, we can meet our goal,” he explained. He said ensuring jobs is an immediate task and his government is coming up with a new policy that will encourage companies create more jobs. “Every year, we produce more than 1 lakh engineers but 65,000 of them are not getting jobs. This is where we all should chip in,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-will-have-1-5-trillion-economy-claims-bommai/articleshow/88098470.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||In 4 months, 290 acres of govt land recovered in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: After five years of inaction against the land mafia, the Bengaluru Urban district administration swung into proactive mode in recovering encroached government land. In about four months, 290 acres have been reclaimed by clearing encroachments at 204 places. Of the 290 acres recovered from July 31 to November 27 this year, 237 are in lake/tank beds. The lake encroachments were cleared at 155 places, with Anekal taluk reporting the highest recovery. North, south, east and Yelahanka are the other taluks where recovery of government land is under way. “Honakalasapura, Rachamanahalli, Giddanahalli and Chokkasandra lakes were among the 59 that were cleared of encroachments in Anekal recently,” said J Manjunath, Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner, adding: “We are conducting these drives every Saturday at lakes, stormwater drains, barren land and grazing land.” However, the administration is not fixing any value for the encroachments on lake beds it has cleared. “Lakes are invaluable assets and we don’t put a price tag on it,”he said. The value of the 53 acres of recovered land, which excludes the reclaimed lake beds and includes gomala (grazing land), gundu thopu and government kharab land, is Rs 96.3 crore, documents accessed by TOI revealed. Manjunath confirmed that no recovery of encroached government land had happened in the five years prior to July 2021. Asked about the AT Ramaswamy legislature committee report’s finding that nearly 25,000 acres of government land has been encroached upon in Bengaluru Urban, officials asserted that their drive to reclaim grbbed land is only intensifying. Forty-three acres of non-lake land was recovered till November 20. The drive was strengthened and 10 acres were recovered in the week that followed. The administration is creating bio-fencing in reclaimed lake areas. It includes planting lines of trees or shrubs on the boundaries to prevent the land from getting grabbed again and creating a barrier during flooding. Officials said if there are buildings on the land, they will be kept for use in future for public purposes. Manjunath has asked his officials to convert a Kalyana Mantapa into a Nada Kacheri. “We are not demolishing all the buildings. If they can be reused for other purposes which will benefit the government, it will done,” Manjunath said. With 94.3 acres, Anekal taluk has the highest number of encroachments excluding lake beds amounting to Rs 34.2 crore, followed by Yelahanka (Rs 29.4 crore). The reclaimed land will be used for setting up public schools, anganwadis, PHCs/sub-centres, social welfare department hostels and used as playgrounds. “We will also ensure that there will be one burial ground for each village with a population over 800 persons. The land will be utilised to set up a solid waste management processing plant spread over 1-5 acres in every GP,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/in-4-months-290-acres-of-govt-land-recovered-in-bluru/articleshow/88098471.cms||Nithya Mandyam

Karnataka has the distinction of being one of the states with extensive forest cover. “Our government has taken extreme care to protect the biodiversity of Western Ghats. People of the region have adopted agriculture and horticultural activities in an eco-friendly manner.

But Whitefield resident Anjali S found out the benefits of retaining the ticket after she left a box of plants in the bus. “I recently travelled by a Vayu Vajra bus from the airport. But I left the box of plants in the bus and realised only after I got down at Marathahalli. But I had the ticket with me which had the bus and depot numbers,” she said. “I connected with depot manager Wilson and sent him my ticket on WhatsApp. I got my box back the next morning.” A senior BMTC official said if any passenger leaves anything in a bus and has the ticket, it will be easier for the authorities to track the vehicle and find the lost item. This is not the first instance of BMTC passengers getting back items left behind. M Madhusudhan, a resident of Vidyaranyapura, said on November 22, his wife left her bag at the Esteem Mall bus stop. “BMTC recovered and returned jewellery and cash worth Rs 6.3 lakh. We were grateful to BMTC traffic controllers Prakash and Shamisab for this,” he said. Woman thanks BMTC crew for safe ride at night BMTC staff have been drawing praise from some passengers. Yogada Joshi, who travelled in a Vayu Vajra bus at night last month, recently took to LinkedIn to thank the bus crew for the safe journey. “I was the only woman in the bus which had five other male passengers, the driver and conductor. Women usually feel unsafe in public transport but I took the bus because I thought it was much safer for odd-hour travel, thanks to rogue cabbie incidents reported every now and then along the KIA-city route… Throughout the journey, I sat happily. Finally, the bus arrived at my destination and here comes an experience showing care and concern: The conductor and driver peeped outside and saw that nobody was there yet to pick me up at midnight. They insisted upon waiting till my father came. I was touched. Appa arrived shortly and the bus left. I want to thank BMTC and Bengaluru city for making me feel happy and safe,” Yogada wrote. Following this, BMTC honoured Parth Shetty, the bus conductor, and Ramachandra, the driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/save-your-bus-ticket-next-time-you-may-get-back-lost-items/articleshow/88098514.cms||---

Brijesh said he had received a letter from the registrar general and census commissioner on September 5 regarding the matter. Some individuals had created documents relating to three women staffers of Bengaluru census office and alleged that top officials were sexually harassing them. An internal inquiry, however, revealed the documents were forged, impersonating the women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/census-chief-seeks-probe-into-false-harassment-claim/articleshow/88098516.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Namma Metro needs 12 lakh daily ridership to break even||BENGALURU: Namma Metro met just 27% of its ridership target in 2019-20. While its daily projection was 15 lakh, average ridership was about 4 lakh when the train network was 42km. Namma Metro needs a daily ridership of 12 lakh — a 208% increase — to break even. This was revealed in a report, ‘Performance of Indian Metro systems: lessons for upcoming urban rail projects’, prepared by the International Association of Public Transport, an NGO. It studied four Metro systems in the country: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai. Today, the 56km Namma Metro’s daily ridership has fallen to 3 lakh because of the pandemic and work-from-home arrangement. The daily ridership in 2019-20 was 9,456 per km, as opposed to 40,650 in Mumbai and 14,653 in Delhi. Chennai had the lowest with 2,553. “A key reason for lower Metro network development in India is high capital costs. Costs are dependent on land acquisition, share of underground network and other aspects,” the report said. Namma Metro’s cost per km is Rs 327 crore, compared to Mumbai Metro’s Rs 390 crore, Chennai’s Rs 259 crore, and Delhi’s Rs 181 crore. About 79% of Bengaluru Metro’s operational revenue is from passenger fare. Its non-farebox revenue like rent and advertisement constitutes 9% — the lowest among the four cities. According to the report, cities such as London, Hong Kong and Singapore have an integrated authority cross-subsidising public transport through revenue from congestion and parking charges, property development and other non-transport operations. Bengaluru’s plan to have a unified metropolitan transport authority has remained on paper. “Indian metro systems are heavily reliant on operational revenue and within that on farebox revenue. Delhi Metro provides the best-case example of increasing non-farebox revenue through land value capture. Other systems need to build on this example for long-term financial sustainability,” the report said. It suggested improving farebox revenue through dynamic pricing with targeted discounts based on time of day and travel distance. Non-farebox revenue could be improved through land value capture, advertising, co-branding of stations, smart cards and providing consulting services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/metro-needs-12-lakh-daily-ridership-to-break-even/articleshow/88098517.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Police told to probe woman’s death again, submit report in three months||Bengaluru: Pointing out several glaring defects in investigation and improper appreciation of the autopsy report, the high court directed Bengaluru police to conduct further probe into the death of one Khushboo Nimbalkar. Khushboo died at her house in Hebbal police limits in August 2016, within 18 months of her marriage. Her father Bhaskar Rao Nimbalkar, a resident of Chhattisgarh, later approached the high court seeking a CBI probe into the matter. Partly allowing the petition, justice M Nagaprasanna rejected the plea for a CBI probe and directed city police to conclude their investigation within three months and submit a supplementary chargesheet in a month. Justice Nagaprasanna noted that cops visited the house two days after the woman’s death, despite being aware of the incident since the complaint had been lodged the same day. The judge was surprised that statements of doctors at V Care Hospital or Jain Hospital were not recorded, and nor was the dying declaration of the deceased. The judge said two witnesses had deposed that the deceased was lying on the floor with a sari tied to the fan and police, without conclusive investigation, went by the forensic lab’s final opinion that death was due to asphyxia as a result of hanging. “The autopsy report’s observations became the bedrock for consideration of the case. The projection is that the deceased died by hanging herself. The final opinion given by the department of forensic medicine in the postmortem report is that ‘death was due to asphyxia’ as a result of hanging. The forensic report was submitted on February 11, 2017. The postmortem report states thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone were intact and neck tissues underlying the ligature mark were dry, white and glistening. If death occurred due to hanging, thyroid cartilage would have been the first to break. That being intact, it would prima facie indicate death was not due to hanging,” the judge observed. According to the petitioner, police conducted a shoddy probe and filed a chargesheet dropping offence under section 302 (murder). The accused are Khushboo’s husband, sister-in-law, mother-in-law and father-in-law. The prosecution contended that on August 21, 2016, at 2.30pm, Khushboo locked herself inside a room and hanged herself. Her husband broke open the door and took her to V Care Hospital. Doctors there advised him to take her to Jain Hospital. But Khushboo died at 4.40pm in Jain Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/police-told-to-probe-womans-death-again-submit-report-in-three-months/articleshow/88098518.cms||---

We would direct BDA to remove illegal constructions reserved for civic amenities and thereafter secure transfer of those areas under registered documents free of cost in terms of the above-mentioned regulation of Revised Master Plan, 2015,” the bench said.The bench also reminded BDA that regulations 6.1(c) and 6.1(d) of the Revised Master Plan, 2015 empower and authorise the authority to secure a relinquishment deed either from the developer or owner free of cost, and the said regulation was brought into force to discourage builders and owners from meddling with civic amenity sites and park area.While regulation 6.1(c) says parks/open spaces and playgrounds should not be less than 15% of the total land area, regulation 6.1(d) states that after making provision for parks and roads in the layout, the balance portion of land should be earmarked for a civic amenity site only.The petitioner had complained that in the 20-acre private layout formed by the society at Marenahalli village, Kempapura Agrahara, Bengaluru north taluk, as against 50% ceiling, the society had formed sites to the extent of 62% of the area. And since the park and civic amenity sites had been sold, residents of the layout had no open lung space.On July 22, 2021, the court ordered for a joint survey by BDA and BBMP. The survey report was submitted to the court on August 13, 2021, indicating violations of the sanctioned layout plan.The court then directed the BDA commissioner to indicate the timeline within which appropriate action could be initiated against the encroachers. In response, the BDA chief filed an affidavit on September 6, 2021 informing the court that within six months the authority will take appropriate action for removal of unauthorised encroachments made in the park area and CA site by invoking section 33 of BDA Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-raps-bda-for-not-taking-over-park-ca-site-in-layout/articleshow/88098519.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Taking KSTDC cab from KIA? Don’t pay ‘additional charges’||BENGALURU: The next time you take a Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) cab from the airport to any part of the city, make sure you don’t pay more than the bill amount. With a shortage of app-based cabs such as Ola and Uber at Kempegowda International Airport, many people are relying on KSTDC cabs now. However, several passengers complained some KSTDC drivers have been charging extra. “I recently travelled from the airport to Manyata Tech Park in Nagawara. The driver told me he could not give a bill as the meter was not working. He collected Rs 320 extra as ‘introduction charges’ in addition to the Rs 900 fare. In app-based cabs, the bill for the same distance will be Rs 650-700. This is fleecing innocent customers. I’ve decided not to take KSTDC cabs anymore,” said Aravind Gowda, a regular passenger. Airport Taxi Owners’ Association president Hamid Akbar Ali said the government issued an order on July 23 to collect Rs 118 per trip from passengers to pay Bangalore International Airport Ltd (BIAL). “The demand for cabs reduced after Covid and such charges will force passengers to shift to Ola and Uber. But this charge is included in the bill, so we aren’t collecting extra.” However, Vijay Sharma, managing director of KSTDC, said, “Drivers need to pay Rs 118 per trip to BIAL as airport charges. But it is included in the bill and customers should not pay anything extra. Customers can raise complaints with KSTDC if any driver demands more. We’ll take stringent action.” He said permission has been given to operate around 900 cabs, but only 600 or so are on the road now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/taking-kstdc-cab-from-kia-dont-pay-additional-charges/articleshow/88098520.cms||---

The last location of the mobile of accused doctor Sushil Kumar was found on the banks of Atal Ghat, Ganga river, police said on Saturday. “Keeping in view the possibility of his jumping into the Ganga, searches are being conducted with the help of Jal Police,” said DCP West BBGTS Murti on Saturday, adding, “A case of murder has been registered on the complaint of the doctor’s brother.” Allegedly depressed over the spread of Omicron and Covid-19, 61-year-old Sushil Kumar, a forensic science professor working at a Kanpur medical college, allegedly killed his wife and children to “liberate them and remove all their troubles in a moment”. Sushil had told his brother Dr Sunil Kumar a few days ago that he was suffering from depression and wanted to kill his wife. In the investigation, one reason for the murders is also believed to be his suspicion about his wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ganga-searches-for-kanpur-prof-who-killed-kin-on-mutant-fears/articleshow/88098521.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||World||Pentagon chief says China ops near Taiwan resemble 'rehearsals'||WASHINGTON: US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that recent extensive Chinese military operations near Taiwan resembled "rehearsals" and he reaffirmed Washington's strong support for Taipei. President Joe Biden's Pentagon chief said the United States remained committed to supporting "Taiwan's ability to defend itself." In a speech devoted largely to an array of challenges posed by an increasingly confident China, he underlined Washington's "real differences" with Beijing. Austin was speaking at a national defense forum at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. In recent months, the Chinese military has mounted an increasingly aggressive series of sea and air military operations near Taiwan, which it claims as its own. "It looks a lot like them exploring their true capabilities," Austin said. "It looks a lot like rehearsals." Some analysts have suggested Beijing may be testing Biden during his first year in office. China was the only power now capable of using its "economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system," Austin said. The world's two largest economic powers, he went on, have "real differences both over interests and values. But the way that you manage them counts." He said Chinese leaders had been increasingly vocal about their "dissatisfaction with the prevailing order -- and about their aim of displacing America from its global leadership role." But, Austin said: "We seek neither confrontation nor conflict.... We're not seeking a new Cold War or a world divided into rigid blocs." In the face of the Chinese challenge, the retired four-star army general said, the US would be deepening its ties to friendly countries in the region, including through joint exercises. "We remain steadfast to our One-China policy," Austin said, but also to "our commitments of the Taiwan Relations Act to support Taiwan's ability to defend itself while also maintaining our capacity to resist any resort to force that would jeopardize the security of the people of Taiwan."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/pentagon-chief-says-china-ops-near-taiwan-resemble-rehearsals/articleshow/88098541.cms||---

This marked the variant’s ominous entry into the state sending the medical and health administration in a tizzy. The elderly man of Gujarati origin is currently stable and under observation, said state health department officials. In addition to the septuagenarian, three persons – a 44-year-old UK women resident of Gujarati origin and a 69-year-old man from Vadodara who landed at Ahmedabad airport and a 53-year-old doctor from Navsari who landed at Mumbai airport – have tested positive upon return from the UK. All three have been isolated at various hospitals and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing to ascertain whether they are carrying the Omicron variant. Gujarat’s Omicron confirmation came on the heels of India reporting its first two cases of the variant in Karnataka. State administration huddled in top level meetings to discuss strategy to keep a hawk’s vigil on the spread and symptoms of Omicron which has triggered resurgence of Covid cases in several parts of the world, including South African nations. Newly-appointed CM Bhupendra Patel chaired an emergency meeting convened with senior home and health department officials. Patel said that Gujarat would follow 3T - testing, tracing and treatment - to counter Omicron cases. Manoj Aggarwal, ACS (health), said in the meeting that beginning December 1, over 4,500 persons arriving from ‘at risk’ countries have been screened. “The 72-year-old elderly had arrived in Jamnagar on November 28 from Zimbabwe and tested Covid-positive on November 30. He has been kept in an isolation ward at GG Hospital,” said Aggarwal. Jamnagar municipal commissioner Vijay Kharadi said the isolation ward where the elderly is admitted is declared a micro-containment zone. The man, living for decades in Zimbabwe, had landed at Ahmedabad international airport and had travelled to Jamnagar by road with two other persons. Both have tested negative, but are kept under isolation and observation, said Jamnagar district officials. All high-risk contacts of the man have tested negative, they added. Meanwhile, a 44-year-old woman, a UK citizen with Gujarati roots, tested positive on Friday night through the RT-PCR test. The woman was sent to a private hospital in Karamsad, said medical officers at the airport. “She had come to visit her maternal grandparents at Mahapura village near Vadodara. A few days ago, they fell sick due to age-related complications. As they have been admitted in the hospital at Karamsad, she preferred to get admitted at the same hospital. Her condition is stable,” said officials. An elderly man from Karelibaug area of Vadodara and a doctor from Valsad are other two patients who tested positive upon return to India. Their samples are sent for sequencing, said state health department officials. The Vadodara man and his wife are quarantined at a hospital. The doctor from Navsari had returned from the UK on November 24. At the end of his seven-day quarantine period, he had tested positive, said Navsari authorities. The experts raised the question about the efficacy of the testing at the airport and also recommended more stringent checks. “The negative RT-PCR is required for air travel. It means that all must have had the report. Then how come they tested positive upon arrival? We need to be on guard with all Covid protocols to ensure that the cases don’t multiply,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/omicrons-ominous-guj-entry-as-jamnagar-nrg-tests-ve/articleshow/88098918.cms||---

Your favourite watering holes in the state have made themselves out of bounds for New Year revellers this season. The Union territory of Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (DDDNH) has imposed a night curfew from 11pm to 6am till December-end keeping the Omicron variant scare in mind and also to prevent the risk of Covid spread. There will be no major events organized on December 31, thanks to the fresh restricting orders. After a low-key 2020, a few leading hotels and resorts were planning to hold star-studded parties, but the curfew has dampened all plans in the UT. A large number of tourists and party-goers from Gujarat as well as neighbouring Maharashtra prefer to visit Daman, Diu and Silvassa for year-end celebrations due to the availability of liquor, well-equipped hotels, resorts and other attractions. Vice-president of Daman Hoteliers’ Association Haresh Tangal told TOI, “Due to reimposition of curfew from 11pm, no major party can be planned now. People will have to reach their hotel or leave Daman before the curfew hour. We will approach the administration of Daman to request for relaxation in the timings. If we get permission till 1am at least people will be able to celebrate.” In Daman and Silvassa, such year-end parties start from December 24 onwards and the New Year festivities continue for a week more. While it is good for the revellers, it generates good business for the tourist destination as it pulls in huge crowds. “I always ushered in the New Year in Daman, but will drop my plans this year owing to the curfew. People also need to follow Covid-19 guidelines to fight the pandemic,” said Vidit Desai, a finance consultant from Valsad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/curfew-takes-zing-out-of-new-year-party-plans-in-ut/articleshow/88096970.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Patna||Centre approves bridge parallel to JP Setu||PATNA: The Union minister of road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, on Saturday announced the Centre’s approval to a bridge parallel to JP Setu over river Ganga at Patna. The 5-km-long bridge will have four lanes. “The ministry has given its in-principle approval to a four lane bridge between Digha and Sitalpur, which is a part of Patna- Sahebganj stretch (sic),” Gadkari tweeted. In another tweet, Gadkari said a highway from AIIMS-Patna to Bettiah via Bakarpur, Manikpur, Sahebganj and Areraj has been included in the Bharatmala project and declared as new NH-139W. State road construction minister Nitin Nabin told TOI that the bridge will be a part of NH-139W, which has been formally announced by the Union transport minister on Saturday. Nabin said the bridge parallel to JP Setu will ease the traffic movement in and around Patna, especially the western parts of the city. “The bridge will be constructed by the Centre, while the state government is committed to providing the approach road for it, which is already available for the JP Setu,” he said. Nabin said the road connectivity between south and north Bihar is being smoothened with bridges getting constructed over the Ganga after every 25km. “Construction of a four-lane bridge parallel to Mahatma Gandhi Setu is in progress and it will be ready by 2024. The bridge, being constructed by the ministry of road transport and highways, is 5.634-km-long while the total length of the project (including approach road) is 14.5km,” he said. “Similarly, work on the six-lane Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge is in the advance stages. It is being constructed by the state government and is likely to be ready by 2023. A six-lane road is also proposed between Sherpur and Dighwara, which will be a part of the Patna ring road,” Nabin added. New bridges apart, the 39-year-old Mahatma Gandhi Setu is also being rehabilitated by using fabricated steel structures. In fact, the rehabilitation work on the western flank of the Setu has already been completed and work is underway on its eastern flank, which is slated to be completed by March, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-approves-bridge-parallel-to-jp-setu/articleshow/88095835.cms||Piyush Tripathi

While some of them have cancelled their trips, others have put their travel plans on hold. Himanshi Sharma, a resident of Ashiana Nagar, has planned to visit Maldives with her husband in January next year. She told this reporter on Saturday, “Travelling at a time when the new Covid variant is spreading its tentacles across the world can be unsafe. We have, therefore, decided to analyse the situation and decide whether we will go to Maldives or not.” Coomar Arunodaya, who had planned to visit his son in the United Kingdom (UK) on Christmas, has put his plan on hold. He said, “I am in a wait-and-see situation. I do not know if I will be able to visit the UK.” Amid cancellation of trips, tour agencies in Patna have once again received a jolt. Their employees claim that the business has been hit as the customers are asking for refunds now. Praveen Kumar Gupta, the employee of a travel agency on Boring Road, rued, “Although domestic travel plans have not been affected much, a lot of customers are cancelling their international trips. Covid has cast a shadow over our business once again.” Anup Sinha, the manager of another travel agency on S P Verma Road, said, “We had thought the Covid situation would improve after the first and second waves, but the new variant has made matters worse. People are cancelling their trips and no new bookings are being made.” Ashutosh Singh, a travel agent, claimed that his clients had started cancelling pre-booked trips to Maldives, Dubai, Bali, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Goa, Kerala, Darjeeling and Himachal Pradesh. “However, some customers have postponed their trips because the hotels I had booked for them are not ready to give refunds,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/omicron-scare-vacationers-in-wait-and-see-situation/articleshow/88095882.cms||Faryal Rumi

All the villages with more than 5,000 population will get three-phase power supply lines in the first phase. Industrial units under food processing sector would be given top priority as they are going to offer decent remunerative prices to the farmers. In line with chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s thrust on MSME sector, the power utilities have decided to lay the new lines to grant new connections to the industrial units particularly in rural areas. The MSME sector is considered to be biggest employment generator after the agriculture sector and hence the government is pinning high hopes on the sector for better economic growth. The state government has also decided to encourage the food processing units in order to provide better prices to the agriculture produce. Chief minister directed the officials to set their focus on encouraging entrepreneurs in food processing sector by providing them additional incentives. The food processing units are expected to be game-changers in providing remunerative prices to the farmers and also create additional employment in rural areas. “Food processing sector is going to transform the rural economy in many ways. They are going to arrest the frequent fluctuations in the procurement prices of agriculture produces by offering decent returns to the farmers,” said agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu. He said the government has readied a blueprint to set up MSME parks in all the districts particularly in the upland areas where the land is readily available. After noticing that the existing single-phase power supply lines have become a big hurdle in allowing the new industrial units in the rural areas, the government directed the distribution companies to go for new lines with three-phase power supply. The Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited (EPDCL) identified about 123 villages to erect the new supply lines on pilot basis. “We are laying new lines to give connections to the industrial units particularly food processing units at a cost of Rs 44 crore,” said a senior official of energy department. He said 11kv sub-stations would be set up to supply power through three-phase mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/3-phase-power-to-boost-food-processing-sector/articleshow/88096913.cms||Samdani MN

Lalu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP know the consequences of caste census and that’s why not allowing it. He said the population of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has increased and they should be given reservation accordingly. He stressed on the need of caste census in order to implement the schemes for the suppressed sections of society in a better way. When asked whether he will meet chief minister Nitish Kumar on this issue, Lalu replied, “Why and for what? Everyone has decided for it. We have been demanding this since the UPA time when Pranab Mukherjee was there.” The RJD chief also hit out at the state government on various issues, including discovery of empty liquor bottles from Vidhan Sabha premises. “Bottles (liquor bottles) are found everywhere. All his (Nitish Kumar) projects and schemes have failed,” he said. Talking about the stopping of labour resource minister Jibesh Kumar’s car on the assembly premises during the winter session, Lalu said, “He was badly treated. He shouted about this incident in the Vidhan Sabha, but was not heard.” Even leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on Saturday said without caste census, one cannot work for the development of the suppressed sections of society. Contering the RJD claims, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said CM Nitish has always pushed for caste census. “He raised his voice even during the VP Singh government when he was a minister. While Nitish is genuinely pushing for it, RJD is doing politics over the caste census issue,” he said and added, “It is Nitish who had worked for the suppressed section of society. Be it women, EBCs, SCs or STs, various schemes have been implemented for their upliftment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-parties-opposed-to-caste-census-wont-exist/articleshow/88096472.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Tibetan Refugee Association’s Chime Tsering said the market, run by Tibetan refugees, is registered under ‘Intellectual Property Law’. “Many local businessmen have opened markets in the name of Lhasa. However, only the Lhasa Market run by us in the city since 1974 is the authentical one,” he added. Tsering added instead of Budh Marg, the market has been put up in the compound of high court mazar this time. “Though the market has started one month behind schedule due to various reasons this time, contemporary and stylish woollen products are being offered.” The market’s co-organiser, Ngawang Tharchin, said 109 stalls have been put up by 60 members. “The stalls have been distributed to the members through lottery.

The then Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah of the Patna high court had ordered ADGP Vinay Kumar to inquire into all the acts of omission and commission of the BNMU with help of a team of four police officers to be selected by him and submit a report in sealed cover. The matter was last heard on September 15. The ADGP had sought six weeks’ time and the matter was listed for October 27. But Justice Amanullah was transferred to the Andhra Pradesh high court in October itself and the matter has not been listed for further hearing since then. The report is expected to be submitted before the high court when the matter is listed for hearing again. The bench had also observed that the ADGP and his probe team shall have a free hand in the matter and shall not be answerable to any executive authority as they have been directly nominated by the court. The university violated the high court order on December 23 last year allowing the PSU to work for the BNMU. The court had restrained the BNMU from making fresh arrangements and permitted it to make required payments to the PSU. The university accepted its mistake on affidavits that some orders passed by the high court were violated but contended that it was neither intentional nor deliberate. “The court would pause here to indicate that the violations having been admitted, it is for the court alone to form a view as to whether the same was intentional or deliberate, which exercise the court is deferring, for now, awaiting the report,” the high court had observed. The M/s ITI Limited had challenged the university order of August 14, 2020 to scrap its five-year work tender to manage the University Management Information System (UMIS) and pleaded that it was unlawful and done without serving any show-cause notice. UMIS includes managing online students’ admission, salary and other varsity works. The work order was scrapped on the grounds of non-satisfactory work and non-deputation of skilled employees. The action was taken after seeking permission from the chancellor’s office. Interestingly, hardly three months before scrapping the work order, the university in May 2020 had asked the PSU to continue for the next four years after finding its one-year work satisfactory. Since then, two vice-chancellors changed. After scrapping the PSU order, the university had written to the chancellor’s office seeking permission to give work orders for 2020-2021 to one M/s Infolink Consultancy Services Pvt. Ltd. on the grounds that it was already a vendor for Patliputra University. However, permission was not granted and the university was suggested to float a tender.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bnmu-also-faces-probe-for-irregularities/articleshow/88096451.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Iman told reporters later that no one could be forced to sing the song in the assembly or elsewhere. It was seen as a rebuff, with BJP calling it an “anti-national act” and accused the AIMIM members of having a “jihadi” mentality. BJP partner JD(U) tried to play down the controversy. “If somebody does not want to sing the national song, he or she cannot be compelled to do so. I don’t remember the national song and not many people in the villages know it either. Am I an anti-national? Are they who don’t know the song anti-national? It is not a big issue,” JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha said on Saturday. It’s good deeds, not merely singing the national song, that made people patriots, he said. BJP MLA for Bisfi in Madhubani district, Hari Bhushan Thakur Bachol, was among the first to flag the AIMIM members’ refusal as an “anti-national” and warned that his party would stop these legislators from entering the House in the next session. “The speaker should take action,” Thakur said. On Saturday, Union minister Giriraj Singh brought into the picture Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the 1947 Partition and AIMIM national chief Asaduddin Owaisi while talking to reporters in New Delhi. “They (AIMIM MLAs) belong to the party of Owaisi, who raises objections in Lok Sabha. What can you expect from them? We will not allow 1947 (Partition) to happen again. They have the mindset of Jinnah and of the ‘jihadi’. If they eat and sleep here, they will have to sing the national song,” he said. Called an ode to the motherland, the first two verses of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s poem ‘Vande Mataram’ from his book ‘Anandamath’ was adopted in 1950 as the national song.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nobody-can-be-forced-to-sing-vande-mataram-says-jdu/articleshow/88096484.cms||Abhay Singh

The initiative aims at promoting livelihood, conserving water and making people self-reliant. Residents of seven villages, who would otherwise migrate to cities for work, will be reached out for skill development and employability encouragement. The sanctuary is spread over 47.07 sq km. As paer norms, no work can be carried out in the seven villages -- Risal, Dalad, Gonap, Katdhara, Satri, Musiachod and Sunauli. On learning that residents of these villages were not getting any benefits of sanctuary policies, the German organisation stepped in to ensure they get what they are entitled to. To tide over water shortage, residents will be taught how to use water from streams for irrigation purposes. They will learn to make handicrafts using bamboo, ringal and pine. The organisation will then help them sell the products in markets. To tap tourism potential, focus will be on boosting eco-tourism. Apart from this, the organisation is also developing sites for work in Mussoorie and Ramnagar. Welcoming the move, DFO Ramesh Chandra Kandpal said the training has already started in Chandigarh, adding that the step will be a game changer and equip residents with skills, making them job-ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/residents-of-villages-around-binsar-to-be-equipped-with-job-skills/articleshow/88096917.cms||---

SDO Vijayant, who led the operation, said a special team was formed to search all the prisoners in the Aurangabad district jail. “A live cartridge was recovered from the bag of one Jaishankar Singh, a resident of village Aat in Madanpur block. Jaishankar is an undertrial prisoner in an Arms Act case. After the recovery of cartridge, intensive raids were conducted in the jail, but no other objectionable article or arms were found,” he said. :A high-level inquiry is being conducted to find out how the live cartridge reached the jail. An FIR is being lodged in this matter with the Town police station.” Aurangabad district jail is considered to be one of the most sensitive jails of Bihar.

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Parli thermal plant to use ‘green coal’ with crop residue as base material||AURANGABAD: The Maharashtra state power generation company (MahaGenco) has decided to make use of “green-coal” at the Parli thermal power station in Beed district. The state power utility has invited expression of interest from prospective bidders for the supply of “biomass briquettes bio coal” for the boiler of one of the three units of the plant having individual power generation capacity of 250 MW. Mohan Avhad, the Parli thermal power station’s chief engineer, said the plant will be the first MahaGenco facility to use “green coal” on an experimental basis. “The alternative green fuel to be used will have agro residue or crop residue as the base material. We have three units, each of 250 MW capacity. They together require around 11,000-12,000 tonne coal per day if the plant is operating at the designed capacity,” he said. While the coal for the Parli plant is arranged from mines near Hyderabad and the Vidarbha region, the proposed use of green coal is expected to save huge transportation cost besides offering environmental benefits and providing supplementary income to the rural population. Pasha Patel, the former president of Maharashtra state commission for agriculture and prices, who has been advocating the use of “green coal” at thermal plants, said the use of eco-friendly fuel would give boost to bamboo cultivation in the state, especially in the Marathwada region. “Weather-resistant bamboo plants can be the ideal raw material for green coal. Also, the rural population, including farmers, are in possession of large quantities of biomass in the form of agricultural waste. This too can be easily used for producing green coal,” he said. Patel, a former BJP MLC, said a single farmer can cultivate around 50 tonne of bamboo per acre and earn an income in the range of Rs 3,500 to Rs 5,000 per tonne. “The National Capital Power Station at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh has already initiated steps to use the green-coal. Maharashtra should also emulate the revolutionary decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/parli-thermal-plant-to-use-green-coal-with-crop-residue-as-base-material/articleshow/88095752.cms||---

The criminals, who came in a sport utility vehicle (SUV) wearing masks, entered the bank premises on the pretext of opening an account. Soon, they held the branch manager, Mithilesh Kumar Jaiswal, and cashier, Jitendra Kumar, hostage before looting the cash. Jitendra was hit by the armed criminals when he tried to resist, police sources said, adding the bank manager was locked in his chamber. “The criminals were there in the bank branch for nearly 20 minutes before fleeing with the cash. They locked the main door of the bank branch while escaping,” the sources added. A police team led by SHO of Shambhuganj Vishnudev Prasad rushed to the branch soon after getting information. Eyewitnesses said the criminals escaped towards Asarganj locality in Banka in the SUV. Banka SP Arvind Kumar Gupta said a special investigation team had been formed to crack the case. “Forensic science laboratory (FSL) team and dog squad have also been requisitioned for the investigation. Raids are being conducted to arrest the criminals involved in the loot,” the SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/criminals-loot-rs-18-41-lakh-from-bank-in-banka/articleshow/88095728.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Tackle pollution sources in Delhi over the year||NEW DELHI: Every year, confronting the pollution means inconvenience of all sorts — closing down school, stopping construction work, regulating industries, arguing about stubble burning and halting diesel generator use, etc. These are temporary measures. What must Delhi and neighbouring cities do year round to render the air breathable at all times? The answer involves all the 29 sources of pollution, but at present, the pollution alleviation narrative is centred on just a few of them. Experts point out the loopholes in this approach, mainly related to inadequate public transport and end-mile connectivity, management of dust, construction and waste, outdated vehicular pollution monitoring system and the absence of a joint action plan. Calling out the ‘very poor monitoring and enforcement mechanism’, Karthik Ganesan of Council on Energy, Environment and Water said, “Had there been a central monitoring and implementation system on pollution, then someone would have looked at IIT data to realise that emissions from Jhajjar in Haryana are abnormally high and sent a ground team to fix it. But there is no central approach.” Track the pollution level in your cityGanesan added that central agencies like CAQM had to build capacity and do more groundwork. He also argued against construction activity in the winter. “Just as mining work halts in the monsoon, why can’t construction be regulated in the winter months?” Ganesan asked. According to Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, it was crucial to fix the city’s public transport system. She recommended an integrated transport system where buses and Delhi Metro shared a single payment mechanism. Pointing out that transport contributed at least 30% to the local emissions, she said, “Around 16% of Delhiites travel in personal cars and two-wheelers but occupy a major portion of the roads. The city needs 11,000 buses, but has only 6,000. The end-mile connectivity is also poor and cannot be relied upon.” Chowdhury added, “There is also a need to update the pollution under control certification system because there are vehicles plying under different emission norms. PUC monitoring could be made remote sensed as in Kolkata.” Experts said that a better system than water sprinkling in a water stressed city was needed to manage road dust. They suggested vegetation along the roads and large green covers like Aravalis and Ridge areas to act as natural barriers against dust. They also urged policies to decongest many city areas. “We need policies to manage the pollution load of many areas by giving them time to breathe before they become polluted again,” said Professor Sewa Ram, School of Planning and Architecture. “Banning traffic from some areas on certain days, creating bypasses and imposing congestion cess like in London and New York are some ways to do this. But these presuppose a robust public transport system.” To these, Dr S Velmurgan, chief scientist, CRRI, added, “The city needs better landscaping and dust-control mechanisms, especially use of dust covers at construction sites. There are no rules on how such covers should be installed and at what height.” He also pointed out that Delhi had 33,000km of road, of which only 1500km were dedicated footpaths and asked, “How will last-mile connectivity improve when there is no space to walk?” Meanwhile, burning — be it coal, garbage, biomass or domestic fuels — is a major source of pollutants. Chandra Bhushan, CEO, iForest, described this as the elephant in the room. “The pollution situation is not going to improve until we address coal and biomass burning. Also cooking, heating, conventional fuels, garbage burning by unsensitised sanitation staff,” declared Bhushan. A policy is required to address this burning."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/want-a-lasting-solution-tackle-pollution-sources-over-the-year/articleshow/88098069.cms||Kushagra Dixit

A 35-year-old official of the company on Friday lodged a complaint with the Wakad police. Police have registered a case of cheating and invoked provisions of the Information Technology Act against unidentified suspects. Police said the company officials transferred money to a bank account with a private bank located in Rockwall in the US. The company officials, however, refused to comment on the issue when TOI contacted them on Saturday afternoon. According to the complaint, the company’s office is located at Yerawada, but the administrative staffers have been allowed to work from home due to the pandemic. One of the officers of the company transferred the money to the fraudsters between October 5 and 8 after receiving the email demanding money. According to the complaint, the company had ordered a conveyor machine from the US company. “The Pune-based company received an email bearing all the details of the US company. The company officials transferred the money to the account number mentioned in the email without verifying the details with the US company,” police said. According to the police, fraudsters often clone emails and other details of a company, including colours, graphics and logos, with a view to cheat. Fraudsters monitor online conversations between two companies surreptitiously and then send cloned email to the paying party, making changes to the bank name and account numbers. This is known as a man-in-the-middle attack in cybercrime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fraudsters-dupe-firm-of-rs-43l-by-sending-cloned-email/articleshow/88096923.cms||---

The crime branch team — led by assistant inspector Manoj Shinde — arrested Jawed Khan (35) of Nutan colony and Shaikh Nazir (35) of Samtanagar. An offence against the duo under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS)Act has been registered with Kranti Chowk police station. During the raids, about seven kg of marijuana was seized from Khan, while the remaining was seized from Shaikh’s place. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav said Khan is a criminal on police record and has 11 body and property offences including robbery registered against him at different police stations. The police record for the second accused is being looked into. Following the seizure from the houses, Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta has issued directives for initiating stringent preventive action against the suspects and their sources of marijuana. Crime branch authorities suspect that the accused belong to the chain that sources a large amount of marijuana from the forests and hilly regions of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chattisgarh. Those privy to the probe said due to the latest crackdown by the narcotics control bureau and the state police, marijuana coming from the neighbouring states has reduced with several peddlers roping in farmers to grow weed along with other lookalike crops. As the police are keeping a tab on the state borders, the criminal elements are convincing the farmers to sow weed. The gullible farmers with a hope to make quick money are falling prey to the traps, Aghav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cops-raid-2-houses-12-25-kg-of-high-quality-marijuana-seized/articleshow/88095769.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Owing to waterlogging in 14 streets in Woraiyur locality, the meter readings were not taken by the Tangedco staff.Owing to the surplus flow in the Kudamurutti river, several streets and houses in Woraiyur locality were submerged and the Tangedco workers had stopped taking meter reading from the locality falling under a portion of the Woraiyur section in Trichy urban division. The readings were supposed to be assessed between November 27 and November 30. As the waterlogging was around 4-5 feet deep in the residential streets, Tangedco said that it has skipped the houses and commercial establishments at Fathima Nagar, Agathiyar Street, Nakkeeran street, Cholan street, Vivekanandhar street, Budhhar street, Ashoka street, Paramahasar street, Kambar street, Thilagar Street, Nethaji street, Avvai street, Rajarajan street and Ilango Street for recording electricity meter readings. “The houses in the 14 streets were asked to pay the same bill as paid in the previous assessment cycle.

The urban local body has said that compliance of commercial establishments will be scrutinised during surprise enforcement drives.In Trichy city, around 7.14 lakh people were identified as eligible to take the vaccine against Covid-19. However, the civic body said that around 25% of the population are still hesitant to take the jab. A significant number of those who took the first dose were found skipping their second dose. As concern over the new Omicron variant is seeping in, the civic body said that they have to pursue a stringent approach to inoculate the public. Commercial establishments including market vicinities, hubs like Singarathope, West Boulevard road and Teppakulam have been issued notices. “As workers in showrooms and other outlets have direct interaction with the public are prone to infection and infect others, immunising them is a priority. Support from the traders’ fraternity is crucial,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said. A section of workers in the commercial streets here are commuting from rural and even other districts.Since the first week of December, the civic body has been distributing public health notices. While the corporation’s notice insists shops to inquire the vaccination status of customers, commercial outlets are unlikely to follow as people were not even wearing facemasks in public spots due to poor enforcement. While the corporation’s vaccination performance in the initial period was better than rural areas, the civic body in November witnessed a slump in coverage. To increase the vaccination coverage, special teams were formed to improve and oversee the performance of 18 urban primary health centres in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-makes-jab-mandatory-to-enter-shops/articleshow/88098059.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Amaravati||Konijeti Rosaiah was first choice as finance minister for all Andhra Pradesh CMs||AMARAVATI: It was always a big discomfort for opposition leaders to face Konijeti Rosaiah in the assembly. His authority over the finances of the state made him the first choice for the position of finance minister for Congress chief ministers. He was a trusted lieutenant to all the CMs with whom he worked. After completing graduation in commerce from Hindu college in Guntur, Rosaiah initially tried his hand in the family-owned business of rice mills, but soon joined politics after getting influenced by freedom fighter NG Ranga. He got elected to the legislative council in 1968 at the age of just 35 years. He was also nominated to the council by the Congress in 1974 and 1980. Interestingly, Rosaiah won his first direct electoral battle in 1989, nearly two decades after entering public life when he contested assembly elections from Chirala constituency in Prakasam district. He served as commercial taxes and transport minister in Tanguturi Anjaiah’s cabinet in 1979, and got the key portfolio of home affairs in Kotla Vijay Bhaskara Reddy’s cabinet in 1982. Channa Reddy made him finance minister in 1989, which he held under subsequent chief ministers N Janardhan Reddy and K Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy till 1994. He was again inducted into the cabinet as finance minister by YSR in 2004 and continued the portfolio even after getting elevated as chief minister following the death of YSR in a chopper crash in 2009. Meanwhile, a pall of gloom enveloped Rosaiah’s son-in-law and AP Chamber of Commerce president Pyda Krishna Prasad’s house in Balajinagar area of Visakhapatnam. Rosaiah’s daughter Rama Devi said her father was a man of values. “He never discussed politics in the house. We grew up with moral values and ethics. He was a simple man, and always wished we should not bring a bad name to him,” she said. Ramadevi is the only daughter of Rosaiah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/rosaiah-was-1st-choice-as-fin-min-for-all-cms/articleshow/88096928.cms||---

As per the current plan, the institution will hold first-year BTech classes online, and may start in-person classes from next year, if the situation improves. Currently, students of other years are present on campus. K Umamaheshwar Rao director, NITK, told STOI that one of the major reasons to give up plans for first-year BTech students to have in-person classes, is the increase in Covid-19 cases, and emergence of Omicron variant. “According to the current plan, all first-year BTech students have been informed that the academic session for the first semester will start on December 27. The classes and all the other academic activities of the semester will be held online. However, all these students have been asked to get vaccinated and prepare themselves for physical reportingon campus, as and when they are called for physical classes,” said Umamaheshwar. “When we go offline, the first year students have to arrive from across the country, as well as from foreign countries to the campus. Mass arrival of students will put other students at risk, who are already present here. So we took this decision, which will safeguard the health of the students,” he said. He added that the campus may go completely offline from next semester, if there are not much Covid cases. The classes for all streams were online since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, and examinations too were held online. Students from second-year BTech courses and PhD scholars have arrived on campus. “We have been advising students time and again, to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour on campus. We are cooperating with the district administration and following their guidelines,” added Umamaheshwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nitk-cancels-offline-classes-for-first-year-btech-students/articleshow/88096285.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The roads will materialise even if the project cost exceeds the estimate, he said.“Thyagaraja Nagar, Beschi Nagar and AUT colony in Woraiyur are frequently facing waterlogging due to rain and overflowing rivers. We will mobilise motor pumps permanently to drain the stagnant water from the vulnerable spots whenever required,” Nehru said while visiting the waterlogged areas. New cement concrete roads are planned only in areas which saw chronic water stagnation in the recent flood whereas in other areas drain networks alone are planned. The minister added that stormwater drains will be constructed on both sides of the road to prevent inundation in Arulmigu Vekkaliamman temple and adjoining residential areas bordering Kudamurutti river that carries surplus rainwater from Pudukottai and Dindigul districts to the Cauvery. “No new roads or drains were constructed in Woraiyur in recent years. The roads remaining now were laid during the previous DMK government’s tenure,” he added. He also distributed solatium of Rs 4 lakh from the state disaster response fund to the family of R Krishnan who drowned in the stagnant water near Paramahamsa Nagar a few days ago. The minister said that the district administration has initiated a damage assessment survey to estimate crop loss in shallot, cotton and maize cultivations in Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Musiri and Thuraiyur administrative blocks. Compensation for crop loss due to rain will be disbursed to the affected farmers as early as possible. Later, the minister inaugurated the revenue department’s native tree plantation drive in Thirumanamedu village near Lalgudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/low-lying-woraiyur-to-get-cement-roads/articleshow/88098072.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Cops change stand in CPM man’s murder||KOCHI: Police on Saturday changed their stance that personal rivalry led to the murder of CPM Peringara local committee secretary PB Sandeep Kumar and added political rivalry as one of the reasons behind the brutal killing that happened on Thursday night. According to sources, police said in a remand report submitted before the judicial first class magistrate court in Thiruvalla on Friday that the prime accused, Jishnu Raghu was an active member of the Yuva Morcha and that three among the remaining four accused including Nandu and his brother Abhijith were active members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Police have reportedly said in the report that the prime accused had nursed a personal as well as political grudge towards the victim. As per the report, the accused unleashed a violent attack on Sandeep with the intention to kill him. The court had remanded the accused in judicial custody for 14 days and shifted them to a Covid-19 care centre in Alappuzha. The investigation team had managed to arrest all accused involved, in a matter of hours, but the police ruling out political motivation behind the attack had invited the ire of CPM, the ruling party. From local leaders to party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had taken a strong stand against the police and said that it was improper for police to rule out political conspiracy behind the murder even before completing the investigation. Sandeep Kumar was hacked and stabbed to death by the five-member gang late on Thursday. The accused were booked for offences including murder, unlawful assembly, and criminal intimidation, among others. The police will soon move an application to get custody of the accused for interrogation. Meanwhile, the BJP on Saturday came out with strong criticism of the police move. BJP leader MT Ramesh said in a press meet at Kozhikode that the police changed their stance after Kodiyeri’s press meet. He also said that the chief minister did not mention the name of RSS in his Facebook post as he had received the correct information. “The district police chief had said categorically to the media that this was a murder executed due to personnel animosity. However, CPM and DYFI leaders were showing an usual urgency to put the blame of this murder on BJP and RSS…Even after everyone realised what has happened, CPM is still blaming RSS for it. People will soon realise this inhumane attitude in the CPM stand,” said Ramesh. He claimed that except one accused, all others who were arrested in the case were either CPM workers or sympathisers. “Three among them are natives of Thiruvalla. Only two of them are from outside the district. They are unable to allege anything that can connect them with BJP or RSS. Not only that they have no connection with us, they are also CPM workers,” said Ramesh. He added that a BJP connection can only be found in the case of the accused Jishnu. “He used to be the Yuva Morcha president in his panchayat. Due to his connections with such criminal activities and following allegations of his links with some drug peddlers in the area, he was removed from his position in Yuva Morcha, two years ago. After that he didn’t have any connections with BJP. The four others are CPM workers and two of them are brothers. They had campaigned for CPM in the elections and CPM had helped them in constructing a house,” said Ramesh, adding that their social media profiles were strong evidence for their allegiances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-change-stand-in-cpm-mans-murder/articleshow/88096948.cms||---

While 250KL would be available from all LMO tanks, another 150KL would be generated by the PSA oxygen plants. The NMC has ramped up its medical oxygen requirement on the directives of the state government after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many private hospitals in the city faced a severe crisis of medical oxygen when the flow of Covid patients surged during the second wave. “This buffer stock of medical oxygen will enable NMC to cater to the needs of the private hospitals on nominal charges. For government-managed hospitals, we would supply it free of cost. We have already purchased 3,000 medical oxygen cylinders to supply the gas to the private/government hospitals if needed,” added the Nashik Municipal Corporation chief. According to him, NMC is well-prepared to deal with any fresh surge in Covid cases in the city. “The Covid situation in the city is fully under control as the declining trend of the cases continues. As the new variant of Omicron has emerged, I would appeal to people to strictly follow all Covid safety protocols to avoid getting infected and infecting others,” added Jadhav. Jadhav said that NMC has also increased 1,000 Covid beds in its various medical facilities as a part of its preparations for a fresh surge in Covid cases. A 100-bed paediatric ward has been set up at Bytco Hospital. “The general beds at our Covid Care Centres (CCCs) have been converted into medical oxygen ones so that CCC authorities can administer oxygen to patients if there is an emergency,” added the civic chief. Jadhav has instructed NMC’s health department to zero in on the foreign travellers arriving in the city and undertake their Covid tests as quickly as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmcs-zakir-hussain-hospital-gets-4-liquid-medical-o-tanks/articleshow/88095787.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Search is on for the key accused.  Superintendent of police Vinayak Deshmukh said a peon identified as Sudarshan Kamane, employed with the DCCB’s main branch at Satkar Complex, noticed that the branch managers from other branches each morning collect cash and take them to respective branches without any security.  In an attempt to make some quick money, he shared the information with his friend Shatrughan alias Baban Gaikwad of Sarwadi village.  In return, Gaikwad discussed it with his friends, — Gajanan Shingade (32) of Pachanvadgaon, Karansingh Bhond (28), Arjunsingh Bhond (23), his brother Kanwarsingh (20) and Sunil alias Tala Bhutekar (22) — who have criminal records and they agreed to commit the robbery.  As a part of the plan, one of the gang members carried out a recce for several days, following which the gang members reached the spot twice to commit robbery but failed. On the morning of November 26, branch manager Subhash Godbole along with another staffer collected the cash meant for distribution as compensation for crop loss from its main branch and was heading towards Golapangri. When two accused stopped and assaulted the bank staffers before threatening them with dire consequences and robbing the bag containing cash, following which the accused fled.  Local crime branch (LCB) inspector Subhash Bhujang said the probe has revealed that the accused who carried out recce has been given a share of Rs 1 lakh, while the key accused in this case, who robbed the bag, allegedly took half of the cash as his share.

---||Nashik||People like Javed Akhtar are frustrated lot: Devendra Fadnavis||NASHIK: Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that people like poet-lyricist Javed Akhtar are a “frustrated lot” and, therefore, tend to have a lopsided view on various issues. Fadnavis was talking to reporters on Saturday during his visit to the city to address party workers ahead of the upcoming municipal council elections. “People like Akhtar are a frustrated lot and have been opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” he said. He was reacting to Akhtar’s remarks during the inauguration of the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, where the noted lyricist said that the freedom of expression among authors was shrinking. “Just like Parliament and the state assemblies are important in a democratic setup, so is the freedom of expression of writers and authors. Unfortunately, that freedom of expression for them is shrinking,” Akhtar had said. Devendra Fadnavis said that a large number of people had returned their awards presented by Union government to register their protest against the PM. “Such people must remember that the electorate of the country chose Modi as their leader and a section of people are trying new tricks to wean people away from him,” he said. “People like Akhtar are the the ones, who were influenced by the thoughts of others. They often are lopsided in their thinking process and, therefore, they stick to a certain view of the society,” he said. ‘Skipped event as Savarkar’s name was missing’ Responding to questions, Fadnavis said he had decided not to visit the venue of the Marathi literary event as the name of freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was missing. “Savarkar was not just a freedom fighter, but was an author, playwright, novelist, poet, historian who coined new words in Marathi language. He was also one of the past presidents of the Marathi Sahitya Sammelan. I fail to understand why the organisers were averse to mentioning his name given that Nashik is his birthplace,” evendra Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-like-akhtar-are-frustrated-lot-fadnavis/articleshow/88095798.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Congress banking on ’09 deja vu, BJP worried about the same||NAGPUR: On paper, BJP’s MLC candidate (local bodies constituency) Chandrashekhar Bawankule seems be in a stronger position with 60-odd surplus voters, but still the saffron party is planning to whisk its public representatives in local bodies to a ‘safe and secure’ resort till the polling date. BJP’s strategy does make sense if one looks at the 2009 results of the same polls. Back then, BJP’s Ashok Mankar looked set to romp home with over 50 voters more than that of the Congress. Yet, Congress’ Rajendra Mulak pulled off a miracle by winning the polls by four votes. The second generation politician worked the local political equations to the maximum and swung votes drastically in his favour, in the end winning by a wafer thin margin. This is why Congress president Nana Patole on Friday said that the ‘on paper’ calculations of voters don’t matter. “This is not that type of an election. Here it does not matter who has the maximum voters. We have worked out a strategy to get to the finish line,” said Patole. A Congress leader said that Mulak’s victory in 2009 is what’s worrying BJP. “If it could happen back then, it can happen now too. In these elections what matters is the relationship you develop with voters, who themselves are public representatives. So a candidate like Mulak, whose father himself was a veteran Congress leader, knew how to connect with voters in every village and taluka. This also means having good equations with the opposition. In the end, Mulak pulled it off,” said the leader. But while Mulak achieved the seemingly impossible, does this mean Congress candidate Ravindra Bhoyar can do the same? The answer depends on whom you speak to within the Congress. The camp which backed Bhoyar’s entry is convinced that history will be repeated. One such leader said, “Do you think tickets are given just like in a scenario where we already know which party has how many voters? It is absurd to even entertain the thought that senior politicians who are smart enough to run the state government will be stupid enough to back a loser. We know which political equations will come into play during the polls, as even the BJP has active factions.” But members of the camp who were not too keen on Bhoyar’s entry say it’s wrong to compare this poll with that of 2009. “That was Mulak, with a big political legacy backing him that has roots in rural politics. He was himself an MLA before so can’t be compared to Bhoyar. And Bawankule is a very strong candidate. It all comes down to how Congress leaders like Mulak and Sunil Kedar work their rural voters and swing things for Bhoyar,” said the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-banking-on-09-deja-vu-bjp-worried-about-the-same/articleshow/88096304.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He was speaking at an interaction programme organised by the Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) on Saturday. The DC said that a meeting in this regard will be held soon after the election to the legislative council. “Why should all depend on the State Bank area in the city for all their needs? Why do urban local bodies of Bantwal and Ullal shift waste to Pachanady? They may process waste generated in their area on their own. Such issues of people depending on Mangaluru for all purposes makes the city remain choked always. Decentralisation is the only solution for this unending crisis. All taluks in the district also should be developed on par with Mangaluru. A decentralised industrial corridor and buffer zone needs to be developed in taluks. Land is being acquired for the purpose in Puttur taluk,” the DC said. On various development works being taken up under the Smart City Mission, the DC said that people need to cooperate since all projects are implemented at a time, with a future vision of 30 years. “Various departments have been working in coordination to implement development works in the city. Once all projects are completed, then the city will be able to provide more infrastructure for the convenience of people,” he said. On the proposed tunnel road between Mangaluru and Bengaluru, Rajendra said that various departments are in touch with each other to make it possible. Meanwhile, railway officials and people’s representatives are also discussing possibilities of introducing more trains between Mangaluru and Bengaluru. The national highway widening project on the BC Road-Addahole stretch on the Mangaluru-Bengaluru route has begun, and review meetings are being held every week, he said. “We will take initiatives for the district administration to get representation in the advisory committees of the New Mangalore Port Trust and Mangaluru International Airport. A road map will be prepared for the development of the tourism sector in the district, with the participation of stakeholders. Initiatives are on to acquire land for development in the IT sector. The Mangaluru Smart City Limited has included several projects that provide infrastructure for sports activities in the city,” Rajendra said.

He said the police FIR on Sandeep murder case was prepared at AKG Centre. “It was Pathanamthitta district police chief Nisanthini who first said that there was no RSS-BJP link in the murder of CPM local committee secretary. But police were forced to change their stand under pressure from Kodiyeri Balakrishnan,” said Surendran on Saturday. The BJP state president said that the party would face the alleged ‘CPM-police’ conspiracy politically and legally. “If the state police have decided to act as per the directives of the CPM, we are not ready to accept the same. There are many more constitutional institutions and judiciary above the state police. State police chief will be answerable for his police functioning as the feeder organisation of CPM,” Surendran added. Surendran claimed that none of the persons taken into custody in connection with the murder of CPM local leader Sandeep were BJP-RSS workers as claimed by CPM and police.

The fresh stocks are expected this month, but the state health officials stressed on exhausting the existing stock before demanding more doses. “A total of 66 lakh Covishield doses and 65 lakh Covaxin doses are yet to be utilised. We should be able to utilise them in the next 15 days,” said a state public health official. “Earlier, there was always a shortage of vaccine stock and the state was constantly demanding doses from the Centre. Now, we have excess stock, which we want to utilise first under the Har Ghar Dastak programme. We are sure we shall get a good allocation,” said another official. From October, the state has been receiving above 2 crore Covid vaccine doses per month from the Centre. Officials are striving to complete the first dose vaccination of adult beneficiaries in Maharashtra by the end of this month. As of now, the state has achieved 82% first dose vaccination of the eligible population and 45% people have been fully vaccinated.

Though Friday started off on a sunny note with the average rainfall for the day just 4.44 mm, residents woke up to heavy rain on Saturday in the city and suburbs. School children who were unaware of a holiday being declared by the district administration were seen at bus stops with umbrellas and raincoats. Vehicles moved through the inundated roads with their headlights on even at 9 am as the skies remained dark and cloudy. People walked through knee deep water on East Veli street, Swami Sannidhi, East Avani Moola street and Palace road. Water stagnation in Thalavai Agragaram, which gets inundated with water coming from East Avani Moola Street, North Avani Moola street and North Chittirai street, forced police to divert traffic near Pudumandapam. “The government should take steps to ensure a proper storm water drainage in these roads,’’ said S Sundaresan of Simmakkal. East Marret road was one of the worst hit, remaining inundated throughout the day. Since the road has become very uneven due to movement of heavy vehicles, many people lost balance and fell during the day. Chellapandian, who has an onion shop, said the corporation has not paid attention to this road for months. At Karupayoorani, women blocked Sivaganga road in the morning as water surrounded their houses. Saraswathi, a resident, said the authorities should find a solution at the earliest. Water flowed on the main road from the lake area next to Mattuthavani bus stand to Uthangudi as the Uthangudi Valar Nagar channel breached. Channels bringing water to Vandiyur tank were diverted or blocked at some places on the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/heavy-rain-floods-madurai-streets-tanks-overflow/articleshow/88097560.cms||---

Zilla Parishad CEO Leena Bansod held a meeting over video conference with the officers of the various primary health centres and sub-centres. It has been decided to increase Covid testing from the current 500 tests per day to over 1,500 to check the spread of infection. People celebrated Diwali together which witnessed large social gatherings. Almost all restrictions have been lifted as a result of which people are gathering more frequently. The wedding season has also begun, which means more people coming together. Amid all of this, the decision to increase testing has been taken. “The CEO said it was after Diwali that the number of cases started increasing steadily and hence the stress is being laid on to ensure the source of infection is identified quickly and the containment actions can be taken accordingly,” said district health officer Dr Kapil Aher. He said the department was not carrying out tests of people but patients who visited primary health centres. “There are about 15 % of patients suffering from SARI and ILI. We are, therefore, taking swabs of such people mandatorily. The local staff has been trained to collect swabs. As of now, we are limiting the collection only to PHCs,” said Dr Aher. The number of active cases in the district is 291. “Though there is no need to worry about the infection at this point, we are just being cautious to identify the pockets that could witness possible breakout,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-zp-increases-covid-testing-at-phcs/articleshow/88095818.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Sankarapandian said that the workers at the TNEB office in Tagore Nagar in Sellur had told him that the higher official, the assistant engineer was not available and that it would take some time for his connection. But when he contacted AE Murugan directly on the phone, he was ensured that he would get the connection immediately.His poster has inspired many like Senthil Kumar of Sellur, who was told he would have to pay Rs 20,000 for a new connection a year back.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Policy to promote ethanol production soon||GANDHINAGAR: With the aim of providing benefits to both ethanol manufacturing units and farmers, the Gujarat government will shortly announce ethanol production promotion policy, 2021. The state government is expected to announce a number of incentives to promote the policy. The policy, which is expected to be announced before the forthcoming edition of Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, aims to utilize, develop, and promote domestic feedstock of agri by-products with emphasis on maize for production of bio-ethanol, thereby increasingly substituting fossil fuels. “The goal of the policy is to enable availability of bio-ethanol in the market, thereby increasing its blending percentage to 20% in petrol by 2025 from the current blending rate of 7.93%,” says the policy document. All farmers engaged in maize cultivation through traditional or hybridization method supplying the maize produce to ethanol manufacturing units will be eligible under the policy. Among the agri-products used as agri-input for ethanol production, maize comparatively needs less water, gives higher yield per hectare in a shorter period and can be grown in any season. With high starch content, maize has the potential as a grain feedstock for ethanol production. As much as 380 litres of ethanol can be produced from 1 metric tonne of maize. The policy recognizes the need to provide incentives to eligible units in the ethanol manufacturing sector for the growth of this sunrise sector. The government will provide incentives to set up new distilleries to produce ethanol and to install any method approved by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Gujarat Agro Industries Corporation Limited (GAICL) shall be the nodal agency responsible for implementation of this policy in the State. GAICL will develop web-based interaction mechanism where suggestions and complaints can be directly addressed to it. BOX MAILED Incentives # Capital subsidy at 25% on eligible project cost (technical civil work and plant & machinery) subject to maximum of Rs 10 crore # Interest subsidy at 7% on term loan for 5 years, subject to maximum of Rs 5 crore. It will be in addition to the assistance received under central government scheme # 100% SGST and electricity duty reimbursement for a period of 5 years, upper limit being 100% of the project cost # Eligible farmers will be entitled to an incentive of Rs 1,000 per metric tonne of maize sold to grain-based ethanol manufacturing units||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/policy-to-promote-ethanol-production-soon/articleshow/88096977.cms||Kapil Dave

A circular from the Council on Saturday said that all marks for practicals, projects and also related files will have to be submitted by schools by January 31 instead of February 28 as they had been earlier informed. This preponement by a month has made schools tense because ICSE and ISC candidates have missed out on physical laboratory work for over 20 months and schools will have to give them intense training now. Since these children are doing their first semester exams now, schools say that nothing could be done about completion of lab practical work or second semester syllabus. Most schools have already informed candidates that they will have to be on campus the day after the semester one exams end so that lab practice can start. In most schools, ISC exams for science are ending on December 13, so kids will be back on campus from December 14 onwards for practice. To facilitate this many schools have cut down on their winter break by over 10 days. Immediately after the lab sessions are done, schools will have to arrange for board practical examinations for ISC candidates who will be externally assessed. In case of ICSE candidates, practical files are prepared for internal assessment. Schools say that because of the preponement, some changes in the original plan of syllabus completion will have to be done because the focus will be on completion of projects, practical work and exams, completing the files and uploading of marks. “We have cut down on our winter break by 10 days. Our teachers will not leave station before Deecember 20 so that they can start out with the children the day after they finish the semester one papers. We don’t know yet why the Council has preponed the submission by a month. Usually February is the month to complete practical exams and projects,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys. South City International has cut down its vacation too and is starting lab sessions for children immediately after the semester one ends. “We are keeping jus a 10 day vacation this time. The Council has preponed completion and submission time of marks of practicals and there is a lot of syllabus of semester two to catch up on,” said principal John Bagul. At AG Church Tollygunj ISC science candidates will be back on campus for practical sessions from December 14-21 and the winter break has been shortened said principal Kajori Biswas. “We are having a short break from December 21 to January 4. We will reopen to a lot of catching up on practical work and projects so that we complete everything by the new deadline, set by the Council,” Biswas added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/schools-cut-short-winter-vacation-as-council-prepones-submission-of-projects-and-practical-files-by-a-month/articleshow/88096986.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

These include 20 passengers staying in Jodhpur and Bodakdev areas as well. These passengers have been issued strict warnings that if they deviate from the mandatory seven-day quarantine for even a minute an FIR will be lodged against them. To make a test case, a passenger who had returned two days ago in Vasna area had ignored two warnings issued by the AMC and was found roaming at public places. Respective police stations have been informed of the presence of these 100-odd passengers in the city. “We will be registering an FIR against the Vasna passenger on Sunday. We had paid a surprise visit to his place. We have already informed the area police station,” said a senior AMC official who did not want to be identified. On Friday night, 56 international passengers had arrived in the city. “They are of varying age groups. Most of these passengers live in Navrangpura, Paldi, Vasna, Bodakdev and Jodhpur,” says the AMC official. The official confirmed that none of the passengers monitored since December 2 have shown Covid symptoms. “Regular calls are being made by our zonal health staff and a few vehicles have been deployed for our flying squads who will drop in to check whether these passengers are staying indoors and following requisite protocols,” said the AMC official. On another front, a separate meeting on increasing the numbers of administering second dose of the vaccine was also conducted. “Many in the city are yet to take their second dose. An increased vaccine cover is vital to counter Omicron,” adds the AMC health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-civic-body-keeps-close-vigil-on-100-fliers-from-omicron-hit-nations/articleshow/88096990.cms||---

According to the complaint filed by the woman’s father with police, the 26-year-old had married a man from Tenkasi district four years ago. The couple had a one-year-old daughter and they stayed and worked in Tirupur. Last year, the woman’s husband was admitted to a private hospital in Tirunelveli after a road accident and was subsequently diagnosed with AIDS. On further tests, the woman was also diagnosed as HIV positive. The woman’s father informed police that she had come to stay at their house at T Pudupatti a month ago with her the child. However, on Thursday morning, she left the house with her daughter and did not return. After a search, it was found that both drowned in a well belonging to a person in the area. Koodakovil police registered a case of suicide under section 174 CrPC on Friday and further investigation is on to establish the cause of suicide. Police said that an RDO inquiry is underway and further action will be taken after that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hiv-woman-ends-life-with-one-yr-old-child-in-madurai/articleshow/88097594.cms||---

State education minister Jitu Vaghani inaugurated the enclosure. Officials said that the penguins were quarantined and acclimatized to the environs. “This addition will not only bring new attraction to the gallery but will also help visitors understand the vast biodiversity sustained by our oceans,” said a senior Science City official. All penguins live in the southern hemisphere, normally on the coasts of Antarctica, South Africa, South America, parts of Australia and New Zealand, and many different islands including the Galapagos. The penguins at the aquatics gallery are African penguins (Speniscus demersus). This species is endemic to the coasts of South Africa, but can be found living and breeding under human care across the world. In the wild, African penguin populations are under threat and are declining rapidly. The African penguin is expected to go extinct in the wild by 2026. “A common misconception about penguins is that they require very cold temperatures. This is not true and only applies to penguin species originating from the Antarctic region. African penguins live in temperate climates, and here at the aquarium we will be maintaining their habitat at around 18°C,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/african-penguins-get-new-home-in-city/articleshow/88096985.cms||---

The reports of other Omicron suspects from Mumbai could be available in a day or two from the gene sequencing laboratory at Kasturba Hospital, near Chinchpokli, said AMC Suresh Kakani. Mumbai has 17 Omicron suspects, of which 13 are travellers and four their contacts. An equal number of suspects are spread out across the state, said a state health official. An update by the BMC said it has a list of 3,760 travellers to Mumbai from high-risk countries and 2,794 have been traced and tested for Covid-19. State health department officials said 60 of the Dombivli patient’s primary and secondary contacts, including 25 co-passengers in the Delhi-Mumbai flight, had been traced and tested. “None of them tested positive for Covid,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. The whole genome sequencing report of another Omicron suspect, a 60-year-old male with a travel history to Zambia, was negative. The genomic report from the National Insititute of Virology, Pune, showed the second patient was infected by a sub-lineage of the Delta variant. KDMC commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi told reporters in Kalyan that the Omicron patient, who has been kept in institutional quarantine, is completely stable. The merchant navy engineer on November 24 tested positive at the airport and chose home quarantine as he only had mild fever. When the field surveillance began, the KDMC health department found out about him because his brother approached a private lab in Dombivli for a Covid-19 test. The brother told the lab staff the engineer had returned from South Africa and was Covid-positive. The lab informed KDMC health officials, who shifted him to a quarantine centre. Maharashtra’s and Gujarat’s confirmations came two days after India’s first two cases of the Omicron variant were reported on Thursday from Karnataka: a 66-year-old South African flyer and a 46-year-old Bengaluru doctor with no travel history. Both men had been fully vaccinated. Jamnagar officials said the 72-year-old man from the district, living for decades in Zimbabwe, had landed at Ahmedabad international airport on November 28 and travelled to Jamnagar by road with two others. He tested Covid-positive on November 30. Both persons who travelled with him are negative, said officials. All high-risk contacts of the man have tested negative, they added. The KDMC has tested 76 travellers, of whom six are Covid-positive. Four returned from Nigeria, and one each from Russia and Nepal. All are asymptomatic.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Airport rapid RT-PCR test now for 13 per cent less at Rs 3,900||MUMBAI: Based on the countries they have flown in from, passengers arriving at the airport are now segregated for further testing, keeping in line with the latest central government norms issued to track the Omicron variant. The good news for passengers who need to undergo a rapid RT-PCR test is that the airport has reduced the rate from Rs 4,500 to Rs 3,900. The new rates came into effect on Saturday. On Friday, 6,732 international passengers landed at the airport. Out of this, 969 international arrival passengers underwent the RT-PCR test, of which 214 passengers took the standard RT-PCR test and 755 passengers opted for the rapid PCR test, said the MIAL. Passengers arriving from countries identified by the government as “at-risk”, such as United Kingdom, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Brazil, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel, are deboarded on priority to undergo a PCR test on arrival, said the MIAL. Dedicated corridors and counters have been created for these passengers, said the airport. “The passengers are required to wait for their test results before leaving or taking a connecting flight,” said the MIAL. But those arriving from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe or passengers who have visited any of these three countries in the last 15 days before arrival in Maharashtra have to undergo a mandatory week-long hotel quarantine after undergoing an RT-PCR test at the airport. A second test needs to be done at the end of the quarantine period. If tested negative, they can leave but have to undergo another week of home quarantine. Travellers from countries excluding those at risk are allowed to leave the airport. They need to self-monitor for 14 days post arrival. But a small percentage (2% of the total flight passengers) of these are required to undergo an RT-PCR test post-arrival at random at the airport. “The 2% of such travellers in each flight are identified by the airlines concerned (preferably passengers from different countries). Such travellers are escorted by the airline to RT-PCR testing area on arrival,” said MIAL. “Children under 5 years of age are exempted from both pre- and post-arrival testing. However, if found symptomatic for Covid on arrival, they shall undergo testing and [be] treated as per laid down protocol,” said MIAL. The MIAL said it has set up 100 registration counters and 60 sampling booths, including 100 rapid PCR machines. If any of the PCR tests are positive, the BMC or state authorities move the passenger concerned to a Covid treatment facility. The samples of such passengers are also collected for genomic sequencing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-airport-rapid-rt-pcr-test-now-for-13-less-at-rs-3900/articleshow/88097616.cms||---

The NRI is from Zimbabwe, and is the country's third Omicron case. Two sets of samples from the Zimbabwean citizen, whose wife is a Jamnagar local, were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) in Gandhinagar for whole genome sequencing. On December 2, the NRI had tested positive for Covid Omicron variant. “We are making regular phone calls to enquire about the health of these individuals who were seated in close proximity to the NRI. All are keeping well and are without any symptom,” says a senior AMC health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/team-monitors-5-at-risk-passengers/articleshow/88096994.cms||---

The arrested are Navaneeth of Ashoknagar, Hemanth of Hoigebail, Deekshith from Boloor and Sandesh. The assault, reported late on November 27 night, was a retaliation to the murder of Indrajeeth in Barke police station limits in 2020. The murder was allegedly carried out by ‘Boloor gang’, said police commissioner N Shashi Kumar. The arrested were planning to assault Ankith, who was allegedly involved in the murder. However, they assaulted Shravan, a friend of Ankith. Shravan, who suffered serious injuries, is now recovering, the commissioner said. “The rivalry between Boloor gang and Alake gang over tiger dance (pili vesha) and groupism has often resulted in clashes in the city. In 2014, the rivalry had led to the murder of Sanjay, son of Talwar Jagga alias Janardhan of Boloor gang. In retaliation to this murder, a murder attempt was made on Rithesh of Alake gang in 2019. In 2020, Indrajith of Alake gang was murdered by Ullas Kanchan, Gautham, Rakesh, Sharan, Kaushik, Ashik, Mokshith, Jagga, Nithin Poojary, Devadas Poojary (all from Boloor gang),” the commissioner explained. The commissioner said that 13-14 persons were part of the assault on Shravan. “They will all be arrested shortly. Mangaluru city police will not tolerate any such anti-social activities. Only if the rowdy sheeters’ conduct is good, their rowdy-sheet case will be closed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/four-held-for-assaulting-rival-group-member/articleshow/88096355.cms||---

The judge, K V Rajaneesh, issued an order on dropping all charges against her on Saturday. The high-level probe committee had submitted the report on June 16 this year. The woman had approached the high court stating that the district court here was delaying their decision on the police report. Following this, the HC had directed the district court to expedite the procedure. The woman was arrested by the Kadakkavoor police on December 28, 2020 based on a petition filed by her estranged husband that she had allegedly sexually abused their 14-year-old son during the period between 2017 and 2020 while the son was staying with her. The husband, who works in a Gulf country, stated in his petition that the son revealed about the abuse after he came to stay with the father. The woman’s family alleged that her husband had falsely accused the woman of using the son to get custody of the children as their divorce case was going before the family court. Soon, the child welfare committee also called out the local police for procedural lapses involved in the steps taken in the case. Senior officers of the police department took note of the allegations and constituted a high-level committee to conduct a probe. The sub inspector of the station was also transferred to another station. The committee concluded the probe stating that there was no scientific evidence to support the allegations levelled against her. The son was also subjected for a detailed medical examination by the doctors at Government Medical College here as part of the probe. The woman's family said that the fight for her justice has not ended and further steps will be announced in the coming week after consulting with their legal counsel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/after-a-year-long-fight-woman-absolved-of-pocso-charges/articleshow/88097002.cms||---
---||Kolkata||12.5 kg cyst removed from woman’s abdomen||Kolkata: An ovarian cyst weighing 12.5 kg was surgically extracted from a woman’s abdomen at a city private hospital recently. Tested benign after biopsy, doctors said the tumour was a ‘borderline cyst’, a rare tumour that falls in a category between a benign tumour and a cancerous one. A team of surgeons led by gynaecologist Dr Susmita Mitra Banerjee, surgically removed the ovarian cyst from a 36-year-old woman at AMRI Hospitals Dhakuria in a complex and difficult surgery. The cyst was totally asymptomatic. “Unlike most ovarian cysts, this one hardly caused any pain or discomfort to the patient. Even other symptoms, like bleeding and menstrual disturbances, were also not present. The cyst only made the patient feel some heaviness as it grew in size. The patient believed she had put on weight or there was some swelling in her abdomen,” said Dr Mitra Banerjee. After visiting a local doctor near Santoshpur in South 24 Parganas, she was directed to a government hospital, where she was scheduled for a surgery but it had to be cancelled as she tested positive to Covid. Later, she consulted Dr Mitra Banerjee, who after an ultra-sonography and other tests, identified the cyst in her ovaries. It had extended upwards from her stomach and was putting pressure on her diaphragm. “We carefully extracted the cyst and put the other organs in their original places. Since the cyst was pressing into her diaphragm, which was pushing her lungs, administering anaesthesia was also difficult but eventually the surgery was successful,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/12-5-kg-cyst-removed-from-womans-abdomen/articleshow/88097005.cms||---

Out of the total, 49,850 were from rural areas while 32,831 were from urban areas and 2,322 were those who got vaccinated in government hospitals. Health officials are hoping for vaccination numbers to continue to improve this week especially after the announcement regarding making vaccination mandatory to enter public places.In Trichy too the mass vaccination camps held at 521 locations saw good turnout with the majority being second dose takers. The reminders sent by Trichy Corporation have also helped the urban local body to improve coverage. “Although Trichy district administration has not made any public announcements recognising vaccination coverage as mandatory to access public spots, such developments happening in other districts have made an impact here. People are realising that the vaccination status will soon be scrutinised to access public places,” a health official with Trichy corporation said. “College students who were skipping their second dose were covered in ward 51 of Trichy city. We inquired among locals, interested people were covered,” an assistant commissioner with Trichy Corporation said. Of the 75,369 doses of vaccines administered as of Saturday evening in the district, around 57% of the jabs were the second doses. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/new-rule-improves-turnout-for-jabs-in-madurai-trichy/articleshow/88097613.cms||---

Members of the public also urged the district administration to give more time before implementing the rule so they can be prepared.“We have registered for Covid-19 vaccination for me, my parents and my wife under only my mobile number. The certificates can be accessed only through my mobile phone. In such case, whenever my wife or parents go out, they have to rely on me for certificate,” said S Muthurajan, a resident of Kamarajar Salai. He said that to protect themselves, they got vaccinated with both doses. “Now, asking for certificates everywhere we go is punishing for us,” he added.Several people who have taken both doses of the vaccine said they don’t know how to download vaccination certificates. “Especially for senior citizens, this is a huge problem. Many already find it difficult to even use mobile phones. We would have to depend on others to help us, which is an additional burden,” said K Raja, a 62-year-old resident of Villapuram.District collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar had announced the new restrictions on Friday after a meeting on Covid-19 vaccination and Omicron prevention with various stakeholders, presided over by commercial taxes minister P Moorthy and corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan. “We will warn them first and then they will be denied entry into public places as per the Public Health Act. People coming to public places, including temples and others would be asked to show their vaccination certificate which would be available on their phones, to gain entry and the personnel in the places would have the responsibility of checking it,” he added.For some people who have taken both doses, the SMS denoting completion of vaccination has not been sent to their phones. “I received calls even last week asking me to get my second dose. My vaccination certificate also shows that I’ve taken only one dose. When such technical issues are still unattended, how can we be asked to produce vaccination certificates,” asks G Revathi, an IT employee from Anna Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tech-issues-accessibility-concerns-over-mandatory-vax-rule-in-madurai/articleshow/88097618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Extensive searches were conducted in the Saliya village of Devgadh Baria taluka after Piplod police received information regarding marijuana plantation done by farmers there. After day-long searches, sleuths finally identified three farms where marijuana cultivation was done illicitly. Two of the farms where 1,745 plants weighing 1,038kg were found belonged to Narsinh Patel. Another 130 plants weighing 101.34kg were found from Ganpati Bariya’s farm. All these farms are located in the same area. The plants are valued at Rs 1,14,03,400 in open market. Cops arrested Patel and Bariya and initiated investigations to find out since when these farmers resorted to contraband farming. Also, sleuths are trying to identify the source of seeds the farmers used and also where they sold the drugs.

In addition to that, 27 containers of 540 metric tonne (MT) capacity for transportation of liquid oxygen have been arranged. The oxygen generation capacity in the state is increased from 135 MT/day to 327 MT/day,” director public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao said. “Also, 5,200 paediatric oxygen beds have been earmarked in different government hospitals so far for Covid-19. We are completely geared up to handle the situation if a third wave arises,” he said, adding that though a rapid spread of the new variant has been predicted,it might not be severe and therefore preparations would be enough to tackle any eventuality. Not just in the government sector, efforts have been made to upscale oxygen generation and storage infrastructure even in private hospitals, which have bought oxygen tankers that can store liquid oxygen sufficienet for 3-4 days. “There was a shortage of tankers during the second wave. Now, majority of the corporate hospitals have set up additional oxygen generation plants, while the smaller and mid-sized ones have made arrangements for tankers,” Telangana Super Speciality Hospitals Association president Dr Bhaskar Rao said. In private hospitals, 39 PSA plants have been commissioned so far.  “Of 27,996 beds in government hospitals, 25,390 have been converted to oxygen beds so far. Currently, there are 55,442 beds in the state, including those in private hospitals. Of these 21,751 are oxygen beds, while 11,845 are ICU beds. “Patients with moderate to severe symptoms, with or without Covid positive report, can go to any notified government Covid hospitals. Based on the clinical requirements, beds will be provided, and treatment will be given free of cost at government hospitals,” the health department said, urging people to utilise government facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/leaving-nothing-to-chance-t-ups-oxygen-bed-capacity/articleshow/88097009.cms||Amrita Didyala

The officials thus suggested intensive checking according to the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for screening of all incoming passengers by the Government of India (GOI). “In March 2020, the first cases of Covid-19 had come to the state through passengers with foreign travel history. But the time has changed now and we know the drill. Apart from isolation of all the nearby passengers, the contact tracing of the persons will be carried out if the person has arrived in the state before December 1 when the guidelines were put into force,” said a health department official. Apart from checking the vaccination status of all the passengers, the health teams deployed at the arrival are asked to screen all passengers for any symptoms and RT-PCR if they have arrived from ‘at risk’ countries. “We also urge the passengers not to hide their identity just to gain entry or cut the hassle. A small misadventure can have a cascading effect and thus they must follow the isolation guidelines and avoid meeting others just because they have no or milder symptoms,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/senior-gujarat-officials-stress-on-intensive-checking-effective-tracing/articleshow/88097004.cms||---

He said that the Union ministry for tourism will give Goa greater attention in the coming months and is willing to provide the necessary funds to enhance Goa’s tourism potential. Reddy, who was addressing a press conference in the state capital, said that the Central government is poised to develop 75 tourism destinations in the country to international standards, particularly Goa and the proposal is awaiting cabinet approval. “There will be more infrastructure, new initiatives and inaugurations by working with the state government, Goa Tourism Development Corporation and Goa Tourism,” Reddy said. “We will give more funds for Goa. We need to bring Goa to international standards, to compete with other international destinations.” He said that the 75 destinations were being developed as part of the ICON project which has been conceptualised to mark the 75th year of India’s independence. Explaining his ministry’s plans for promoting India as an international tourism destination, Reddy said tourist officers have been appointed in 20 embassies to promote, brand and market India as a tourism destination. “That is why our department, in the coming months, wants to pay more attention to Goa and its tourism potential,” Reddy said. He added that the emergence of a new Covid-19 variant, Omicron, has thwarted plans for resumption of international travel, particularly international charter flights. “We had spoken to international charter operators and with the countries but because a new variant has been detected, the tour operators and various other countries have introduced new restrictions. This has created a hassle for us,” Reddy said. He said that he is confident that Goa’s tourism sector will once again boom once the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mantri-unveils-tourism-projects-says-centre-will-fund-some-more/articleshow/88097684.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Parkonnim has everyone guessing as Kuwait-Goan has the last laugh||VASCO: A Goan woman working in Kuwait has bagged a unique heritage quiz in a competition that had enthused Konkanis residing in various nooks of the world to answer 50 easy and difficult riddles – an indication that Goa’s oral traditions are alive somehow. Parkonnim or humannim (riddles) were an integral part of Goa’s cultural traditions when elders and others posed these brain teasers as a pastime, but change in lifestyles and other factors have meant their use has faded, somewhat in recent years. In a bid to revive the colourful traditions, Chicalim Bio-Crusaders, a group documenting their biodiversity, had organised the quiz, ‘Parkonnem – Kitem Tem Sang’ for the second year, stirring interest among Goans across the state and even globally. That Aquila Rodriques, a professional who now has a house in Verna and works in Kuwait, turned out to be a storehouse of the fading knowledge surprised not only the organisers but two other co-winners, Raisa Fernandes and Ashley Afonso. “Both Fernandes and Afonso were also the first competition joint winners and had already experienced the joy of holding aloft the trophy. In a big gesture to promote heritage and impressed that Rodrigues took part all the way from Kuwait, they showed a big heart in offering the position to her,” Cyril Fernandes, convener of Chicalim Bio-Crusaders said. The 50 riddles released on social media over a couple of months had created much buzz. The competition itself took shape under interesting circumstances. George Varkey, a Kerala resident who was born and brought up in Goa, promptly offered support to the idea of a parkonnem competition after the Chicalim group mooted the idea. Varkey, who came down specially to attend the prize distribution function from the southern state on Friday, gushed, “This is very interesting and a good activity,” he said. The unexpected response has proved heartening for the organisers. “Our heritage appears to be impacted in recent years, but the tremendous response shows that Goans are still interested in our legacy and concerned in preserving it,” Fr Bolmax Pereira, local parish priest and an environmental activist said. Rodrigues, the competition winner, was not much interested initially and unsure about accuracy of her answers. “But after answering a few and receiving encouragement from organisers, I decided not to give up,” Rodrigues said. After the third and final competition next year, the organisers hope to collect the parkonnim in a book. The huge response has prompted the organisers to urge art and culture department to take the competition to a higher level. “We did what is best within our constraints, but after the encouraging cultural impact of it, we feel the department should raise the bar,” Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parkonnim-has-everyone-guessing-as-kuwait-goan-has-the-last-laugh/articleshow/88097644.cms||Ruvina Khan

---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: 2-day bank strike from December 17||AURANGABAD: The United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) has given a call for a 2-day nationwide strike from December 17 to oppose the proposed privatization of two public sector banks. Devidas Tuljapurkar, the UFBU Maharashtra convener said, more than eight lakh bank employees will join the strike. “Gathered under an umbrella body of UFBU, the bank employees associated with different unions staged a protest on Saturday at state capitals to oppose privatization. The protest, coinciding with the winter session of the Parliament, will be stepped up further,” he said, adding that the protest is supported by AIBEA, NCBE, AIBOC, BEFI, AIBOA, INBOC and INBEF. Tuljapurkar said the centre has not consulted with the stakeholders and various sections of the society while pushing for privatization. “The government’s agenda of privatization will create uncertainty among the public and more particularly with the depositors of the banks. All public sector banks together have booked the operative profit of rupees Rs 50,863 crore, and net profit of rupees Rs 17,132 crore. So, there is no need to privatize these banks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-day-bank-strike-from-december-17/articleshow/88095860.cms||---
---||Kolkata||KP watsapp warning||Kolkata: A common cyber fraud carried out on Facebook - and which had targeted several top bureaucrats, cops, doctors and academicians in the past - is now making a return through Whatsapp. The detective department of Kolkata police has now issued a warning on its social media pages - especially Twitter - of random Whatsapp messages where money is being sought in the name of hospitalization of a relative. Most hospitalizations are sent in the name of Covid-19, the new messages even citing the new Omicron variety. This is the third warning from cops on the misuse of Whatsapp by cyber criminals in a span of 45 days. "Did you receive a WhatsApp message from an unknown number with the DP of a friend, asking for money as he/she is in a hospital and needs money urgently? If yes, then be alert. Do not transfer money or share your bank details without verifying the sender’s credential," the detective department wrote on their social media handles. Cops said that they have received multiple complaints in this regard forcing them to issue the warning. "This is one of the most common modules used on Whatsapp to trick citizens nowadays. Of late, cheating through Whatsapp - even by hacking it - has witnessed a substantial rise," said a deputy commissioner of police. Only last month, Kolkata Police - along with other state and national security agencies - had warned all users of social media to ascertain if scamsters are using their 'compromised' accounts to cheat fellow citizens. According to police sources, scammers have also come up with a new way to cheat people with a gold bar scheme using compromised WhatsApp accounts. They added that the accounts had been hacked using a voicemail method. In this new scam variant, the crooks pretend to be a friend of a victim by using a hacked WhatsApp account belonging to the friend and then communicating with the victim through the messaging service. Posing as the friend, the scammers tempt the victim into buying gold bars claiming that they are being sold much below the market rate. Police had also taken to its Facebook page to warn netizens about the new dangers. "WhatsApp Getting Hacked! If you receive this kind of message and if any person on your WhatsApp contacts list (even if known) asks you to forward the same, please don’t do so. Fraudsters are using this to take control of your WhatsApp account. We have received a few such complaints and seek your cooperation,"it stated, sharing a screenshot of the fraud message where a whatsapp code apparently is asked to be shared. Sources in Kolkata police claim that these organized gangs are mainly operating from Bharatpur and Alwar in Rajasthan. "They have been duping lakhs of people from across the country, first by posing as armed forces and paramilitary personnel intending to sell vehicles through e-classifieds portals. Now, they are impersonating police and important persons of the society on FB and WhatsApp,” said a cyber crime official. Ever since the pandemic, several senior state police and government officers - including IAS and IPS officers - have fallen prey to cyber fraudsters after they created fake emails and social media accounts and made fake Facebook and whatsapp posts in their names and demanded money from the victims' acquaintances claiming helplessness. Several cases were filed under sections 43, 66, 66C of the Information Technology Act, 2000 along with IPC sections pertaining to cheating. Police said that they have already sent a few questions to Facebook asking them for leads in similar other cases. "We are now sending similar queries to Whatsapp authorities to help us with leads. The Whatsapp is often used by crooks as chats are more private in nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kp-watsapp-warning/articleshow/88097027.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Goa||‘Government open to calling Goa casino capital’||PANAJI: Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy said here on Saturday that “people have already given casino capital title to Goa” and the Centre was open to declaring it as the “casino capital of India” if it benefits the state. “If Goa benefits from it, we can definitely do it. But there is no need to do it. People have already given Goa that title,” he said in response to a question whether the Centre has plans to declare Goa as the casino capital of India. Reddy said people come to Goa for casinos. “They are either here or in Sikkim (both places were casinos are allowed),” he said in the presence of Union minister of state for tourism and North Goa MP Shripad Naik. Although Goa has six offshore casinos and a dozen onshore casinos in starred hotels, the state is yet to come out with a casino policy to regulate their operations. The offshore casinos are in the Mandovi, and the ports department is looking at alternative sites to relocate them but have failed to do so for years. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had launched an agitation against casinos ahead of the assembly elections in 2012. BJP had fought the election on the issue of removing offshore casinos from the Mandovi, but over the past 10 years despite running the government, the party has failed to relocate them. Every six months, the state government takes a decision to grant an extension to them to continue in the Mandovi. Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, in his election manifesto, had promised to move casinos out of the Mandovi within 100 days of getting elected, but later said that they were required in the river for the business community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/people-have-given-casino-capital-title-to-goa-union-tourism-min/articleshow/88097657.cms||---

He said that unauthorised construction around the historic monuments without the approval of ASI is wrong, and that action would be taken against those responsible for flouting norms. “I found that it has been built without ASI’s permission, (and) we will take action,” Reddy told reporters in Panaji. He added that Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar had informed him about the illegalities, based on which a probe was sought. “What happened is very wrong. The inquiry is on. I have asked ASI to form a special team to do the inquiry. We will definitely take action against... whoever it (may) be,” said Reddy. The Union minister said that domestic and international tourists come to Goa to admire the 15th and 16th century heritage structures that dot the state, including the churches at Old Goa. “We are aware that there are many heritage sites in Goa, and a lot of international travellers come here to see this heritage,” said Reddy. When asked if he agrees with the need to create buffer zones around protected sites and heritage zones, Reddy replied in the affirmative. “I am convinced of the issue and definitely this should not happen again,” said Reddy. The Union minister is in Goa to inaugurate a slew of tourism projects around the state and to unveil funding for art and cultural projects. Town and country planning minister Chandrakant Kavlekar recently asked the Old Goa panchayat to initiate necessary action and demolish the illegal house, built adjacent to the St Cajetan church in Old Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/special-asi-team-to-probe-construction-in-old-goa-union-min/articleshow/88097664.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Institutional quarantine for flyers from 3 African nations||MUMBAI: Amidst concerns over the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, the BMC on Friday released the standard operating procedure (SOP) for international travellers arriving from high- and at-risk countries in Mumbai. A senior civic official said whoever lands in Mumbai from high-risk countries—South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe—will have to undergo institutional quarantine, and those from at-risk countries must follow strict home quarantine for seven days in order to restrict spread of the virus in the public domain. At-risk countries include those in Europe, including the UK, Brazil, Bangladesh, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. Those who land in the city from at-risk countries and wish to continue their journey by road to either Pune or Nashik will also be monitored by the BMC. The SOP calls for these passengers who are under home quarantine to be dialled five times a day by the civic ward war rooms to monitor their health, issuance of letters to office bearers of housing societies where such passengers are under quarantine that no visitors be allowed in their homes, and in case any violation, notify the ward office. Also, ward war rooms have been directed to send medical teams with ambulances to verify whether the passengers are complying with home quarantine procedures. The SOP further mandates that a passenger under home quarantine undergo mandatory RT-PCR after the quarantine period is completed. “In case of appearance of any symptoms in the home quarantined passengers intimated from the WWR (ward war room), the health post team under MOH shall visit and shift said passengers for hospitalisation,” states the civic circular. BMC commissioner I S Chahal said, “The BMC has introduced a very unique and strict home quarantine monitoring mechanism for international passengers arriving in Mumbai from at-risk countries. It will be as effective as institutional quarantine. Our objective is to prevent the possible spread of the Omicron variant in Mumbai.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-institutional-quarantine-for-flyers-from-3-african-nations/articleshow/88097674.cms||Richa Pinto

The graduated included four PhD students. “I have taught many outstanding undergraduate, master and PhD students at MIT and earlier at Harvard University. I often saw some of them disappointed as they were too quick to buy into narrative of what constitutes success,” said Prof Banerjee. “We are often told that ‘if you don’t do this, you are a failure.’ It’s a delivered narrative and may not be your narrative… Follow what you believe to be right, what your mind and heart is saying.” He shared anecdotes from his growing up years and also professional career and said that his passion guided the life course even when he did not always know what he wanted or what lay ahead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/follow-what-you-believe-to-be-right-nobel-laureate-prof-abhijeet-banerjee-tells-ahmedabad-university-students/articleshow/88097052.cms||---

During the two-day questioning, officials, involved in the investigation, gathered that the socialite had been doing finance business, basically rotating money, for the last several years by taking money from some people promising high returns. Later, the accused used to give money to the needy on high interest rate. “Shilpa basically used to rotate money by taking money from people who have excess and give it to those who are in need of money. However, in the last several months, people who owe money to her failed to return it and this led to the accused defaulting on payments to the victims,’‘ a Cyberabad police officer told STOI. As part of the investigation, the socialite was taken to her house, where searches were conducted. As of now, police have received three complaints from people who have lent her Rs 7.05 cr. She allegedly dropped the name of a popular florist, accusing her of failure to return money. However, the florist reportedly told police that it was Shilpa who had to return her money. However, the florist till date did not lodge a complaint. The florist was yet to be called for questioning. Officials have written to the registration and stamps department to unearth the properties owned by Shilpa Chowdary and her family. After the completion of her questioning, she was produced before a magistrate, who sent her in judicial remand.

As the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) once again receives approximately 42% higher rates against the project cost after inviting the tenders, hiring a firm remains a challenge. The firm has quoted Rs 614 crore to construct the tower. An JDA official said, “Earlier, the re-tender was invited after the single firm has quoted Rs 479.44 crore to construct the tower which is 18% higher the scheduled rate. Now, it is difficult to award the work to a firm who has quoted nearly Rs 183 crore higher than the project cost.” As firms that participated in past to construct the 22-floor IPD tower having a helipad at the top failed to qualify, and firms in fray quoting high amount starting a construction remains a challenge. As per the previous plan, the entire project was proposed to be completed in 21 months. However, in the revised plan it is stated to complete the phase-1 in 21 months and phase-2 in 12 months.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: If Omicron wave is to come, it’ll take at least 6 weeks, say experts||MUMBAI: While the state’s first Omicron case has been detected in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, experts said it would take another six to eight weeks for an “Omicron wave”, if at all, to become apparent. The state health machinery is going to use the time to focus on vaccination. Additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said: “We will focus on quickly completing the vaccination process and ensuring that people follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, particularly proper wearing of face mask.” Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state government’s Covid task force, said: “There are too many unknowns with the Omicron variant at the moment. We shouldn't panic, but maintain a vigil. We have to study if Omicron in the next few weeks displaces the Delta variant (which caused the second wave in India) as the dominant variant in circulation.” He said the next six to eight weeks are crucial to see how the Omicron variant behaves in India, which has seen a wide exposure to the Delta variant. “Most Omicron cases are related to travel. We have to study clusters of cases in countries other than South Africa that may have developed after the first travel-related case. It will help us prepare,” added Dr Joshi. Another task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said that it has be back to the basics of tracing, testing and treating. “As we have seen previously, cases take a month or two to rise after a new variant is found to be in circulation,” he said. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that there is no cause for panic in Mumbai at the moment. “We have adequate medical infrastructure needed to handle any increase in cases we may see,” he said. Kalyan-Dombivli municpal commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi said people should observe social distancing and wear a mask outside home. “I have asked hotel associations and commercial establishments and unions to adhere all safety norms of wearing masks. Our civic teams will start fining those who fail to wear masks and shopkeepers and other establishments who will not follow Covid safety guidelines,” he said.

According to the records of the city police, as many as 1,00,090 persons have been arrested for the violation of Covid rules. The breaches include the failure to maintain social distancing, not wearing masks, and venturing out during curfew hours or while the lockdown was in force. The arrest figures cover the period from June 24, 2020, to December 3, 2021. This means that on average 191 people were arrested per day for violating Covid rules since the pandemic began. “We have registered 91,031 cases of Covid-rule violations which include cases for disobeying notifications, spreading infectious disease by negligence or intentionally, and assembling unlawfully,” said a police officer. “Some cases were filed under the provisions of the Disaster Management Act. In all, at least 1 lakh people have been arrested for various Covid-rule violations.” The officer said that most people were arrested for flouting curfew stipulations or for ignoring the social-distancing directive. “People still have the habit of roaming out at night and take pride in dodging the cops,” said a policeman. “But if caught, they give emotional excuses — such as their need to tend to an ill relative. But checks reveal that most people are lying.” Another common excuse is being delayed at a friend’s place. Some people have been booked for not paying mask fines. Police officers said that they will intensify the crackdown on the violations of Covid rules as the state prepares to tackle Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/arrests-for-flouting-covid-rules-cross-1-lakh-mark-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88097063.cms||---

Chief minister Pramod Sawant launched the policy on Saturday. “Fifty charging stations would be commissioned within three months,”Sawant said. The charging stations would be provided with 20% subsidy, Sawant said, adding that Goa would be the first state to implement the mobility policy The government will appoint Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) as the authority to issue permissions for installation of charging stations in public and private property. GEDA will advertise a list of concessional electric vehicle charging locations against which applications will be received by GEDA and licences will be granted to applicants after following due process. In case of multiple applications for any particular location, GEDA will award the concessional location to the applicant offering maximum fixed monthly contribution to Goa Decarbonisation Fund for the period of allotment. “If there is no operator coming forward for a particular location, GEDA, with the approval of the Tariff Committee, may offer a higher tariff for such locations,” a senior officer said. GEDA will establish a single window process within 30 days from the date of the policy’s publication for submission of applications. Till such time, GEDA, on receipt of application, will process it along with all documents received for necessary action. The officer said that adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) for daily commute is essential for a wide range of goals, including better air quality, reduced noise pollution, enhanced energy security, along with lowered carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. With vehicular pollution being a constant source of reduced air quality within the state, rapid adoption of zero-emission vehicles is of great importance, he said. The Goan economy is largely dependent on tourism as the annual arrival of visitors are almost five times that of the local population. The movement of these seasonal tourists is largely dependent on unorganised transportation, including taxis, motorcycles, ferry boats and rickshaws, the officer said. “High vehicle density in Goa leads to greater environmental impact due to higher Co2 emissions. Therefore, an affordable and efficient concessional public EV charging infrastructure is needed,” he added. The state also launched the Goa Electric Mobility Policy 2021 with the objective of adoption of electric vehicles to at least 30% by 2025. The policy aims to create 10,000 jobs in the sector by 2025.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-install-50-charging-stations-in-3-months-cm/articleshow/88097676.cms||Murari Shetye

The Waqf authorities on Friday reached the Paithan police station in Aurangabad rural for registering an offence against suspect land sharks for illegally demarcating a plot belonging to a Dargah and selling it off illegally. Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel said, “The land sharks have played a key role in all the scams. These properties are meant for the sustenance of poor, destitute, widows and orphans.” Newly appointed Waqf chairman and MLC Wajahat Mirza said, “We are not only getting the offences registered, but have also started taking concrete steps to reclaim Waqf properties in the state.” Two days ago, the Paithan police registered an offence against three suspects for demarcating over 28 acres of land belonging to Maulana Sahab Dargah and selling it off illegally.

---||Allahabad||Junior resident doctors’ strike continues||Prayagraj: Patient care was badly affected at SRN hospital of the city, on Saturday, as the junior residents continued with their strike. The junior doctors have joined the nationwide strike called to show the displeasure among the doctor fraternity for the delay in conducting the first year counseling for a year. A nationwide strike has been called by the Junior Doctors Association. Because of the strike, the patients, especially those coming from far flung areas, faced trouble for the first two hours of OPD. As the junior doctors blocked the passage of the hall, where the registration slip for OPD is issued, for two hours in the morning itself, lot many patients had to wait for getting registration slip and thus, showing their patients to the senior doctors. The junior doctors maintained that due to lack of counselling for one year, the load of first year students is falling on second and third year students. Due to this, the workload is increasing and although the association had raised the concern, but the government is not listening. When the senior doctor sat in the OPD, they could manage only to attend a few patients who came with old prescriptions, while there was a huge crowd of patients at the prescription counter. The protesting residents also took out a candle procession in the evening. The junior doctors gathered at SRN and raised their demand vigorously. The doctors said that this is a symbolic demonstration and if the demands are not accepted, the agitation will be further intensified and even emergency services would be stopped at SRN. “Our demands are justified as we are here to serve the patients and for this, we constantly work peacefully under pressure of work and when there was a nationwide strike, we joined our association. If the demand is not accepted, then the scope of the movement will be increased,” said Dr Sarvesh Pathak, office bearer of the Prayagraj unit of the association. However, at around 11am, the principal of MLN Medical College, Dr SP Singh, met the agitating junior residents and persuaded them to call off today’s protest. “It is true that the services were affected for some time, but later senior doctors attended the OPD and all were treated. OT also functioned normally,” said Dr Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/junior-resident-doctors-strike-continues/articleshow/88097054.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Weekly vaccination in Maharashtra rises by 100% in light of Omicron threat||The last week has seen over 100% surge in weekly vaccination in comparison to the beginning of November, with some private vaccination sites also reporting a spike in daily footfall and increased demand for Sputnik and Covishield. The week saw nearly 63.24 lakh doses being administered in the state, against less than 40 lakh weekly doses administered earlier in November. This has been the highest so far since the vaccination drive began in Maharashtra. A major reason for the surge was the fear of Omicron variant, stated the state health officials and hospitals’ authorities. State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI, “We are currently administering an average of 9 lakh jabs daily. This trend is taking us closer to completing all first doses by December-end, three months after which the entire population of eligible beneficiaries in the state is likely to be fully vaccinated. This means by March 2022, Maharashtra may achieve 100% full vaccination of all its eligible beneficiaries.” Another state public health department official said, “A major reason for an increase in the number of people coming forward to get the jabs this week is the fear of Omicron. It is prompting them to get their pending doses or first shots now. Some private vaccination centres have also reported a rise in daily vaccination, but the increase there is not as much as government sites because the latter still have ample doses.” A similar trend was noticed in the US, where vaccinations peaked at around 3.4 million per day, after reports of Omicron. Dr Madhav Chavan, managing director of Phoenix Hospital in Pune, said, “Daily vaccination has doubled for Covishield and Sputnik V, after reports of Omicron. Also, those who were delaying second doses are now coming forward to get the shot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-weekly-vaccination-in-state-rises-by-100-in-light-of-omicron-threat/articleshow/88097691.cms||Neha Madaan

General education minister V Sivankutty said many teachers of late have shed their vaccination hesitancy after the government warned them of consequences. The minister, however, did not divulge the details of the teachers as he had earlier claimed. “Those who have not taken Covid-19 vaccine on medical grounds should produce valid medical certificates to prove the same. They should submit such documents to the respective school authorities. Others will have to produce an RT-PCR certificate weekly. In case some teachers continue to remain unvaccinated, they would be asked to go on compulsory leave without salary,” Sivankutty said here on Saturday. The minister had earlier said that nearly 5,000 teachers and non-teaching staff have not taken the vaccine. To a question on why he has not revealed the teachers’ names as warned earlier, Sivakutty said many teachers have taken the vaccine in the recent days, and the government did not mean to demoralise or shame them publicly. The district-wise list of unvaccinated teachers released by the minister indicated that the largest number of unvaccinated teachers and non-teachers are in Malappuram, Kozhikode and Thrissur districts. While 184 teachers and 17 non-teaching staff in schools in Malappuram are unvaccinated, the number of teachers unvaccinated in Kozhikode is 136 and non-teaching staff is 15. As many as 103 teachers and 21 non-teaching staff in the Thrissur district are yet to receive vaccination. Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts have 89 and 87 unvaccinated teachers, respectively. Districts with the least number of unvaccinated teachers are Wayanad (25), Kasaragod (32), Idukki (36) and Pathanamthitta (40). The maximum number of unvaccinated teachers are in LP/UP and high schools (1,066). This is followed by 200 teachers in higher secondary and 229 teachers in vocational higher secondary schools. In total, 1,707 teachers and non-teaching staff in government and aided schools are unvaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/1495-teachers-212-staff-unvaccinated-minister/articleshow/88097075.cms||---

The state unit has now decided to organise a meeting on December 6, the death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar, at the Birla Auditorium to reactivate the party.The BSP is organising a major function after a long time and it will be attended by Akash Anand, Mayawati’s nephew, said state unit president Bhagwan Singh Baba.With the assembly elections just two years away, political activities in the state have gathered momentum. The main opposition, the BJP, which is a divided house, is trying to put its house in order with the Union home minister Amit Shah taking the lead. He will address party workers on Sunday to energise the party cadres for the task ahead.The workers’ meeting is a major event planned by the BSP as the party could not recover from the blow of defection of MLAs and has been fighting a legal battle to nullify the membership of the defected MLAs. The matter is still pending in the Supreme Court. The BSP is popular among the Jatavs and the Dalits in east Rajasthan.The ruling Congress was assiduously wooing the Dalits and it had inducted several leaders from the community in the ministry to send out a message. Thus, the BSP has its task cut out. However, Mayawati will not surrender her vote bank to the Congress easily as she was aggrieved over the defection of her party MLAs, engineered by chief minister Ashok Gehlot, even after her party extended unconditional support to the ruling party. This is the second time Gehlot facilitated the defection of all BSP MLAs to the Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-level-bsp-meet-tomorrow-to-boost-party-workers-morale/articleshow/88097688.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Today, we have good leader in form of chief minister Pramod Sawant,” he said Reddy inaugurated the Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts’ (IGNCA) regional centre at Sakhali, and said that it would benefit the culture. Sawant, among others, was present at the function. Reddy said that BJP has given the state a stable government and taken it on a development path. He also said that the Union government has decided to provide a free toilet to each and every household in the country. Sawant said that IGNCA indulges in various forms of art. He said the institute will conduct a study on Goa’s art, culture and history, and the presentation would be given at the Centre. “In the next five years, this institution will be made a world institute for exchange of culture,” he said. Reddy also said that it’s because of the countrywide vaccination programme that so many domestic tourists are visiting Goa. “Without vaccination, no tourist would have come to Goa,” he said, speaking at the launch of six tourism development projects at Fort Aguada. “The reason there are so many tourists here in Goa is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s desire to see all Indians vaccinated. Because they’re vaccinated, they feel safe.” Sawant, meanwhile, urged Reddy to grant approval for the phase-II tourist circuit which passes through Bicholim and Sattari talukas. He also said that after Panaji, the only other masterplan prepared is for Sakhali (his constituency).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-will-be-top-destination-ahead-of-nyc-nz-spore/articleshow/88097738.cms||---

In the latest case, the accused extorted Rs 30 lakh and also took a car worth Rs 21 lakh from a woman by blackmailing her. The 35-year-old woman works in the IT industry. An FIR was registered with the Central region cyber police station on December 2. The police arrested the accused, Yuvraj Bhosale, alias Rajevir alias Satish alias Virendra Bhosale, a Talegaon resident, near Pune. The accused has been booked for cheating, criminal intimidation, outraging the modesty of a woman, extortion among other sections. A team led by DCP Dr Rashmi Karandikar, which is probing the case, arrested Yuvraj at Talegaon. The complainant, a divorcee, told police that she had registered herself on a matrimonial site and a job portal as well. In September last year, she got a call from Yuvraj who asked her if she was looking for a job. Later, he befriended her and gained her trust. He had introduced himself as the son of an IPS officer, said the police. He later promised to marry her, said an officer. Police said that the accused took the woman’s objectionable pictures and blackmailed her. Moreover, he even demanded money from her. “Sometimes he said there was an IT raid going on at his place and he needed money. Another time, he asked for money, saying his mother had been admitted to hospital in ICU,” said an officer. He had threatened the woman to make her photos public and post them on social media. The woman had taken a loan too to pay to the accused due to his constant threats. The police have found that 11 cases, mostly of cheating women, have been registered against him in the state. “During our probe, we found 10 more women whom he has cheated. We appeal to people to lodge complaints at their nearest police station if they have been cheated,” said Karandikar. She said the accused claims to have studied BA (criminal psychology) and LLB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-41-year-old-mingles-with-singles-extorts-rs-30l-from-one-zips-off-in-anothers-car/articleshow/88097705.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Jaipur||‘Focus on panchayat polls, don’t come to December 12 rally’||JAIPUR: The shifting of the Congress’s mega rally against inflation on December 12 from Delhi to Jaipur may have enthused the party workers, but it also brought an unexpected windfall for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) it has been arranged on the day when the panchayat elections in four districts are scheduled. Panchayat elections in Baran, Kota, Karouli, and Sri Ganganagar are scheduled on December 12. Realising this coincidence, PHED minister Mahesh Joshi on Saturday appealed to the party workers of the poll-bound districts not to come for the rally and focus on elections in their districts. The party has performed well in the bypolls and panchayat polls held recently and it wants to continue its success in these four districts, Joshi said. The Congress party shifted its rally after the party was denied permission by the Delhi governor citing pollution and Covid conditions. The party decided to shift the venue to Jaipur’s Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium, which is close to Delhi and it is a state which is ruled by the party. About a lakh workers from neighbouring Haryana and Punjab are expected to attend the rally. It is a prestige show for the party, especially because not only some party leaders, even some other leaders in the opposition camp like West Bengal chief minister Mamta Banerjee have been questioning the potency of the Congress to lead the charge against the BJP. The state unit is leaving no stone unturned to make the rally a big hit. Ministers, MLAs, and frontal organisations were given targets to mobilise maximum workers on the day of the event, which is being attended by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, and other tall leaders from north India. The chief minister, Ashok Gehlot, has himself taken the reigns of organising the rally and making it a success story to further enhance his standing in the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/focus-on-panchayat-polls-dont-come-to-dec-12-rally/articleshow/88097707.cms||---
---||Kochi||Navy’s skills, ops capabilities on show||Kochi: The backwaters facing Rajendra Maidan on Saturday witnessed the breathtaking display of skills and operational capabilities of the Indian Navy’s men and machines as the Southern Naval Command (SNC) conducted the annual Operations Demonstrations (Op Demo) as part of the Navy Week 2021 celebrations. Naval personnel, including the elite special forces unit marine commandos (MARCOS) and the Navy’s sea/air assets took part in the 90-minute demo providing the public with an insight into the force’s operations. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan was the chief guest of the event, which was hosted by Vice Admiral MA Hampiholi, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, SNC. The event was attended by several civilian dignitaries including Kochi Metro Rail Ltd managing director Loknath Behera, Kochi corporation mayor M Anil Kumar, among others. The naval personnel and families and retired defence personnel too were present. The demonstration commenced with MARCOS carrying out a simulated combat beach reconnaissance and assault operation, using inflatable watercrafts called Gemini. This was followed by a flypast of 13 naval aircraft. These included four Dorniers and three each advanced light helicopter (Dhruv), Chetak and Seaking 42 B, which flew in various formations. The Seaking, which is known as flying frigates, showed its cargo lifting capability when one of the choppers flew past carrying a jeep. Also, a sailpast by naval ships INS Kochi, an indigenously-built guided missile destroyer named after Kochi city, and INS Shardul was held. They simulated firing of guns and performed helicopter landings on the deck of moving ships. Other ships of the navy including sailing vessel INS Tarangini, INS Sarvekshak, INS Sujata and fast-attack crafts INS Kabra and INS Kalpeni also took part in the event. The event demonstrated special operations by MARCOS from air and water; simulation of VBSS (visit, board, search and seizure) operations which showed the commandos entering a ‘hijacked vessel’ and ‘arresting’ the pirates. The helobatics by Dhruv and Chetak helicopters while demonstrating the SAR (search and rescue) missions was another highlight of the event. The commandos were seen slithering down the ropes from helicopters to rescue the ‘victims’ using winches and rescue baskets. The main attraction of the evening was the fast-paced operations undertaken by the MARCOS, who displayed stealthy insertion into the enemy area using helicopters and Geminis to undertake the demolition of an offshore enemy installation using explosives. In addition, the specially-trained Labrador Retriever sniffer dog of the Indian Navy’s explosive ordnance disposal team demonstrated its capability of detecting an explosive device, which was then safely disposed using a robotic device. A continuity drill performed by 30-men contingent from INS Dronacharya, the naval gunnery school, stood out for its skills in weapon handling. The display concluded with a Beating Retreat by the SNC naval band and the ceremonial sunset ceremony. All naval ships were illuminated and sailed past at the end of the event. Earlier in the day, governor Khan addressed the SNC personnel on the contemporary topic ‘secularism’ - in the context of Constitution, it’s position and relevance and thanked them for their support to state and district administration in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic and assistance in various HADR operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/navys-skills-ops-capabilities-on-show/articleshow/88097099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kanpur||Omicron-driven third wave likely early 2022: IIT-Kanpur professor||KANPUR: If the available statistics of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron, is taken into account, it is likely that it would spread in the country and the third wave could set in early months of next year, Dr Manindra Agarwal, professor in the department of computer science engineering at IIT-Kanpur, tells Abhinav Malhotra. Excerpts: Q: Is the Omicron variant of coronavirus deadlier than the Delta variant? Can it bypass natural and vaccine immunity?A: Nothing concrete can be said about this as of now. The indications so far suggest that the Omicron variant of coronavirus spreads faster than the Delta variant. But, is this variant deadlier than the Delta variant, meaning will more people be needing hospitalisation (due to Omicron), cannot be commented upon now because the data which has emerged from South Africa and some other countries, all those people there infected with Omicron, have mild infection and are not severely infected. Q: Will there be a third wave of Covid in India? When is it likely to commence?A: Chances are very high that Omicron would spread in our country and since it is known to spread faster than the Delta variant, it would spread. So, if we believe that it (Omicron) has started to spread, then it could be said that the third wave could set in the early months of next year and reach its peak after which it would gradually subside. But it appears that the third wave would not be as lethal as the second wave of Covid. Q: Will Omicron impact India harder than the Delta variant?A: As per initial reports, it is being believed that Omicron can bypass the immunity developed after getting vaccinated, but this is yet to be substantiated. The symptoms for this infection (Omicron) suggest that it is not able to bypass the natural immunity (the immunity developed in people after they contracted Covid-19) developed in people. If this is true, then it appears that Omicron will not have much impact on the Indian population because almost 80% people in India have developed natural immunity against Covid. Other than this, a large population here (India) has got vaccinated. If these two aspects are kept in mind, it seems Omicron won’t be able to make much impact on Indian people. Keeping all statistics in view, it does not appear that there would be high demand for oxygen or hospital beds like it happened during the second wave. The symptoms that we see now suggest that there may not be high demand for oxygen. But, it is important that one should remain extra vigilant. Wear a mask because a mask can prevent a person from getting infected. Those who have not got themselves vaccinated, should take the jab as early as possible. Those who have taken only the first dose, should hurry up and complete their vaccination course.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/third-wave-of-covid-19-due-to-omicroncan-set-in-early-next-year-iit-k-expert/articleshow/88097731.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

But if golf courses and marinas are set up here, we will have the best of tourism in Goa. We now have tourists who come here, stay for seven days, sometimes even live on the streets, and go.” Alemao, who was visibly annoyed on noticing that names of local panchayat members were missing from the inauguration name plaques, openly chastised the tourism department officials for what he said was something that was “just not done.” “I am the MLA here, and this causes harm to me (sic),” he said, addressing Reddy. He also expressed his displeasure over the failure of the tourism department in taking him into confidence while building the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-needs-golf-course-marinas-says-churchill/articleshow/88097735.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Excise department reduces penalty for liquor vendors||JAIPUR: Agreeing to the demands of agitating liquor traders, the excise department has provided relief in penalty and guarantee targets. The department has reduced the targets from 50% to 35% for shopkeepers to purchase Rajasthan Made Liquor (RML). A liquor trader said, "Earlier, there was a mandatory target of purchasing 65% stock of country-made liquor and 35% stock of RML. If the stock was not sold, the shopkeeper had to pay the difference amount to excise." Also, relief has been provided on interests and taxes to those shopkeepers, who have failed to meet the guarantee targets in the last three months. The traders, who have not been able to meet the target of selling in April, May, and June, will be benefited. Nilesh Mewara, president of the Raj Liquor Welfare Society, said, " We welcome the excise department’s move as it would provide relief to the traders. The government should also consider our other demands including, removal of the rider on purchase and permission to surrender the shops." Liquor traders had earlier, also raised the demand to let the shops remain open till 10 pm. At present, the shops are allowed to open till 8 pm. The shop owners also demanded a decrease in the number of shops. "After the number of shops increased, the margins have reduced. The shopkeepers are facing stiff competition as there are several shops allotted in one locality," added another trader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/excise-dept-reduces-penalty-for-liquor-vendors/articleshow/88097729.cms||---

---||Kanpur||Woman commits suicide after killing her three children||Kanpur: In a heart wrenching incident, a woman allegedly killed her three children and committed suicide, in Kulpahar Police area of Mahoba district, on Saturday morning. The deceased have been identified as Sonam (35), Vishal (11), Aarti (9) and Anjali (7). The police rushed to the spot and started investigation by taking possession of the dead bodies of the mother and her three children. According to the police, the shocking incident took place in the Katwaria locality, under the Kulpahar police station, where one Kalyan Singh used to live with his wife Sonam, and three children, son Vishal and, daughters Aarti and Anjali. Kalyan used to earn his livelihood by taking care of the family by working as a daily-wager and farming on a small piece of agricultural land. On Friday, after having dinner, he went to irrigate the fields. When he returned home on the next morning (Saturday), the door of the house was found to be closed. He repeatedly knocked the door, but getting no response for a long time, either from his wife or children, he went to his roof through the neighbor’s house. On entering the house, he found his wife Sonam hanging on the noose in the room and the blood-stained body of their son Vishal was lying nearby. The bodies of daughters, Aarti and Anjali, were found with their throat slit and covered with a quilt, on a cot. On this, Kalyan alerted the neighbours, who informed the police. The police rushed to the spot and initiated investigations. When the police searched, a broken sickle with blood stains was recovered from the room. Circle Officer Sadar Tej Bahadur Singh, questioned the people around and Singh. CO said that prima facie, it appears that after killing the children by slitting their throats, the woman committed suicide by hanging herself. “The exact cause of the incident is being ascertained and we are working on all possible angles,” said CO further. During further interrogation, it came to fore that Kalyan’s wife used to doubt Kalyan’s fidelity. “The locals told investigators that Sonam had doubts about the faithfulness of her husband towards her. She felt that her husband Kalyan was having an affair with another woman. Due to this, she often used to quarrel with him as well,” said the official further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/woman-commits-suicide-after-killing-her-three-children/articleshow/88097726.cms||---

"It has been established that the accused Param Bir Singh through arrested accused (dismissed API) Sachin Waze and other accused extorted bookies, hotel and bar owners across Mumbai by threatening to arrest them in crimes and raiding their establishments," said the chargesheet submitted by special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap. A witness, ACP Sanjay Patil, allegedly said that during a meeting with hotel and bar owners, Waze had said that No. 1, meaning Singh, had given him a target of collecting Rs 2 crore daily. The witness said "Number 1" was Singh. The chargesheet said witnesses have said Waze was a special aide of Singh. "In the police department, the police commissioner is the topmost official.

The witness said Waze told him Singh had instructed him to make collections from all bookies across Mumbai. The chargesheet also invoked three new charges against the accused, including criminal conspiracy. This was done in light of the statement of a witness from whom Rs 35 lakh was extorted by Waze. The witness, Manan Nayak, alleged that he paid up Rs 35 lakh in October 2020 to another accused, Alpesh Patel, at Waze’s behest after he was threatened to be implicated in a criminal case relating to bookies. “Fearing he will be falsely implicated in a bookie case, he told his friend Bimal Agarwal about it. When Agrawal spoke to Waze, he told him there was a lot of pressure from CP Param Bir Singh, the witness will be arrested or will have to cough up Rs 2 crore,” the witness said. Later, it was decided that Nayak would pay Rs 35 lakh. The chargesheet said it was established on August 31, 2020, Waze had conducted a meeting on extorting bookies at crime branch, Unit 11, Kandivli (West). Statements of five bar owners are included in the chargesheet. They said they were present at he meeting, and that money was being collected for Number 1. Witness Mahesh Shetty and two others said that Number 1 was the police commissioner.

Statements of five key witnesses, including ACP Sanjay Patil, were recorded before the magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Three witnesses, among whom were the cashier and manager of complainant Bimal Agarwal's Andheri- based BCB Bar and Restaurant, said in December 2020, accused Sumit Singh and absconding accused Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhati came to the hotel claiming to be Waze and Singh’s men. The accused said if they wanted to run the restaurant smoothly, they would have to pay good luck money of Rs 2 lakh and monthly Rs 1.5 lakh. Another witness is police officer Kedari Pawar, part of the property cell where the case against a bookie was registered. He said Waze called him to the CIU office. The witness said in that meeting in front of Agarwal, Waze said “CP Saheb” had given him a target for collection from bookies. The witness alleged Waze told him Manan Nayak was named. The witness claimed on October 4 or 5, 2020, Waze called him to office and told him a settlement was finalised with Nayak and Rs 35 lakh paid to Alpesh Patel.  Jagtap told the court, “Param Bir Singh committed a heinous act of extortion and the protection under the Criminal Procedure Code cannot be extended to him.” Waze is in custody in the Antilia bomb scare case.

It was only during the recording of supplementary statement, the complainant had admitted to the theft of Rs 50 lakh. “We have made recoveries of cash and gold worth around Rs 6 crore. We expect the heist could be more than Rs 15 crore. Since ED too has started the investigations, their reports will further clear the picture,” a senior STF official said while confirming that ED has started the investigations as well. STF has recovered cash worth Rs 3.90 crore, USD amounting to 48,37,500 ( Around Rs 2 crore) and Gold bricks weighing three kg having value of 15,02,100. This recovery has been made from two persons apprehended by STF soon after taking over the case. Case was registered in August this year.

CIA staff had arrested seven persons, who included four employees and three associates of a gangster and could recover an amount of around Rs 2 lakh only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gurgaon-heist-stf-spills-the-beans-cops-dcp-under-scanner/articleshow/88097736.cms||Manvir Saini

The directorate of health services has also sought an explanation from the Kozhikode DMO, Dr Ummer Farook, on the statements made in the news conference on Friday and sources said that Dr Farook has already submitted his explanation. The directive issued by director of health department Dr V R Raju states that if there is a need to reveal any important or crucial information, it must be shared with the permission of the department, after ensuring the authenticity of the information. It further states that under no circumstances such ‘acts’ should be done without acquiring prior consent. “A fact has come to attention that in many cases the news that are reaching the public are not authentic. Such non-authentic news can create misunderstandings about the work of the department among the public and cause harm to the reputation of the department. In these circumstances, all DMOs and staff are directed to maintain utmost care while sharing information publicly and are supposed to share information after taking prior permission,” the note issued by the director stated. Meanwhile, the samples of a 22-year-old Tamil Nadu native who had arrived at Karipur airport from Germany on Friday and was later tested Covid positive was also sent for genome sequencing test to check if she is infected with the Omicron variant.

The samples were sent for genome sequencing as part of the guidelines issued by the central government. The Kozhikode DMO had said that the UK returnee and his mother had only mild symptoms and that the UK returnee had taken three doses of Pfizer vaccine. This person had travelled by train to four districts before he tested positive, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/seek-nod-to-pass-on-info-to-public-govt-to-dmos/articleshow/88097106.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat High Court quashes 2017 FIR against Hardik Patel for unauthorized rally||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court quashed a criminal case lodged against Congress leader and former convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), Hardik Patel. He was accused of acting in violation of a notification promulgated by the competent authority by taking out a rally in December 2017 ahead of the assembly elections. In this case, the authority had refused permission to two associates of Patel for a rally on December 10, 2017. Patel carried out the rally with cars and motorcycles without permission in Bopal, Ghuma, Shilaj and Bhadaj areas in western Ahmedabad. Patel and a few others were booked by Bopal police under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for violation of an order promulgated by an additional district magistrate. A chargesheet was filed against the accused and the case was pending since 2018. Anand Yagnik, the advocate appearing for Patel, argued that police cannot lodge an FIR under Section 188 of the IPC because provisions of Section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) bar police from registering an FIR under this section and filing a chargesheet. It was submitted that the officer concerned needed to personally file a complaint before a judicial magistrate for disobedience of a government notification. In this case, the police did not make any complaint before the magistrate and instead registered an FIR, which is not permissible. The state government vehemently opposed Patel’s quashing petition. After hearing the case, Justice Gita Gopi on Wednesday quashed the FIR lodged at Bopal police station and chargesheet filed before the judicial magistrate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-high-court-quashes-2017-fir-against-hardik-patel-for-unauthorized-rally/articleshow/88097109.cms||---

The Aam Aadmi Party will begin a door-to-door membership campaign from Sunday, hoping to win enough support among Delhi residents to win the municipal elections likely to be held early next year. At a function organised at the AAP headquarters on Saturday, attended by party workers from across the capital, Sisodia asserted that AAP was not a party, but a movement and asked the party workers to work tirelessly to win the municipal elections. He claimed that AAP wanted to transform Delhi into a clean capital. “Every AAP member must have the drive to make these dreams come true, to make Delhi shine. For this, we have to first dislodge the corrupt BJP from the corporations,” said Sisodia. Rai elaborated, “As part of this campaign, we have to go to every street, lane, booth, ward, mandal, assembly. We have to go to every corner in Delhi and let people know that just the way they chose Arvind Kejriwal to eradicate corruption in government, the time has now come for the corporations. We can improve everything in Delhi. We give free water, free electricity, we installed CCTVs, yet when people opened their doors, they see garbage and its sours their mood. We have to take up this responsibility of making Delhi a better capital city.” As for the dismal 2017 municipal election results, Rai said AAP did not have any experience in fighting municipal elections then. “What we learnt was that if we want Delhi to shine, cleanliness is of utmost importance. That is why we are launching this MCD Badlaav Campaign,” said Rai. With three months for poll preparations, AAP workers are all gung-ho. “We have December, January and February to prepare for the polls,” said Rai. “We will organise day-long membership camps at every booth and mandal. At the booth level, our teams will go door-to-door to make people pledge a change in the corporations, make them shareholders in this great campaign of change. You have to work three days at the same booth and get at least 300 members from each booth. Our target is to enrol 50 lakh people as members of AAP in the coming three months.” To encourage the assembled party workers, Rai told them that many of them were probable candidates for the municipal elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-kicks-off-campaign-to-make-delhi-a-clean-capital/articleshow/88097122.cms||AlokKNMishra

Singh informed the state director general of police about it via email, sources said. It is learnt that he had sent two mails informing about his trip and left before he was granted permission. The suspension order had stated his headquarters will be the office of the state DGP and he will not leave it without the DGP’s permission. Singh had been hiding in Chandigarh for months after Mumbai police began looking for him in connection with the cases of extortion registered against him here. They had even visited his known address in Chandigarh to serve non-bailable warrants but returned empty-handed. It was even suspected he had fled the country before his lawyer told the Supreme Court on November 22 he was in hiding as he feared a threat to his life. After the SC granted him protection from arrest, Singh landed in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singh-leaves-mumbai-for-chandigarh-for-legal-work/articleshow/88097751.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt completes drone survey in Cheruvally Estate||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government has completed the drone survey in Cheruvally Estate, identified as the proposed site for the upcoming Sabarimala airport project. The survey by the consultant Louis Berger Consulting Private Limited, covered 1,450 hectares, including the proposed location for the project. "The drone survey has been completed, and once the documents are prepared on the basis of the survey, the matter will be processed for submitting it to the ministry of civil aviation,” Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) MD M G Rajamanickam said. The techno economic feasibility and social impact assessment reports for the project initiated in 2017 were conducted by the same consultant have been submitted to the Centre. The government has also appointed KSIDC as the nodal agency for implementing the project. After the reports were submitted by the state to the ministry of civil aviation, it had raised certain queries regarding the project. Quoting the observations of the director general of civil aviation, the ministry of civil aviation had sought certain clarifications from the government while considering the application for project clearance. The government has submitted clarifications to the Centre and the nod is expected soon. The social impact assessment study and soil test are yet to be conducted conducted due to pending litigations on possession of the designated land. As per the environmental impact assessment report prepared by the consultant earlier, the proposed site will require a considerable amount of preparatory work to make it suitable for the project. A preliminary analysis of the site topography had indicated that the existing elevation of the site varies from 40m-170m. Also, though the proposed project does not fall within the 10km radius of the eco-sensitive boundary of Periyar Tiger Reserve, as the final notification of the eco-sensitive zone is yet to be published, a recommendation from the national board for wildlife may be required for the project. It has also been estimated that 130 structures and five common property resources (approximately) will be impacted, including a church, a temple, a mosque and a hospital. The airport– which is estimated to have 800 passengers during peak hour by 2029-30 and 1,850 passengers during peak hour by 2049-50 – is expected to break even only in 60 years, said the consultant. This raises several questions on the economic viability of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-completes-drone-survey-in-cheruvally-estate/articleshow/88097127.cms||KP Saikiran

Though police reached these two cities, she could not be traced. She had not taken her ATM card or mobile phone but only some clothes. A special team under the district police chief R Viswanadh was formed and headed by Alathur DSP K A Devasya.

The Hisar health department had come to know about the matter about five months ago, but a case was registered in this regard only on Friday. All 18 fake birth certificates have been issued in the CRS ID of CHC Siswal and CHC Uklana of Hisar district. Hisar police said that the Uklana police station has registered a case on the complaint of the additional district registrar (ADR) of births and death against unknown persons under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66-C (identity theft) and 66-D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the IT Act. In the complaint to the police, ADR said that the chief registrar of birth and death certificates and the director general of health department informed through a letter on July 30 that around 18 fake birth certificates have been generated by some unknown person after stealing the password of the CRS (combined reporting system) IDs of and the CHC Siswal and CHC Uklana and the respective registrars. Copies of all fake birth certificates and details have also been given to the district health department. After this, the department gave a complaint to the Hisar police in the month of August, 2021 and asked them to conduct a full investigation through the cyber cell about the persons by whom the birth certificates were made. On this complaint, the police have now registered a case. The investigation of the case has been handed over to ASI Pradeep Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/18-fake-birth-certificates-generated-in-hisar-after-health-dept-site-hacked/articleshow/88097748.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt to argue in SC that case against Param Bir Singh predates his ‘letter bomb’||MUMBAI: The state government is set to argue in the Supreme Court that one of the key complaints against former police commissioner Parambir Singh pre-dated his “letter bomb” against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. This will be one its responses to counter Singh’s case in the Supreme Court alleging a state conspiracy against him and seeking a transfer of his cases outside the state. Singh had moved the SC in May alleging that multiple inquiries had been initiated against him in the state as part of a conspiracy to frame him for levelling corruption allegations against Deshmukh. He argued that the purpose of the conspiracy was to make him withdraw the allegations. The state will highlight that former police inspector Anup Dange had written to the state home secretary in February 2021, levelling grave corruption charges against Singh, sources say. Dange’s complaint is being probed by the anti-corruption bureau. Singh’s letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, though, accusing the former home minister of corruption was written on March 20, 2021. Hence, the probe into Dange’s complaint could not have been a conspiracy to frame Singh, the state is likely to argue. Dange had alleged that Singh had demanded Rs 2 crore to reinstate him after his suspension in 2019. He had also alleged that Singh had suspended him when he acted against a bar owner who kept his establishment open beyond the stipulated time. The state will also point out that one of the key inquiries against Singh by the state has already been concluded. The state had asked the then additional chief secretary Debashish Chakraborty to inquire into whether Singh had violated service rules. The inquiry report has already been submitted to the state government and was among the grounds for Singh’s suspension. The state is also expected to point out that Singh had informed the Chandiwal Commission, which was probing his allegations against Deshmukh, that he had no evidence to offer and that his charges were based on hearsay. This being the case, how could the state government be accused of hatching a conspiracy to make him withdraw the allegations against Deshmukh, the state is expected to argue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-to-argue-in-sc-that-case-against-former-cp-predates-his-letter-bomb/articleshow/88097753.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

On November 30, the panchayat issued a stop work notice to the parties involved in the construction on the river front near Arch of Viceroy and Largo de St Cajetan, a heritage monument. In the notice, which was issued after the panchayat met and adopted a resolution in that regard, sarpanch Janita Madkaikar had cited violation of Coastal Regulations Zone (CRZ) as per the permission granted by the authorities. Though the sarpanch was not available for comment, a panch, Vishal Volvoikar said that a response from the parties to the notice is awaited. “The panchayat will meet shortly to decide the future course of action and legal opinion is being sought,” he said. The panchayat has sought an explanation from the parties regarding its move to revoke the construction licence dated November 14, 2016 and renewal licence dated October 4, 2019. Following a series of protests and satyagraha opposite Basilica of Bom Jesus at Old Goa, the TCP revoked the technical clearance for the project. The committee stated on Saturday that they will continue their satyagraha till the illegal structure is demolished. Architect Tahir Noronha of SOGAC said that protesters will carry on the hunger strike till a demolition order is issued. He said that the TCP’s letter to Old Goa panchayat simply directs the body to take necessary action in accordance with Goa Panchayati Raj Act. According to Section66(3) of the Act, the panchayat may revoke the construction licence and issue notice for demolition, he told reporters. “The panchayat’s notice gives owners of the land and builders seven days to respond as to why the construction licence has to be revoked? This clearly indicates that the panchayat has initiated action on revocation and not demolition,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goa-protests-continue-as-activists-await-panchayats-demolition-order/articleshow/88097769.cms||---

However, there is still a lot of scope to improve this accuracy, said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD, during an interaction on national weather services organized as part of Intromet-21. Replying to TOI’s query on accuracy of extreme weather events, he said that IMD and ministry of earth sciences (MoES) is working to improve the modelling and observational systems to increase the accuracy of forecasting systems. “While there is more accuracy in cyclone prediction as it is a larger system and a lot of R&D has gone into developing it, there has been a lot of improvement in the accuracy of heavy rainfall warning from around 50% in 2014 to 77% in 2020,” he added. The IMD chief said that the district rainfall forecasting needs to be improved because it is not the same in all places. “We have introduced district-level forecasting three years ago and are also now issuing impact-based forecasts. This accuracy varies from season to season and parameters too. Like we can accurately predict temperature rise but with heavy rainfall during monsoon season, especially mesoscale events, it is comparatively less.” Speaking of the deaths caused by thunderstorms and lightning, he said that it is not because of lack of proper warnings, but because people seem to ignore them as they have to go outside for work, especially farmers. “We will have to work on outreach and awareness on the dangers of thunderstorms. We are almost accurate in those warnings. From 2019, IMD started issuing thunderstorm lightning warnings, the accuracy is about 88% in the before-three-hours alerts. Efforts are on to augment the weather monitoring network. From four Doppler radars in 2006, the country now has 30 Doppler radars. Another 26 radars will be set up in 2-3 years covering the entire country,” he said. On demand from the fishermen community for regional warnings, he said the IMD is issuing warnings for deep-sea fishermen in local languages. Some states have developed mobile apps for the warning while at sea. IMD, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and Isro are also jointly involved in issuing these warnings to states that pass it on to the civic authorities. “INCOIS is planning to come up with a small-craft advisory for boats with outboard engines. We have been taking the concerns of the stakeholders seriously and proposing to come up with an impact-based warning system which will specifically tell which boats can go and which cannot. These are in a testing phase and will be boat-specific, differentiating between traditional fishing boats and deep-sea boats,” said Balakrishnan Nair, group director, INCOIS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/work-on-to-improve-accuracy-of-weather-warnings-imd/articleshow/88097136.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

In a letter to Bijnor district magistrate (DM) Umesh Mishra, the executive engineer, Vikas Agarwal, stated: "This was part of restructuring of an old and damaged road and only an initial level of laying work was done. The real work was to begin for which the MLA was invited for inauguration. The allegation that a coconut broke the road is totally false. A spade was used to scrape off the road portion." The executive engineer termed the entire episode uncalled for. He requested the DM to get a probe done from a different agency. "The local MLA had expressed dissatisfaction with the thickness and quality of the road. The coating was removed with a shovel at one place," he added. The BJP MLA, however, continued to level corruption charges against the contractor and irrigation authorities. She alleged, "The road was to be built by a hot-mixing machine. But, it was being constructed manually. Apart from this, sub-standard materials were being used. The road costs Rs 1.64 crore, but officials showed Rs 1.16 crore. The irrigation officials are hand in glove with the contractor. Our government has made the state corruption-free.." She added, "The guilty officers must be punished. An SIT should be constituted to investigate the matter. I have written a letter to district magistrate Umesh Mishra and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to bring the matter to their notice." The inauguration ceremony of the under-construction road in Bijnor district went horribly wrong, turning into a major embarrassment for the BJP MLA who had been invited to do the honours, when the "coconut-cracking ritual left the drupe intact but broke the road instead". The legislator from Bijnor who was there for the road-opening, stopped the event, sat on dharna for three hours and demanded action against those responsible for what she called a "grave misdemeanor". She declared she wouldn't budge from her protest until officers came to the site to take samples of the road, investigated and booked the culprits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/irrigation-dept-at-loggerheads-with-mla-says-road-broken-by-spade-not-coconut/articleshow/88096475.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Chandigarh||Only 11% of recycled water used in green belts, parks||Gurgaon: The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is stepping up efforts to ensure that only recycled wastewater is used to maintain green belts and parks in the city. Five sewage treatment plants (STPs) generate 223 million litres a day (MLD) recycled water in the city at present. Out of this, only 103 MLD (46%) is used in horticulture, irrigation, the textile industry and construction, according to GMDA officials. This includes 25 MLD, or around 11.2% of the total recycled water, for horticulture purposes. The rest is released into drains. According to officials, GMDA chief executive officer Sudhir Rajpal emphasised that more recycled water should be used to maintain green areas in the city and directed officials in this regard in a meeting held earlier this week. At present, of the three parks that fall under the metropolitan authority’s jurisdiction, recycled water is being used at two, while potable water is being used at Tau Devi Lal park. “The only reason fresh water is being used to maintain that park is because there is no line over there through which we can source recycled water. Approval has now been given to set up this connection and, once it is set up, recycled water will be used for its maintenance,” a senior GMDA official said. While the green belts in the city are maintained using recycled water, officials say this is transported to the sites using tankers filled up at GMDA’s sewage treatment plants (STPs). Now, however, the authority is working towards installing water hydrants in green belts across Gurgaon. “The tender has been planned and an estimate is ready for the project. We will be taking lateral connections from the master sewer line, which is linked to STPs, and use them to install hydrants in green belts. This will ensure that there is enough water in these areas so that there is more greenery, and dust pollution is also reduced,” the official said. Officials said GMDA will also be working with the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) for maintenance of the latter’s green belts, parks and community centres using recycled water. “We are planning to create connections wherever the GMDA master lines are laid, which will enable the corporation to maintain its parks, ponds, green belts and community centres using recycled water,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/only-11-of-recycled-water-used-in-green-belts-parks/articleshow/88097757.cms||Sakshi Dayal

Filing a complaint of rape and breach of trust on Friday, the woman told police: “My mother-in-law ran a marriage bureau and I helped her out. In 2018, Jamshedkhan Pathan, 25, approached us as a client. Initially, we called each other to discuss suitable marriage proposals. Gradually, we became friends. Meanwhile, due to some dispute, my husband left me.” She claimed that Pathan promised to marry her and accept her four-year-old daughter in August 2019. “The same month, he took me on a pilgrimage to Ajmer where he raped me in a hotel. In February 2020, he raped me at a hotel in Paldi. When I raised the issue of marriage, he dumped me.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 23 people duped of lakhs in Goregaon ATM fraud||MUMBAI: In a span of three hours on November 27, 22 customers of a nationalised bank who had their accounts in the Goregaon (west) branch were duped of a total of Rs2.24 lakh by a fraudster who withdrew money from the ATM without them sharing any details. Two days later one more person, a senior administrative officer with BEST training school, Sudash Sawant, approached the police with a similar plaint. In the case of a BEST official, he lost Rs 2.7 lakh in 29 fraudulent withdrawals between November 11 and November 22 but realised it later. All the fraudulent withdrawals were made between 7.30pm and 10.30pm, the police said. Cops suspect that the fraudster, using a skimming device attached to the ATM machine, captured the card details, made clones of the cards and withdrew the money. A card skimmer reads the magnetic strip on the card and stores the card number. Sawant said, “Total 29 fraudulent transactions have taken place from my account. I received a few text messages from the bank which went unnoticed as it was delayed due to a network issue. I was in a state of shock when I realised the fraudulent withdrawals. The bank officials did not show any urgency to solve the case. I don’t know whether I will get the money back.” Similarly, another victim Mahadev Thavi (62), a carpenter, lost Rs6,600. “When I arrived at the Goregaon police station, 22 other bank customers were already present there to complain. The victims said they are worried about their money. However, a senior bank official told TOI, “We have not received any complaints from either the customers or the branches. Even the police have not approached us for CCTV footage or customers’ account details. Our bank has a three-layer security system to prevent frauds. If such fraud has happened using the cloned card, it is unclear how the fraudster got hold of the pin.” There have been similar cases in the past. In February 2018, at least 50 people were cheated of Rs9.11 lakh in a case of card cloning. The police suspected the involvement of an inter-state gang who fitted skimming devices and cameras in an ATM of a private bank on Charni Road (West). In June 2013, cyber-thieves stole bank data of several Mumbaikars by skimming an ATM at the state police headquarters. The ATM belonged to a private bank, which has the salary accounts of police personnel. The bank credited the stolen amounts back to the accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-23-people-duped-of-lakhs-in-goregaon-atm-fraud/articleshow/88097780.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The accident occurred while the family was on their way to Jizan from Jubail. The deceased have been identified as Muhammed Jabir (48) of Beypore, his wife Shabna (36), and children Laiba (7), Saha (5) and Lutfi (3). According to sources, Jabir was transferred to Jizan in southwestern Saudi Arabia and the accident occurred when they were shifting to their new home in the port city. Social workers and relatives came to know about the accident when the vehicle with the household goods that started before them reached the destination and Jabir and his family did not. Jabir had left Jubail on Friday with his family and were travelling in a Corolla car when they met with the accident. Sources said the vehicle lost control after a Land Cruiser, reportedly driven by a Saudi national, rammed it from behind. Jabir, a field officer with a private company, received the transfer order a week ago. He had gone to Jizan and after finding a home for his family returned to Jubail. He was again heading for Jizan with his wife and children when the accident occurred. All the five members of the family reportedly died on the accident spot. The bodies were shifted to the mortuary at Al-Rain Hospital. Sources said that efforts were on to bring the bodies back to Kerala. Beypore MLA and PWD minister PA Mohammed Riyas visited the relatives of the victims in Beypore on Saturday. "It is a very tragic incident, and we are all grief stricken. Efforts are on from the side of the government to speed up further procedures. The district collector has been assigned to take appropriate action," said Riyas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/five-of-a-family-killed-in-saudi-accident/articleshow/88097161.cms||---

Children recited their poems, drew caricatures and made paintings and also interacted with noted Marathi actor, playwright, director Dileep Prabhavalkar, who has to his credit a huge body of literary work as well. The children, who recited their poems, spelled out what they envisioned of the world and their thoughts. The poem on lockdown that depicted the view that government should take a very broad view in the future before bringing the system to a grinding halt. Another poem on ‘school on Mars’ was equally enjoyed by the audience as it revealed a very different view — that about having fun times on Mars. Children were happy to interact with ‘Dilipkaka’, who chaired the sessio. He had asked the children to address him as Dilipkaka and set the ball rolling for a dialogue, instead of giving any lecture to the children. Then what unfolded was the life sketch of Prabhavalkar — how ‘Bandya Satbande’ – the famous book, which is most sought by the children, was penned by him, what prompted him to write, or act in a films like Chimanrao, Chaukat Raja, Tatya Vinchu, the roles of Aaba played in Shriyut Gangadhar Tiprey and many more. Prabhavalkar urged the parents to boost the children for presenting their skills. “The children today are very smart and each one has a skill, which needs to be nurtured. The parents have the responsibility to the ensure they provide all support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/childrens-poems-on-lockdown-mars-get-writers-thinking/articleshow/88095994.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Delhi||East Delhi Municipal Corporation identifies 13 parking sites, more vacant plots||NEW DELHI: To improve the parking management in east Delhi areas, the municipal corporation is talking to various agencies and working out plans to identify new sites for use as parking places. It is also planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, or DSIIDC, on turning vacant plots in industrial areas into car parkings. “We have identified around 13 sites where car parking lots can be created to prevent avoid illegal and roadside parking,” said an East Delhi Municipal Corporation official. “These are located in industrial areas. We have exchanged correspondence with the officials concerned and things are in being finalised. We propose to run these parking lots on a profit-sharing basis.” The official added that there were no parking facilities in industrial areas such as Patparganj and Jhilmil. The civic body at present operates around 95 surface parking lots and one multilevel parking at Krishna Nagar. The contractual period for 37 of these parking facilities have expired, so EDMC plans to immediately issue tenders and contract out these sites again. To resolve the parking problem in congested and busy commercial or market areas, the corporation identified 10 plots belonging to Delhi Development Authority sometime ago. The civic body intends to approach DDA for permission to use those land for creating parking facilities and will offer to share revenue from these facilities planned to be developed on a public-private partnership basis, said officials. Civic officials claimed to have carried out a joint inspection of the various sites or held meetings in the case of three potential parking lots at Karkardooma, Laxmi Nagar district centre and Geeta Colony (opposite the crematorium). The other shortlisted possibilities include Ganesh Nagar Chowk (Patparganj Road), Narwana Road (Naar Mangalam Hospital), Aditya Complex (Preet Vihar), ITO Chungi (Vikas Marg), Seed Bed Park (Shakarpur) and Scope Tower (Laxmi Nagar). At present, some of these sites are being used for surface parking. “We have carried out the internal preparation, made a request for proposal for the plots where the chances of transfer of land is high and are waiting for DDA’s nod,” said the official. “The chances of developing multi-level parking near Karkardooma is high.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-identifies-13-parking-sites-more-vacant-plots/articleshow/88097776.cms||Vibha Sharma

AAP state convener Rahul Mhambrey said that Kejriwal is likely to make yet another poll promise to Goans, this time on the lines of the schemes for women implemented by the AAP government in Delhi. Upon his arrival, Kejriwal called on Amit Palekar, who ended his 5-day fast on Saturday protesting the approvals granted by the government for an illegal structure at Old Goa, at his residence in Merces. Speaking to reporters, Kejriwal said that Palekar’s fast against the illegal structure marked the “beginning of Goa’s political cleansing.” “All divine forces are coming together, and the coming polls will usher in revolution,” Kejriwal said. “People of Goa are fed up with the party-hopping politics going on in Goa. Goa’s politics has become corrupt and dirty. People don’t know what to do. People of Goa will soon get liberation from all these corrupt forces.” He said that AAP represents honest politics and struggle, and takes up people-centric issues. Lauding Palekar for his courage in persisting with his protest fast despite his deteriorating health and doctor’s raising concern, Kejriwal said, “The corrupt forces had to finally bow down before him.” He further said, “People who claim Palekar’s hunger strike was a political stunt, I challenge them to fast for five days. Fasting is a spiritual experience. It cleanses the body and soul. In the last 60 years of liberation, no political leader has burnt out their body for a cause.” Palekar also slammed those terming his fast a political stunt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goans-fed-up-with-party-hopping-politics-kejriwal/articleshow/88097809.cms||---

As many as 3,439 new companies were incorporated in state in 2020-21 financial year compared to 2,300 in 2016-17. Altogether, 13,805 new companies were set up under the Companies Act, 2013 between 2016-17 and 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh. During the same time, 8,779 companies went out of business in the state. However, state pales in comparison when it comes to the new companies floated in states like Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. For instance, 10,128 new companies ventured into the market in 2020-21 in neighbouring Telangana compared to Andhra Pradesh’s 3,439 during the same period. Other southern states like Karnataka (12,280 new enterprises), Tamil Nadu (9,632), and Kerala (6,409) also dominated the business sphere. The Andhra Pradesh government has introduced the AP Industrial Development Policy (IDP) 2020-23, identifying 10 thrust areas. Manufacturing sector, accounting for about 11% of the gross state domestic product, remains the high focus area in the state. According to the official statistics of the state government, 44 large and mega industrial projects were established with an investment of Rs 22,282 crore in 2019-20. The state attracted Rs 3,656 crore investment by paving way for 12 large and mega projects in 2020-21. The Covid-19 pandemic seems to have an impact on the quantum of investment in the MSME sector in the state besides the large industries. As many 10,019 MSMEs set up their shops in Andhra Pradesh with an investment portfolio of Rs 2,979 crore in 2019-20. The investment flow in the MSMEs has decreased to Rs 2,154 crore in 2020-21. During 2020-21, 1,061 large and mega industries filed their proposals with the state nodal agency for 1,332 clearances and approvals from various departments. Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation allotted 467 acres of industrial land to 660 units with an employment potential of 31,462 and proposed investment of Rs 2,244 crore in the 2020 calendar year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/state-registers-steady-rise-in-new-firms-in-last-5-years/articleshow/88096524.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The collector’s order was for all establishments in divisions E, F, G, I and H, which have licences under the Maharashtra Prohibition Act to sell foreign and Indian liquor shall close their shops on December 6. Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association had challenged the ban for 27 licensees in the H division on the grounds that bars and restaurants had been hit by the pandemic. Their counsel Veena Thadani said the entire ban was on the basis of a “solitary requisition’’ made by a Shivaji Park police station senior inspector in Dadar (W) for Dadar, Mahim, Matunga and Bhoiwada and there was no such requisition for ‘H’ division. Justice Girish Kulkarni who passed the order, made available on Saturday, said for the collector to exercise such power “it needs to be in public interest and more particularly, in the interest of public peace”. Government pleader Purnima Kantharia in defence of the ban said 40 cases were registered under the Act in the ‘H’ division from April to October. The HC noted it is common knowledge a large number of visitors who attend the solemn function on December 6 every year at Chaityabhumi, Shivaji Park, Dadar, also visit other prominent areas in the city. “Surprisingly, there is no restriction in such areas, which also possibly have large number of bars and restaurants and liquor outlets and certainly more than any other division,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-quashes-dec-6-liquor-ban-order-for-parts-of-mumbai/articleshow/88097783.cms||---

According to the police, the complainant in the cheating case had purchased land from a farmer in Trimbakeshwar. However, landshark Rami Rajput, who has been arrested in a murder case, had connived with the lawyer and prepared fake back-dated documents to register a fake deal with the office of the sub-registrar. In February, a farmer was stabbed to death in the Gangapur road area. Against the backdrop of the murder, the police had started a drive to check the landsharks. The police have framed charges against Rami Rajput under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act. The police had asked the citizens to contact them if they were cheated by the landsharks. Subsequently, a complaint was registered with the Upnagar police recently against Rajput. Taking into account the role of the lawyer in the cheating case, the police officials have arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-lawyer-arrested-in-cheating-case/articleshow/88095999.cms||---

Police said the neighbour, a 30-year-old man, has confessed during preliminary interrogation to raping the child before killing her. She was studying in class two. "Someone informed us about a stench emanating from inside the locked house of a man in the same locality. We sent a team to investigate and found the body of the child stuffed inside a trunk. It has been sent for post-mortem," said the additional superintendent of police, Hapur, Sarvesh Mishra. The police officer said that the man had admitted the girl was also sexually assaulted. "That shall be confirmed by the post-mortem report, which is awaited," said Mishra. The man is believed to be a known drug addict and used to stay alone. His wife had left him and taken their two children along with her a few months ago. The girl's father said that she had gone out to fetch sweets on Thursday evening but never returned. "We conducted a thorough search and informed police the very next day about her disappearance," he said. Cops had to protect the accused during his arrest as local residents turned violent and started thrashing him. "We had to form a cordon around him. He could have been lynched. The public was extremely angry," Mishra said. A similar incident took place in March in Bulandshahr, where a 14-year-old girl's body was exhumed from a pit inside the house of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/girl-6-missing-for-2-days-found-stuffed-in-trunk-at-neighbours-house/articleshow/88096522.cms||Sandeep Rai

Revabhai Parmar (45), along with his four children — daughters Nisha (17), Bhumi (13) and Bhanu (12) and son Punabhai (16) — had consumed poison outside the women’s police station in Patan on November 29. They were shifted to Dharpur civil hospital for treatment on the same day. On December 1, all five were shifted to Ahmedabad civil hospital where Anu died late in the night. On Friday night, Revabhai and his son Puna breathed their last in Ahmedabad civil hospital. According to police, Revabhai, a resident of Khakhal village in Harij taluka of Patan had attempted suicide with his four children as he was upset over his wife Asha (40) leaving them about a year ago. He had lodged a police complaint accusing one Kamlesh Gosai from Kutch of adducting his wife and seven-year-old daughter. As the police could not trace Revabhai’s wife for over a year, he went into depression and took the extreme step of consuming poison with his four children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/patan-family-suicide-bid-two-more-die/articleshow/88096533.cms||---

After a week of rain, weather conditions remained dry all day. Met’s forecast for Sunday said Thane and Raigad can expect light rain or thundershowers while Mumbai is likely to stay dry. The overall air quality index (AQI) for Mumbai was ‘satisfactory’. According to a forecast by SAFAR, it is likely to be ‘satisfactory’ over the next two days. A few pockets like BKC, Colaba, and Malad showed ‘moderate’ AQI levels. Met officials said the reason for dense fog was high humidity. The Colaba and Santacruz observatories recorded humidity of 93% and 91% respectively. “Calm winds coupled with high humidity levels led to foggy weather conditions,” said a Met official. Temperature in the city rose with the minimum at Colaba and Santacruz touching 22.8 degrees and 22.4 degrees. Maximum temperature for Colaba was 30.2 degrees while it was 32.5 degrees for Santacruz.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dry-day-likely-for-city-today-after-a-foggy-sat-morning/articleshow/88097798.cms||---

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was chief guest of the closing ceremony and awarded the winning Haryana team with gold medal, trophy and Rs 2 lakh cheque, runner-up Uttar Pradesh team with silver medal and Rs 1 lakh cheque and Rs 50,000 cheque to players who got the third position. “I welcome the participating teams and congratulate the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh teams for their excellent performance in the final match,” the CM said. “Sports fill us with positive energy and health and inspire us to do good work. Prime Minister Narendra Modi started ‘Khelo India Khelo’ 7.5 years ago and the results have started coming in. In spite of the corona pandemic, a big group of players participated in the Olympics and Paralympics. Not everyone can participate in the Olympics as one has to qualify for it. And after that a fresh competition starts and the person who bags a position in the competition becomes a hero,” he said. “I’m happy that the Indian participants for the first time brought so many Olympic and Paralympic medals. On August 19, in a grand function in the state capital Tokyo Olympic medallists were honoured with monetary prizes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/haryana-wins-kabaddi-meet-held-in-memory-of-mahant-avaidyanath/articleshow/88096535.cms||---
---||Delhi||Extortion case: Action against cops ordered||New Delhi: A city court has pulled up Delhi Police for allegedly falsely implicating a man in an extortion case and directed the police commissioner to initiate disciplinary action against two police officers. District Judge Dharmesh Sharma said the case was symptomatic of how disgruntled police officials sometimes misuse police powers. “…it is shocking that senior officers in the hierarchy fail to take cognisance of such facts and allow such disgruntled police officers to play with the life and liberty of poor people,” the court said in the order. The observations came while setting aside a 2019 magistrate court’s order by which Santosh Kumar was convicted for threatening to kill the owner of a company where he worked and demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh from him. The magistrate court had sentenced him to two years in prison. He challenged the order before the sessions court. The sessions court said Kumar suffered the ignominy of being incarcerated for about a month. It said that this humiliation must have resulted in irreparable anguish to his family members, besides loss of his dignity and stigmatisation in society. According to the prosecution, Kumar went missing soon after the owner filed a complaint of alleged extortion. The police arrested him after laying a trap. The sessions court said the prosecution’s entire case appeared to be “a cock and bull story”. It added that the inevitable conclusion was that Kumar was apprehended and forced to write the alleged threatening letters on account of some kind of “unholy nexus” between company owner and the cops. It observed that there were no departure entries from the concerned police station for the raid, nor any superior officer was informed about it, and no public witnesses were joined to lay the trap. “This shows the stark case of gross unprofessionalism if not sheer incompetence,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/extortion-case-action-against-cops-ordered/articleshow/88097800.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The couple. Sachin and Tina Dhiman, both in their mid-30s, hail from Nagla Rai village in Charthawal police station area. They were returning home after visiting relatives in Deoband in Saharanpur. A farmer, who was working in his field, heard a noise and came to the road to find out what had happened. He saw the car had fallen down 16 feet into the canal. He alerted others, and together they pulled out the sinking car from the water. Police said Tina died in hospital while Sachin is in a critical condition. They suspect that the driver may have lost control while trying to avoid hitting a wild animal that may have suddenly come on the road. Dinesh Kumar, SHO of the Charthawal police station, said, “The body has been handed over to the family after autopsy and further investigation is on.” Rupender Dhiman, Sachin’s brother, said, “My brother and Tina were married five years ago. They had a daughter who had died a few months ago. They had gone to Haridwar and were coming home after visiting Tina's family in Deoband when the accident took place.” Termed as “killer canal”, several accidents resulting in vehicles falling into the 560-km-long canal have taken place in the past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/car-plunges-into-ganga-canal-wife-dies-man-critical/articleshow/88096534.cms||Mohd Dilshad

But the administration refused to lower the guards. “Cyclone Jawad is no longer as strong as predicted and it is weakening. But we remain vigilant in coastal districts as the possibility of heavy rain persists,” said a state official on Saturday evening. Digha wore the look of a typical pre-cyclone day, with an overcast sky, deserted beach, constant drizzle and occasional gusty winds. The administration is on alert, geared up to prevent any untoward incident. The cyclonic storm, along with high tide, may deluge a large area, fears the East Midnapore district administration. TimesViewIt is imperative that tourists heed the advisory and the warnings being issued by the administration. The administration and locals should be able to focus on more serious work, like minimising damage to crops and property, instead of monitoring tourists indulging in irresponsible behaviour.Hoteliers and tour operators in Digha claimed to have suffered huge losses this weekend. The beach is cordoned off and NDRF units are keeping an eye on the possible direction of the cyclonic storm. M Kalairajan, inspector of the second battalion, said, “We have been warning locals and tourists against going near the sea.” Fisheries minister Akhil Giri visited Digha and nearby areas and met fishery owners. “We are trying our best to prevent loss of life and property,” he said. People from low lying areas of Jalda, Chandpur, Jamra and Shyampur have been asked to be ready in case they have to be evacuated. In South 24 Parganas, NDRF and SDRF units patrolled Namkhana, Patharpratima and Kakdwip. Nearly 14,000 people have been moved from low lying areas there and Gosaba and Sagar to safer places. Sagar MLA and minister Bankim Hazra said, “The rain has stopped and the sky looks clear, but we are prepared for any eventuality.” BDOs and police in Gosaba have been advising people not to step out of homes. Fishermen have been warned against venturing out. “We have 19 flood centres and 70 schools ready,” said Biswanath Chowdhury, BDO, Gosaba. So far, 8,000 people have been moved out. The rain has been incessant in West Midnapore, where the authorities have issued an orange alert and opened a control room. “Flood relief centres are open in Ghatal, Chandrakona, Kharagpur, Daton, Belda, Narayangarh and Keshiyari,” said DM Rashmi Kamal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vigil-on-coast-as-heavy-rain-alert-remains/articleshow/88097178.cms||Suman Mondal

Union minister for tourism G Kishan Reddy, who was also present at the event said, “The renovated lower fort with a museum dedicated to the freedom struggle will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 19 to mark the 60th anniversary of Goa’s liberation from Portuguese colonial rule.” A week ago a proposal was placed before the cabinet to hand over the maintenance and operations of the central jail complex to a private party. The complex had recently been renovated and a museum was set up to showcase Goa’s Liberation movement. Lobo had opposed the move to involve a private party and the decision was deferred to the next cabinet meeting. Talking at the function Lobo said the chief minister called him on Friday night to inform him that the plan to give the fort on lease has been cancelled. “The CM told me that nothing will be outsourced and it will remain with the state government,” he said, adding that a formal statement on this would be issued shortly by the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC). Dayanand Sopte, the chairman of GTDC was also present at the function. “The jail, known as the lower fort, was where freedom fighters were lodged during the freedom struggle not just from Goa but from other parts of India. It’s a place with a lot of history. It’s a place which should always remain with the government,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-plans-to-hand-over-operations-of-fort-aguada-to-private-party-lobo/articleshow/88097813.cms||---

---||Nagpur||G’chiroli HCWs run ‘night vax’ drive as tribals not available during day||Nagpur: The tribal population of Masandi village, 14km away from Pendhri’s primary health centre (PHC) in Dhanora in Gadchiroli, was surprised when a zilla parishad (ZP) health team came in the evening,offering to vaccinate them. The village on the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border is a known Maoist den.Around 67 beneficiaries from Masandi village were jabbed by the team of health and revenue officials as part of a special ‘night vaccination’ drive in the Maoist-affected district. The drive was one of various micro-planning measures undertaken by district collector Sanjay Meena and ZP CEO Kumar Ashirwad.Through this drive across 12 talukas, around 12,764 persons have been vaccinated in 124 remote villages.Ashirwad said a survey across 100 villages in the district showed that 23 reasons were cited for not taking a jab. “One of the reasons was the ongoing harvest season and the forest produce collection which would keep villagers away from their houses during morning hours,” he said.The night vaccine drive is undertaken only in far-flung places and not in the towns of Wadsa or Armori.Ashirwad said the drive revolved around the ‘door-to-door’ and ‘ease of vaccine’ vision. “The daytime engagements of the tribals forced the teams to kick-start the drive, even if it meant stepping into the Maoist stronghold, after sunset in places without motorable roads,” he said.In one instance, the teams waded through Indravati river and Karjeli nullah post sunset to reach Kopela village, around 25-30km away from Jhinganoor PHC in Sironcha taluka. The team managed to inoculate around 148 people.Ashirwad also said the night vaccine plan was fruitful in talukas like Bhamragarh, Korchi, Etapalli and Sironcha. “It earned the goodwill of the population as it did not affect their daytime engagement for livelihood. They got health benefits in the evening at their doorsteps,” said the ZP CEO. Till Friday, 75.78% of the population had received the first dose, while 39.52% had been administered the second dose.The drive in Gadchiroli district was also monitored by divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma.Ashirwad said the teams had to face tumultuous resistance at talukas adjoining Chhattisgarh border and in places like Korchi, Dhanora, Bhamragarh and Etapalli.“During the survey, it came to the fore that due to deaths of some Covid patients in Chhattisgarh after taking the vaccine, their relatives and friends had spread panic in Gadchiroli. Impotency was another fear. We prepared responses for the 23 listed fears and clarified them to the villagers,” said Ashirwad.The CEO is hopeful that the vaccination and testing drive would pick up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gchiroli-hcws-run-night-vax-drive-as-tribals-not-available-during-day/articleshow/88096539.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Meerut||Gangetic dolphin census begins, 15 sighted on 1st day||Bijnor: The annual Gangetic dolphin census began on Saturday. It will cover five districts in Uttar Pradesh, starting from Bijnor. The census, a part of Project Dolphin, was launched in Bijnor by divisional forest officials and a WWF (India) team. On the first day, 15 dolphins were sighted along the 30-km stretch of the Ganga. Forty-one dolphins were sighted last year. According to officials, it is the first time such a census is being carried out simultaneously in the country on the lines of the tiger census and will take a year to complete. WWF (India) and members of Uttar Pradesh forest department (UPFD) from five districts — Bijnor, Meerut, Hapur, Amroha and Bulandshahr — will conduct the census jointly within Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary and Narora Ramsar site. Field coordinator with WWF-India, Shahnawaz Khan, said, "This is the first time when a dolphin census is being conducted under Project Dolphin. Several teams are engaged in the exercise as per their zones. In 2015, we conducted a census across UP and 1,272 dolphins were sighted in different rivers. The final number may surpass that figure this time." The dolphin census was launched by director, rivers and wetland division, WWF-India Suresh Babu; field coordinator Shahnawaz Khan, WWF-India; Prof. Qamar Qureshi and Dr Vishnupriya, scientists at Wildlife Institute of India; and Bijnor divisional forest officer Anil Kumar Patel. Project Dolphin aims to protect and enhance the population of the human-friendly mammals. It was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the lines of Project Tiger and Project Elephant. It will focus on both river and sea dolphins, and “strengthen biodiversity, create employment opportunities and attract tourism". The project envisages addressing concerns over conservation and empowering stakeholders, such as the river-dependent population, in reducing river pollution and allowing sustainable fishery and other river-based livelihood options via scientific conservation approach. As per plans, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change will launch the 10-year project to give impetus to conserving and protecting the fast-depleting species of dolphins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/gangetic-dolphin-census-begins-15-sighted-on-1st-day/articleshow/88096549.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Nagpur||Delta strain in 784 Ngp Covid samples studied till date||Nagpur: The whole genomic sequencing of 784 samples collected and studied by CSIR-NEERI’s environmental virology cell has found mostly delta (B1.617.2) variant and in some cases its sub-lineage delta plus. Much before the latest SarCov-2 variant Omicron scare, the premier research institution’s cell led by Dr Krishna Khairnar had started sequencing RNA of all daily Covid postive samples from Nagpur city since June. However, the virology cell has been involved in SARS-COV-2 sequencing of Nagpur samples since Oct 2020. CSIR-NEERI had initiated the whole genome sequencing of all new positives samples — which are quite low since June this year — after a request by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). CSIR-NEERI had been performing the sequencing study since October 2020, but until June, the study was limited to samples collected from the RPTS testing centre. After June 2021, CSIR-NEERI has been sequencing SARS-COV-2 positive samples for the entire Nagpur district.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said, “R-naught count, infectivity rate and the patient’s condition were monitored. Patients, even if found to be positive for delta or delta plus, were stable. Recently, only one elderly patient passed away,” he said.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said the data regarding genomic study is regularly updated on the GISAID (Global initiative on sharing all influenza data) portal. “Other than that we have done sequencing at NIV Pune also through our regular government channel,” he said.When TOI accessed the GISAID data for city, the Omicron variant hasn’t been reported from the samples processed by NEERI. The dominant Covid variant reported at GISAID for Nagpur samples had been Delta.Dr Khairnar said, “The SARS-COV-2 whole genome sequencing study is a wonderful joint initiative of CSIR-NEERI, Nagpur and CSIR-CCMB, Hyderbad.”Dr Khairnar also said that for the early detection of Omicron, RTPCR kits which use ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) can be a good strategy. “But it has to go along with the whole genome sequencing. Without sequencing, the new variant can’t be confirmed 100%. SGTF can tell us about the likelihood of Omircron as a presumptive indication, but it needs to be confirmed through whole genome sequencing,” he said. State coordinator for genome sequencing Dr Rajesh Karyakate said as per INSACOG, 5% of all samples were sent for the genomic study from each district. “Now, wherever cases are drastically low, all of them are studied. Every district was asked to give 100 samples but the daily count of many is much lower. So, whatever cases are reported, their samples are sent for study. The samples need to have CT value of 25 at least for this study. It has been relaxed till 30 now,” he said.Dr Karyakate added that a monthly 100 samples from districts are also sent to NIV Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/delta-strain-in-784-ngp-covid-samples-studied-till-date/articleshow/88096552.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Majority or not, parties taking no chances over MLC election||HYDERABAD: Taking no chances over possible poaching and cross-voting in the MLC local authority constituencies, political parties across the board are going the extra mile to keep hold of their representatives. In a recent move, representatives from Karimnagar, Khammam, Medak and Adilabad were shifted to Goa and Bengaluru. This, even as parties such as TRS have majority to win in some constituencies. According to sources some candidates are spending as much as Rs 50,000 a day on each elected representative from their party for accommodation, liquor and food apart from other expenses. Some elected representatives’ spouses were also allowed to accompany them on their ‘trip’. However, they are under complete surveillance and their phones have been switched off. Sources said that in the wake of new cases of Omicron variant of Covid-19 being detected in Bengaluru, one party is planning to move its representatives to Mysuru. “Those moved to camps in other states would be brought back a few hours before polling on December 10,” a senior leader from the party said, on condition of anonymity. Camps are being organised for the MPTCs, ZPTCs and councillors, who are voters in MLC local authority constituencies, especially for Karimnagar, Medak, Khammam and Adilabad districts. This, as Congress candidates are in fray in Medak and Khammam districts while independent candidates are contesting in Karimnagar and Adilabad constituencies. In Medak, parties have reportedly shifted MPTCs, ZPTCs and other representatives to a resort near Bengaluru as Congress fielded Nirmala Jayaprakash Reddy from Medak LAC. Nirmala is the wife of Sangareddy MLA T Jayaprakash Reddy. TRS has 777 voters in the constituency who were shifted in special buses to Bengaluru. In Karimnagar, TRS rebel and former mayor Ravinder Singh is in fray apart from some independents. He has support from BJP and Congress leaders. BJP’s Huzurabad MLA Eatala Rajender is reportedly helping him in getting required numbers. From TRS, L Ramana and Bhanu Prasad Rao are in fray. Interestingly, Congress reportedly shifted about 40 MPTCs and ZPTCs belonging to a resort on the outskirts of Hyderabad. A Congress leader from Jayashankar-Bhupalpally district was made in-charge of the camp. Manthani MLA D Sridhar Babu is supervising the camps. Local bodies’ elected representatives from Khammam were shifted to Goa. In Khammam, the ruling party has 497 of total 769 votes while Congress has 34; CPM 26; and TDP has 19 voters. Congress has fielded R Nageshwara Rao however Rao has reportedly approached other parties seeking their support and claims he has over 100 voters’ support from other parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/majority-or-not-parties-taking-no-chances-over-mlc-election/articleshow/88097187.cms||Koride Mahesh

Sharma, who was suffering from several ailments, including cardiac and respiratory disorders, was also an accused in the case, as the vends from where the hooch was sold were "in her name". The kin of the undertrial woman staged a protest and accused the administration for “murdering” her, as she was discharged from Medical College on December 2, despite being unwell. She had been admitted there since November 9, said her son Vinay Bhardwaj. “I got a call from a lady constable at 11.44 pm that my mother’s condition was not good and they were taking her to JN Medical College. When I reached there, doctors told me that she was dead,” said Bhardwaj. He told media persons that her release on bail was confirmed on Friday but the police refused to certify one guarantor, as some case was pending against him. “We had managed the second guarantor, but the process of her final release was delayed to Saturday and she died even before coming out,” he said. Protestors demanded a CBI inquiry into the circumstances of her death and immediate release of all her family members, including her husband and the alleged kingpin of the liquor mafia, Rishi Sharma, for performing final rites. They also demanded that her post-mortem should be conducted before them, else they would continue with their protest. Local residents raised slogans against the state government. Jailer Pramod Kumar Singh said that they could not save her despite trying their best. “The arrangements were made to take her to medical college after her condition started deteriorating but she could not survive,” he said, adding that her release order was not received in the jail so far. The application of the kin to allow their jailed family members to perform last rites, was rejected by the local court, he added. A judicial inquiry will be conducted into the matter, which is mandatory under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The hooch tragedy had claimed over 100 lives in the district in May and June this year. Police said she had been lodged in Aligarh district jail on May 29 since her arrest and was granted bail by the high court on November 18 due to her poor health condition. She was charged under various IPC sections, including 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) at Jawan police station. Her husband Rishi Sharma was the alleged kingpin of the illicit liquor mafia, and he was arrested near Bulandshahr border after nine days of chase. Uttar Pradesh Police had announced Rs 1 lakh on any information leading to the arrest of Sharma, who went missing on May 28 when villagers started dying allegedly after consuming toxic liquor brewed and illegally sold by his gang to authorised vends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-hooch-tragedy-wife-of-main-accused-dies-while-being-released-on-bail-judicial-inquiry-ordered/articleshow/88096559.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

However, the way the world has panicked after the discovery of the new variant Omicron has made many doctors think about the sustainable solution for normalcy in life in the future. Health transformation expert and MS in psychology Dr Ravi Wairagade, who holds a PG degree in homeopathic medicine, has claimed that the psychoneuroimmunity (PNI) is the one of the very few effective solutions that enable humans to fight and recover against any variant of the coronavirus, be it Omicron or any other future variant. Dr Wairagade said the sudden panic in the public mindset after doctors found a new variant can bring psychological pressure on people and those living with the immunocompromised condition can suffer from different immunity-related disorders. “I have been working on PNI for the last many years and have many success stories to share. Covid is a new disease and it’s not so easy to search for medicines, pills, drugs or vaccines for every new variant of the virus responsible for this disease. We can’t stop and lockdown our life every time we find a new variant. In such a case, PNI is the most effective solution,” he said. Dr Wairagade claimed that boosting immunity is the biggest service to the nation in present scenario. “I appeal to all healthy people to maintain their health. People living with risk factors for developing severe Covid such as obesity, older age diabetes and heart disease should take care of their immunity,” he said. According to him, positive thinking is the first step of PNI. Dr Wairagade and his wife Dr Minal, a gynaecologist, provide free online consultation on the PNI module. “It’s not just a medicine or a module that we have developed in our clinic. Individuals can start following it in their day-to-day life. Take care of yourself and be confident that the virus will never break your immunity cover,” he said. LINK OF MIND AND BODY* Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) a relatively new field of study that looks at the interactions between central nervous system (CNS) and immune system* PNI studies relationship between emotional states, CNS, endocrine and immune systems* Increased psychological stress and depression associated with decrease in immune functioning * Positive thinking, fearlessness and stress-free life can boost immunity* Dr Ravi Wairagade’s module of effective use of PNI has many success stories||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/psychoneuroimmunology-only-remedy-for-all-variants-of-covid-claims-doctor/articleshow/88096568.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Justice Prateek Jalan also summoned the principal of the school and said the relevant records with regard to the admissions conducted this year be made available too for the perusal of the court. The court has listed the matter for further hearing on December 12. The petition alleged that admissions have been made to various classes in the school without notifying the vacancies. One of the petitioners alleged that some candidates had not applied, but still got admission, and some got admission to the classes in which no seats were advertised. “The petitioner upon making queries was shocked to discover that the respondent school had purportedly brought out a list on the basis of which it was proceeding to grant admission in a completely secretive and dubious manner,” it further alleged. It has sought the court’s direction that the draw of lots for the paid category be held afresh. The petitioner’s name was in the waiting list for Class-I at the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/petition-over-paid-admission-hc-summons-jamia-registrar/articleshow/88097825.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Conscious of congestion and roadblocks, traffic police taking the lead in pothole repair||Nagpur: Wary of the traffic snarls caused by potholes and the delay in response from the authorities concerned, Nagpur traffic police have taken the lead in repairing potholed roads.The cops are using Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)’s jetpatcher and instapatcher machines to level the pothole-ridden roads across the city. “For the last couple of days, traffic police personnel from 10 traffic zones have been working with NMC’s machinery to repair bad stretches across the city,” said deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sarang Awad.To a query, the DCP said they are focusing on major thoroughfares. “Most of the complaints pertaining to potholes were received through social media and WhatsApp,” said Awad. “Citizens can approach Nagpur traffic police via its WhatsApp number and social media handles to inform about bad roads, which we will repair with the help of NMC,” he said. The office of DCP traffic in Civil Lines had also submitted a list of 75 pothole-ridden roads to NMC, seeking its attention to repair them without any delay.Traffic cops told TOI it is not that NMC is not repairing the potholes, but the civic body is carrying out the works as per their priority. “But we are focusing on major thoroughfares among the list of 75 roads like Seminary Hills, Katol Road, Wardha Road, Kamptee Road and Amravati Road, among others,” Awad pointed out.Roads under jurisdiction of Sadar and Sitabuldi traffic zones were in really bad shape with 13 and 12 stretches respectively becoming uneven due to potholes. Likewise, there are nine road patches under Indora zone, seven each in Kamptee and Sonegaon traffic zones, six bad stretches under MIDC, Sakkardara and Lakadganj traffic zones, while Cotton Market and Ajni zones had identified five bad stretches.“NMC has spared two machines — JetPatcher and InstaPatcher — for us along with manpower and they are attending to the pothole-related complaints being forwarded by traffic police,” traffic cops said.Motorists welcomed the move of traffic police but demanded that if any accident takes place due to a damaged road, the owner of the road should face punishments like the traffic violators being penalized by cops.Traffic police do not have any data on how many potholes or bad patches they got repaired with the help of NMC in a week. So far in this calendar year, NMC claims to have repaired over 9,000 potholes across the city. But due to faulty repair works, most of the city roads remain bumpy. Elevated pothole-filling work has resulted in increase in backache issues. Repair of vehicles too has increased manifold, said automobile mechanics.Right way to repair potholesAffected portion to be dug properlyCleaned completelyHigh quality tar to be filledLevelled properly by using a road rollerHelpline Numbers: Traffic police WhatsApp number: +91 90113 87100Twitter handle: @trafficngp||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/conscious-of-congestion-and-roadblocks-traffic-police-taking-the-lead-in-pothole-repair/articleshow/88096583.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

It would become functional from a highrise building in Nanakramguda. A curtain-raiser event was organised at HICC. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao hoped the emergence of IAMC would make India overcome its image of lagging behind in enforcement of contracts on account of problems like lack of sufficient judges to resolve disputes quickly. He thanked CJI for choosing Hyderabad for the facility. KCR said the international facility would receive full support from state, Centre and other Asian nations. Making it clear that it was impossible to clear four crore backlog cases, Justice L Nageswara Rao of the Supreme Court called for alternative dispute resolution mode. “The time is ripe now because the Centre amended arbitration laws in 2019 and 2021,” Justice Rao said. CJI Ramana promised IAMC will not confine itself to settling commercial disputes, but look at disputes of ordinary people. “Anyone with common sense and a good reputation in society can become a mediator and we will ensure such eminent persons act as judges at Hyderabad centre,” Justice Ramana said. Former judge of Supreme Court Justice RV Raveendran said Indian must get rid of laying claims bigger than their real entitlements. Telangana HC Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma said centre would function in a autonomous way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/intl-arbitration-centre-in-hyd-on-dec-18-cji/articleshow/88097239.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Beware of backpack thieves who reach into bags to steal valuables||MUMBAI: It may no longer be enough to merely keep a good grip on your bag when walking in crowded places to prevent your valuables from getting stolen. Thieves are now using a new technique to steal belongings from one’s bag. They do not lift or steal the bag. Instead, they identify a target wearing his/her bag on the back, and then follow the person into the thick of the crowd, where they open the bag’s zip and steal the contents.  “This is a new method of theft coming to light. Earlier, thieves would prefer running away with bags,” said police. In most such cases, the accused targets a person when he or she is walking from the railway station to a destination. They wait for a crowded area to execute their plan, police investigations have found. In the latest case, the L T Marg police arrested a 20-year-old Sewree resident on charges of theft. On November 24, the accused, Javed Shaikh, took advantage of the crowd and while walking on the road, opened the zip of a bag on the back of the complainant and took out two boxes containing 208 grams of gold jewellery worth Rs 9.7 lakh. The police used technical and human intelligence to arrest Shaikh on November 26 and recovered stolen property worth Rs 6.3 lakh. On the same day, the Pydhonie police arrested a 22-year-old youth, Arman Shaikh, in a similar case. A 27-year-old man,who had come to Pydhonie area to buy hardware material, was walking from Masjid Bundar railway station towards Pydhonie, when Shaikh opened the zip of his knapsack on his back and ran away with Rs 2.2 lakh. The incident took place at 4.30pm on a crowded street on November 19. Interestingly, Shaikh was released from the Byculla jail a month earlier, on October 18, after spending months inside for another theft case. “There are around 10 cases of theft against Shaikh, mostly registered with the railway police. He was arrested in a theft case when he was just 17,” said a police officer. Investigators said that earlier bag lifting was a common crime. However, the new crime trend being reported from various parts of the city is merely opening the zip and making off with the contents of the bag. “Sometimes it’s a single accused who executes the theft. In some cases, there are two or three people who commit theft by opening the zip of a bag and stealing the valuables, passing it on to the other accused, who flees from there. We appeal to people to be careful while walking on the road if they wear their bags on their backs,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-beware-of-backpack-thieves-who-reach-into-bags-to-steal-valuables/articleshow/88097827.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Hyderabad||Being made scapegoats for students’ performance: Telangana teachers||HYDERABAD: Teachers are being made scapegoats for students’ performance with many alleging that the Social Welfare Society is threatening them with suspensions and increment cuts if all students in a class fail to secure more marks in the baseline test. Teachers said that the board issued a circular in June 2021 stating that New Performance Appraisal Policy (NPAP) will be implemented this year. Under NPAP, teachers are awarded marks based on student’s performance and they need to score above 50 marks to not get ‘punished’. The NPAP was cleared in 2020, but the same was not implemented last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Why is NPAP limited to only Social Welfare Society? Orally, officials are saying NPAP will not be implemented this year, but a circular has been issued regarding its implementation. NPAP is being used to torture teachers,” said a teacher from Asifabad. Teachers said students are being tested for their reading and writing skills through exams. “The students have been staying at home during the pandemic and most of them have even forgotten the basics. Within a month after reopening physical classes, how can they expect students to excel in exams. Why implement NPAP at this stage,” asked another teacher from a school in Nalgonda. According to teachers, the exams are being conducted for students of class 5 till Intermediate in all subjects. It is mostly additional secretaries who are putting pressure on them, they said, adding they are not sure if higher-ups are aware of the issue. They further said that they were scared of losing their increments, and that some teachers have been lenient with invigilation, even helping students with answers. The teachers added that the Society has already suspended two faculty members. A junior lecturer’s suspension letter said he was involved in ‘malpractice’ as all students secured 15-20 marks in an exam, but when a higher official conducted a re-exam they only secured 0-5 marks. Members of Telangana State United Teachers Federation have even submitted a representation to the Society asking them to withdraw NPAP. The secretary of the society, D Ronald Rose, said they have given clear instructions that this year no punishments will be given due to Covid-19. “Some teachers were caught writing answers for students to copy and two of them were suspended based on an inquiry,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/being-made-scapegoats-for-students-performance/articleshow/88097248.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The accused was arrested at Udaipur and later handed over to Mathura police after the woman lodged a complaint with Government Railway Police (GRP). Investigating officer in GRP Mathura, Pramod Sharma, said the woman, a resident of Delhi’s Palam Gaon boarded the train at Nizamuddin railway station around 7pm for Udaipur, where she is studying. She alleged that the crime took place between Mathura and Udaipur. She said she initially told the suspect to behave himself when he attempted to touch her inappropriately but he did not listen. She then informed her father who was also travelling with her. When the train stopped at Udaipur railway station, the woman filed a complaint with the GRP and handed over the accused, who identified himself as Khushi Ram, 26, a resident of Haryana’s Jind district. He claimed that he was posted as a postal assistant in Udaipur. Sharma said that Udaipur GRP took the accused to Mathura on Saturday morning and he was remanded to judicial custody after being produced in the court.

The group is trying to mount pressure on the Union defence ministry to initiate the process. “We have represented the matter to the local MLA and also to the MPs in Delhi to raise the matter in the Parliament during the ongoing winter session. The ball is now in their court whether they want to consider the residents’ plea or not,” said Ambala Srinivas, executive member of the Cantonment Vikas Manch, an SCB-based NGO which has been spearheading the protest in the national capital. During the round-table, Ambala echoed the sentiments of other residents and said that the merger would enable better facilities for civilians living in the Cantonment limits. “If you compare the SCB areas with those in GHMC, there is a stark difference between both. Areas in the GHMCare much more organised and have better facilities for the kind of taxes that people pay,” said Ambala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vikas-manch-continues-merger-stir-in-delhi/articleshow/88097179.cms||---

It is one of the oldest schools in the cantonment area that has suffered the brunt of the road closure.” In 2018-19, the LMA had briefly closed a gate constructed near Holy Trinity Church leading to Bolarum due to which children enrolled in Valerian Grammar School had to take a detour. After much hue and cry by parents and residents of north-eastern colonies, it was opened for the public. In fact, locals say, students of many schools in the Secunderabad Cantonment limits have been inconvenienced due to closure of gates and roads by the local army authorities in the past. Residents also raised concerns over lack of schools, playgrounds, hospitals and other essential infrastructure within the Secunderabad Cantonment limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-closure-led-to-drop-in-enrolment/articleshow/88097176.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Road closure in violation of Cantonment Act?||Secunderabad: Conversation around the closure of civilian roads by the Local Military Authority (LMA) dominated Saturday’s roundtable. Representatives of the Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS), which have been fighting against the closure of 21 civilian roads for the last six years, urged the Maud principal secretary, Arvind Kumar to find a permanent solution to this issue. The secretary of the residents group, C S Chandrasekhar, also explained how the LMA’s move was against the procedure mentioned under Section 258 of the Cantonment Act, 2006. He said: “On closing and opening of roads, Section 258 of the Act clearly states that a Board shall not permanently close any street without prior permission of the General Officer Commanding in Chief or the Principal Director. Provided that no such street shall be closed for reasons other than the security reasons and without giving a public notice inviting objections and suggestions from the general public.” Though the MoD had issued orders in 2018 to keep all civilian roads, the LMA ignored th se orders, he added. Members of United Federation of Resident Welfare Associations, an apex body of RWA, also raised the road closure issue. Responding to this concern, Arvind Kumar said that the matter had been taken up with LMA many times. “We have brought it to their notice saying that people of several areas have been affected and that they have not followed procedure in accordance with the Cantonment Act,” he said. With regard to acquiring land to build alternative roads, he said the authorities need 37.96 acres of land within SCB. The cost of the land transfer, lease and compensation to properties affected by acquisition would amount to Rs 406 crore. “During a meeting on the issue, the state told the defence secretary about this and also said that it was ready with the DPR to build alternative roads. But the minutes are yet to be received,” Arvind Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-closure-in-violation-of-cantonment-act/articleshow/88097199.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||‘Merger is the only answer to better amenities in SCB’||Hyderabad: The cry to merge civilian areas under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) limits with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) got louder at a roundtable organised by The Times of India in the city on Saturday. Representatives from close to 10 resident welfare associations came together and put forth their concerns before Ajith Reddy, SCB chief executive officer (CEO); Arvind Kumar, special chief secretary, municipal administration and urban development (MAUD), Telangana government and Sayanna, MLA from Secunderabad Cantonment. The event kicked off with a detailed presentation on the history of Secunderabad from the early 1900s and how it has evolved over time. Residents discussed an array of issues that plague the area now and pointed out how a merger of civilian areas within SCB limits with the GHMC, could lead to better amenities. From paucity of funds and staff crunch at SCB to the problem of road closure and poor infrastructure and maintenance, residents highlighted various concerns that they believe can be resolved only if a merger takes place. “Due to staff crunch at the ground level in SCB, the board is unable to monitor rampant encroachments within its limits. Paucity of funds results in poor sanitation and battered roads that are not maintained in many wards. If the civilian areas are merged, the least we can expect is better infrastructure and living standards,” said Jithender Surana, a resident of Bolarum. The issue of road closure was among the key things discussed by locals. “Residents have been fighting for this issue for so many years. Yet, there has been no permanent solution. Nobody knows the rationale behind closure of roads in the cantonment areas. There is a need to find out if it is indeed due to the army installations and security reasons or there is something else to it,” said M L Aggarwal, president of the All Cantonments Citizens Welfare Association. Addressing the concerns raised by residents, the SCB CEO, Ajith Reddy, said that there has to be equal participation from the state and central government in resolving these long-standing concerns. “There has to be a state government representative as a nominee in the SCB.

---||Coimbatore||Coordinated efforts needed to prevent elephant deaths||Coimbatore: Divisional railway manager (DRM) of Palakkad division Trilok Kothari has urged the forest department to take steps to reduce delay in sharing information on movement of wild elephants to prevent train-elephant collisions.Three elephants were mowed down by Mangaluru -Chennai express train on Track A between Walayar and Ettimadai on the night of November 26. “Most of the animal watchers are deployed on Track B, which also has most of the watchtowers since it is close to the forest. But railway officials didn’t receive any information on elephants crossing Track B on the nigh the accident happened. Perhaps they missed the elephants, which crossed Track B to reach A,” Kothari told TOI.Immediately after the accident, the forest department deployed more staff on the stretch, Kothari said. “Presence of more watchtowers on the stretch will reduce the delay in passing information to railway on marauding elephants.”Being one of the busiest lines of the Southern Railway, over 70 trains pass through each of the tracks daily.While forest department officials believe that the train was running above the permissible speed limit, Kothari said that the investigation being conducted by the forest department will reveal what caused the accident. Suggesting a long-term solution to prevent such incidents, he said elephants must be prevented from coming out of the forest. “Even if they come out, they should be tracked effectively and allowed a safe passage. We are trying to work closely with the forest department on this,” he said.K S Ramakrishnan, a railway researcher, said the government departments concerned are not aware of the aftermath of the changes in crop pattern and other developments taking place in the region, which lead to human-animal conflict. “They should regulate what farmers in Ettimadai and Navakkarai areas are cultivating. Most of them raise maize, corn, sugarcane and banana that attracts elephants. They should be advised to cultivate crops like castor plants, chilli, cotton, sesame, onion, garlic, ginger, mulberry, tobacco and turmeric, which are not preferred by elephants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coordinated-efforts-needed-to-prevent-elephant-deaths/articleshow/88097196.cms||Sampath Kumar

The injured man was identified as R Rakesh, 30, of Kodipuram in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala. “Rakesh, who was working at a spa in Dubai, was in a live-in relationship with his colleague P Jayanthi, 27, of Thiruvalluvar Street at Meenambakkam in Kancheepuram. She had separated from her husband. Rakesh returned to Kerala in July to attend his sister’s marriage and Jayanthi returned to Chennai. Rakesh married another woman in Kerala three months ago. He sent a WhatsApp message to Jayanthi on Thursday and asked her to visit an apartment in Peelamedu on Friday. They met at the apartment around 11.30am and Jayanthi asked him to marry her. When Rakesh refused, an argument broke out between them and Jayanthi took a bottle of acid from her bag and poured it on his face. He sustained burn injuries to the cornea of his left eye. She also stabbed him on his right-hand thumb with a knife and consumed poison,” a police officer said. The apartment watchman rushed the duo to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). Based on Rakesh’s complaint, the Peelamedu police registered a case against Jayanthi under Section 323, 324 and 326 (A) of the Indian Penal Code.  Meanwhile, Jayanthi lodged a complaint saying that Rakesh had borrowed Rs 18 lakh from her. Police have registered a cheating case against Rakesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-throws-acid-on-former-boyfriends-face/articleshow/88097216.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Para swimmer bags national award for diving into accessibility||MUMBAI: Unlike the certificate he got from the president in Delhi two days ago, the certificate that he received from a doctor in Mumbai nine years ago had punched former karate champion Mohammed Shams Aalam Sheikh in the gut. "100 percent disabled," it had pronounced the athlete who recently spent his lockdown rolling out chapatis in the shapes of countries in which he had and hadn't yet won a medal. "How can a person be 100 percent disabled? Doesn't that mean he cannot do anything?" asks the 35-year-old international para swimming champion, backstroking mentally to 2010 when a failed surgery to remove a benign spinal tumour had smashed his dream of representing India at China's Asian Games by rendering his body immobile from a few inches above his black belt. Two years after that fateful day, Sheikh had startled lifeguards at Mumbai's swimming pools by rolling up in his imported automatic wheelchair for a dip and, later, after he sliced through six kilometres of the sea at the Gateway of India in under two hours, the Bruce-Lee fan found his doctor smilingly reducing his disability percentage to 72. "But these are just certificates. They help me get concessions. I don't take them personally," brushes off Bihar-born, Dharavi-bred, Gurugram-based para swimmer cum disability rights activist who was one among 59 individuals and organisations to receive a national award for "empowering persons with disabilities". Conferred annually on December 3, the International Day for Persons with Disabilities, this award is the Social Justice and Empowerment ministry's hat-tip to Indian efforts toward accessibility. Besides founding the Mumbai Para Sports Association, a platform for para-athletes that conducted the 1000-participants-strong Maharashtra Paralympic Games in 2015, Sheikh--who swam eight kms of Candolim's sea within four hours in 2017--was instrumental in making five Goan beaches accessible and wrote letters to the Bihar government seeking funds to add ramps and an elevator to Patna's Patliputra Sports complex. It was in Bihar's flood-prone chest that a two-year-old Sheikh--the youngest of seven children of an impoverished couple--had impressed neighbours by floating across the pond outside their home in Madhubani district's Rathos village. His mother would retrieve this childhood memory often during his catheter-tethered recovery at Mumbai's Paraplegic Rehabilitation Centre when the Urdu-medium-honed MBA would compose philosophical couplets that would later open his various TEDx talks. While striving to regenerate his nervous system at the centre, Sheikh bumped into Raja Ram, an international para swimmer who would egg him on to hit the water again. Soon, even as his lifeless limbs mimicked Raja Ram's butterfly strokes and back strokes, Sheikh's bladder regained control and the catheter lost its use. "I stopped feeling like a patient," he says. What followed was a yellow blur of medals that are now in the safekeeping of his sister in Dharavi. Special among them is his first international bronze medal from 2016's 100 m breast stroke in Quebec's Can-Am Para Swimming Championships and the four gold medals that he bagged at the Indian Open Para Swimming Championship in 2018. Sheikh was at the Kuala Lumpur airport, flying back home after representing India at the 50m and 100m butterfly, freestyle and various other categories at the Para Asian Games of 2018, when he got a call saying his mother was ill. "Before I came back, she was gone," says Sheikh. "Accept"--the word that his earthy tongue mispronounces--is not only the crux of his motivational videos but also the verb that saw him wade through many downs that prefixed 2018's Para-Asian Games. If the management of the Dharavi swimming pool stopped him from training "due to some issues", the government turned down his request to attend the training camp in Bengaluru saying the "infrastructure was not wheelchair-friendly". "I would wheelie myself nearly eight kilometres to a pool in Dadar for practise," recalls Sheikh. These days, having replaced his Rs 1.5 lakh imported wheelchair with a self-designed customised version that costs one-third the amount, Sheikh can be found flailing up and down Delhi's temperature-controlled Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee swimming pool.He is preparing for a dream that had been paralysed in 2010: "I want to win a gold medal at the 2022 Asian Games in China."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/para-swimmer-bags-national-award-for-diving-into-accessibility/articleshow/88097837.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Visually-challenged adventurer mother feted as ‘role model’||MUMBAI: Daring' isn't an English adjective so much as a Hindi verb for 52-year-old government employee Neha Pawaskar who has scaled various summits including 17,200-foot-high Mt Kshitidar in the Himalayas, crossed three deep Konkan valleys while tethered to a rope and is now fighting an uphill legal battle for a promotion. "I do daring," says the Bandra-based adventure-seeking mother whose online channel identifies her as 'Iron Lady Pride India'--a title gifted to her by France's Bravo International Book of World Records a few years after she had ziplined across a steep cavity in the semi-circular Kokankada cliff at Ahmednagar's Harishchandragad. During this televised feat of 2016, a sky-facing Pawaskar had heard audible gasps when she let go of the zipline yoked to her harness as instructed. "If I could see, I would've looked down and been scared," she says. "But I have no fear as I have no vision." On December 3, International Day for Persons With Disabilities, Pawaskar--who was eight when her progressively-blurry world grew black--received a certificate from president Ram Nath Kovind that called her a "role model". She would have preferred a pension or a cash prize but in this national award Pawaskar read overdue "dignity" and acknowledgement for her stubborn tryst with the outdoors. After losing a steadily-degenerating partial vision, she had graduated in BA sociology, finished a telephone operator course, learnt Judo, swimming, chess and athletics and later, signed up for a mountaineering course in Darjeeling. Following a ligament tear that thwarted her daring streak in 2013, the adventures that animate Pawaskar, mother to a 17-year-old sports enthusiast who studies in "the same college as Sachin Tendulkar", are the 'goalball' tournaments that her NGO All India Andha Stri Hit Association organizes for underprivileged, visually-challenged girls from the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/visually-challenged-adventurer-mother-feted-as-role-model/articleshow/88097841.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

While 20 startups were identified for the competition after vetting, GoFloaters was adjudged the winner. The ideas are, however, yet to be put in use by the Coimbatore corporation, which is following a conventional booking system, where people have to visit vaccination camps an hour before the camp starts.GoFloaters, founded in 2018, is an on-demand workplace booking platform that connects professionals who do not have a permanent office and people offering office on rent on daily and monthly basis. “The Chennai corporation required a platform to enable vaccination booking programmes to meet the demand in April. With the experience of running the booking website, we played a significant role in designing an exclusive portal for Chennai corporation, which has been used by more than 2.5 lakh people,” Shyam said. “We learnt about the competition to provide innovative solutions for Coimbatore corporation and decided to took part. We provided the template created for Chennai corporation with additional features like booking through missed call, scanning QR code and booking through WhatsApp.”The concept of shared office model is picking up in Coimbatore, Shyam said. “Eight places are available on GoFloaters platform. We are operating in 25 cities in Tamil Nadu,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/startup-bags-award-for-offering-solutions-to-city-corpn/articleshow/88097201.cms||---
---||Agra||Junior doctors’ strike hits services at Agra's SNMC||Agra: Demanding filling up vacancies for junior doctors in medical colleges ahead of the possible Covid-19 third wave, Grade 2 and 3 doctors at SN Medical Colleges here have boycotted work — as a part of a nationwide protest — for the past seven days, hitting medical services. The protesters are demanding to expedite filling up vacancies of junior doctors in medical colleges across the country and conduct the NEET-PG counselling without any further delay. They boycotted work at the outpatient and inpatient departments (OPD & IPD), but they continued serving the emergency ward and the intensive care unit (ICU). The boycott has strained resident doctors severely, with the Covid-19 and dengue cases increasing. SNMC requires 320 junior doctors, but only 180 are serving different departments at SNMC — the largest government hospital in the Agra region. Protesters said though the NEET-PG exam was held in September, the counselling could not be conducted as a case over EWS quota is sub judice in the Supreme Court. “The government first delayed the exam, and now they are delaying the counselling, wasting an entire academic year of medical students,” said Dr Anurag Mohan, president, SNMC Junior Doctors’ Association. Earlier, the NEET-PG exam was scheduled for January, but it was postponed to April. Then the Centre again postponed the exam to September owing to the second Covid wave. The exam was finally conducted on September 11, and the result was declared on September 28. Dr Anupam Singh Yadav, vice president of the association, said, “The government conducted elections during the Covid wave but postponed the NEET-PG exam. Now, the sub judice case is delaying the counselling. It has severely affected the functioning of medical colleges across the country. We want the authorities to expedite the NEET-PG counselling and the admission process and also speed up the court proceedings.” Meanwhile, faced with financial constraints, many aspirants are in a dilemma over waiting for counselling or looking out for other employment opportunities. SNMC principal Dr Prashant Gupta said, “We are trying to ensure patients do not suffer. But, if the strike extends, it will create a problem in providing normal services at different wards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/junior-doctors-strike-hits-services-at-agras-snmc/articleshow/88096596.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two travel agents held for forging fake Canadian visa||MUMBAI: Two travel agents were arrested from Haryana and Punjab on Friday for allegedly making a fake Canadian travel visa a year ago for a woman from Kurukshetra, in exchange for Rs 10 lakh. Suspecting that the visa was fraudulent, the 26-year-old woman did not fly to Canada. However, she was stopped at the Mumbai international airport on September 4 while trying to fly to Ukraine. Officials discovered the fake Canadian visa on her passport and Sahar police arrested her for cheating and forgery on September 5. The two agents, Hardeep Singh and Prashant from Punjab, were arrested from Jhansi after the deputy superintendent of police from Shahabad, Haryana, actively probed the written complaint filed by the woman on November 6. The agents were produced in court on Saturday and have been remanded in police custody till December 9. The woman, in her complaint, said that she was a victim of fraud and had lost over Rs 10 lakh that her father-in-law paid the agents last year after they promised a bright future in Canada. “I did not fly to Canada last year after I suspected that the Canadian visa stamp was fake. This year, I got an education invitation from the Ukraine University, and was flying legally when I was stopped. The fake stamped Canadian visa made me an accused for no fault of mine after the airport officials at Mumbai found the forged Canada visa,” she wrote. Lawyers Prabhakar Tripathi and Amit Shukla, who appeared before the Andheri court for the victim, got her released on bail after arguing that she is a victim and not an accused. “The woman is a victim of cheating and forgery that was committed by the travel agents who duped her to the tune of Rs 10 lakh and made a fake Canadian visa stamp on her passport, which then got her trapped when she tried to fly with a genuine Ukraine visa for higher studies in September. Also, the accused agents issued two cheques to refund the money they took from her, which was dishonoured,” Tripathi told TOI. Sahar police are probing the case to find out how many people were duped by the agents with similar modus operandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-travel-agents-held-for-forging-fake-canadian-visa/articleshow/88097844.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Because of the delay, the entire area was flooded with water, creating inconvenience to commuters.”He said earlier only oral permission from the traffic police was required to carry out such repair works. “So, it was easy to attend to the leakage issues without wasting any time. Now that the approval system is centralized, we have to write to the traffic deputy commissioner, seeking permission. It takes time.”Another contractor confirmed that the new approval system was delaying repair works.When contacted, S R Senthil Kumar, city deputy traffic commissioner of police, said there was no delay from their part in granting permission. “We give nod in a day or two. If there is an urgent work to be carried out, city corporation officials will talk to us directly and the permission will be granted instantly.”He said the new approval system that they had introduced was in place in Chennai for years. Senthil Kumar said there was a lot of confusion earlier, as there was no proper system to grant approvals for taking out repair works of water supply and drainage pipelines on the city roads. “It was like contractors would dig up roads and leave it such as for a long time. They would also erect barricades and block roads, causing traffic congestion. The new system will allow us to plan and ensure diversions without causing traffic snarls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/contractors-slam-new-approval-system-to-carry-out-pipeline-repair-on-roads/articleshow/88097218.cms||V Devanathan

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MHA beefs up Narayan Rane’s security to ‘Z’ category||MUMBAI: The Ministry of Home Affairs, led by Amit Shah, on Friday upgraded the security cover of Union minister of micro, small and medium enterprises Narayan Rane from ‘Y-plus’ to ‘Z’ with immediate effect. The MHA has asked the Central Industrial Security Force to provide Z-category cover on all-India basis to Rane immediately. “Prima facie, it appears that Rane’s security has been upgraded in view of the threat perception. In such matters, state government is never consulted,’’ a senior IPS officer said. A week ago, Rane had declared that the Thackeray-led state government will be dislodged in March 2022. After Rane joined the BJP during the tenure of Devendra Fadnavis, he was provided with a Y-category security cover. However, it was withdrawn on January 8, 2021, when the state home department’s high-level threat perception committee reviewed the security provided to all leading politicians. At the time, security cover of quite a large number of BJP politicians was drastically reduced. Fadnavis, who had ‘Z-plus’ security cover since he was CM, was reduced to ‘Y-plus with escort’.  Rane was completely de-categorised. As a result, he had only one police personnel for his security. Along with Rane, security cover of senior BJP leaders Raosaheb Danve, Ashish Shelar, former UP governor Ram Naik, Rajkumar Badole, former speaker Haribhau Bagde, Ram Kadam, Prasad Lad, Shobhatai Fadnavis and Madhav Bhandari was cut or withdrawn. In the recent past, the MHA had provided security cover to Rane after he took a firm stand against the MVA government led by Uddhav Thackeray. In fact, when Rane allegedly passed derogatory remarks against Thackeray, criminal cases were registered against him at three places and in one of the cases, he was arrested by the police. He was produced in court and released on bail. Currently, four persons in the state have Z-plus security cover, while 12 have ‘Z’ category cover. Those assigned Z-category have at least 17 police personnel in one shift to guard them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mha-beefs-up-ranes-security-to-z-category/articleshow/88097852.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The drive has been intensified after the state decided to cut down the special duty fee on the BIO by 150% to increase its revenue.The department, along with the railway police and protection force, has started checking long-distance trains, especially the ones coming from Delhi and other parts of north India. In September-October, the state excise department twice seized liquor consignments coming from Haryana by trains.SP Pramod Sonone said his teams would visit marriage halls, party halls, lawns, programme venues and such places to check any liquor brands being consumed which was manufactured and distributed in other states. “Though the modified special duty cuts would take some more time to be implemented, we would be watchful against liquor being brought from other states at cheaper rates during the festive season. This was planned to boost the state’s revenue and also check blackmarketing,” said Sonone, adding, there was an increase in cases and revenue collection in the ongoing financial year.As per the statistics furnished by the state excise department, around 1,733 cases were registered between April 1 and October 30 this year. In the last financial year, around 1,623 cases were registered between April and October 2020.Sonone said 269 cases were registered in November in which 243 persons were arrested and six vehicles were seized. Material worth around Rs 21 lakh was seized, he said.Sonone also made an appeal to the masses to alert the excise department on the toll free number 18008333333 or WhatsApp (8422001133) for any information regarding liquor brought from other states. “We will take action if a complaint is received,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/zero-tolerance-against-liquor-from-other-states-excise-dept/articleshow/88096615.cms||Soumitra Bose

Thakur while addressing the students of Maharana Pratap Siksha Parishad (MPSP) at the opening ceremony of weeklong MPSP foundation week celebration, said during the previous governments regime, the invaders were glorified and martyrdom of freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh was described as an extremist step in the history books. Can anyone believe that Shaheed Bhagat Singh was an extremist or terrorist, asked Thakur. The programme was presided over by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. While praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Thakur said, “During the past seven years, India has stood up as a country of startups. Entrepreneurship has now become the strength of country’s youth.” He also announced that a shooting range and an indoor stadium will be constucted and asked MPSP president, Prof UP Singh to send a proposal for it to the ministry. Thakur praised the revolutionary role of MPSP in educating people and said Brahammleen Mahant Digvijaynath started the Parishad nine decades ago and CM is carrying forward the legacy and continuously working to attain the goal for which it was established. “Education is the base for development of any society in the country and Uttar Pradesh is the first state to implement a new education policy,” he said. The union minister described the importance of sports and social work in front of students and said Yogi is the only CM in India who honored all the Tokyo Olympic winners in a grand programme and now he is constructing sports stadiums and fields in every district of the state and promoting sports among youth. He praised the CM for successfully handling the corona wave in the highest populated state. Thakur told the students that network is very important and it is actually ‘net worth’. While citing the example of Swami Vivekanand, he advised students to face the challenges instead of running away from them.

She added that she hoped UP CM Yogi Adityanath would one day make it possible for devotees to visit the place of worship without any restrictions. After visiting the Krishna Janmasthan temple, Ranaut, who had earlier faced the wrath of protesting farmers for her controversial remarks on the anti-farms laws agitation, wrote: “It’s a very sensitive place with heightened security and no pictures are allowed because of the encroachment of the holy place much like Ram Janmabhoomi (sic)…hopefully, soon @myogi_adityanath will make it possible for devotees to visit the entire premises.” Her post comparing the sacred places in Ayodhya and Mathura comes amid the controversial statement made by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya that the construction of grand temples is on in Ayodhya and Kashi, and preparations are being made for the one in Mathura. The actor "clarified" that she did not tender any apology to farmers after her vehicle was stopped in Punjab’s Rupnagar district by a group of people carrying flags of a farmer outfit on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/krishna-janmasthan-encroached-like-ram-mandir-once-was-kangana/articleshow/88096619.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CM Uddhav Thackeray’s green concern spurs review of tunnel project||MUMBAI: Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has decided to have relook at the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the Thane-Borivli underground tunnel after a nudge by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Thackery, during the release of the Comprehensive Transport Study (CTS)-2, had urged MMRDA to revisit the DPR to ensure there is no ecological damage. A senior MMRDA official said, “We have decided to relook the DPR though our assessment is that there is not major environmental impact as the project is similar to Goregaon-Mulund Link which will also have an underground tunnel.” The tunnel will pass through Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The proposed alignment for this corridor will start at Thane and end at Ekta Nagar on Western Express Highway at Borivli with a twin tube tunnel. The tunnel, work for which will be undertaken by MMRDA, will have six lanes. Meanwhile, Thane Municipal Corporation has invited suggestion and objections for change in land use that is in the alignment of Thane-Borivli twin tunnel, which is expected to reduce travel time between the destinations to 10 minutes. According to a notification issued by the Thane civic body on November 23, 10 locations are affected in Thane for which land use modification has been done. Any person who wants to submit his suggestion or objection to the said modification within 30 days from the publishing of the notice to municipal commissioner, TMC or on the email id-adtp@thanecity.gov.in. The said modification in the plan is on display in the civic body’s Town Planning department’s office and published on the civic authority’s website www.thanecity.gov.in. About 34 ha of land is affected, including 8.4 Ha above ground. And 25.6 Ha underground (below parks and green zones). Completion of the tunnel will cut distance between Thane and the Western Express Highway to just 10 minutes, besides reducing congestion on Ghodbunder road. The existing alignment connects Thane and Borivli via Ghodbunder with length of 23km. At present it takes about 1-2 hours to travel between these points, depending on traffic density. Distance saving because of this corridor between Thane to Borivli will be by about 13 Km. Those traveling by JVLR can also take this tunnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cms-green-concern-spurs-review-of-tunnel-project/articleshow/88097854.cms||Manthank Mehta

---||Delhi||‘Involve community, kids to save Vasant Vihar trees’||New Delhi: Delhi High Court has called for community participation and assistance of schools in Vasant Vihar on a plea alleging inaction of authorities over concretisation of trees. Justice Najmi Waziri said children would be a valuable watch and ward army for protection of trees. “Their participation will be very relevant,” the judge said in an order on November 29. The court noted that substantial work has been undertaken in the past three days apropos removal of loose concrete around trees and washing of trees maintained by the authorities. It further said that South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) went ahead and sprayed water on trees, which were otherwise covered with dust, in the Lajpat Nagar area. A similar exercise has also been accomplished by the public works department, said the court. “The collateral benefit of this exercise is relief to the trees, citizens and for bringing down dust pollution on some arterial roads of the city. It is hoped that this exercise would continue at least for another two weeks so as to mitigate the pollution in these areas. The learned counsel for Delhi Police assures the court that the footpaths shall be kept free of parked cars, so as to make available the footpaths for walking,” the order stated. It said that the residents’ welfare association (RWA), Vasant Vihar, has given a compendium listing each tree in its colony with details of the variety and approximate age of each tree. “SDMC shall treat the same as a census and number each tree. It shall maintain a proper record of the same. Let the conservator of forests submit his report to the court within two months. It may coordinate its efforts with the RWA concerned to ensure that the green cover is maintained and augmented,” the court stated. The court also said that the additional standing counsel for the Delhi government has assured that concerted efforts shall be made to intimate the public and especially the authorities and public agencies about the needs to preserve trees, failing which a penalty of Rs 10,000 and/or imprisonment may be imposed on the party. “The tree officer shall take appropriate action in this regard, including meetings with the RWAs, so as to generate and augment community participation. Workshops, if so required, may also be conducted in the residential colonies,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/involve-community-kids-to-save-vasant-vihar-trees/articleshow/88097243.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The protest in Lakhimpur Kheri was called by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leaders who refused to leave the site despite efforts by the district magistrate and the superintendent of Police. Mill operations in Gola have come to a standstill for the past 48 hours. Farmers said they would leave only after the money was transferred in their bank account and the Gola mill officials were arrested and sent to jail In Lakhimpur Kheri, cane dues have not been paid since December 2020. In November this year, the mill administration had given a written undertaking that dues would be cleared by November 30. Kheri’s DM had on Tuesday ordered an FIR against the sugar mill officials of the Palia unit. Palia BJP MLA Romi Sahni also tried to resolve the matter by seeking CM Yogi Adityanath’s intervention in the matter. While no mill administration official was available for comment, Sanjeev Suman, SP Kheri, said, “We had a word with the mill officials and they said they are not in a position to clear all the dues. However, they promised to pay Rs 10 crore by Monday.” Shree Krishna Verma, farmer leader, told TOI, “We refuse to withdraw the protest as our meeting with the Kheri DM and SP has failed. They were offering money to us as if we were beggars.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/not-paid-cane-farmers-protest-against-mills-in-kheri-shahjahanpur/articleshow/88096629.cms||---

---||Delhi||Home bird & chicks bring hope amid winged guests||New Delhi: As the wetlands of Delhi and surrounding areas have begun to echo with chirps, quacks and whistles of the winged visitors flying here from the far north and central Asia, the nesting of a voiceless and solitary resident bird with three chicks has taken birders by surprise and awe. While conservationists can’t stop worrying about degrading habitats, the nesting of this rare and terrestrial bird species, black-necked stork, at Sultanpur Wildlife Sanctuary has emerged as a silver lining on the future of avifauna in the region. The largest stork of the region flaunts a large black beak with glossy greenish-black head, tail and bars on the wings. The greenish-blue neck and coral-red legs make its appearance strikingly distinct. It is very selective when it comes to building a nest or breeding, so spotting a nest with chicks is extremely rare. “The female with yellow eyes was seen with three chicks in a nest in a tree. This solitary bird prefers an undisturbed habitat, so one tree often has only one nest as they don’t live in colonies. Earlier, some nests were spotted in different habitats, but they were abandoned, perhaps due to breach of peace. There are hardly a dozen breeding pairs of this species in this region,” said birder KB Singh, who spotted and clicked the stork’s nest and chicks along with fellow birder Reginold Thankappa. As the carnivore requires lots of food and is known to live for up to 40 years in captivity, the stork’s nest hints at a healthy habitat and the presence of a good prey base. “This stork is a very unusual species and purely carnivorous terrestrial bird. The entire Haryana and NCR won’t have more than 20 breeding pairs, so this sighting is rare. Sultanpur used to have such breeding pairs in the 1990s, but they left for the countryside. This pair might have returned due to development work in the countryside. It’s very difficult to find its nest. The bird has sight fidelity, which means they often nest on a tree used earlier,” said KS Gopi Sundar, scientist at Nature Conservation Foundation and co-chair of the IUCN Stork, Ibis and Spoonbill Specialist Group. Sundar added that since the chicks alone consume over 800 grams of meat, the stork’s return to Sultanpur must be a sign of a healthy prey base. “The bird is carnivorous and consumes a lot of meat, especially fish. As soon as the chicks become over two months old, they consume 800 grams to 1kg of food. The adults can eat even more,” he said. Eminent birder and author Bikram Grewal said the bird was notorious and famous as a bully. “It’s a very good sighting from the conservation and habitat’s perspective. The black-necked stork is becoming extremely rare and highly endangered. It’s a strange species, standalone and a bully and it disturbs other smaller birds a lot. It often kills other small water birds, like egret, jacana and others,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/home-bird-chicks-bring-hope-amid-winged-guests/articleshow/88097893.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Pune||Irrigation minister: No plan to cut Pune’s water supply||PUNE: State irrigation minister Jayant Patil said on Saturday that there was no plan to reduce water supply from dams to the city. The irrigation department had sent a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday informing about its plans to reduce water supply to the city starting this week. The move was opposed by various civic organisations and elected members. Patil, while addressing media persons here, said no step would be taken to curtail water supply to the city from dams. He further said measures would be taken to provide adequate water to the 34 villages recently merged in the PMC limits so that these areas did not face water scarcity. “Options such as construction of barrages are being explored to make available more water to Pune city and district up to Ujani considering increase in population and the growing demand for water. The figures of new census will be considered to work out water supply plan for the city. All the elected representatives and stakeholders will be taken into confidence while preparing the plan,” Patil said. The minister claimed that the city’s water supply was cut when the BJP was in power in the state by shutting down the pumps that lift water for the city. “Altogether 11 letters threatening water cut were sent to the PMC when the BJP was ruling the state. Our government does not have such policy to cut city’s water,” he added. The minister expressed the need to recycle water and release it for agriculture. He said, “Municipal corporations like Mumbai and Pune have already been asked to recycle water. The PMC has not utilised the finances allotted for water recycling projects. The projects have not been commissioned to full capacity. The tenders also have been delayed. The BJP is in power in the PMC for the last five years. It should explain the reasons behind the delay,” he said. Meanwhile, mayor Muralidhar Mohol welcomed Patil’s announcement not to cut the city’s water supply. He said that the minister should explain why the letter was issued by the state irrigation department to the PMC stating that water would be cut with immediate effect. Mohol said that steps were being taken to utilise water efficiently by reducing wastage and losses. Irrigation department officials had said that as per the contract, 11TMC water has been allotted to the PMC. so around 900MLD to 950MLD should be lifted from Khadakwasla. But the civic body has been lifting 1,460MLD water from the dam, and between 180MLD and 200MLD from the Bhama Akshed dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irrigation-minister-no-plan-to-cut-punes-water-supply/articleshow/88097254.cms||---

Devi died soon afterward at a district hospital that the cops took her to. Those living next door alleged that her son, 27-year-old Pankaj Kumar, locked her inside their house for 20 days without food, even though she was bedridden and suffered from psoriasis. The incident took place in the Durga Prasad locality, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Bisalpur police station. Devi lived with Kumar in a house allotted to her by the district urban development agency under the Aasra housing scheme. Kumar usually stayed outside for work and was unmarried. Police are trying to trace him. Bisalpur's station house officer (SHO), Naresh Tyagi, told TOI, “We got a call from one Manish Kumar, who suspected that an elderly woman in his neighbourhood was unwell. He claimed that her son had locked her inside without food for over 20 days. We rushed to the spot, broke the door, and found the woman lying unconscious. We took her to a community health centre. After initial treatment, doctors advised us to take her to a higher centre in Pilibhit city. We provided her with the best care but she couldn’t survive. Locals told us that her son often locked her inside the house without food. We have been unable to contact him so far.” Neighbours used to give Devi food through a window, Tyagi said. He added that an autopsy report was awaited and so far, no evidence of starvation had been found. However, Tyagi said that her death was "definitely because of her son's negligence." Police will cremate Devi's body on Sunday. No complaint has been registered against her son so far. Devi's neighbour, Manish Kumar, told TOI, “A few days ago, my children heard Devi begging for food from inside her house. She was in a pitiful condition and was barely able to move. She told me that her son had locked her inside and hadn't returned for over 15 days. We offered food and water but on Thursday, no one noticed any movement inside. On Friday, we informed the police, who found her unconscious. I wish her son had sent her to an old age home instead of locking her inside the house alone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/elderly-woman-dies-after-son-locks-her-up-for-20-days-without-food/articleshow/88096645.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Now settled in New Zealand, left-arm spinner Ajaz’s family hails from the Kantharia village. On Saturday, Patel became only the third bowler in Test cricket history to achieve a perfect-10. Mohammad Musa Kapadia, maternal grandfather of Ajaz said that he was delighted at the feat. “All of us are overjoyed by what Ajaz has achieved. He has made a place for himself in cricketing history,” said Kapadaia, brother of Ajaz’s maternal grandmother. Describing his early days, Kapadia said that after moving to New Zealand Ajaz used to play with his uncle Saeed Patel, who works as coach in a local cricket league there. Kapadia, who hails from Bharuch, is also a permanent resident of New Zealand. He has been living in Bharuch for the last one year due to Covid restrictions. “Every family member is proud of Ajaz. That he achieved the feat at his birthplace is like icing on the cake. We are trying to meet him but due to Covid-19 restrictions we are yet to get permission,” said Ajaz’s uncle Akeel Patel. Akeel is the younger brother of Ajaz’s mother, Shehnaz. Ajaz’s father Yunus, who used to run an electronics sales and service business in Mumbai’s Jogeshwari area, migrated to New Zealand in 1996. Yunus now runs a tyre business in Auckland. “Ajaz practices really hard to make his game perfect. He has two younger sisters,” said Akeel, who runs a car rental business in Mumbai. All brothers of Yunus are settled in NZ. “Ajaz is a wonderful cricketer. After his selection in the Kiwi team, we invited him to be the chief guest for one of our local tournaments. But due to a busy schedule he couldn’t make it. I attended his marriage in Mumbai and I am happy for him,” said Arif Bapuji, a relative of Ajaz. Not just the family members but every villager cheered for Ajaz, said Yaqub Dudhwala, a farmer from Kantharia. “All in the village are happy that the boy whose family hails from our village secured 10 wickets in an innings,” said Dudhwala.

The project work has been expedited in last couple of months. Officials said work is underway on three fronts — construction of overhead tanks, laying of water distribution pipelines, and installation of water meters. A total of 82 overhead tanks are expected to be constructed, while there is a plan to lay 1,550km distribution pipeline network and 120km of transmission lines across the city. A total of 3.18 lakh automatic water meters will be installed as a part of the project expected to be completed by March 2023. The work of overhead tanks has progressed near to halfway mark. About 550km (about 35%) long water distribution pipelines have been laid, while over 54,000 water meters (18%) have been installed so far. Aniruddh Pavaskar, head of the PMC’s water supply department, said the work is underway across the city in full swing. . “There has been some resistance to installing water meters. We are engaging with local elected representatives to clear doubts of residents and expedite the installations.

Officials said as the government had kept the name of Kashi Vishwanath corridor project a secret till the PM laid its foundation, it is expected that this time too the suspense would be cleared only a day or two before the formal opening of the expanded shrine area. “The shrine area had officially come to be known as Kashi Vishwanath Dham only when the PM had reached the city on March 8, 2019 to perform the ‘bhumi pujan’ of the project,” a district administration official told TOI on Saturday. Talking to TOI, divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board Deepak Agrawal said, “Each of the newly constructed seven artistic gates and 24 buildings on KV Dham campus will be given special names. A list of names has been prepared and sent to the state government. The naming will be done only after the approval of the state government.” Till the state government clears this list of names, the board officials have declined to disclose it. However, they expect that the process would be completed before the formal opening of KVD by the PM in a grand ceremony proposed at Mandir Chowk on December 13. “Of the seven beautifully constructed artistic gates, four are in Kashi Vishwanath temple premises inside the KVD and three at the entrance points, including one at the Ganga and another at Chhattadwar, which is currently known as Godowlia Dwar and is used by the devotees for entering the temple,” said KVT chief executive officer Sunil Verma. After the formation of BJP government in the state in 2017, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had initiated the project to expand the area of this prime shrine, which houses one of the 12 Jyotirlingas, in order to develop facilities as per its stature. The project began with the purchase of 320 buildings and their removal. According to PWD executive engineer Sanjay Gore, who is supervising the project, the KVD has come up in an area of 5.30-lakh sq/ft.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/suspense-over-names-of-kvds-seven-gates-24-bldgs-continues/articleshow/88096679.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The plot owners, of which a majority are retired persons, are unable to construct houses on their plots since the last six years. On January 1, TOI reported how 317 plots owners are running pillar to post for constructing houses on their plots for the last five years following construction of an overhead water tank and road by the NIT on some plots instead of the public utility (PU) land. “Office bearers of the association met NIT officials and requested them to approve the revised plan of the layout. The officials, whom we met earlier, have either retired or have been transferred. All the relevant documents, including demarcation of all plots and layout by the city survey office, are available in the file. Despite documents, officials directed us to again clean the grass and weeds on the plots and do the demarcation. We requested them to do the needful. We have no other option than to engage machinery and do the entire exercise again. This is for the third time that we have started to clean grass, weeds and plants on all plots and do the demarcation,” secretary of the association Kiran Lanjewar told TOI. NIT officials assured the association that that they would visit the site and check the demarcation. “We have spent around Rs 4 lakh on process. We raised this money from plot owners who have no other option than to contribute to construct their dream houses,” said Lanjewar. According to the association, the layout with an area of 67,461.8 sqmt was laid out in 1996 at Chinchbhuvan. The NIT had regularized plots under the Gunthewari Act followed by approval of the layout’s plan in 2001. Six years ago, the NIT allegedly constructed a tank on plots assuming them to be PU land. It did nothing to identify the exact location of PU land. The consent of the association is a distant dream. The NIT also did not inform the association about the tank’s construction. The association did the demarcation of all plots only to learn that the NIT constructed a tank and a road on plots. Instead of demanding action against concerned officials, the association shifted the road and submitted a revised plan to solve the problem. Instead of approving the plan, NIT officials are allegedly citing one or the other reason. For the last one and a half years, the case was pending after the state government removed powers of the planning authority of the NIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/to-correct-own-mistake-nit-forces-socy-to-demarcate-plots-for-3rd-time/articleshow/88096684.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The state public health department is seeking information from the Bureau of Immigration to reach out to these travellers and getting them tested. “This is a part of our extended surveillance, besides checking for those arriving at the airport. We have sought the names of those who returned to the state from abroad and sought help of the local authorities to track and test them,” said the state surveillance expert, Dr Pradeep Awate. As many as 271 travellers from high-risk countries were traced in Mumbai and 148 of them were tested. Another 426 such people were tracked in other parts of the state and 277 of them were tested. Some reports are awaited. Samples of those who had tested positive on return but recovered are being sent for genome sequencing. The Maharashtra government in its new guidelines directed the officials to track the travellers returning to the state last month from high-risk and at-risk countries. “The issue arises when the person in question has travelled to another city for work. In such cases, tracing and tracking take time. Local authorities have been asked to speed up the testing,” Awate said. In the last two days, a total of 2,821 travellers arriving at Mumbai airport from high-risk countries underwent RT-PCR test. Two samples tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/697-from-abroad-tracked-in-in-last-15-days-health-dept/articleshow/88097286.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The government had issued a notice to AA on Friday on the grounds that its crew of a New York-Delhi flight did not randomly identify the required 2% passengers for on-arrival testing at IGIA. Passengers randomly selected “shall be escorted by the concerned airlines/aviation ministry to the testing area on arrival. The GM of the concerned airline is hereby show caused for not complying with the directions...,” says the notice issued by Delhi Cantonment SDM Piyush Arun Rohankar. AA said in a statement: “American Airlines holds the health and well-being of our customers and team members as our highest priority, and we take care to abide by Covid-19 guidelines and all other rules and regulations established by governments in markets where we operate. We received the notice and believe our flight was in compliance with the latest guidelines, and we have responded accordingly.” The New Delhi district administration has also issued show cause notices to Air India and a private airline from Iran for alleged violation of passenger boarding guidelines issued following the emergence of Omicron, PTI reported on Saturday. Officials said three passengers — one each in Air India flights from Dubai and Amritsar, and the third travelling in a Mahan Air flight from Tehran — were allowed boarding without filing up their personal details. No response was available from the two airlines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/didnt-violate-testing-rules-us-airline-says-in-reply/articleshow/88097918.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Peter Mukerjea gets bail in laundering case||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court granted bail to Peter Mukerjea on Saturday in the INX Media money laundering case, allegedly involving former Union minister P Chidambaram and his son Karti. Special Judge MK Nagpal granted him bail on a bond of Rs 1 lakh with an equal surety amount and directed him not to leave the country without its permission and not to tamper with evidence. The court said investigation associated with Mukerjea “is already complete” and he had appeared before the investigating officer on four occasions as and when he was asked to. It said evidence against Mukerjea, the former director and chief operating officer of INX Media, has been mainly documentary and he wasn’t in a condition to tamper with it. “Hence, no useful purpose is going to be served by denying bail to the applicant and taking him into custody when he was not arrested during investigation.” The CBI registered its case on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance granted to INX Media for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 when Chidambaram was Union finance minister. The Enforcement Directorate had lodged a money laundering case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/peter-mukerjea-gets-bail-in-laundering-case/articleshow/88097917.cms||Usha Das
---||Delhi||Delhi University’s new credit norms not matching central body plan||NEW DELHI: Certain guidelines mentioned in a draft National Higher Education Qualifications Framework (NHEQF), which is currently being prepared by the Centre, and the structure of four-year undergraduate programme adopted by Delhi University (DU) appear not in sync. While the draft NHEQF entails that a four-year bachelor’s degree programme will require 160 credits, the structure of the four-year undergraduate programme, which has received DU’s nod, states that 196 credits will be required at the end of the course. Another aspect to be considered by the university is awarding of a bachelor’s with honours degree after a three-year course. According to the NHEQF, after a three-year programme comprising six semesters, students will be awarded a bachelor’s degree in a particular discipline. However, according to the FYUP structure adopted by DU, students can be awarded a bachelor’s degree with honours in their respective courses after three years itself. DU claims to have contacted the University Grants Commission regarding these differences. DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh told TOI, “On both these aspects, we have requested the UGC to reconsider. We have suggested that the 160 credits be considered as minimum ones. As for the bachelor’s degree with honours after three years, we have told the UGC that since we’re already awarding such degrees currently, we would like to continue with it. We will now wait and see what the UGC says following which the next course of action will be taken.” The recommendations, which were proposed by the NEP implementation committee of DU, had stated that a four-year bachelor’s degree in arts, commerce and science courses would require 196 credits. A similar requirement is there for a four-year BSc (H) degree in physical science, life science, mathematical science and BA (H) in humanities and social sciences. According to members of a committee that is deliberating on the issue, the varsity will have to rethink this aspect if the ministry notifies the lesser requirement of credits. “The NHEQF is still in the process of being finalised. It has to be seen what gets notified finally. If the ministry states that the minimum requirement is 160 credits and universities can take a call beyond that, then it is okay. Otherwise, DU will have to rethink this aspect,” a member said. Another DU official said: “The FYUP will most certainly be rolled out in the varsity in the next academic session and hence, a call on these issues will be taken soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dus-new-credit-norms-not-matching-central-body-plan/articleshow/88097283.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Delhi||FYUP courses likely to get more practical approach||New Delhi: With Delhi University (DU) gearing up to roll out its four-year undergraduate programme from the next academic session, various committees set up by the varsity are currently working out the modalities, senior officials said. One of the aspects being deliberated upon is how to teach new courses like ethics and social and emotional learning that have been proposed. Under the recommendations proposed by the NEP implementation committee of the varsity, the proposed structure includes social and emotional learning, innovation and entrepreneurship, ethics and culture and co-curricular courses. These courses are likely to have a more practical approach and the pattern of teaching is being worked out, senior officials said. The committee is likely to finalise its report and submit the same by March for approvals from the university’s statutory bodies. A member of the committee said, “The FYUP, which is set to be rolled out, is a more refined version under the NEP mandate. Daily meetings are being held and course structures are being made. We want the courses to have a more practical approach. They will be project-based, application-based or software-based. They may also include field trips. For example, in the ethics course, more than theoretical aspects, it is important to have a practical approach.” The member stated that after the course structure is completed, teachers will be trained accordingly. “We are concentrating on how to teach the courses so that those teaching the courses can be trained as well. The recommendations will be finalised by February so that the report can be placed before the statutory bodies by March.” PC Joshi, pro-vice chancellor of the varsity, said, “We do not want to do anything in haste and hence, a lot of deliberations are being done, especially for the six new courses. All details are being worked out and discussions are taking place before the structure is formally adopted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fyup-courses-likely-to-get-more-practical-approach/articleshow/88097291.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Drunk biker crashes into shooting set in Kolkata, injures actors||KOLKATA: A drunk biker crashed into a film set on New Town Main Arterial Road and injured two actors late on Friday night when the shooting was on for a Hoichoi web series. Actor Priyanka Sarkar fractured her right tibia in the accident while her co-star Arjun Chakrabarty was also injured. They were shooting for the first season of cinematographer-turned-director Soumik Halder’s ‘Mahabaharat Murders’. Chakrabarty told TOI that both actors were sitting on a bike and getting ready for the shoot. “It was the last day of our Kolkata schedule. We were almost packing up and not even moving when this drunk biker rammed into us at a very high speed. Priyanka’s leg was smashed in the process,” he said. The bike involved in the accidentBoth were immediately taken to the Ohio Hospital. “I went for a check-up and thankfully, there are no hidden fractures. I have a bandage on. There is a lot of pain and I can’t move my leg freely. Oral medicines, ice pack and rest have been recommended,” he added. The spokesperson of the OTT platform told TOI that the accident was “very unfortunate”. “We are hoping that she recovers soon,” the spokesperson said. The biker, the spokesperson confirmed, was an ‘outsider’ and not connected to the shooting unit. According to Eco Park police station, the accident happened around 11.30pm. “The Hoichoi production team had taken prior permission for a shooting. During one of the shots of an action sequence, a bike entered the shooting cordon, causing injury to the actor. She has suffered a fracture in the bone above the knee and is currently undergoing treatment at AMRI Mukundapur,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate. Police said they have arrested the biker and have seized the bike. Sarkar was shifted to AMRI Hospital Mukundapur on Saturday. Her ex-husband — actor Arunadoy Banerjee — was at the hospital on Saturday evening when she underwent an ORIF (open reduction internal fixation) surgery under orthopaedic consultant Vishal Bhagat. “I am at the hospital while our son is at Priyanka’s place. I spoke to her before the surgery. She was in distress. It was a long surgery and I wish her a speedy recovery,” he said. A plate was implanted to set her broken bone in place. ORIF, a surgery to fix severely broken bones, is only used for serious fractures that can’t be treated with a cast or splint. “Her tibia got shattered. So we did a surgery where we had to put dual plating on both sides of the tibia to make a strong construct along with some artificial bone grafting. The patient is in a stable condition. We are hoping to discharge her in two-three days,” Bhagat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/drunk-biker-crashes-into-shooting-set-injures-actors/articleshow/88096690.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Covid-19: 42% fully vaccinated in Bengal, 88% got at least one jab||KOLKATA: Even as states take guard against Omicron, health officials in Bengal can take heart from the fact that 88% of the eligible adult population has already been vaccinated with one dose. For over close to two weeks, more than 3.5 lakh people in the state are being consistently administered the second shot in Bengal. By Saturday, a little above 42% in Bengal has been completely vaccinated. “We have scaled up the second dose drive so that maximum number of people get the double dose protection as fast as possible,” said a senior health official. But there is a worry for about 5 lakh-plus healthcare workers, including doctors, most of whose vaccination was completed six months to nine months ago and their immunity to the virus may have declined. Health officials admitted that there was a growing demand for booster doses from the medical community but said it had to wait for the Union health ministry’s decision on booster doses. State health officials said the eligible adult population for the vaccine in the state was pegged at 7.3 crores. With little above 88% already having got at least one dose, more stress is being given on the second now. For the past few days, a total of 6 lakhs doses and above are being administered in Bengal daily. On certain days, only the second dose count touched around 6 lakhs. “Currently, of all the doses administered daily, about 80% is second dose while the rest is first dose. After achieving about 90% first dose coverage, the drive for the first dose will get slowed down and the second dose drive will pick up pace,” said state family welfare officer Ashim Das Malakar. The inoculation drive gained the maximum acceleration between September and October when 4 crore jabs were administered in just a span of 50 days. Sources said most of these were first-dose recipients who have started returning for second dose on completion of 84 days post the first jab. “The rush for second dose will go up further by next week because we had the fastest first-dose coverage between September and October,” said Das Malakar. On Saturday (till 6.30 pm), 3.3 crore plus doses had been dispensed from over 4,000 lakh vaccination sites across the state, of which 2.5 crore plus were the second jab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/42-fully-vaxxed-in-state-88-got-at-least-one-jab/articleshow/88096741.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Brihanmumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said the civic body had made all arrangements for institutional quarantine for these high-risk travellers. According to state government rules, those arriving from high-risk countries — South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe — have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR tests. “If the RT-PCR test is found be to positive, passengers are shifted to a hospital with Covid treatment facilities. Those testing negative must complete seven-day institutional quarantine in Mumbai and then proceed to their hometowns and stay in home quarantine for seven days,” Suresh Kakani, the additional municipal commissioner of Brihanmumbai, told TOI. He said a section of the passengers currently in institutional quarantine were residents of different districts in Maharashtra and some were from other states. The Pune district administration authorities said they would coordinate with the officials in Mumbai to monitor the travellers in home quarantine in their jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/17-travellers-from-high-risk-nations-in-quarantine/articleshow/88097295.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Nagpur||Saamna editorial was in national interest: Patole||Nagpur: Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna’s editorial emphasizing the need to keep Congress as part of a united opposition to keep ‘fascist’ forces at bay, has come in for some superlative praise from the latter’s state unit president Nana Patole. When questioned whether Saamna editorial was written with vested interest to keep the Maha Vikas Aghadi intact, Patole said, “Saamna’s editorial was in national interest, not political.” The editorial comes after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee questioned the Congress-led UPA’s existence. Mamata’s statements about the Congress come at a time when her party is now looking to play a bigger role in national politics. The sweeping victory of TMC in the West Bengal assembly polls despite BJP throwing all its might, has got many political pundits talking about Mamata’s party spreading its reach in other states. But Saamna’s editorial says this may not be a good idea, if it means replacing the Congress. “The last decade of Congress’ downward spiral is worrying, but plans to prevent its rise and take Congress’ place is risky,” the editorial mentioned. On his arrival at Nagpur airport, a visibily pleased Patole said, “All political parties have to take a stand on whether they want to be with those who are trying to save the nation or those trying to sell it. BJP is selling public properties (companies), not allowing a discussion on China’s encroachment in Arunachal Pradesh, destroying the country’s democratic values. Saamna’s article is very apt because only Congress can save the country now.” The third major member of MVA too agreed with Saamna’s editorial. State cabinet minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik said, “For over a year now, our party’s founder Sharad Pawar has been saying that a pan-India opposition front needs to readied to fight the BJP. And he has always said without Congress such a front cannot be thought of. We firmly believe that the Congress needs to be part of a united front going forward.” Malik also said that parties outside the UPA too need to be part of this. “Such parties have around 150 Lok Sabha seats and Pawar saheb has for long been calling for a united opposition. In the near future there will be a united opposition front and who will lead that is not of immediate concern. In fact, a suggestion being floated was that collective leadership should be the way ahead,” said Malik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/saamna-editorial-was-in-national-interest-patole/articleshow/88096734.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The car was going towards Saharanpur from Dehradun. Three members of a family, who were in the car, died on the spot while two others suffered serious injuries. The injured were rushed to a community health centre in Fatehpur, from where doctors referred them to the district hospital. The bus, which had around 40 passengers, has been seized, police said, adding that none of the passengers in the bus were injured. According to station officer (SO), Biharigarh, Manoj Chaudhary, the dead have been identified as Doon-based business owner Praveen Chauhan, 47, a resident of Mehuwala in the city, his wife Madhu Chauhan, 45, and daughter Shilpi Chauhan, 22. The injured persons have been identified as Praveen Chauhan’s sons, Dikshant, 20, and Nishant, 17. “The family was travelling to Saharanpur for carrying out some shopping ahead of their daughter’s engagement on December 19,” Chaudhary said.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cycle rally on Sati abolition day anniversary celebrates women’s empowerment||KOLKATA: Rammohan Library on Saturday organised a cycle rally led by women to mark the 193rd anniversary of sati abolition day. On December 4,1829, due to the efforts of Raja Rammohan Roy, an act was passed by Governor General William Bentinck to abolish sati in the country. More than 150 cycle lovers, especially women, from the city, Burdwan and Midnapore took part in the 12km rally to celebrate emancipation of women. “The idea behind our campaign was to converge three symbols into one theme, beti, books and bicycles, to make people aware that it is through knowledge and cycle that women can attain empowerment and emancipation,” said one of the organisers, adding that the event is part of the year-long celebration of Rammohan Roy’s 250th birth anniversary. The group started their journey from 113, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Roy’s residence and now the office of the deputy commissioner of police, and travelled through Shyambazar, Bagbazar, Girish Chandra Avenue, Kumartuli, Shobhabazar-Sutanuti, Nimtala Ghat Street, Ahiritola, Beadon Street, Raja Rammohan Sarani, Sukia Street and Vidya Sagar Street to get a glimpse of old Kolkata neighbourhoods that boasts of rich history and heritage of the Bengal Renaissance. The rally ended at Rammohan Library on A P C Road. Nabanita Mishra, teacher and founder of West Midnapore Cyclers Club, travelled from Midnapore along with 10 members to participate in the rally. “This is the first time I explored the lanes of old Kolkata on my cycle. Cycle stands for independence, confidence, empowerment and being a woman, leading a rally and a club is itself meaningful,” said Mishra. Sinthee resident Priyanka Mitra said, “Society still imposes restrictions on women and women are still not safe in the country. We hope to bolster women’s rights.” As the cyclists passed through Hatibagan’s ‘theatre para’, the organisers narrated tales of Bijan theatre, Rangmahal, Rangana, Sarkarina, Star theatre and Noti Binodini, and spoke about how the city’s theatre culture has faded. They also spoke about two landmarks — Bangiya Sahitya Parishad and Bangiya Bigyan Parishad. On entering Bagbazar, the cyclists visited the house of actor, director and writer Girish Ghosh. Other landmarks the rally passed by include Minerva theatre, Chaitanya library, Shovabazar Rajbari, Chattu Babu’s house, Bethune College, residences of Vivekananda, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, author Rajsekhar Basu and psychoanalyst Girindrasekhar Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-rally-on-sati-abolition-day-celebrates-womens-empowerment/articleshow/88096729.cms||Dipawali Mitra
---||Pune||Sedentary lifestyle spurs diabetes in younger women||PUNE: A common precursor to diabetes in younger women aged between 20 and 30 is Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS are often insulin resistant — their bodies can make insulin but can’t use it appropriately, which increases their risk of type 2 diabetes, lowering the average for this disease in women considerably lower than the conventionally assumed number of 45 years old. Nisha Pansare, fertility consultant at Nova IVF Fertility, said, “Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with menstrual irregularities and lower fertility rates. Now, even young women have been diagnosed with diabetes during their reproductive years owing to sedentary lifestyles. Diabetic women are more prone to infection and damage to reproductive organs like fallopian tubes. High blood glucose levels lead to miscarriage or congenital defects in the fetus. Increased blood glucose and excessive nutrition for the growing fetus can cause macrosomia (big baby syndrome). Owing to tiredness, depression, stress, and anxiety, many women with diabetes have low sexual desire.” Diabetologist Sushant Rajput echoed, “Factors such as being overweight, consuming a low-fibre and high-sugar diet, low level of physical activity, sedentary lifestyle due to work environments, and high levels of stress can considerably increase chances of women in their 20s and 30s to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.” According to the Office on Women’s Health, US Department of Health and Human Services, 50% of women with PCOS develop either diabetes or prediabetes before the age of 40. A research by Endocrine Society, a global community focused on improving patient care, shaping effective policy, in 2017 revealed that women with PCOS are four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than similar peers without the disorder. “PCOS an also induce infertility, and high blood sugar levels during pregnancy also known as gestational diabetes. It can cause premature delivery, large baby, miscarriage, and birth defects in the babies. Women with diabetes can get urinary tract infections (UTIs) and vaginal yeast infections, one’s periods can also become longer and heavier due to changes in the menstrual cycle,” said Rajeshwari Pawar, consultant, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Motherhood Hospitals, Kharadi. Nutritionist Supriya Kulkarni added, “The best way to keep blood sugar levels in control is to watch what you eat. Stay away from processed foods, fried snacks. Reduce the carbs in your meals and make sure to add 50% of fibre and proteins.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sedentary-lifestyle-spurs-diabetes-in-younger-women/articleshow/88097306.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

These cells are headed by inspector-rank officers. Delhi Police has also started carrying out multiple drives across the city to ensure that people follow Covid protocols. Several teams of police officers are visiting congested areas to educate people and to ask them to follow all Covid protocols. In an order undersigned by special commissioner of police (welfare) Shalini Singh, on December 2, the officer has instructed all the 15 police districts and other units to be fully geared to face any exigency related to Omicron through their respective Covid-19 nodal officers. The order stated that all Covid care centres must be prepared and asked to ensure availability of oxygen cylinders and concentrators, life saving medicines, hospital beds, ambulances, sanitizers, masks, gloves, PPE kits and other essential items. Police officers have also been directed to make the Covid-19 helpline functional at the earliest and gradually step up prosecution of those found violating Covid-appropriate behaviour. Further, the cops have been instructed to get themselves and their families fully vaccinated. Deputy commissioners of police have been tasked with reviewing the medical exemption granted to certain police personnel from vaccination and encouraging them to get vaccinated after consulting doctors. “It will be a DCP-rank officer who shall be the nodal officers for ensuring proper medical facilities to the cops and their families, and an officer of the rank of inspector or above shall visit the hospitalised police personnel and ensure requisite assistance,” the order reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-revive-covid-cells-to-manage-emergencies/articleshow/88097937.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The total number of such people, primarily people with a history of travel to countries such as the UK, France, Belgium and South Africa isolated at Lok Nayak, has reached 16. Except for one with a history of travel to Tanzania, all travellers are asymptomatic, officials said. Covid-19 was marked by high fever, dry cough and a dip in oxygen saturation in the first and the second wave. But reports from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was detected first, suggest the new variant leads mostly to extreme fatigue and body ache, among other symptoms. Health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday that the genome sequencing reports of 12 suspected patients of the Omicron variant would start coming by the weekend, reports ANI. A dedicated team of doctors, nurses and other staff members have been deputed in the ward. The Lok Nayak hospital director added that they were trained to look after the high-risk patients with utmost precaution not to get themselves infected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/four-more-flyers-admitted-to-lnjp/articleshow/88097954.cms||---

The conflict was sparked byelections that were won by the Awami League, which wanted greater autonomy for the region. While the political parties and the military argued over the formation of a new government, many Bengalis became convinced that West Pakistan was blocking their ambitions. Jawans of 40 Medium Regiment move towards DhakaThe attacks on India’s airbases triggered the war with India’s Airforce, Navy and Army responding in a coordinated effort. The war continued between December 3, 1971, and December 16, 1971 after which the head of the Pakistani forces surrendered with 93,000 troops after signing the Instrument of Surrender that led to the creation of Bangladesh. Brigadier PK Ghosh was assigned a difficult task in the Eastern Sector of creating road blocks, intercepting enemy convoys and inflicting casualties on the enemy. “I went into East Pakistan wearing a lungi. My code name was Peter and it was made clear to me that if I get caught, the army will disclaim any knowledge of my activity in East Pakistan,” said Ghosh. Lieutenant General Gurbaksh Singh Sihota on December 9 ordered to find a suitable landing site for helicopter-borne operations in the eastern sector. “I piloted the helicopter deep into the enemy territory where it was even fired upon. But with that damaged helicopter we managed to evacuate two serious casualties. Later in the day, I led a wave of helicopter-borne operations,” said Sihota. Colonel AK Tara was 29 when he went to save the life of the family of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who went onto become the first Prime Minister of Bangladesh. “The Pakistani troops had surrendered but the news had not reached many pockets. I was securing the airport when I was told to move towards the place where Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family were still in captivity. When I was a few meters away from that single-storied house, some people stopped us saying we might be attacked by the captors. I handed my arms to the jawans and went towards the house. They told me to stop but I started a dialogue with them, telling them their army has surrendered. Initially, they did not believe me but when I told them they will get killed once Muktijoddhas come here, they surrendered,” said Tara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangladesh-war-veterans-recall-testing-times-from-1971-battleground/articleshow/88096746.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Madrassa passouts can also look beyond life as clerics||MUMBAI: Mufti Faiyaz Alam is a Qazi or judge at the All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB)-run Shariah court at Nagpada. Ever since he completed his religious education at the famous seminary Darul Uloom Deoband (UP) in 2006, Alam has been looking for an opportunity to enroll himself in a graduation course at a government-recognised university. His search ended last week as Ehtesaab, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh-led NGO helped him join the BA course at Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University (YCMOU). Alam is among 50 madrassa products, most of them working as low-paid imams at mosques or teachers at madrassas, who have been enrolled for graduation courses at YCMOU. They are now in the mainstream education system and, post-graduation, their employability in the open job market will get enhanced. “Even if I don’t join another profession, there is always an advantage in getting additional qualifications. It will help me become a more confident individual. Armed with a graduation degree from a recognized institution, I can face the world better,” said Alam, who wants to do a doctorate. Confidence is the key to success. The maulvis or the madrassa products deserve encouragement to put in extra effort to also see life beyond mosques and madrassas. Since they are unequipped to find jobs in the global market, they have limited options when it comes to choosing jobs. “Why the madrassa products look at life only as imams or preachers? Why can’t they get trained to enhance their employability and live comfortably? These are the questions that haunted me for long and now we are trying to make a little difference with this project,” said Shaikh at his Madanpura-based office where a team helps these maulvis complete the admission process. Career counsellor Amir Ansari who is closely working with Shaikh’s team to ensure that these maulvis who already work as imams, teachers or preachers need proper guidance and motivation to complete their course. “They have to clear a preparatory exam in three subjects (the proficiency in the medium of instruction they have chosen, how will they learn the language and basic mathematics) before their admission is confirmed. Currently we are coaching them to clear the exam,” explained Ansari. Many of those who have joined the course are hafizs or the ones who have memorized the Quran and are now eager to enter the secular education system. Maulana Naushad, an imam at a mosque at Peru Lane in Central Mumbai, said he is proud of his religious education which enabled him to become a hafiz but he doesn’t want to stop there. “Nobody was there in my background to guide me that I could have done another course while I was becoming a hafiz. But then it is never late to learn,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/madrassa-passouts-can-also-look-beyond-life-as-clerics/articleshow/88097950.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Auto unions seek Rs 2 fare hike as CNG cost rises||MUMBAI: The auto unions have used the RTO-approved formula on fare hikes and found that the fare should be Rs 23 for the minimum distance of 1.5 km instead of the present Rs 21. They are now demanding a two-rupee hike in fares for autorickshaws plying in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane. “We have taken into account all the parameters and factors that lead to a fare hike. These include the current cost of living, repair and maintenance costs, capital costs, insurance and taxes and fuel costs of running an auto in Mumbai,” said Thampy Kurien of Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union. The hike is mainly due to an increase in CNG cost by Rs 14 in just ten months of 2021. He further said that every time a hike was approved, there was a formula based on which the fares were increased for both autos and taxis. “I have the basic formula for auto fare hikes and have used actual data to calculate based on the huge increase in fuel and other costs in 2021,” he said. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Transport Authority had approved a fare hike of three rupees for both autos and taxis in March this year. This had led to the minimum auto fare rising from Rs 18 to Rs 21, and the minimum taxi fares increasing to Rs 25 from Rs 22. “But now our calculation shows that the fare will be Rs 15.12 per km –- which comes to Rs 22.68 for minimum flag distance of 1.5 km. This means, the minimum fare should be Rs 23 – a fare hike of Rs 2,” Kurien said. The autorickshaw unions will now petition the state government demanding Rs 2 hike in fares .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-auto-unions-seek-rs-2-fare-hike-as-cng-cost-rises/articleshow/88097956.cms||Somit Sen

The three-day convention, which is being held in Nashik, was inaugurated on Friday. For the convention, Nashik has been referred to as Kusumagraj Nagari in honour of the renowned Marathi poet V V Shirvadkar alias Kusumagraj. The convention is being held at the Bhujbal Knowledge City in Nashik. While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was invited as a special guest, scriptwriter, lyricist Javed Akhtar was the chief guest. Owing to ill health, the chairman of the Sahitya Sammelan Jayant Narlikar could not attend. Fadnavis, in his letter to the organisers, said Nashik is Savarkar’s birthplace as well as his ‘karmabhoomi’. “You named this place only after Kusumagraj. Have you not brought down the prestige of the two great men by ignoring Swatantrayaveer Savarkar? He is our ideal and our inspiration. if he is not being given the respect he deserves then why should we go there?” the former CM said.

---||Pune||NGT junks plea against civic body’s reservoirs on three hills||PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has dismissed an application by three members of the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti challenging the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) move to construct three water tanks on Panchavati, Law College and Fergusson College hills as part of a larger plan for the ‘equitable water supply project’ for Pune city. An NGT bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and expert member Dr Arun Kumar Verma cited a Supreme Court judgment of 2011 while holding on December 2 that “the construction of water tanks/allied activities on the lands in Law College hill and Fergusson College hill on the part of the 1st respondent (PMC) cannot be faulted.” The bench also took note of the forest department’s stand that the PMC’s proposal for diversion of ‘forest land’ is pending consideration and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has granted an in-principle approval to the diversion of ‘reserved forest land’ in Bhamburda area, subject to various conditions. On the alleged reforestation/afforestation said to have taken place, the NGT said that the same is to be monitored at regular intervals. The state departments of environment and forest and the MoEFCC must ensure “periodical and surprise inspection and if any infractions/violations are noted, shall take immediate, necessary and appropriate actions in accordance with law against the concerned violators.” “The said respondents shall also ensure that the trees claimed to have been planted by way of afforestation are reared and maintained properly so that adequate green/forest cover is created,” the order stated. Lawyer Rahul Garg, who represented the municipal corporation, told TOI, “Construction of these three tanks had come to a standstill for more than two years now due to stay order. However, with the dismissal of the plea, the tribunal has given a much-needed boost to the project that is critical to equal pressure and efficient supply of water across the city.” Total 82 new water tanks are being constructed in addition to the existing ones as part of the project, which is to be implemented from 2014 to 2023 keeping in view the city’s projected growth and population by 2047. The original applicants had argued that the three tanks were being constructed on ‘forest’ lands without any clearances from the statutory authorities, including the state forest department and the MoEFCC and that illegal tree felling was done by the project contractor. The municipal corporation had countered these arguments in a detailed affidavit on March 20, highlighting, among other things, why the project was important for Pune city and that more than 50,000 trees had been planted by the project contractor. The green tribunal referred to a slew of Supreme Court judgments pronounced at regular intervals that made certain exceptions to non-forest activity on forest lands “in public interest”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ngt-junks-plea-against-civic-bodys-reservoirs-on-three-hills/articleshow/88097327.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The move has been taken to keep a strict vigil on travellers entering Dharwad district from other states and districts. This apart, the department has formed 11 teams for collecting swab samples in schools, colleges, nursing colleges, hostels, and also at bus stands and railway station. Everyday, swabs of 5,000 persons are being collected, said district health officer (DHO) Dr Yeshwanth Madinkar. He said 36 Covid positive cases have been reported in last three days, but not all of them are linked to SDM Medical College and Hospital. Some cases are of primary contacts of students, doctors and medical staff of the college. After the outbreak of the infection, periphery testing was done. But no positive case has been reported in the last five days, said district surveillance officer Dr Sujatha Hasavimath. The infected ones are kept in government quarantine and those asymptomatic have been asked to be in home isolation. There are less chances of them spreading infection, the doctors said, and added that people near SDM Medical College need not panic but exercise caution. “They have been told to wear masks compulsorily and avoid gatherings. They have also been asked to complete two full doses of Covid vaccination,” she said. Following reports of nursing students in other districts contracting the virus, the department has started random checking of samples in nursing colleges in the district. “Two positive cases have been reported from Ayurveda College at Heggeri in Hubballi and both of them have been isolated. Their health is stable,” Dr Sujata said. Those arriving in the twin cities from high-risk states/ districts are being compulsorily subjected to RT-PCR testing. Until the test reports are out, they have been put in home isolation. Several teams have been formed by HDMC to keep an eye on busy super marts and market areas. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said bill collectors have been deployed at malls and theatres to ensure that only those who have taken two doses of vaccination are allowed entry. Steps are being taken to jab those who have not taken the vaccine, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/36-fresh-cases-reported-in-dharwad-district-in-three-days/articleshow/88096350.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

He added that extra precautions were required to be taken at a time when a new variant of Covid-19 was at rise, but it was disappointing to see that norms were flouted for ensuring that hordes of people assembled for the PM’s rally. “We are with the government in the fight against Covid-19 but the government, too, needs to maintain transparency.” A few days ago, BJP leaders had claimed that a gathering of over 1 lakh would attend the PM’s rally in Dehradun. Meanwhile leader of opposition Pritam Singh said that he was disappointed that the PM did not touch upon issues related to farmers or the Char Dham priests. “There was no mention of inflation, soaring prices of LPG, petrol, diesel and commercial cylinders,” he said, adding that “by claiming false numbers, BJP leaders were trying to set a false narrative before the people.” Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni claimed that it was surprising to see cabinet ministers desperately running around to gather people. “This is a clear message that the rally was a flop show,” she said. Meanwhile, BJP leaders said that “the rally was a resounding success and the PM’s message was effectively conveyed that only the BJP can form a government that can take Uttarakhand forward in the path of development.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-takes-jibe-at-turnout-for-modi-rally/articleshow/88096744.cms||Kautilya Singh

With cutoff marks soaring each year, for admissions to various merit-based undergraduate courses, the varsity had constituted a committee to assess the admission pattern. The committee’s report is likely to be placed at the meeting on Friday. According to sources, it has been recommended that entrances be held for admissions. A member of the committee said, “The broad recommendations include that entrances should happen but the exact modalities will be decided by the academic council. Whether admissions will be based on only entrances or whether a combination of the board results and entrances will be considered and what weightage will be given, has to be seen. These aspects will be deliberated upon by the AC.” The committee was also asked to study the board-wise distribution of students. However, a committee member said that there was “not much of a difference” between admissions that have happened over the years. The AC is also likely to approve the constitution of a New Education Policy (NEP) Cell in the university in accordance with relevant notifications of the University Grants Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-council-to-take-up-issue-of-common-entrance-tests/articleshow/88097340.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The school has only two classrooms in which students of five classes (1-5) are crammed. During a visit to the campus on Friday, TOI found that the primary school has only three teachers catering to around 80 students of various primary classes from 1 to 5. Also, a corner of the first room, where students of classes 1-3 are fitted into, has been turned into the principal's office by just putting a chair and a table. In monsoon, it gets even worse as the walls of the six-decade building start leaking the rainwater into the classrooms. "We have requested the education department for a tin shed roof on our terrace. It will help stop the rainwater and we will get more rooms for the students," said Anju Johari, principal of GPS Rajpur. Notably, the school was established in 1966 and is located on land which ideally comes under the DMC's zonal office, but is run by the state education department.

Muzaffarpur town DSP Ramnaresh Paswan said the operation theatre (OT), medicine shop and offices of the hospital were sealed in the presence of a magistrate. “An FIR was lodged with Brampura police station against the hospital administration for medical negligence leading to the loss of vision of several patients. The OT and other areas have been sealed for fair probe into the incident,” he told this newspaper. Brampura police station SHO Anil Kumar said civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma has made 12 persons accused in the FIR lodged on Thursday after 16 people lost their vision in an alleged botched-up cataract surgery. “According to FIR, 328 people had undergone cataract operation at a free camp between November 22 and 27,” he said. Of them, 65 had undergone operation conducted by only one doctor on November 22. Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh, head of the ophthalmology department at SKMCH, said 12 patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital after their infected eyes had to be removed. “The doctors are continuously monitoring their situation. After cataract surgery, 21 patients were admitted to the hospital with severe infection in their operated eyes. Other nine patients were referred to the IGIMS at Patna on Friday for treatment,” he said. Meanwhile, the state health department has asked the civil surgeons of Muzaffarpur, East Champaran, West Champaran, Samastipur and Sheohar to trace all the patients, who had undergone cataract surgery at the Muzaffarpur hospital during the free camp. They will be brought to IGIMS for medical check-up. Only one patient was from Kushi Nagar in Uttar Pradesh. Special secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar Singh told this newspaper that the list of patients were given to the civil surgeons to trace them. “The culture report has not come yet, but the state-level team members, who visited the eye hospital on Thursday, stated that the OT was not up to the mark. They also said the hospital did not have any regular eye surgeon. Post-operation, a patient’s eyes are to be checked by the surgeon, but in this case, it was done by ophthalmic assistants, their report said,” Sanjay said and added: “The source of infection will be known only from the culture report.” Dr Bibhuti Prashan Sinha, head of ophthalmology department at IGIMS, said the number of admitted patients increased to 15 so far. “Nine patients were brought from Muzaffarpur on Friday while three came on their own in the last 24 hours and three more were sent by the Muzaffarpur civil surgeon on Saturday. All these patients had undergone cataract surgery on November 22 and were experiencing similar problems due to infection,” he said. He said doctors have performed vitrectomy on three patients Friday night and one of them was given intravitreal injection on Saturday. “Fortunately, the infection has not worsened in all the patients. One patient got corneal transplant and another has got patch graft. They are stable. We take it as a positive sign,” Dr Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/private-eye-hospital-in-muz-sealed-after-botched-up-surgery/articleshow/88096335.cms||Faryal Rumi

The stolen jewellery has been recovered. We are planning to file a chargesheet by next week,” said Ajay Pal Lamba, additional commissioner of police (crime). Usually, in rape cases of minor girls, police work to file faster chargesheet, but since this is a serious burglary case, Jaipur police aims for an early chargesheet. He added that police from various states have contacted Jaipur police since similar cases were pending against him in their police stations. :He would be produced in court on Sunday and we will not request for further remand. In that case, he would be sent to jail. When he is in jail, police from various states can apply for production warrant. Also, we have two more cases pending against him in Jaipur,” Lamba added.

But if your waiting time on the lanes is 15-30 minutes, Rs 200 will be charged as entry fee. The Northern Railways resumed collecting the “entry fee” from private and commercial vehicles a couple of weeks back to restrict “unauthorized” parking of vehicles causing congestion in parking lanes. It had introduced the access-controlled parking system last March, but it had to be suspended due to the Covid pandemic. In a written response in Rajya Sabha on Friday, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, “In order to manage movement of traffic and to restrict unauthorised parking of vehicles causing congestion in parking lanes, entry fee (pick-up and drop) charges are levied per vehicle at New Delhi railway station.” Giving details of the entry fee, the ministry said there is no charge for the first eight minutes for private vehicles while for commercial vehicles, it is Rs 30. For 8-15 minutes, the entry fee for both private and commercial vehicles is Rs 50 and for 15-30 minutes waiting, the uniform rate is Rs 200. The minister said, “No pick-up or drop facility will be allowed beyond a period of 30 minutes. However, if a passenger wants to wait beyond 30 minutes then he/ she can park the vehicles in the demarcated area for parking for which parking rates are fixed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parking-fees-up-to-rs-200-back-at-new-delhi-stn/articleshow/88097363.cms||Dipak K Dash

The Union territory of Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (DDDNH) has imposed a night curfew from 11pm to 6am till December-end keeping the Omicron variant scare in mind and also to prevent the risk of Covid spread. There will be no major events organized on December 31, thanks to the fresh restricting orders. After a low-key 2020, a few leading hotels and resorts were planning to hold star-studded parties, but the curfew has dampened all plans in the UT. A large number of tourists and party-goers from Gujarat as well as neighbouring Maharashtra prefer to visit Daman, Diu and Silvassa for year-end celebrations due to the availability of liquor, well-equipped hotels, resorts and other attractions. Vice-president of Daman Hoteliers’ Association Haresh Tangal told TOI, “Due to reimposition of curfew from 11pm, no major party can be planned now. People will have to reach their hotel or leave Daman before the curfew hour. We will approach the administration of Daman to request for relaxation in the timings. If we get permission till 1am at least people will be able to celebrate.” In Daman and Silvassa, such year-end parties start from December 24 onwards and the New Year festivities continue for a week more. While it is good for the revellers, it generates good business for the tourist destination as it pulls in huge crowds. “I always ushered in the New Year in Daman, but will drop my plans this year owing to the curfew. People also need to follow Covid-19 guidelines to fight the pandemic,” said Vidit Desai, a finance consultant from Valsad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/curfew-takes-zing-out-of-new-year-party-plans-in-ut/articleshow/88096763.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

The gang members used to come from Delhi in their vehicles by late evenings and used to return after the thefts early in the morning. Also, they used to execute barefoot during every theft. Police have arrested five persons of the gang who have been involved in at least 20 cases of thefts in Jaipur, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chandigarh and Haryana. DCP (west) Richa Tomar on Saturday said following growing incidents of thefts in Jhotwara, Karni Vihar, Chitrakoot, Vaishali Nagar and Harmada, officers were asked to take strong action and find out the gangs involved in the burglaries. “Our team visited the spots where thefts had taken place and analyzed the video footage available. With technical surveillance, the gang was identified,” said the DCP (west). Tomar said the gang members used their own vehicle. “They used to reach Jaipur late in the evening and unlike other gangs, they were into random selection of the targets. They used to enter residential localities and apartments which were close to national highways. After entering unguarded apartments, they used to select a locked house as their target. While executing the theft, they used to lock the main gates of the neighbours,” Tomar added. The accused were identified as Muglesur(27), Shehjad (21), Sheikh Ataul (20), Aamir(20) and Aaftab (20). “All of them are natives of Delhi and were involved in burglaries not only in Jaipur but also in other states including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-bust-inter-state-gang-involved-in-burglaries-five-arrested/articleshow/88097357.cms||---

It is a tale of two small towns (Satkhira in Bangladesh and Taki in India) that are separated by the Ichhamati river. Drawing inspiration from the real-life story of his mother who grew up as a girl from Satkhira in Khulna and was married to a family on the other side of the river, it explores the pangs of separation and longing of people living across the river border. According to Banerjee, this film will serve as an up, close and personal account of many Indians and Bangladeshis living along the bank of the river and will trigger the unfolding of many untold stories. “The eastern fringe of Bengal – right from Sundarbans to Coochbehar – shares many similarities with the western border areas of Bangladesh. Here, rivers bisect two nations but the people continue to share a common history. Many here don’t believe in these man-made political and geographical borders,” said Banerjee, who has become a familiar name on the small screen after his acting stint in ‘Desher Mati’. Banerjee’s film is dedicated to those who refuse to accept the Radcliffe line. “My grandmother was one such person. When my mother got married to my father in Barrackpore, she was told that her new home would be just across the river in another district. That it involved passport, visa and other official formalities to just pay a visit to my grandmother was a subject that was never discussed before her marriage. But, there was no manipulation in hiding these facts from my mother. What she was told is what her family essentially believed in,” said Banerjee. Crossing the line was easier said than done. Banerjee’s mother could visit her family only once in her 50 years of married life. “Her Bangladesh visa didn’t come through even when my grandmother was seriously ill. One fine morning, a telegram informed us of her demise. That created a tremendous agony for ma,” the director said. In this film, Banerjee has tried to explore this pain of border tales. Being posted as DIG Barasat from June, river patrolling over Ichhamati has been a regular professional exercise. Stories of his mother’s longing haunted him every time he went on a launch cruise touching the water border. “Often our launch goes very close to Satkhira. It is a new district carved out of erstwhile Khulna district. The river that was unsurmountable by my mother was something I was patrolling. This was a strange paradox,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-tribute-to-untold-stories-from-both-sides-of-ichhamati/articleshow/88096772.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The two accused have been identified as Ruban Massy and his father Rajender Massy. Police received a call from one Kunal Paras, who stated that he runs an eatery in Yashwant Place. “He said he was having dinner with Ruban, who is known to him, after shutting his shop. At that time, Rajender, Ruban’s father, came to the place and started abusing and threatening him. He said that when he opposed, Rajender attacked him with a knife used for cutting vegetables,” said a senior police officer. Paras further alleged that when he tried to escape, Rajender and Ruban pinned him down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/father-son-held-for-attacking-eatery-owner-in-chanakyapuri/articleshow/88097991.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt's Rs 5,000 assistance to registered construction workers welcome, but most feel not enough||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is providing assistance of Rs 5,000 to each registered construction worker in the city whose livelihood has been disrupted by the anti-pollution construction ban. The sum, while welcome in such circumstances, hasn’t, however, elated all the labourers. Last week, the state government allotted Rs 350 crore to be given as assistance and said that over seven lakh construction workers registered with Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board stood to benefit. The government also claimed that 2.9 lakh workers had already received the money. A few at Shalimar Bagh who had indeed received the sum, however, expressed dissatisfaction saying that with the government having notified a minimum daily wage of Rs 618 for them, the Rs 5,000 wasn’t sufficient compensation for days lost. Dhaniram Ahirwal said, “It is good that the government is providing us help. But we have already lost 15 days of work since the first construction ban imposed on November 14. The ban has been reimposed by the Supreme Court and is likely to stay for some time. A daily wager earns over Rs 16,000 if he works throughout the month, so Rs 5,000 is a meagre amount.” Ahirwal and his ilk should count themselves lucky. On Wednesday, TOI spoke to labourers at construction workers who weren’t even registered and, therefore, ineligible to receive the compensation. At the Ashram underpass project site, Jitender Yadav said, “I came from Bihar to work at this site. I don’t know how to get registered with the workers’ board. I don’t even have a proper residence. The PWD officers have provided me with free accommodation in Taimur Nagar.” Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board secretary Arun Jha indicated that four lakh construction workers weren’t registered. He said, “Over six lakh construction workers of the estimated 10 lakh in Delhi are registered with the board. The registration of 80,154, however, needs to be renewed. A new lot of one lakh workers have applied for registration.” Contractor Inamul Damu, who is temporarily working in Gurgaon after the Pragati Maidan revamp work came to a halt because of the ban, testily said, “Who are the construction workers who benefit from these government relief? They are those from Delhi who have proof of residence and have a network in the city. The hundreds of migrant workers working in Pragati Maidan and living in a camp in Sarai Kale Khan will not benefit. Their employers will not even help them in registering with the welfare board since they don’t have proof of address in Delhi.” Meanwhile, Rajiv Pandit, a mason in Mukherjee Nagar, said, “When the government’s monetary support isn’t adequate for an unskilled daily-wage labourer, it is far too little for skilled labourers like me.” In fact, several labour union leaders asserted it wasn’t correct for the government to have decided on the compensation without consulting the workers’ board. While the Delhi government spokesperson refused to comment on the views of the workers, a government statement assured, “Till the construction activities remain closed in Delhi, the government will run registration drives on a large scale to list construction workers who aren’t registered with the Construction Board. At the registration camps, Delhi Government will also renew the registration of construction workers with the Board. This way, all the workers can benefit from the schemes introduced for their welfare.” Unhappy at the constant disruption to normal work at the various sites in the city, some PWD officials said workers and their families were being affected and so the department should immediately compensate the labourers working on PWD sites during periods of bans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-5k-welcome-but-most-feel-not-enough/articleshow/88097401.cms||Zumbish

However, Jawad has weakened into a deep depression. At least 50 other trains running through the SCR zone were cancelled by other railway zones. The total number of trains either originating, terminating or passing through the SCR zone was estimated to be around 120. Majority of the trains affected are originating from the East Coast Railway zone which is worst affected by the cyclone, said officials. Among the trains cancelled are the Secunderabad -Howrah Falaknuma Express from Secunderabad, Secunderabad-Guwahati Express, Secunderabad-Bhubaneswar Visakha Express and Howrah-Hyderabad East Coast Express, which terminate in the city. The cancellations have left those who planned to travel over the next few days in a dilemma. As a result, many sought to get their tickets cancelled. Also many trains were rescheduled. Train No 17229 Thiruvananthapuram – Secunderabad Daily Sabari Express, which was to leave Thiruvananthapuram at 07.00 hours, has been rescheduled to leave at 10.00 hours due to traffic regulations at one of the junctions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scr-cancels-12-trains-as-precautionary-step/articleshow/88097409.cms||---

On enquiring, he found that the hospital had not taken permission from the civic body. The commissioner immediately called the garden department and zonal officials who filed a first information report (FIR) against the hospital. TOI learnt that during the investigation, the NMC found that around 6 fully grown trees of different species were heavily chopped. “The reason given by some hospital staff was the problem caused by leaf litter. This is least expected from medical professionals. At least they should understand the importance of trees and not cut it for trivial reasons,” said civic officials. Accepting that it did not have permission to cut the branches, KRIMS hospital stated that they were creating obstruction for patients and their kin. “We have always been pro-environment and since many years we have been doing plantations too. We realize the importance of tree conservation and had planted those trees ourselves,” said administrators Rajesh Mehta and Chandrakant Udgikar in a release. NMC officials said that no citizen can trim or fell trees in their own property without NMC’s permission. “We want to appeal to the citizens to not damage city’s green cover for such small reasons,” said NMC superintendent Amol Chorpagar. The official further informed that to ease the process of seeking permission, the garden department has also empowered zonal officials to grant permission to fell trees for specific reasons. “People don’t need to come all the way to NMC’s main office. They can go to their zone office where officials have been allowed to grant permission for genuine reasons like drying up of tree or if it is posing any danger,” added Chorpagar. Activists demanded that apart from paperwork, strict action should be taken against offenders. “What happens after NMC issues notice or filed FIR is important. Unless stringent punishment is given, nothing will change,” they said. On Friday, TOI reported how the proposed felling of a 208-year-old banyan tree at a private plot in Sitabuldi sparked a controversy. NMC officials informed that they are submitting the objections to state tree authority as the tree comes under ‘heritage’ category. Also, as reported on Saturday, data raveals that 3 trees are being cut every day since the last 80 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fir-against-hospital-for-trimming-trees-sans-permit/articleshow/88097345.cms||Manka Behl

One of them alleged in a letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot that they were not getting treatment at JK Lon Hospital. He demanded to the chief minister to help him to get the treatment which cost around Rs 60 lakh per year. One Rafiq Mohammad, a resident of Balchand Ki Haveli area of Kota, has already lost his six-year-old daughter due to gaucher and high cost of the treatment. Now, his five-year-old son has the same disease. “I have already lost my daughter, I don’t want to lose my son now. I have written to chief minister to help me,” said Rafiq. Rafiq has a vegetable shop in Kota and he is not capable of providing the expensive treatment to his child. “I don’t have much earning and providing treatment to my child is quite difficult. In such cases, we have seen filmstars and businessmen or any social foundation help children. But I do not have any such connection to seek help for my child. I have written to the CM for his help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rare-disease-patient-writes-to-cm-asking-for-help-in-treatment/articleshow/88097406.cms||---

The answer is easy. It is not difficult. But almost next to impossible. That is especially during the peak hours. Parking chaos in the city is deepening by the day, with the BJP-ruled municipal corporation (MC) failing to bring any kind of improvement on the ground, leaving commuters struggling to get hassle-free facilities. What’s more, paid parking contractors have failed to convert the lots into smart. The traffic police has been unable to stop illegal parking along roadsides and other unauthorised places across the city, said sources. A concrete policy is still eluding the authorities. Although the UT administration has held multiple meetings in the past, nothing has been implemented on the ground. Community parking in residential areas was raised by former mayor and BJP councillor Davesh Moudgil in the last monthly general house meeting of November. But like previous times, no roadmap was laid out. Constructing ample parking spaces in commercial areas, improving public transport and imposing congestion charges in main commercial areas have been discussed multiple times in the past many years, but none of the ideas materialised.  Haphazard parking is a routine affair, mainly in parking lots of key commercial locations. “Employees of paid parking are busy issuing parking slips after taking money. Commuters have to struggle to park their vehicles,” said residents. In the name of action, the MC has imposed a penalty on contractors, but that has hardly acted as a deterrent. Vehicles are parked haphazardly at various commercial and residential places across the city. In residential areas, the problem is worst in southern sectors and Manimajra, Even in northern sectors like sectors 7, 15 and 22, hundreds of vehicles can be seen parked in an unauthorised manner. In many places, the situation is such that an emergency vehicle cannot cross the road during the night hours. “This is because people have no option but to park their vehicles on the roads,” said residents. Over three years back, the MC and traffic police had tied up to penalise people parking their vehicles in an unauthorised manner but the problem persists. Recently, UT adviser Dharam Pal had slammed the MC for not managing the paid parking lots according to the smart features. Municipal commissioner Anindita Mitra had then called a meeting of paid parking contractors and asked them to install all the features. WHY THE MESS Chandigarh has the highest per capita ownership of vehicles Thousands of vehicles come and pass through the city on a daily basis As Chandigarh is the joint capital of both Punjab and Haryana, these states have multiple offices in the city and employees of both the states visit the city on daily basis NEEDED, BUT MISSING Community parking Building ample parking spaces in commercial areas Improving public transport Imposing congestion charges in main commercial area 89 | Paid parking lots in the city||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parking-pangs-get-a-whole-lot-worse/articleshow/88096790.cms||Deepak Yadav

Only a few states like Karnataka and Kerala have crossed the 90% first dose inoculation threshold. As per the revised estimates of the Union government, the targeted population for vaccination in AP is about 3.95 crore. The state administered 6.11 crore vaccine doses as of 7 pm on Saturday. First dose has been given to 3.56 crore people. The second dose coverage has exceeded the 64% mark. Nellore, Prakasam and Kurnool districts have already achieved more than 95% first dose coverage. Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and West Godavari are lagging behind compared to other districts. While more than 70% of eligible beneficiaries have been fully vaccinated in Nellore district, the second dose coverage is only some 55% in Srikakulam, the lowest among all districts. Of the total 15,001 village/ward secretariats in the state, 12,834 (86%) secretariats have achieved at least 90% first dose vaccine coverage, with urban secretariats outperforming their rural counterparts in terms of coverage as more than 90% of ward secretariats have given at least one dose to 90% of the eligible population living in their precincts. The Union government has allocated about 5.93 crore vaccine doses to AP till November. The state on its own procured about 21 lakh doses. Private hospitals have got 7.2 lakh doses. The state has inoculated all the targeted population in the 45-plus age group with at least one dose. Despite the deferred rollout of the mass vaccination drive for the 18-44 group, the first dose coverage has exceeded the 75% mark. While a certain degree of complacency crept in among the public with regards to vaccination with the decreasing daily case numbers in the last two months, health state officials are expecting that the new variant Omicron would once again spur the vaccination uptake as had happened with the emergence of the second wave in April-May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-achieves-90-first-dose-covid-19-vaccine-coverage/articleshow/88096793.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Of the 25 buildings inspected so far, which are 60m high, six residential buildings have been found violating safety norms. The owners were issued notices asking them to rectify the violation and report it to fire officials. “We could not carry out any inspection since the pandemic struck last year. We have constituted a committee for inspecting buildings and directives have been issued to each fire station to conduct inspection. Many buildings have been found without maintaining proper fire safety equipment,” said regional fire officer P Dileepan. Fire force will inspect the buildings, which were found violating safety norms, again after a few days. If the building owner or the residents’ associations fail to address the safety violations, the department will give a report to the district collector requesting to act against the concerned under the Disaster Management Act. The building owners should renew their fire no-objection certificate (NOC) every year. It has been found that some owners failed to renew the NOC for the past two years. The fire force department does not have the power to take penal action against those violating the fire safety norms in the buildings. So, they approach the district administration or local bodies requesting to act against violators. It has been found that the talk back system, sprinkler, pump system are not functional and the whole fire system remains not updated in many buildings. The reasons for not renewing the NOC are attributed to various factors like the whole building is not fully occupied or the builder has not handed over it to owners. Fire and rescue authorities say that people do not give importance to fire safety aspects. “Gandhinagar fire station itself had issued notices to some of the high-rise buildings in its limit as they failed to address the defect. Before this, we had conducted inspections in hospitals and they also failed to renew the NOC. Despite repeated inspections and notices, some hospitals do not even rectify the defects. In such cases, we have asked the Kochi corporation to take action against the hospitals concerned,” said Radhakrishnan, Gandhinagar fire station officer. The standard fire and special perils insurance policy is taken by many builders or residents’ associations for buildings. All the documents related to the building should be active to avail insurance protection, if any untoward incident happens. “If the documents, including annual fire safety NOC, are not active due to the failure to renew it annually and a fire incident happens in the building during that period, it won’t get the insurance benefit,” said insurance surveyor Laiju George.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fire-force-starts-inspection-in-bldgs-above-16m-height/articleshow/88096791.cms||T C Sreemol

The water level in the Krishna river had risen and as a result, the Mhaisal and Rajapur barrages were submerged. Three barrages across the Panchaganga river were also likely to get submerged by late Saturday night. This is the first time that these barrages have got submerged in December, that too when the dams are not releasing the water. The showers have also taken a toll on sugar cane cutting and crushing activities. Several huts of the sugar cane cutters in the district were damaged due to waterlogging and heavy fall. As per the Indian Meterological Department (IMD), Kolhapur received 2.4mm rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 8am on Saturday morning. The Karveer region received the highest (2.1mm) rainfall whereas Shirol, Shahuwadi, Chandgad and Gaganbawda region received no rain. Most parts of Satara and Sangli districts received heavy rain on Friday night and Saturday morning. Satara received 10.1mm rainfall in the 24-hour period. Man Dahiwadi region received highest (37.8mm) rainfall, while the Karad region received the least (4.7mm). Sangli received 2.3mm rainfall.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Traffic violators summoned for Lok Adalat on December 11||NAGPUR: Over 2.17 lakh violators have been asked to remain present before the Lok Adalat on December 11 and pay their fines by the traffic police. As per data, from 2019 to 2021 (November end), around 20.35 lakh motorists were penalized for violating various traffic rules and regulations. The fine amounts to be collected from them was calculated to be over Rs 68.29 crore. Out of the 20.35 lakh violators, 11.62 lakh paid the fine (Rs 32.68 crore), but the others have defaulted. Another Rs 35.60 needs to collected. The state government’s plan to launch online system for traffic violators to pay fine has turned out to be a major stumbling block as the pending fines have started accumulating due to non-payment of dues by violators. The notice mentions that violators can pay their fines at the respective 10 traffic police zonal offices if they want to avoid Lok Adalat proceedings. The notices have been sent via SMS to vehicle owners’ registered mobile numbers through a link. If the challan amount is not paid before the Lok Adalat proceedings, judicial action will be taken against the violators, said a traffic cop. Traffic experts praised the traffic police for penalizing violators but at the same time they felt there should also be a system to ensure 100% recovery of fine, which was not being done. “Thus defeating the purpose of penalizing the violators,” experts said. Traffic cops clarified that the primary duty of theirs was to regulate traffic and vehicular movement on the city roads and to discipline errant motorists. During peak hours (morning and evening), the traffic police on the road manage the traffic and try to regulate traffic. During non-peak hours, traffic police are doing smart ‘nakabandi’ under which they randomly check registration numbers of vehicles waiting at traffic signals and if there are pending fines on any vehicles, the motorist is asked to pay up. In the past few days, the traffic police have recovered over Rs 51 lakh pending fine amount from over 11,000 motorists who had defaulted the fines.

Ravinder Pal Singh, who was heading the protest here in Zirakpur said that their primary demand that Punjab domicile person should be given priority in any kind of recruitment and other demands had been accepted by MC officials during a meeting with them on Friday evening. “After our demands were accepted, we ended the strike and have come back for the work,” said Ravinder Pal Singh. Sanitation workers said while they were aware of the importance of their job, the government was not listening to their demands despite the promise made by Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. “We were forced to take to the roads to get what is rightfully ours,” protesting workers said. Sanitation workers, who were protesting under the banner of the Municipal Council Employees Sweepers Union (ETCU), did not allow officials to enter the office from the main gate, forcing them to take a longer route for the past six days. The protesters said most of the employees working for the Zirakpur municipal council were from Panchkula and Chandigarh. They also blamed the council’s executive officer for not filing a proper report with the state government regarding employees and decided to go on a hunger strike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mess-cleared-as-weeklong-strike-of-safai-karamcharis-ends/articleshow/88096799.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Even as 6.41 lakh families have already completed 81-99 days of work so far, it is much less compared to last year’s figures. Last year 12.31 lakh families in Rajasthan had completed 100 days of work. The huge demand for work was attributed to the migration of workers due to the lockdown last year. According to the centre’s MGNREGA portal, while 3.58 lakh families have completed 71-80 days of work under the scheme so far, 4.18 have completed 61-70 days of work. Over 5 lakh families have completed 51-60 days of work so far. Meanwhile, the state government has written to the government of India several times urging them to release funds for material components amounting to Rs 1,000 crore. “Letters have been written by the chief minister (Ashok Gehlot), chief secretary (Niranjan Arya) and the department requesting the centre to release funds for material components. But, we haven’t received the funds yet,” said rural development department secretary Krishna Kant Pathak. “Due to delay in release of funds, several construction works done with material components have stalled. The suppliers delay in supplying equipment. Hence, many construction works remain incomplete,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-74-lakh-families-complete-100-days-work-6-41-lakh-finish-81-99-days-so-far/articleshow/88097432.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

FISAT officials said that students have been working on advanced robotic technology that assists people to deal with their real-life problems. The robot club of FISAT has developed numerous socially relevant projects by understanding the day-to-day patterns and needs of the people they care for. “Rather than simply giving workshops, we are providing hackathons on mask detection using machine learning, which will be implemented with the help of supervised learning paradigm and PC web camera to detect people with or without masks. This is a fundamental project that can be implemented at colleges, airports, hospitals and offices where chances of Covid-19 spread are moderately higher,” said Bejoy, coordinator of the event. He said that DROID 2.0 would be beneficial for the young minds to impart insights on how to set up a successful startup initiative in the field of robotics. Interactive talks will be handled by world’s top roboticists on master courses under robotics. “We are also hosting robotic expos, hackathons with more that 100+ enrolment counts, cultural events, etc,” he said. The faculty said that there was a lot of interest in this field in the wake of social restrictions due to Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/national-conclave-on-robotics-begins/articleshow/88096801.cms||---

But the civic body authorities haven’t replied to it. This will create more problems for the operations of the waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram. KSPCB’s move follows the corporation’s inaction regarding rectification of flaws at its plant. A few months ago, the pollution control board had returned the application filed by the local body seeking licence for operating the solid waste treatment plant.  The board returned the application as the corporation authorities failed to fulfil the requirements while submitting the application. While considering the civic body’s application in 2016, KSPCB had asked the corporation to complete a slew of measures, including setting up a leachate treatment plant. But the corporation couldn’t fulfil the conditions. In August 2021, KSPCB officials had conducted an inspection at Brahmapuram and found that the facilities there were far from satisfactory. “As the next step, we gave refusal intention notice to the corporation. They haven’t replied so far. Now, we are planning to refuse the application submitted by the local body seeking authorization from us,” an official with KSPCB said. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had asked the corporation to file a report on the status of the solid waste treatment plant by September 27, 2021. The NGT had sought report from the corporation after KSPCB submitting a report before the tribunal stating that the condition of the plant and the facilities there were pathetic. KSPCB in its report submitted on July 29, 2021, had stated that the corporation hasn’t obtained the necessary authorization from the board for operating the solid waste treatment plant. A team from the NGT had visited the plant in February 2019 and gave instructions for improving the facilities and addressing the shortcomings. But the corporation authorities are still unable to construct a proper plant to treat the leachate coming out from the treatment plant. In the absence of a plant to treat the leachate, the waste water is being percolating into the groundwater and nearby Kadambrayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pcb-likely-to-deny-nod-for-solid-waste-treatment-plant/articleshow/88096798.cms||---

Huda officials have observed that a few violators return after the drive and legal action is required against them. Huda officials started the encroachment drive soon after instructions were received. The team removed encroachments from Sector 20 twice but street vendors started coming back again and the authority plans to take legal action against them. Earlier, legal action was taken in Sector 7, when the then Huda estate officer Mamta Sharma lodged a police complaint. Last week, Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that a large-scale anti-encroachment drive was required to remove encroachments from city sectors and from government land. Gupta asked officials to remove encroachments, failing which they would face action. “We do not require officers in Panchkula who are not willing to work for development of the city,” he asserted. Gupta asked the DC to prepare a detailed report of the action taken on encroachments in the city. During the meeting, Gupta said that junior engineers (JEs) and police post in-charges of areas concerned would be held liable if encroachments were found in their areas. Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said that a tender of Rs 50 lakh had been taken out for fencing on MC land. Gupta gave a list of priority works to newly-appointed DC Mahavir Kaushik for strict implementation. However, street vendors who have been displaced said that their livelihood was in danger as they had been removed but not given an alternative space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/recurring-encroachments-huda-to-take-action-against-violators/articleshow/88096806.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

In the current session of Parliament, the government made it clear that there was no proposal to form a separate Vidarbha. Addressing the media on Saturday, VRAS said that before the 2014 general assembly polls, BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had given in writing that if voted to power, the saffron party shall create Vidarbha state. VRAS members say even though BJP rode to power once again in 2019, they went back on their promise about Vidarbha. VRAS president VS Chatap said, “On December 7, in every district of Vidarbha, our members will burn effigies to draw their attention towards this issue.” VRAS went on to say that in 1997 itself, BJP in its party convention in Vidarbha had taken up the issue. A statement issued by VRAS says the Maharashtra government is heavily indebted and there’s no way they can complete their obligations towards Vidarbha. The pro-Vidarbha activists say the irrigation backlog of Vidarbha is so massive that the debt-laden state coffers will never be able to complete pending projects. “In such a scenario, it will be best for Vidarbha to be a separate state,” said the statement signed by Chatap. Others pro-Vidarbha leaders like Ranjana Marmade, Arun Kedar, Mukesh Masurkar, Vishnupant Ashtekar, Sreenivas Khandewale, PKB Chakraborty, Tatya Matte, M Bhagwant and Kapil Iddhe were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pro-vidarbha-activists-to-burn-modi-effigies-on-dec-7/articleshow/88096807.cms||---

JNUSU however, appealed to the students’ community to come for the programme and proceeded with the screening. Stating that no prior permission had been sought for the screening, the university administration said that “such unauthorised activity may disturb communal harmony and the peaceful environment” of the campus. The circular issued by the administration read, “The students or individuals concerned are firmly advised to cancel the proposed programme immediately failing which strict disciplinary action as per the university rules may be initiated against those responsible for this event. The students are also instructed not to get provoked by the pamphlet, which is unauthorised and unwarranted.” Aishe Ghosh, president of JNUSU, responded, “It is ironic that the pretext of this request by the JNU administration has been that the screening might disturb the peace and communal harmony of campus. The film in question has received national awards and has been aired on national television for its advocacy of secularism and exposure of communalism. Thus, to say that it will incite communalism points to the flawed and communal mindset of the JNU administration itself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnu-bars-docu-screening-union-doesnt-comply/articleshow/88097999.cms||---

According to NKDA officials, commuters used to face trouble, locating addresses as the place was new and there was no indication of the street numbers. People had to depend on roadside tea stalls or eateries for directions. “To sort out this problem for commuters and motorists, a pilot project was taken up in Action Area I to instal street signages at the entry points of every inner lane and street, mentioning the particular block and street number. After positive feedback, it has been decided to instal such signages in other localities of Action Area II and III as well,” said a NKDA official. Apart from the names of the blocks and the street numbers, some signages also mention the names of prominent buildings in the area. “Earlier, locating a house in New Town used to be rather difficult. But now, the boards at the road corners have made it easier,” said Kaustav Dey, a resident of New Town BA block. “This has been a very good measure taken by the authorities as people earlier had to ask locals to finds houses across New Town,” said Samaresh Das, a resident of New Town and chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of residents’ forums. “People often find it difficult to locate a housing complex in this area as all look the same with very few landmarks. Such street signage will help immensely,” said Supratim Karmakar, a resident of a housing complex in Action Area II.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/illuminated-street-signages-to-come-up-across-new-town/articleshow/88096820.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Health Minister Greg Hunt said medical regulators had granted provisional approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to be administered to younger children for the first time. It follows similar decisions in the European Union, the United States, Israel and Canada. Hunt said the vaccination of 2.3 million Australian children in the cohort will start on January 10, subject to approval from the nation's immunisation advisory body. "It is recommended for children right across Australia," he said of the vaccine. "It is about keeping our kids safe, keeping our families safe, keeping all Australians safe." The Therapeutic Goods Administration regulatory authority said children aged five to 11 would receive a smaller vaccine dose than people 12 years old and above. Agency head John Skerritt said he was confident in both the efficacy and safety of the formulation, adding "it has extensively been clinically tested". Almost 93 percent of Australians aged over 16 have now received a first vaccine dose, with 88 percent of the population double-dosed. Booster shots were authorised in October, with people encouraged to receive their third jab after six months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/australia-approves-covid-vaccine-for-children-aged-5-11/articleshow/88098700.cms||---

Though police have been acting tough against the sale of tobacco products ever since the ban imposed by the government in May 2013, they have not been able to stop it. Youths including college students keep the business thriving. Information received from the arrested accused shows that gutka has been finding its way to Tamil Nadu from Karnataka where it is not banned. “Even though we could trace the manufacturers of gutka products in Karnataka, since its manufacturing is not banned in that state, they escape legal actions from our side. So, we are attempting to curb the sale here by seizing and arresting them,” IGP central zone V Balakrishnan told ToI. Ganja is smuggled to Tamil Nadu from Visakhapattinam in Andhra Pradesh.

The private players in the market are offering throwaway price to the farmers, denying minimum support price (MSP) offered by the state government. This year, the CCI had announced an MSP of Rs 6,250 per quintal, while the market price now is just Rs 4,500 to Rs 5,500. The price is offered at the whims and fancies of the private buyers in the absence of the CCI in the market. The price which was around Rs 9,000 per quintal in the beginning of the season had come down to Rs 4,500 now. The private buyers are rejecting the yield at the market platforms on the grounds of quality, particularly discolour. The cotton is cultivated in 6.06 lakh hectors, which is close to 15 lakh acres, this year, with an estimated yield of 19 lakh bales (84.5 lakh quintals) at a productivity rate of 536 kg per hectare, according to the reports of the Agriculture Market Intelligence Centre of Acharya NG Ranga Agriculture University. While the entire country was estimated to produce 371 lakh bales of cotton from 129.57 lakh hectors in this season, Andhra Pradesh contributes 19 lakh bales. Interestingly, Andhra Pradesh is one of the third highest cotton producing state in the country, after Maharashtra and Gujarat. AP is a part of the Cotton Basket of India, including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana, which collectively contribute two-thirds country’s cotton production. Cotton is produced in Kurnool, Guntur, Anantapur, Krishna and Prakasam districts, the top five districts in terms of area of cultivation and production. The price which was around Rs 6,000 per quintal in July 2020 had come down to Rs 2,500 in August 2020 and currently fluctuates around Rs 4,500 to Rs 5000 per quintal at the Adoni market in Kurnool district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cotton-farmers-hit-hard-as-cci-yet-to-enter-market-ensure-msp/articleshow/88096817.cms||Gopi Dara

Sighting of the satyr tragopan was first reported by Hickell in 1842, between the present Kurseong and Sonada region. In 1863 Jerdon and in 1933 Inglis reported the presence of the bird, locally called “munal” near Darjeeling at 7,000-8,000 feet and the present Singalila National Park. The Darjeeling Wildlife Division officials sighted and captured the birds in the Sonada second block in August this year. The announcement was made on Saturday to coincide with World Wildlife Conservation Day. “It is a success for our years of conservation effort. We can now tell the world that the bird is also there in our very own Senchel Wildlife Sanctuary,” said the Darjeeling Wildlife Division, DFO, Suratna Sherpa, on the sidelines of a workshop on bird conservation.  “Till date, we did not have any form of official photographic proof. This is the first time after 178 years that we managed to sight and rediscover the birds,” Sherpa said. “We first sighted a female satyr tragopan in April. Then we set up camera traps which in July captured a male tragopan. And in August this year, we sighted three males,” said Rachana Pradhan, the deputy ranger, who was the first to sight the birds in their natural habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rare-bird-spotted-in-darjeeling-sanctuary/articleshow/88096850.cms||Deep Gazmer

---||Dehradun||As temperatures plunge, those seeking shelter say raen baseras can 'do better'||Dehradun: The city’s homeless population has started moving into raen baseras to find some warmth during a harsh winter. However, occupants allege that the facility lacks many basic amenities, including security guards. The Dehradun municipal corporation (DMC) runs the shelters. Most establishments see people spending the night and leaving in the morning to earn a living. For Mahi Siraz, taking care of her three children is her priority. However, the lack of a permanent housing situation keeps her worried about their safety and health, especially during the cold. “My eldest daughter, who is nine, and I sell balloons at traffic signals and markets around ISBT. I lost my husband a few years back and subsequently my house a few months later. Ever since then, we have been on the streets, fending for ourselves. We spend most of our nights under the flyover but since it is getting colder, I take my kids with me to the raen basera near Indresh hospital. We don’t have many facilities there but at least we have space to spend the night. These shelters can do better,” Siraz, who hails from Bareilly, said. Some say the establishments lack certain amenities. “What we severely lack here is proper security. We should have at least three guards working in shifts for crowd control. However, we have none right now. There are only three staff members who are looking after everything. This is taxing for all of us. We have been asking for guards for a while but the problem hasn’t been solved yet. This poses a serious security concern,” said a supervisor at a shelter near the clock tower. A beneficiary at the shelter added that while they get decent blankets and morning tea, it would be helpful if they received at least one meal as well. DMC currently has four shelters operating in the city. These are in Patel Nagar, clock tower, Chunna Bhatta, and Transport Nagar. They are capable of housing more than 500 people. “The raen baseras in the city are being managed by DMC. We will gradually expand as the need arises,” said deputy municipal commissioner Rohitash Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-temperatures-plunge-those-seeking-shelter-say-raen-baseras-can-do-better/articleshow/88096856.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Prior to this, the daily average was about 4,500. On Saturday, 6,102 vaccine doses were administered. Health authorities feel this is because of fears over Omicron. Also, the South Africa returnee who violated quarantine protocol on December 2 was shifted to GMSH-16 on Friday after her saturation levels started decreasing. Her Covid test again yielded a negative result. She will be tested again on December 8. The genome sequencing report of the Sector 36 resident who returned from South Africa and tested positive on the eighth day is still awaited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/avg-vaccination-on-sat-highest-since-oct-9/articleshow/88096853.cms||---
---||Patna||Make four Bihar cities ‘smart’ in real sense: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Saturday asked the urban development and housing department (UDHD) officials to expedite construction works in the state’s four cities selected under the Smart City Mission and make them “smart” in real sense. Patna, Muzaffarpur, Biharsharif and Bhagalpur in Bihar have been selected under the Centre’s Smart City Mission. Addressing a government event at ‘Samvad’ hall of the CM secretariat after inaugurating and laying foundation stones for several projects of the UDHD and the Patna Smart City Mission, Nitish said, “Only the name should not be ‘Smart City’, these cities should be refurbished as ‘smart’ in real sense. As the project has been named ‘Smart City’, the cities selected under it must be made smart.” Expressing concern over delay in beginning of works under the Smart City Mission, the CM said, “There was excessive delay in Patna. However, some work has started in Patna. It is a matter of happiness. I congratulate deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad and the UDHD for beginning the work. However, work has not been started at other three cities yet.” The CM asked the deputy CM, who also holds the UDHD portfolio, to start work in the other three cities. Nitish assured the UDHD officials that the state government would provide sufficient funds to make these four cities ‘smart’. “Only one part of the funds under the Smart City Mission come from the Centre. Major part is provided by the state government. The cities will not become smart by allocation of meagre funds. We have already held a meeting over this issue. We will provide all necessary funds to make these cities smart in a real sense,” Nitish said. He also asked the officials to expedite the work on the Greater Patna project whose draft was prepared in 2013-14 financial year. Highlighting the pace of urbanisation in the state during his 16-year tenure so far, Nitish said, “When we got an opportunity to work for the people of the state in 2005, we made several efforts to ensure development in urban areas and their continuous progress. In 2005, there were only 112 urban bodies in Bihar. The number increased to 258 in 2021. Similarly, the total population of urban bodies in 2005 was around 81.49 lakh and it increased to 158.71 lakh in 2021.” Nitish also inaugurated 12,515 houses built in different towns under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U). He handed over the keys of newly-built houses to four beneficiaries – Manju Devi, Sushila Devi, Sanjida Parveen and Shamima Khatoon – at the function. The CM also handed over the loan amount of over Rs 5.81 crore to 479 self-help groups (SHGs) under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Antyodaya Yojana. Earlier, the CM inaugurated 12 schemes and laid foundation stones for another 15 projects under the Patna Smart City Mission. He also inaugurated 15 projects of the UDHD and laid foundation stones for several schemes of the department. Deputy CM and the UDHD’s principal secretary Anand Kishor also addressed the function.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-make-four-bihar-cities-smart-in-real-sense/articleshow/88096410.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Delhi||Delhi: 31-year-old man held for luring 50 people with DDA job offers||NEW DELHI: A 31-year-old man who cheated more than 50 people on the pretext of providing jobs in Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was arrested from Moti Nagar, police said on Saturday. The accused was identified as Anil Singh, a resident of Basai Dara Pur. According to police, they received a cheating complaint in the cyber police station (north-west). The complainant, Satpal Singh, told police that he posted an advertisement in a newspaper regarding the marriage of his daughter. “On seeing the advertisement, someone called him and projected himself as senior assistant director in DDA and became friendly with him,” an officer said. After some days, he told the complainant that internal vacancies were available in DDA and that he could get the latter’s son appointed in DDA. He later asked the complainant to deposit Rs 30,000 for the opening of a bank account in SBI for his son’s salary purpose. “Satpal made payment through the wallet and thereafter, the accused switched off his phone,” the officer said, adding that a case was then registered. During the probe, they found that Anil was residing in Mangolpuri. “It was found that the family had disowned him in the year 2013 as he was habitual in cheating people,” the officer said. While the probe was on, they received another complaint where the victim was duped through a similar modus operandi. “We got the location of the accused in Moti Nagar. It was found that Anil regularly visited a tea stall. He was arrested on Friday,” an officer said. Anil told the cops that he got the information and contact numbers of his targets through different advertisements in newspapers. In 2013, he duped 46 women. In every instance, he used a different SIM for calling his target and after cheating them, he would destroy the SIMs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-luring-50-with-dda-job-offers/articleshow/88098022.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: New variant fear drives up weekly vaccination count||PUNE: The latest week has seen over a 100% surge in weekly vaccination in comparison to the beginning of November, with some private vaccination sites also reporting a spike in daily footfall and increased demand for Sputnik and Covishield. The week saw nearly 63.24 lakh doses being administered in the state, against less than 40 lakh weekly doses administered earlier in November. This was the highest so far since the vaccination drive began in Maharashtra. A major reason for the surge was the fear of Omicron variant, stated the state health officials and hospitals’ authorities. State immunisation officer Dr Sachin Desai told TOI, “We are currently administering an average of 9 lakh jabs daily. This trend is taking us closer to completing all first doses by December-end, three months after which the entire population of eligible beneficiaries in the state is likely to be fully vaccinated. This means by March 2022, Maharashtra may achieve 100% full vaccination of all its eligible beneficiaries.” Another state public health department official said, “A major reason for an increase in the number of people coming forward to get the jabs this week is the fear of Omicron. It is prompting them to get their pending doses or first shots now. Some private vaccination centres have also reported a rise in daily vaccination, but the increase there is not as much as government sites because the latter still have ample doses.” Dr Madhav Chavan, the managing director of Phoenix Hospital, told TOI, “Daily vaccination has doubled for Covishield and Sputnik V, after reports of Omicron started circulating. We have seen a sudden surge in demand for Sputnik’s both the doses for a week. Also, those whose second doses were pending and were delaying it are now coming forward to get the shot.” Dr Sidram K Raut, the director of Noble Hospitals, told TOI, “The fear of the new variant is driving footfalls for vaccination, a trend seen during swine flu. Daily beneficiaries, including corporates, have now started turning up to get their second shots, which wasn’t the case before. Even repeated reminders from hospital authorities couldn’t get people to get their second shots. We have seen a 10-20% increase in daily jabs in the last few days.” A similar trend was noticed in the US, where vaccinations peaked at around 3.4 million per day, after reports of Omicron. Vidya Yeravdekar, the principal director of Symbiosis Society, said Symbiosis University Hospital & Research Centre had seen an increase in the number of enquiries for booster shots. Yeravdekar said the hospital was planning a public lecture on booster doses soon to dispel the myths and answer important questions on the issue. Dr Rebecca John, deputy medical director, Ruby Hall Clinic, said the facility was getting enquiries for booster doses earlier, which further surged in the last one week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-variant-fear-drives-up-weekly-vaccination-count/articleshow/88097485.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||SEC to deploy 32,00 cops for Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls||KOLKATA: The State Election Commission is planning to deploy around 32,000 men in uniform for the KMC polls on December 19. Sources in SEC hinted the commission was in favour of deploying cops from Kolkata Police and Bengal Police and not central forces, as demanded by BJP. The reason cited for not calling central forces is the incident at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar during the Assembly elections on April 10, when CISF personnel had allegedly opened fire outside a booth, leading to the deaths of four persons, sources said. BJP had asked for central forces, alleging the state and Kolkata Police acted in a biased manner. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, too, had called for deployment of central forces during his recent meeting with State Election Commissioner Sourav Das. Das later held a meeting with DGP Manoj Malvya and Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra. After the meeting, an official said that 27,000 personnel from Kolkata Police and 5,000 from state police would be deployed. No civic volunteer would be assigned poll duty, as EC had earlier objected to it. So far, it has been decided that in each booth, the controlling officer will be a sub-inspector of police. There will be 1,707 premises which will house 4,742 booths and there will be another 385 auxiliary booths. Under the sub-inspectors at the booths, an ASI, two armed constables and two constables with lathi might be deployed. But, an IPS officer pointed out, it was too early to decide on the final arrangements. The force will be deployed, depending on political tension and vulnerability. The SEC will again hold a meeting on Monday to decide on deployments and fine-tune the arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sec-to-deploy-32k-cops-for-kmc-polls/articleshow/88096862.cms||Debashis Konar
---||Pune||Pricier vegetables may cost even more: APMC officials||PUNE: The cost of vegetables has increased by at least 20-30% in retail and wholesale markets due to lower intake and arrival in the last two days, according to Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials, traders and others. Some said the rates are expected to increase further as vegetables that were in the harvesting stage have been damaged in the unseasonal rain that lashed Pune and neighbouring districts in the last three days. Dutta Kalamkar, head of the vegetable section at the Gultekdi market yard, said 600 trucks of vegetables arrived in the market on Friday against the usual 1,600 trucks. “Most farmers could not harvest their vegetables due to the rainfall. Also, several acres of vegetable crops have been damaged due to the rain, leading to less produce arriving in the market. The demand and supply equation has been disturbed, causing prices to increase 20-30%,” Kalamkar told TOI on Saturday. APMC officials said there will be more clarity on rates on Sunday, which usually witnesses high arrival of vegetables in the market. “The prices of leafy vegetables that had reduced in the last ten days are very likely to increase again. Many vegetable growers have told us this,” added Kalamkar. Vilas Bhujbal, president of commission agents at the market yard, said, the vegetables currently arriving in the market are not of good quality but are being sold at higher rates due to the increased demand. “Fresh vegetable arrivals will happen after one-two weeks. Till then, the rates are likely to remain high in wholesale as well as retail markets,” said Bhujbal. Farmers, meanwhile, are despairing the financial losses. “One kg of coriander seeds costs Rs350. I had planted nearly 20kg. Due to the heavy rainfall, I could not harvest even on bunch. Only vendors will make money from the increased rates,” said Kaluram Thorat, a farmer from Daund taluka. Citizens said they have been purchasing vegetables at high rates for the last two-and-a-half months. “A bunch of coriander costs more than Rs15. And now, prices will increase more. Continuously increasing prices have disrupted many household budgets,” said Deepali Kale, a resident of Kothrud. Deepti Deshpande, an IT professional, complained that vendors charge more than double what vegetables cost in the wholesale markets. “Their rates are not regulated at all. One can understand 20-30% more, but doubling prices makes a huge difference,” said Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pricier-vegetables-may-cost-even-more-apmc-officials/articleshow/88096865.cms||---

The ship ran aground at Tenneti Park during a cyclone in October last year. It will be made a floating restaurant in the next six months. The 79-meter-long ship has two cargo holds and both would be developed as restaurants of two types. One will have sky roof and glass dome with air conditioning. There will be an air-conditioned restaurant also inside the ship. Tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao said the ship was abandoned by the owner, and M/s Gill Marines of Visakhapatnam took over it from the insurers M/s PNI Club (North of England) for a price of Rs 1.25 crore. “It would be remodelled and developed with recreation components at an estimated cost of Rs 10.5 crore. Entry ticket price will be different in morning, evening and weekend slots,” Gill Marines’ representative said. We decided to develop the project in PPP mode after consulting port officials and experts, the minister said. The state government is keen on developing various tourist destinations with necessary facilities. A cruise terminal will also come into reality soon, the minister added. Cruise from here to Kakinada, Krishnapatnam, and Chennai will be possible in a year or two. “Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is keen on cruise tourism as there is no cruise on East Coast till date. We are also planning for eco-tourism, temple, boat, and river tourism. The state’s tourism policy is investor-friendly,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/abandoned-ship-to-turn-floating-restaurant/articleshow/88096858.cms||Siva G
---||Dehradun||PM Modi kicks off projects worth Rs 18k crore in U’khand ahead of polls||Dehradun: In his second visit to poll-bound Uttarakhand in the span of a month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated seven projects and laid foundation stones for 11 others, cumulatively worth Rs 18,000 crore, and in a not-so-veiled attack on opposition Congress, said that “those falling apart in India cannot develop Uttarakhand”. Addressing the gathering at the Parade Ground in Doon, the PM made a strong pitch for voting the BJP back to power in the state, “We have a young face in the form of CM Dhami and a strong team with vast experience. Those who are being scattered away throughout the country can do nothing for Uttarakhand. With the blessings of the people, the ‘double engine government’ at the state and Centre will continue to work for Uttarakhand in the future.” Continuing his attack on the opposition, the PM said, “With time, a new form of politics has emerged, in which parties tend to pamper one caste, religion and discriminate in development policies. Such parties don’t allow people to become strong but make them dependent on the government. We follow a path that is difficult but in the interest of the country. We do not practice vote-bank politics, but follow ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’.” The PM said the previous governments “did not work on infrastructure of border areas in hills as seriously as they should have.” He added that the BJP government had to “make up for lack of development during the UPA tenure.” “Parties questioning the performance of the 'double engine' government need to realise that between 2007 and 2014, the then government constructed national highway roads of 288 km in length and spent only Rs 600 crore. In contrast, we spent Rs 12,000 crore on 2,000 km of highways.” He added that in the last five years, the Centre released over Rs 1 lakh crore for Uttarakhand’s development. Laying the foundation for the Rs-8,600 crore Delhi-Dehradun Expressway economic corridor, the PM said that the 175-km-long highway will not only cut travel time between the two cities from six to two and a half hours, but also benefit residents of Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Haridwar, Shamli and Baghpat, as there will be major interchanges for these cities on the stretch. The PM also announced that “Asia’s biggest elevated wildlife corridor, which will be 12 km long, will be built on the highway and reduce man-animal conflict by allowing safe passage to wildlife”. Notably, the e-way has triggered protests among residents and concern among environmentalists, as 11,000 trees would need to be chopped for it, leaving Shivalik slopes prone to landslides and the wildlife vulnerable. Several protests have been organised by citizens on this and some activists have moved court to stop the tree felling. On December 2, the NGT asked two petitioners to submit a list of mitigation measures in a week and said it will pronounce its judgement thereafter. The PM also claimed that infrastructural development at the four Char Dham shrines has made the pilgrimage smooth, while laying the foundation for Rs 220-crore development projects at Badrinath and Rs 54-crore development at Gangotri and Yamunotri. Apart from these, the PM laid foundations for a Rs 2,082-crore road project to link Haridwar with the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, the Rs 1,602-crore Haridwar ring road project, Rs 69-crore bridge next to Lakshman Jhula, Rs 1,695-crore Dehradun-Paonta Sahib 50-km route and the Najibabad-Kotdwar (NH-119) road widening worth Rs 86 crore. Modi also laid foundations for the Rs 538-crore Haridwar Medical College, Rs 724-crore water supply, road and drainage infrastructure in Dehradun and a Rs 58-crore Child Friendly City Project in Dehradun. The PM also inaugurated seven projects worth a total of Rs 2,573 crore. These included the 120 MW Vyasi hydro electricity project with a 86-metre-high dam, worth Rs 1,777 crore. He said the 415 million units of power that will be produced at the hydel plant will include around 353 million units of green energy per year. Besides, he inaugurated the Integrated Himalayan Cultural Centre, worth Rs 67 crore, to exhibit the state’s cultural wealth and six essential perfume oil and aromatics laboratories covering 20,560 square feet, constructed in Dehradun at a cost of Rs 40 crore. The PM reiterated that “the third decade of the century belongs to Uttarakhand.” Concluding his speech, he recited a poem that he said he had composed for Uttarakhand a few years ago.

---||Nagpur||Look out for back pain among students due to prolonged sitting posture in school||Nagpur: As schools in rural Nagpur welcome back students on campus, one of the issues facing kids is how they will sit upright for the two or three hours of study. Online class attendance has given the flexibility to students for getting up from their chair, dashing off to the washroom at will and sometimes even lying down by switching off the camera. But these same primary school kids won’t be able to do the same when back on campus. Sitting upright on a wooden/fibre bench for a prolonged duration is very likely to be a problem for them. Parents feel that schools need to innovate now and integrate some kind of physical activity in the limited time spent at school. As per the SOPs, children are not allowed to play on the ground to prevent them coming in close contact with each other. Pankaj Jain, a parent, said, “Small breaks can be provided between two classes so that kids get relief for some time and don’t affect their backs. To solve this problem, it’s important that physical activities are scheduled on the first day in the morning. Also, stretching and yoga should be encouraged so that the mind and body both come back to discipline.” Another parent, Simran Nagpal, said, “Students should have a heavy breakfast before class. Their breakfast should include fibres to keep them full for long hours before class so that they do not face any problem. Kids should be made to watch videos on yoga stretches by teachers which they can practice at home so that they do not face problems while attending classes.” Parent Shivani Mandhare said, “Having no breaks could be a huge problem when it comes to kids. They are not in the habit of sitting in one place and this may affect their posture and overall health. However, kids adapt to new things much easier than others. So, there is a possibility the transition may be seamless.” She added that teachers can adopt activities that involve a lot of moving and make children stand and stretch every 15 to 30 minutes. Parent Sudha Chauhan said, “I am more worried about kids who started their academic life in online mode. They do not know what a school looks like, they do not know about sitting in a classroom. At schools, they have to sit for hours, which is a matter of concern for all parents. Schools should initially open physical classes on alternate days and they should also take small breaks between classes.” Shailendra Sharma, a parent, said, “In order to prevent stiff necks and back pain caused by prolonged hours in the same position, teachers should ensure that children are made to do stretching exercises for a couple of minutes in class every half an hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/look-out-for-back-pain-among-students-due-to-prolonged-sitting-posture-in-school/articleshow/88096890.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Allahabad||HC turns down bail plea of ex-MLA accused of assaulting man in lock-up||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has rejected the bail application of a former MLA convicted by a lower court for assaulting a person in police lock-up, observing that “nowadays, legislators and political persons consider themselves to be above law... this menace cannot be taken lightly and should be dealt with an iron hand”. The appellant, Hasratulla Shervani, was a sitting member of UP Legislative Assembly when this incident took place on August 30, 2012. Hearing the appeal filed by Shervani, seeking suspension of sentence and his release on bail during the pendency of an appeal against lower court’s conviction order, Justice Mohd Aslam observed, “It was his duty to raise the issue of misuse of law in the Assembly and get it remedied. But instead of it he himself misused the law and took law in his hand and pressurized the police personnel to adopt third degree and get him lodged in police lock up. This act of the accused amounts to misuse of police machinery, therefore, his act deserves no sympathy instead of condemnation.” The additional district and sessions judge, Kasganj had on August 25, 2021 convicted Shervani and seven others under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC), including the offence of attempt to murder. They were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment of two years with a fine of Rs 1,000 each. As per the prosecution case, one Shamsad was lodged in police lock-up in connection with a case. On August 30, 2012 at 2 pm, the accused-appellant Shervani, the then MLA along with other persons including his relatives and supporters, went to the police station and instructed the police to beat Shamshad so badly that he became crippled by foot and hand. After that, Shervani, armed with rifle and gun along with his supporters, who were armed with sticks, proceeded towards the police lock-up, caught hold of Shamshad’s hand from the outside and assaulted him with an intention to kill him by the butt of the rifle. Shamshad could be saved only when then SHO Ram Murti Yadav intervened. Thereafter, Shamshad lodged an FIR in this connection against the appellant and seven others on September 14, 2012 at police station Dhalana of Kasganj district. It was contended by the counsel for accused-appellants that the informant/injured as well as other eyewitnesses had turned hostile and only two police personnel supported the prosecution. Opposing the bail plea, the state counsel argued that Shervani was an elected member of the Legislative Assembly and had crossed all limits and also obstructed the police in performing their official duties. At the outset, the court perused the injury report and found that it prima facie supported the contents of the FIR. Therefore, the court opined that in these circumstances and that the injured had turned hostile is of no consequence. The court in this judgment dated November 12 also noted that it appeared that on the influence of Shervani, the witnesses have turned hostile. The court, however, allowed the bail application of other seven accused-appellants, noting that they had followed the then MLA and the sentence awarded to them will remain suspended during the pendency of the appeal. The court has also listed their appeal against the lower court judgment for a final hearing on January 10, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-bail-plea-of-ex-mla-accused-of-assaulting-man-in-lock-up/articleshow/88096884.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||‘Centre yet to clear state’s balance GST compensation’||Aurangabad: A reply to an application made under the Right To Information (RTI) Act has revealed that of all the states in the country, Maharashtra has the highest amount of balance GST compensation — Rs 6,430 crore — which is yet to be released by the central government. Prafful Sarda, who is an officer on special duty (OSD) to the minister of state Kuchik Raghunath, sought the information under RTI. Sarda told TOI, “This is surprising to know that till date more than Rs 6,400 crore state GST is pending with the union finance ministry. First, it was discrimination over medical colleges and fund allocation, now it is state GST money which is purposely kept on hold by the finance ministry.” The outstanding amount includes GST compensation dues, the amount released from proceeds of cess and back to back loan. The RTI shows that GST compensation from April 2020 to March this year, state’s balance GST compensation was Rs 20,213 crore, against which back to back loan of Rs 13,782 crore was obtained, leaving Rs 6,723 crore as a balance to be received from centre.

The traders' union of Bazpur also came in support of Arya and the market was closed soon after the incident. Notably, Yashpal Arya, the legislator from Bazpur, who was transport minister in the ruling BJP government, and his son Sanjiv, the legislator from Nainital, left the saffron party in October and join the Congress. Arya and his son had come to attend a public meeting on Saturday afternoon when the incident took place near Lewda bridge. Talking to the media, Sanjiv Arya said that their convoy was attacked by a group of around two dozen people led by BJP supported zila panchayat member from Bazpur, Kulwinder Singh Kinda. "It was a conspiracy to kill me and my father. The group of goons in the guise of political protesters stopped the cars and then assaulted us with sticks and sharp-edged weapons. Our supporters and the Congress workers along with our security personnel managed to protect us and we were taken to the city police station. A few supporters put their lives on the line to save us and sustained grievous injuries. We demand stern action against Kinda and his henchmen,” said Sanjiv Arya. Meanwhile, SP (crime) Mithilesh Singh rushed to the spot with a police posse and took stock of the situation. He tried to pacify the Congress workers promising to arrest the accused soon. Yashpal Arya said that the attack was planned at the behest of senior leaders of the BJP. "This is an attack on democracy. We will take the matter to the state-level and will not move from the Bazpur police station until the attackers are arrested,” he added. In the meantime, Congress leadership has announced to stage a protest at CM’s house on Sunday against the attack on Arya. Former CM Harish Rawat, Congress state in-charge Devendra Yadav and leader of the opposition Pritam Singh will lead the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ex-minister-yashpal-aryas-convoy-attacked-in-us-nagar/articleshow/88096895.cms||Aakash Ahuja

A passenger, Raju Motiram Chinchwadkar (62), suffered injuries to his backbone when the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus went over the road hump in high speed. TimesViewThe Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) authorities should take immediate action against the negligent driver responsible for the bus passenger’s injury in the backbone. They should also put a system in place to track the buses on roads and maintain a vigil on their drivers. It would help curb speeding and negligent driving for sure. Police, on the other hand, should act strictly against the rowdy PMPML drivers.Senior police inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of Bharati Vidyapeeth police said, “The bus was heading towards Katraj from Vimannagar and the bus driver, according to the complaint, was driving at a high speed. The bus jumped over a speed breaker in front of Katraj Zoological Park around 5.30pm, and Chinchwadkar, who was sitting in the last row of the bus suffered injuries to his backbone.” Speaking to TOI, Chinchwadkar’s son Nilesh said, “My father sells fruits in Mandai and he had taken a day off on November 27. He had gone to Nana Peth to meet his ailing cousin. After meeting his cousin, my father boarded a bus heading towards Katraj to reach home.” “The bus driver was driving at a high speed and the bus jumped over a speed breaker. My father was sitting in the last row and he was flung into the air owing to the impact of the bus on the speed breaker. He landed on the seat but other passengers fell on him,” Nilesh said. “He was in pain. After he reached home, we took him to a private hospital at Dhankawadi and his tests were conducted. The doctor’s report states he has suffered injuries in his backbone and needs to undergo a surgery. We thus decided to lodge a complaint with the police,” he said. A PMPML official said he needs to get more details on the incident before commenting. “Drivers at the PMPML have always been sensitized and trained to adhere to speed limits in the city on different roads. There are clear instructions to drive at moderate speed limits in the city. Conductors have also been told to alert drivers from time to time and also inform them about the load factor in buses and the presence of a large number of senior citizens or women in a bus. Careful driving is extremely important. We would look into the matter and fresh sessions on this will be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/passenger-suffers-backbone-injury-after-speeding-bus-jumps-on-road-hump/articleshow/88096885.cms||---

The museum has transformed two paintings and a sculpture into tactile artwork that can be “viewed” by the blind. This is the pilot project in what the museum promises will be a continuous effort to make more exhibits in the painting and other galleries accessible to persons with disabilities, particularly the visually challenged to whom the Indian Museum has been a dark space till now. 3D impressions of ‘Simul Tree’ have been created“The blind have till now not had an opportunity to view the two-century old Indian Museum’s rich and diverse repository. This is the first of many important steps that we intend to take to make Indian Museum more inclusive,” said Indian Museum director Arijit Dutta Choudhury, who had agreed to the initiative when suggested by painting gallery curator Arnab Basu. Roy had for years been bothered by the lack of access to artwork by the blind. Encouraged by the director’s nod, he, along with ceramic artist Gargee Ghosh and Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys’ Academy principal Biswajit Ghosh, began an experiment on how to make artwork viewable to those with impaired vision. The experiment has been christened ‘The Melody of Touch’ after the name he had given to a painting of a blind girl feeling a flower on Central Avenue three decades ago. “We created a 3D impression of the paintings. For starters, we have converted two works: ‘Simul Tree’ by Binodbehari Mukherjee and ‘Tear Drops on a Lotus Leaf ’ by Abanindranath Tagore.We also created a replica of the 18th century sculpture, ‘Women Playing Tambourine’. I have tried to transform the lines and shades in the paintings into a tactile model. The works were developed in clay and cast in plaster,” Roy said. Students from RKM Blind Boys’ Academy helped provide a short note on the artist and the work in Braille. Museum education officer Sayan Bhattacharya, who has made their online programmes more inclusive by offering persons with disabilities a platform to express themselves, said the effort would continue. “We have ramps and elevators with Braille buttons. There are disabled-friendly washrooms for men and women. The signages and descriptions in the Bharhut gallery are in Braille. In the next one year, we will try to create a section in each gallery, where the blind can get an experience. Work is also underway on an audio guide,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/please-touch-museum-turns-3-artworks-tactile-for-blind/articleshow/88096896.cms||Subhro Niyogi

According to the weather department, the city may see light rain on Sunday night and Monday morning that may not affect the air quality much but will start bringing the mercury down and make the days cloudy with shallow fog in the morning. The city’s air quality had been tossing within “very poor” to “severe” levels for the past month. Track the pollution level in your cityOn Saturday, Delhi saw an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 362, on a scale of 0 to 500, against 346 a day earlier. Low wind speed and consistent emission, especially in some NCR cities, led to lesser dispersion of the pollutants rather than those coming in. According to the ministry of Earth sciences’ IITM, emissions from Jhajjar contributed to 18%-23% of the capital’s PM2.5 while local transport were contributed 8%-14%. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the AQI is likely to worsen due to poor ventilation. “The AQI today indicates ‘very poor’ air quality. Till November 6, winds are likely to reduce ventilation, leading to degradation of air quality but within the same category. From December 7 onwards, winds are expected to increase dispersing pollutants, but AQI is likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category,” said a statement from SAFAR. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city is likely to see rains again towards Sunday evening and strong winds after next week. “There are strong chances of light rains between Sunday night and Monday morning, which will increase the cloudiness,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-likely-to-improve-with-weekend-rain-strong-winds/articleshow/88098039.cms||---

Of his four-acre fig plantation, two acres that were at the harvesting stage have suffered 70% damage due the unseasonal rainfall over the last three days. Like Jadhav, hundreds of figs growers in Purandar taluka, which is famous for ‘anjir’ and custard apple in the state, face a similar fate. “I have dumped half the produce in a pit near my house. Most fruit has been ruined due to the rain,” Jadhav told TOI on Saturday. “One requires at least Rs1.30 lakh investment to grow good quality figs. I will not get even recover the capital investment from this year’s harvest,” he said. Fig or ‘anjir’ plantations spread over 600 acres in Purandar taluka are in danger, as per growers, agriculture scientists, and officials from the district agriculture office. The harvest season of the fruit had begun last month and most plantations that are at the harvesting stage have been badly affected. According to growers, they will have to shell out more money to spray pesticides and meet expenses to save the remaining harvest. Yuvraj Balgude, a plant pathologist working at Purandar taluka’s fig and guava research centre, said the existing weather conditions are favourable for rust disease which can spread fast in plantations. “This disease primarily affects the growth of the leaves and the quality of the fruit. Figs are delicate and most of the fruits have developed cracks due to the rainfall. Many farmers are likely to suffer losses,” said Balgude. According to another agriculture scientists, the local centre has advised farmers and growers to spread pesticide to control the disease to some extent. “Clear skies and a cool atmosphere are necessary for figs to grow well. For the last five days, the conditions have mostly remained overcast in the district. This will affect the overall harvest in Purandar,” he added. Anil Lohate, another plant pathologist who has worked in Purandar for a few years, said there is a danger of fruits dropping as well due to the adverse weather conditions. “Usually, get fruits in the range of 30-60kg from one fig tree. But this time they might get less.” Lohate added that as figs are extremely delicate, growers need to spray pesticides consistently. “Figs have to be plucked and packaged carefully. Maintaining quality standards is a mammoth task. Hence, the capital investment in fig is more than that required for other fruits,” said Lohate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fig-plantations-ruined-fruit-at-risk-of-disease-due-to-rain/articleshow/88096899.cms||Sandip Dighe

The arrested individuals may be small in number, but some bigger persons are behind this conspiracy and they are the ones who orchestrated these attacks on social media platforms, the court said. The court further observed that a large number of persons started posting on social media platforms against the judiciary, and judges of both the high court and Supreme Court since April 2020. “The same trend continues even today. This cannot be seen as posts by individuals and should be construed as a conspiracy to scandalise the courts,” said Justice D Ramesh while rejecting the six bail petitions. He further noted that the registrar general of the high court filed a police complaint on May 24, 2020 to trace, investigate and punish the culprits. “But for reasons best known to them, the state police authorities failed to investigate the crime. Subsequently, the high court transferred the investigation to the CBI on October 12, 2020. That it took one year even for the CBI to arrest the accused, shows how puissant the petitioners are,” the high court observed. While considering bail applications, the court has to consider the nature of offence, the role of the persons, and facts of the case, Justice Ramesh said, adding that it is the bounden duty of the court to apply its mind to examine the entire material on record for the purpose of satisfying itself.  “Having considered the severity of the allegations and the fact that some of the accused are yet to be arrested and the investigation is not yet completed, the bail petitions are dismissed,” he said. The CBI has so far arrested Avuthu Sridhar Reddy from Guntur, Jalagam Venkata Satyanarayana from Hyderabad, Guda Sridhar Reddy from Markapuram in Prakasam district, Suswaram Srinath from Hyderabad, Darisha Kishore Kumar Reddy from Railway Kodur in Kadapa district, and Suddaluri Ajay Amruth and charged them under sections 153-A, 504, 505(2), 506 of the IPC and section 67 of the Information Technology Act.  The accused later moved bail petitions before the high court. While the CBI counsel opposed the bail petitions on the grounds of pending investigation and influential background of the accused, the counsels for the petitioners argued for bail on the grounds that they will cooperate with the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/attack-on-judiciary-hc-turns-down-bail-pleas-of-accused/articleshow/88096893.cms||Srikanth Aluri

All passengers travelling to and from Jharkhand have been advised to carry a RT-PCR negative report — the test should be conducted 72 hours prior to boarding — or a double vaccination certificate which shows that the second dose was taken 15 days prior to boarding. The AAI has said that in case the passengers do not furnish the negative test report or the vaccination certificate, they need to undergo an RT-PCR test which will be made available at the airport by the state government and it’ll be free of cost. “Passengers undergoing a Covid test at the airport will have to submit a self-declaration form online through the ‘Jharkhand home isolation management system, GoJ’ web portal (https://swaraksha.nic.in),” the AAI has said. “Those testing positive will remain in home isolation for 14 days or will be admitted at a private/government-run health centre based on the report given by the incident commander and the home isolation team. The composition of the home isolation team will be decided by Ranchi civil surgeon,” the directive read. “The state government may be coordinated for further details and updated guidelines,” the AAI stated. All those travelling inter-state have been advised to self-monitor their symptoms for 14 days and comply with the guidelines issued by MoHFW.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/air-passengers-to-jharkhand-must-carry-rtpcr-negative-report-or-15-day-past-double-vaccine-certificate/articleshow/88096789.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The direction comes at a time when the state is yet to define “locals” and a policy is pending for adoption in this regard. Soren said the companies must abide by the Jharkhand Act (Jharkhand State Employment for Local Candidates Act of 2021), which mandates 75% job reservation in private sector to the state’s local residents. Nagraju was here to discuss measures to operationalise six coal mines — Keredari, Chatti Bariatu, Badam, Tubed, Tokisud and Lohari — for which the allotment process has been completed. He added that three mines are operational in the state, and with joint effort of central and state officials, mining would soon start in the six coal mines. He urged the CM to order construction of a new road between Pachhwara coal mines in Pakur to Dumka for ease of transportation of the coal produced from the mine. Soren, however, rejected the idea, saying that constructing a road would have adverse impact on the region’s environment. “Instead, the Centre should consider laying a dedicated railway line on the route for evacuation of mined coal,” Soren said. Responding to CM’s request of engaging locals in mining, Nagraju said t a direction would be issued to the allottee coal companies in this regard. “The central mine ministry would issue a directive soon so that 75% of the workforce engaged in mining activity is from the state of Jharkhand,” he said. The officials discussed the scope of operationalising several other coal mines of 29 coal blocks identified in the state. The meeting was attended by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh, additional chief secretary L Khiyangte, principal secretary to the CM Rajiv Arun Ekka, secretary to the CM Vinay Kumar Choubey, mines secretary Puja Singhal and director mines Jitendra Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hire-locals-in-state-coal-mines-cm-to-centre/articleshow/88096702.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

In a letter posted on the Twitter address of the minister, the AICCTU stated that resentment prevails among the workers due to non-payment of wages. The union said that with workers on strike, the HEC has incurred loss of Rs 1 crore so far and warned that the corporation would fall short of its targets if immediate steps are not taken to solve the issue. AICCTU secretary Bhuwaneshwar Kewat said, “Any threat of disciplinary action against the workers would worsen the situation. The officials who are also without salary for the past eight months are giving silent support to the strike.” The AICCTU demanded that the government guarantees payment of worker’s dues and HEC be provided special work order and bailout package to save it from the present crisis. It stated that a regular chairman-cum-managing director should be appointed in the company. The old machines must be replaced by the new ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/aicctu-seeks-union-ministers-help-in-hec-strike-issue/articleshow/88096751.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||False details by passengers a worry for admin as Covid testing ramped up||Ranchi: With Covid-19 testing stepped up at railway stations and airport in the wake of fresh concerns over Omicron, a new variant of Sars-Cov-2 that originated in South Africa, officials involved with the testing process are once again confronted with problems of wrong contact details shared by people after giving their samples. Officials said that a similar trend was evident during the second wave, too, which remained more lethal both in terms of infection and casualties vis-à-vis the first wave since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. Ranchi civil surgeon Vinod Kumar appealed to the people to be more responsible in the fight against the pandemic. Although he couldn’t provide such ‘ghost details’ offhand but said that it has increased since they have resumed Covid-19 testing at transit points last week. “The problem is we can’t do anything to curb this as it is practically impossible to ascertain if the address or phone number provided by the people is right or wrong. When the samples return positive, contact tracing begins and we get to know if the details are right or wrong,” he said, giving a recent example of a family which returned to Ranchi. “Three of a family in Kanke tested positive but when we sent officials for contact tracing, we found that the said house was locked. The numbers furnished by them either remained inactive or didn’t respond,” he said, adding that such careless behaviour directly or indirectly lead to surge in cases. Another official engaged with testing work at Hatia railway station said that many even tend to get into fights with the testing team. Recalling an incident, he said, “The health staff immediately dialed the number provided by a traveler from Bangalore after giving his sample at the station to cross check if it worked or not. It turned out to be inactive. When confronted, the passenger got into a brawl and in the mêlée slipped away. The only reason behind giving wrong details is fear of quarantine or isolation, but they fail to realise that the testing is for their own good and public safety.” Currently, the health department is mainly focusing on testing at transit points and at static centres like Sadar hospital in view of the Omicron scare. Testing at other public places, however, is grounded owing to heavy scarcity of rapid antigen kits (RAT). On an average, 8,000 tests are being done collectively at airport, two railway stations (Ranchi and Hatia) and entry points to the capital district. Kumar conceded about the crisis of RAT kits but said that they are expecting fresh kits soon to further ramp up scanning of people. Ranchi deputy commissioner Chhavi Ranjan didn’t pick phone for his comments on how administration plans to tackle the wrong phone numbers menace. Another senior official, however, said, “The only way is to instill fear among such people by slapping cases for wrong information whenever such case is detected. But the decision has to be taken by the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/false-details-by-passengers-a-worry-for-admin-as-covid-testing-ramped-up/articleshow/88096754.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Paddy procurement to begin from Dec 15||Ranchi: The state government will begin the procurement of paddy from December 15, state food and civil supplies-cum-finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said on Saturday. “All the districts have been asked to keep their basic infrastructure ready for operating the procurement centres to ensure that farmers are able to sell their crops in a hassle-free manner,” he said, adding, “Like last year, this time too, government will offer 50% payment on the spot and the rest will be given in three months,” The government has set a target of procuring 8 lakh metric tonnes of paddy this year, two lakh MT more than the previous season. A minimum support price of Rs 2050/quintal has been fixed for normal grade and Rs 2070/quintal for superior one. “Procurement centres are being set up at the offices of primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) and large area multi-purpose societies association in all districts. Our target is to begin the procurement from Dec 15,” Oraon said, adding that to avert issues in on-spot payment of 50% money to farmers, they have decided to take loans from SBI and the Bank of India. “We are readying money in advance for on-spot payment to farmers. For this, we are seeking loan from SBI and Bank of India. The remaining 50% of the money will be transferred to their bank accounts in three months after due verification process,” he said. Asked about last year’s payments to many farmers, Oraon said that genuine farmers who sold paddy at government centres got the money but in some cases, payments are stuck due to various reasons. Giving an example, he said that they had discovered 65,000 such sellers at paddy procurement centres during the previous season who had ration cards and below poverty line (BPL) card, along with kisan certificates. “It is a kind of forgery as someone with BPL card can’t possess a kisan certificate for selling at a procurement centre since whatever a BPL person grows and harvests, it is only for self-consumption for a year. They don’t have the resources and money for excess production. If they have resources or money, they are not in the BPL category. So, we are probing those cases for legitimate action,” he added. He said, “In order to prevent such forgery or curb middlemen from usurping MSP meant for the farmers, we have decided to fix the maximum limit one can sell at a government centre.” He added, “Now, one farmer cannot sell more than 200 quintals at a procurement centre. This will enable small and poor farmers get the right MSP. Earlier, contractors used to buy from farmers at throwaway price and sell at 400-1000 MT to grab MSP meant for farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/paddy-procurement-to-begin-from-dec-15/articleshow/88096786.cms||ASRP Mukesh

The health officials have sought police’s help in making sure that the man, who stays in Kadma, comes to the test centre. Even as the fear of Omicron looms large and the authorities are keeping a close watch on those coming from overseas, especially the ‘at-risk’ countries, some people are switching off their phones soon after they leave the airport, while others have shared their international numbers with the authorities, thereby, making it difficult to track them. Though Pall said that the number of such uncooperative people is small, he didn’t disclose the exact figure. He added, “In the past 30 days, over 550 people have arrived in the district from several ‘at risk’ countries namely, Singapore, South Africa, UK and Bangladesh, among others. Of those, 130 have tested negative for Covid-19. In case a sample tests positive that is being sent for genome sequencing.” While appealing to the returnees to take the Covid test, Pall said, “Our purpose is to identify the Covid patient and do further tests to check if he/she has been infected with the new variant (Omicron). Our aim is only to help the suspect and prevent him/her from spreading the infection among his family,” he added. He, however, clarified that barring a few isolated incidents of non-cooperation, sample testing is going on smoothly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/foreign-returnee-to-jsr-refuses-cov-test-flees-with-sample/articleshow/88096622.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Ranchi centre of IMD in its afternoon bulletin said that the Cyclonic Jawad over west central Bay of Bengal moved slightly northwestwards with a speed of 3 kmph and lay centred over westcentral Bay of Bengal about 200 km east-southeast of Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), 310 km south-southwest of Gopalpur (Odisha), 380 km south-southwest of Puri (Odisha) and 470 km south-southwest of Paradip (Odisha). “After moving nearly northwards the system has weakened into a deep depression and is now moving north-northeastwards along Odisha coast to reach near Puri around noon on Sunday. Subsequently, it is likely to weaken further and continue to move north-northeastwards along Odisha coast towards West Bengal coast,” director Ranchi IMD Abhishek Anand said. Issuing a yellow category warning for the entire state for Sunday and for southern-central and north eastern districts for Monday, the IMD has asked people to remain watchful. “Since the system is going to weaken into low pressure area by the time it reaches northern Odisha and West Bengal coast, it is likely to simply cause rainfall in the southern and north eastern districts of Jharkhand on Sunday,” Anand said. Other parts of the state are likely to receive light rain and high speed wind reaching upto 30-40kmph. The inclement weather conditions are likely to continue on Monday but by Tuesday skies would become clear. Anand said that once the system dissipates, the temperature is likely to fall bringing in the winter chill from northern India. “Both maximum and minimum temperatures would reduce from Tuesday and wind direction is likely to change,” Anand said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/showers-cloud-cover-bring-down-mercury/articleshow/88096671.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The 4000-MW thermal power plant that was supposed to complete its first phase of 3X800-MW capacity by 2019 is running behind schedule. According to the agreement, signed with the state government in 2015, the project is to be completed by 2024. Despite using supercritical thermal technology, which reduces the requirement of fuel for steam production, the new-age plant is far from considering carbon capture and sequestration or flue gas to methanol conversion technologies — two effective ways for reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. In an RTI query, filed by Patratu resident Ashiwani Kumar Central Public Information officer, NTPC Shantimoy Nandan has said CCS or flue gas to methanol conversion technology is not being envisaged now. “No hazardous effects on the environment of the upcoming plant are envisaged as the systems for emission control are being designed as per guidelines stipulated by ministry of environment and climate change and central pollution control board,” Nandan said in his reply. The CPIO has, however, dodged another query of the RTI application, which sought the corporation’s response on what it (NTPC) is doing in Jharkhand to help India achieve its Paris Climate Agreement. The CPIO said the question was vague and cannot be replied. The NTPC has shown its commitment to add renewable energy with a total installed capacity of 1295.5MW of renewable energy comprising solar, wind and small hydro in nine states and one union territory. However, the list does not include even a single commissioned project in Jharkhand. Climate activist and founder Damodar Bachao Abhiyan, Gulab Chandra said moving towards net zero by 2070 would remain a distant dream unless thermal power projects are completely shelved. “PVUNL is not a new plant but augmentation of the pre-existing PTPS. Apart from being fuel-efficient, it should also consider reducing emissions,” he said. Another environmentalist, member of 350.org movement and protagonist of Save karanpura campaign, Padma Shri Bulu Imam believes it's already too late to cut down on emissions and expect the environment to get cleaner. “We have already damaged the environment to irreparable levels and a catastrophe is imminent. Now it's time to extend humanitarian relief and work to save the population that faces the maximum threat,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pvunl-poses-hurdle-in-realising-phase-down-of-coal-promise/articleshow/88096647.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Goa||GFP for 15% OBC quota for Bhandari community||Panaji: The Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Saturday demanded at least 15% reservation for the Bhandari Samaj within the 27% reservation provided for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and said that once the GFP-Congress government is formed in 2022, the Bhandari samaj would get adequate representation.  GFP general secretary Mohandas Lolienkar said that the BJP was paying lip service to the community as it had done nothing to promote and project leaders from the Bhandari community. Lolienkar refuted chief minister Pramod Sawant’s claim that GFP used Jayesh Salgaonkar to gain the Bhandari community votes. “Today the BJP is importing MLAs. This may have been ok at one point of time for the Congress, but today the BJP is going around taking Poskim (fostered children) from other parties,” said Lolienkar at a press conference.  Poskim is a Konkani reference for adopted or fostered children. Within the OBC community, Naik Bhandari Samaj constitutes around 61% but GFP said that even though the Naik Bhandari community is the majority caste, they do not get adequate representation. “Out of the 27% reservation permitted, 15% reservation at least must be for the Bhandari Samaj,” said Lolienkar.  With the 2022 state assembly elections around the corner, all parties are vying to gain the confidence of the Bhandari community. The Aam Aadmi Party has vowed to appoint a chief minister from the Bhandari community.  Former chairperson of Ponda Municipal Council Venkatesh Naik, who was also present for the press conference, said that the BJP has failed to give justice to the Bhandari community.  During a discussion in the state legislative assembly, GFP president Vijai Sardesai had demanded that the government should fulfil the aspirations of Bhandari Samaj by providing them quota within quota from 27% allotted to OBCs. “Despite this, the BJP government failed to take steps in this matter. Hence, it has no right to bank on Bhandari Samaj votes,” Naik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-for-15-obc-quota-for-bhandari-community/articleshow/88097675.cms||---
---||Goa||PC: Will ensure jobs are created if Cong forms govt||Panaji: Congress has a plan to restart mining operations and also accord land rights to tenants, said former Union finance minister P Chidambaram while addressing party workers at Valpoi. Chidambaram also promised party workers that if Congress forms the next government in the state, he will personally ensure that job opportunities are created in Goa. The AICC senior election observer, along with other Congress observers, arrived in Goa for a two-day visit and held meetings with party workers at Valpoi and Sakhali. On Sunday, Chidambaram will interact with workers at Shiroda and Navelim. “We have found that there is a legal way to restart mining and once the Congress government is formed, mining will be restarted in a legal way,” Chidamaram said. However, he did not spell out the plan to restart Goa’s lucrative iron ore mining industry, which has been shut since 2018 when the Supreme Court scrapped the renewal of 88 mining leases. Employment generation is an important factor to prevent brain drain and Congress will do everything to create jobs for locals, Chidambaram said. “There are huge opportunities to create jobs and I will personally monitor and see that jobs are created in Goa. There are thousands of jobs that are vacant today, but the current government has no money to fill these vacancies. We are promising that within six months of the Congress government being formed, all these vacancies will be filled and reservation policy will be followed,” he said. Given that land ownership rights remain an unresolved issue, Chidambaram said that Congress would introduce a new legislation that would protect the rights of tenants and prevent them and their families from being evicted. “Congress will make a law conferring tenancy rights and protecting the tenant in respect of the land that is in his possession and under cultivation. It is called the protection of the tenant’s rights,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pc-will-ensure-jobs-are-created-if-cong-forms-govt/articleshow/88097723.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh Police embarks on reforms to expedite trial, release on bail||LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh Police has embarked on a series of comprehensive reforms to pave the way for a swifter and more transparent trial system by weeding out the procedural impediments blocking the benefits of the use of technology and automation. DGP Mukul Goel chaired a high-level a meeting with DG, prisons, Anand Kumar, ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar, and senior officers at the DGP headquarters recently to review the status of digitisation and use of technology to fast-track and streamline various processes and communication between police, prisons and courts. Senior police official's privy to the minutes of the meeting said the important items on the agenda were related to the prisons department, including release of prisoners on bail orders received through email from the Supreme Court, preparation of custody certificate and database of prisoners released on bail. 'Proposal to amend provision sent to govt'DG, prisons, Anand Kumar said the issue of delay in release of prisoners granted bail by higher courts was discussed and the provision in para 99 of the jail manual that necessitates validation of the bail order by the trial court for its execution in such cases was found to be leading to the delay. "The provision needs to be amended and a proposal has been sent to the government. Once the amendment takes place, there will be no delay in releasing prisoners on receiving the bail order through email," he added. He added that following the orders of the Supreme Court, custody certificate of every prisoner carrying all details has been prepared on the prescribed proforma. DGP Mukul Goel issued instructions to speed up investigation while maintaining high quality and directed senior officers to conduct a drive in December to reduce the pendency of investigation of cases. He instructed ADG training to impart regular training to all investigation officers. The DGP also stressed on mentioning phone numbers of all government officials in the chargesheet so that they can be informed about the date of their deposition in court since serving of summons leads to delay due to frequent transfers. Summons can be served via WhatsApp, saving time and resources, he said. IG technical Mohit Agrawal said online submission of chargesheets has already begun. DGP Goel said the reasons for procedural delay that hold up filing of chargesheet should be discussed in the district monitoring committee meeting for resolving it. "We have embarked on a futuristic strategy to evolve better synergy between police, prison and prosecution through maximum use of technology to automate the criminal justice system and assisting the judiciary in expediting trials leading to better convictions."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-police-embarks-on-reforms-to-expedite-trial-release-on-bail/articleshow/88098783.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi girl gets two-wheeler registration number with letters 'SEX'||NEW DELHI: The city transport department has halted registration of vehicles under the 'DL..SEX..' series from November 29 after a woman who was allotted number 'DL3..SEX...' for a scooter went on social media and spoke about the ordeal she had to face due to the number. The woman's post went viral. The department had registered 4,600 two-wheelers under 'DL..SEX...', an auto-generated number series, between October 15 and November 28. Taking cognisance of the matter, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Friday issued a notice to the department, asking it to immediately change her vehicle registration number containing the letters 'SEX'. The DCW also sought details of all vehicles given 'DL..SEX..' series numbers. "The DCW was approached in the matter by a girl who bought a scooty recently and got a vehicle registration number which contained the term 'SEX'. The girl informed the Commission that she was facing severe harassment due to the registration number, as people taunted and even teased her due to it. She further said that because of all this she is facing a lot of problems in commuting and is not being able to go out for essential work," a DCW statement said. DCW chief Swati Maliwal said she asked the transport department to submit details regarding the total number of vehicles registered under 'SEX' series. "It is very unfortunate that people can be so petty and abusive that the woman is having to face so much harassment. I have given four days to the transport department to resolve this issue so that the woman doesn't suffer anymore," Maliwal stated. A transport department official said the 'DL..SEX..' is an auto-generated recent series for vehicle registration. "We have stopped registration on this series because of the sensitivity. Registration series are autogenerated by the system. If we receive requests, we can change the registration numbers on a case-to-case basis," said the official. "We have not received any objection to the number from any of the registered vehicle owner. Due to its sensitivity the registration of vehicles under 'SEX' has been stopped. We are ready to change the registration number if we receive a complaint. In the new number, 'SEX' will be replaced by 'SEY', while other letters and digits will remain same," said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-sex-series-number-plate-gets-people-worked-up/articleshow/88098802.cms||AlokKNMishra

Such a high number of new cases was witnessed after at least three months during which daily count had remained below 20, and of late, even less than 10. Gautam Budh Nagar reported nine Covid cases, taking it to the top of the list of districts with the highest number of active cases. With only 8 recoveries reported against the 27 new cases, UP's tally of active cases crossed the 100 mark to settle at 116. "The nine cases in Gautam Budh Nagar are worrying. The tally included one health worker, three people tested randomly, and five people of one family. The family got tested because one of them had a cold and therefore all decided to get tested and were positive. They are all asymptomatic and all are feeling better now," said a health department official. Mainpuri reported five cases, followed by three in Varanasi and two each in Lucknow, Mathura and Bareilly. A government spokesperson said that keeping the new variant in mind, the government is focusing on increasing vaccination coverage and its cluster approach and door-to-door campaigns had resulted in 5% increase in second dose coverage. Till Saturday, more than 77% of the state's adult population had received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine, while over 35% had been covered with both doses. "So far, the state has administered 16.66 crore doses of the vaccine with around 11.4 crore people covered with the first dose and over 5.26 crore fully vaccinated with two doses," the spokesperson said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/covid-spurt-amid-omicron-scare-27-new-cases-in-uttar-pradesh/articleshow/88104224.cms||---

Speaking on the occasion of Navy Day, Pynumootil said that the Indian Navy remains in a heightened state of combat and operational readiness to address any situation in the Indian Ocean region. “We are in the process of transferring a IL- 38 aircraft to the Goa government for establishing an aircraft museum. I am sure the project would be functional in the next few months and would become a major tourist attraction,” said Pynumootil. Touching up on the broader geo-strategic security environment, Pynumootil said that with a distinct shift towards the Indo-Pacific Region, the Indian Navy remains poised to respond to any challenge. “Our responsibility as the preferred security provider in the IOR requires the Indian Navy to be the first responder to any crisis and to provide assistance and humanitarian aid in the region. Dedicated surveillance missions by our units in our area of interest and close association with friendly neighbouring countries ensures the same,” said Pynumootil. The admiral highlighted the services rendered to aid civil administration, including restoration of normalcy post cyclone Tauktae and vaccination centre set up by the Navy, administering over 55,000 doses. Three former naval chiefs were present for the function along with retired and serving senior naval officers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-to-hand-over-il-38-aircraft-for-museum/articleshow/88097808.cms||---

The STF has also taken mobile phone numbers of as many as 100 people on surveillance to trace the circulation of question papers. On November 28, UPTET was cancelled after a question paper was leaked on social media, triggering arrests of 38 people. At least 20 lakh students were scheduled to write the examination at 2,736 centres in two shifts.

---||Kanpur||No trace of Kanpur professor, last location at Atal Ghat||KANPUR: The police have found some leads about the forensic sciences professor who is at large after allegedly murdering his wife, son and daughter at their flat in Divinity Apartments, Indira Nagar, Kalyanpur, on Friday. The last location of the mobile phone of the accused doctor Sushil Kumar was traced to Atal Ghat, police said on Saturday. "Keeping in view the possibility of his jumping into the Ganga, searches are being conducted with the help of Jal Police," said DCP West BBGTS Murti on Saturday, adding, "The forensic team took hammer, bedsheet, some white powder and tea from the spot as evidence for analysis. A case of murder has been registered on the complaint of the doctor's brother." Kumar, a forensic sciences professor at a city medical college, allegedly killed his wife and children to 'liberate them and remove all their troubles in a moment'. Sushil left behind a 10-page note mentioning that he was suffering from an incurable disease and also that Omicron and "Covid-19 will not spare anyone". Sushil had told his brother Dr Sunil Kumar a few days ago that he was suffering from depression and wanted to kill his wife. Sushil had sent a message to his brother at 5.32pm asking him to go home. His brother Dr Sunil reached his house as soon as he read the message and found the bodies lying in rooms. In the message, Sushil had written, "Inform police, I am in depression and have killed Chandraprabha, Shikhar and Khushi." Police investigation has revealed that Sushil remained at home till 1.10pm and the location of his mobile phone was found in Mandhana at 6.30pm, after which the phone was switched off. Kalyanpur police station in-charge Ashok Kumar Dubey said, "The statement of Dr Sunil and the letters suggest that accused Sushil was suffering from depression. But, the probe is pointing towards some conspiracy. Questions are also being raised on the intention of Sushil, who himself was an expert in forensics, so it is believed the murder was carried out in a planned manner. Had he been really ill, he would most probably have called the police himself after the murders. It seems the entire family was first sedated and then murdered, said officials. Police believe that Sushil hit his wife several times on the head with a hammer, which shows his extreme hatred for her. Police officials are investigating whether Sushil used to doubt his wife and that is why he carried out the grisly crime. Meanwhile, the staff of Rama Medical College where Sushil worked said his behaviour was normal. Rama Medical College's principal DN Tripathi said that he had met Sushil two days ago. During conversation it did not seem that he was under any stress. "His behaviour and interactions with everyone have been simple. He never had any rift with anyone in the staff," said the principal further. Sushil had been a student of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College, from where he had done MBBS 15 years ago, according to family sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/no-trace-of-kanpur-professor-last-location-at-atal-ghat/articleshow/88098842.cms||Faiz Siddiqui
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: In Nandurbar villages, vax drive on with smartphone flashlights||NASHIK: Flashlights of smartphones and solar-powered streetlights are turning out to be the Covid vaccinators' SOS kit after sunset in several remote villages of north Maharashtra's Nandurbar district. When a four-member health team recently visited Malgaon village in Shahada taluka of Nandurbar, the entire hamlet had plunged into darkness due to load shedding. It was impossible for the team members to vaccinate even one person in such a situation. The team was determined to inoculate at least a section of the villagers though, and, after quick thinking, they switched on the flashlights of their cellphones and helped the vaccinators administer the shots. The health team ran into a similar hurdle a few days later at Vadagaon village, barely 15km from Malgaon. Fortunately, the solar streetlights were functional at the village and the vaccination team went ahead with their mission. Malgon and Vadagaon are not the only villages in Nandurbar where health teams on vaccination missions are banking on cellphone flashlights or solar streetlights to inoculate citizens. Dr Mahendra Chavan, district health officer, told TOI: "A section of our health teams faces similar problems daily, in at least 8-10 villages, where power cuts are frequent. The teams visit homes of beneficiaries and use flashlights of cellphones to vaccinate them. They also get beneficiaries together under solar streetlights and administer the vaccine shots." With Nandurbar's vaccination track record being extremely sluggish, the local administration, led by district collector Manisha Khatri, has gone all out to improve vaccine coverage in the district. Nandurbar is at the bottom among the 35 districts in Maharashtra in terms of anti-Covid vaccine coverage. "When the Centre's door-to-door campaign started on November 3, we realized that increasing the vaccination coverage during the daytime would remain a major challenge. A large section of the beneficiaries is busy working during the day, due to which footfall at vaccination centres was low. We decided that our health teams would visit villages in the evening, after the beneficiaries return from work," Dr Chavan added. The Nandurbar zilla parishad has mobilized 180 health teams - each team comprising four members - that continue to reach out to villages in the six talukas after 5.30pm to vaccinate villagers. The teams spend around 2-3 hours in each village. The result appears encouraging, as the vaccine coverage has improved significantly. In the past one month, over 3.03 lakh doses have been administered, the bulk of which are first shots of the beneficiaries, the district health officer said. "Visibility is not an issue when smartphone flashlights or streetlights are used to vaccinate people. I was a part of the team at Vadagaon, which carried out vaccination under the solar streetlight. We did not face any hiccups," Dr Sachin Pawara, community health officer of Shahada taluka, said. The evening sessions in villages are planned a couple of days in advance and the local gram pradhan and the Asha worker are informed about the event. The aim is to mobilize the beneficiaries. On the day of vaccination, the team members either travel in a government vehicle or on their two-wheelers to reach the designated villages. "There is still some amount of vaccine hesitancy among a section of people in many villages. It takes a lot of persuasion before they agree to take the shots," a health official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/maharashtra-in-nandurbar-villages-vax-drive-on-with-smartphone-flashlights/articleshow/88098845.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Nagpur||‘Some don’t accept Buddhist theatre as part of mainstream’||NAGPUR: Since humans first appeared on earth, storytelling has been a part of every evolving society. And stage theatre is one of the oldest performing arts that still survives in this day and age of digitalization. In India, amidst the various forms of theatre which trace their roots to millennium-old traditions, is the slowly growing space for ‘Buddhist theatre’, also popularly known as ‘Bahujan theatre’. Artiste Virendra Ganvir was the organizer of the recently-concluded Buddhist Theatre Festival in Nagpur and founder of Bahujan Rangbhoomi which stages plays on social issues with a strong Buddhist theme. Ganvir talks to TOI about how Buddhist theatre is wrongly considered to a trend, but it actually is ‘the mainstream’ Excerpts... Q. Why do you strongly claim that Buddhist/Bahujan theatre is in fact mainstream and not a parallelly running entity?A. Absolutely, because all our theatre comes from the ancient Nag culture. We all trace our origin there and slowly different streams took shape. We evolved into an art form which portrays Buddhist values and is also known as Bahujan theatre. So, ultimately we are all part of the mainstream. But what’s happening here is a clash between two schools of thought, which has self-ordained itself as the ‘mainstream’ and does not want any other theatre form occupying this space. Q. You call it Buddhist theatre, but the other name, Bahujan theatre, also signifies its socio-cultural importance?A. Theatre has definitely had a major role to play in shaping our society. A play’s only purpose is not to entertain, but also to prod the audience to introspect about the message being given through plays. In the 1850s, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule started interacting with people and stage plays were an important part of that. Later, in 1950s, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar too used theatre as a mode to make people aware of the society and uplift them. In fact, when Dr Ambedkar took deeksha in Nagpur in 1956, there was a play staged here. At that time, over six lakh people saw it which was unprecedented. Even in today’s time, the same issues like caste and religion continue to plague our society. These are barriers to making the world a better place. In today’s world, people are fighting against each other based on these concepts and we have to move beyond that and make people think about humanity. Q. And that’s where the Buddhist part in the theatre comes in.A. Yes, the teachings of Lord Buddha carry a message for entire humanity. Through theatre, we have to potray it in a format that is understood by the people. Art has to bring people together. Q. How difficult is it to stage plays in a digital world? A. First of all, I have no doubt in my mind that even today theatre impacts people. When an audience sits through the play, they are not merely watching it but slowly start becoming a part of it. That’s the beauty of live theatre. It’s vibrant, it’s real and the audience is thrust right into it. The actors are all flesh and bone. So, whenever you leave a play, the impact of that stays with you for a long time. Even in today’s digital world, there is an audience for live theatre. That’s the reason that the world over they are doing well commercially too. Q. Has finding actors become tough, especially now that youth might be more inclined towards commercial art — be it theatre or movies?A. Those who get involved with Buddhist theatre are of a different mould. Here, I involve the kid next door, the youth who is currently in a no-where zone of life and focus their energy into creating something good. Nobody comes as an actor, they come simply to be part of a social cause. The stage is an expression of that feeling to do something for humanity. I don’t believe in commercial theatre for my style of performing art, and hence, my Bahujan Rangbhoomi is a more of an inner calling. I have been doing this for 31 years now and so many students have gone on to do well in commercial settings. Some are in Marathi movies, serials etc. I’m convinced that in the coming years, Buddhist theatre will get its due as part of the mainstream performing arts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-dont-accept-buddhist-theatre-as-part-of-mainstream/articleshow/88094975.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

It may reach Bengal as a low-pressure or a cyclonic circulation on Sunday that will curb its impact a great deal, though heavy rain has still been predicted in some areas of the four coastal districts of the state. Kolkata could receive just light to moderate showers on Sunday. Three factors led to Jawad losing its strength, said weather experts. First, the lack of a uniform ‘wind shear’ that was needed to keep the cyclone intact and make it move towards the coast. Secondly, north Bay of Bengal — over which the system is now hovering — turns cool in December which cuts off the supply of moisture to cyclonic systems, rendering them weaker. Finally, cool winds have been blowing into sea from land which is making the system disintegrate. “A cyclone is a mammoth system which needs to be pushed by a uniform wind speed which is now lacking. Disparate wind currents tend to break the system and leave it weaker, which has happened to Jawad. Due to low temperatures and cool winds, which now prevail over Bay of Bengal, cyclones are rare in December,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. With Jawad fizzling out as a cyclone, Kolkata is now set to receive just light to moderate rain on Sunday, instead of the very heavy showers that had been earlier predicted. The coastal districts — the two Midnapores and 24 Parganas may receive heavy rain in some areas, along with Howrah and Nadia. The system could be accompanied by a wind speed of 45-60 km/hr when it finally reaches land. On Saturday, Jawad, pronounced Jowad and named by Saudi Arabia, lay over westcentral Bay of Bengal and moved northwards at a speed of 6 km/hr and lay centered at over westcentral Bay of Bengal, about 210 km east-southeast of Vishakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh), 320 km south of Gopalpur (Odisha), 390 km south-southwest of Puri (Odisha) and 470 km south-southwest of Paradip (Odisha). It then moved northwards, weakened gradually during the 12 hours between 8 am and 8 pm and then moved north-northeastwards along Odisha coast towards Puri. “It is set to be close to Puri around noon on Sunday as a deep depression. It may weaken further and continue to move north-northeastwards along Odisha coast towards Bengal coast. It’s not clear when it could hit land and where,” said deputy director general of meteorology Sanjib Bandopadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclone-jawad-fizzles-out-may-hit-bengal-as-a-low-pressure/articleshow/88096496.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||Best Foot Forward||Kolkata: Good shoes take you to good places, they say. No surprise that the footwear industry saw increased activity over the past couple of years, a pandemic and unprecedented restrictions notwithstanding. Market leaders believe altered consumer attitude has been a contributing factor. Shoes, once considered a value buy, have transcended into a lifestyle purchase. Top retail brands, some of which are based in Kolkata, say the demand for footwear has been “price-sensitive and season-specific” in Covid times. While shoe addicts have been scouting for pocket-friendly options, the festive season has witnessed record sales. “It is too early to predict the future trend, but our last festive sales are indicative of almost full recovery of business. This year, we have reached our 2019 performance. Stores are busy throughout the week and we are seeing a huge demand for affordable athletic footwear and comfortable sandals, both at stores and e-commerce portals,” Rochita Dey, director of Sreeleathers, told TOI. Rochita DeySreeleathers has an intriguing back story. Freedom fighter late Suresh Chandra Dey, a member of Master-da Surya Sen’s squad, dreamt of making durable shoes in an independent India. Sreeleathers was born as a small unit in Jamshedpur in 1952. Within a short time, the brand became popular and business expanded. In 1985, the factory shifted its base to then Calcutta and opened a swanky store on Lindsay Street. It became a limited company in 1991, the year Suresh Chandra passed away. On whether the footwear and leather accessories company was thinking of new designs, Rochita said: “We have launched our winter collection and customers looking for party wear will be spoilt for choice.” The company is planning to tap the e-commerce segment in a big way. “Our customers can expect a user-friendly website soon. We are opening a new warehouse facility in north India to cater to the pan-India demand,” she added. Compared to the total footwear industry’s 8% to 8.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2025 fiscal years, the economy in middle and premium sections is expected to grow at a comparatively higher rate of 10% to 11% CAGR, said Nissan Joseph, CEO of Metro Brands. Nissan Joseph“Increasing exposure to global fashion trends, higher aspiration levels and demographic factors are likely to galvanise this shift. Organised players are likely to disproportionately benefit from the shift owing to their strong balance sheet and robust supply chains,” Joseph said. He added that e-commerce had gained importance for footwear sales in the past few years. “Metro Brands, which dates back to 1955, is drawing up and implementing omni-channel strategies across its network of more than 586 stores.” For Khadim India, recovery of business in the second quarter of FY22 has been better than the same period of FY21 at 75-80% of Q2 of FY20. Sales are returning to pre-pandemic numbers. Speaking to TOI, CEO Namrata Ashok Chotrani said: “The fashion business is swinging back to normalcy. Given the reduced disposable income in the hand of buyers, affordable fashion brands have a higher chance of benefiting from the change. We are in a sound position to cash in on this opportunity through both retail and distribution segments of our business. In the wake of the pandemic, we have recast margin and cost structures along with the supply chain. All these changes have ensured that we are able to adapt to the changing macro-economic scenario and tide over the prior business inefficiencies.” Namrata Ashok ChotraniIncorporated in 1981, Khadim India — which traces its roots to KM Khadim & Company, a footwear store in Chitpur, acquired by Satya Prasad Roy Burman in 1965 — has taken a slew of measures to reach out to its customers amid the pandemic. For instance, it has come up with a residential and weekly touch point to serve those who are unable to visit retail stores. It has also rolled out ‘On the Go’, a store on wheels for added convenience. On their future plans, Chotrani said: “We want to enter new markets through company owned and operated outlets, and penetrate further through franchises once the brand is well-established. On the distribution side, we are focusing on entering the existing markets in eastern and southern India by capitalising on retail brand recall, and targeting new markets in western UP, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and other states in the north. We are also reinventing the product range of sports sandals, sports shoes and formal shoes.” Gunjan ShahOver the past few months, with offices and educational institutions reopening, formal footwear has been witnessing a strong turnaround. At the same time, casual footwear is likely to continue seeing high traction, said Gunjan Shah, MD and CEO of 1931-born Bata India. “We have introduced a range called ‘Relaxed Workwear’ that comes with the latest comfort technologies. A rebound in demand for school shoes is also being seen. There is a consistent rise in footfall across our outlets. We are looking at strengthening our sneakers range and casual portfolio. Formal shoes will remain an important part of our portfolio, but with enhanced comfort,” Shah said. The unstable and fluctuating prices of raw materials have been throwing up challenges for the footwear industry. “With China hoarding containers, the supply chain of chemicals has been hampered. However, the challenge has been compensated by the increasing national sentiment in the country, as customers take pride in wearing Indian products,” said Rochita.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/best-foot-forward/articleshow/88097438.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Kolkata||Coal case: ED to grill 4 Majee aides next week||Kolkata: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned four persons next week for questioning in the Bengal illegal coal mining case. All four are said to be close aides of prime accused Anup Majee, alias Lala Jaydeb Mandal, Nirad Mandal, Narayan Nanda and Gurupada Maji were earlier arrested in the same case by the CBI. They were recently granted bail by a special CBI court in Asansol. Jaydeb allegedly ran the entire operation in Asansol and its adjoining areas. He had even built a rapport with a few officials who helped him transport coal. Initially, Jaydeb worked with another group led by one Raju Jha, but later switched to Majee’s side. In 2011, Jaydeb was arrested by Kolkata Police STF in connection with an arms deal. Later, he was wanted in several other mining cases, but he managed to dodge arrest by hiding in Malaysia, Singapore and Switzerland. Investigators believe Majee used Jaydeb’s overseas network to stash cash. Gurupada, on the other hand, collected payments on behalf of Majee. He was arrested by the CID in 2018 under the NDPS Act. ED officials are looking into possible money laundering by Majee and his associates. The agency has already questioned a few TMC leaders and arrested a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coal-case-ed-to-grill-4-majee-aides-next-week/articleshow/88097335.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||GSI finds 29,600m tonnes of coal in Rajmahal-Birbhum basin||Kolkata: Geological Survey of India (GSI) found an estimated coal resource of about 29,600 million tonnes at the Rajmahal-Birbhum Coalfield till April 1, of which nearly 7,300 million tonnes lay in the southern part of the basin in the Birbhum belt. The huge reserve of Gon-dwana coal includes that already located in the Deocha-Pachami area. Bengal gover-nment estimates put the potential Deocha-Pachami reserve at 1,200 million tonnes. GSI is entrusted with regional exploration of solid fossil fuel across the country to identify and locate coal deposits, apart from a host of other activities. Sudip Bhattacharya, director of Natural Energy Resources (Mission II-B) of GSI, Central Headquarters, Kolkata said: “Locating this resource was a real challenge as the basin is a hidden one, concealed almost entirely under thick Rajmahal basalt, a trap rock consisting of a number of basaltic flows. The potential resource has been proved by GSI officials during the last few decades through exploratory drilling aided by geo-physical surveys.” Thick layers of Gondwana coal seams of Barakar Formation were identified at an average depth of 100-120m in boreholes during drilling carried out in Rajmahal-Birbhum Master Basin. The basin covers an area of around 5,200 sq km spread over Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar; the coal-bearing area has been identified as nearly 2,100 sq km. “Exploratory drilling through boreholes has proved that, at times, you can get thick workable coal seams (which can be lifted through open cast mining) within a 300m-depth,” said Bhattacharya. “The exploration is continuing which might augment the resource scenario in Rajmahal-Birbhum Coalfield.” Formed nearly 250-290 million years ago, in the Permian period, Gondwana coal accounts for about 98% of the resource in the country. “GSI’s job is to identify and locate the coal resource through regional exploration and pass on the information to the ministry of mines in the form of geological reports,” Bhattacharya said. GSI is also pursuing projects to find out the oil potentiality of Indian coal. “In the energy sector, the world is moving towards greener and cleaner energy. Thick coal seams of Rajmahal-Birbhum Coalfield have shown a lot of potential in this domain. This may play a role to lessen carbon footprint with suitable technological know-how in future,” said Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gsi-finds-29600m-tonnes-of-coal-in-rajmahal-birbhum-basin/articleshow/88097300.cms||Rohit Khanna

Police allegedly had to lathi-charge to control the crowd. A local NGO had advertised 1,200 vacancies, on behalf of the company, asking unemployed youths below 30 who had cleared Class VIII to apply. The company has 12 construction sites in Murshidabad. “The firm will hire 1,200 youths, but nearly 50,000 turned up. Police helped us control the crowd,” said the NGO’s Murshidabad unit president Abu Bakkar Siddiqui. Anarul Sheikh, an applicant from Salar, claimed police lathi-charge made the situation worse. “I came early and stood in the queue. But, when I reached close to the table, police began lathi-charge and that led to chaos. I fell down and hurt myself.” Murshidabad SP K Shabari Rajkumar denied lathi-charge as did minister of state Humayun Kabir. “There was no such action. Police set up barricades to control the crowd,” Kabir said. According to the minister, candidates who will clear CV screening and interview will undergo a 45-day training. “Yesterday (Friday), 2,500 youths enrolled their names in Nadia and today, more than 20,000 in Behrampore,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/50000-turn-up-at-job-camp-for-1200-posts-in-behrampore/articleshow/88097292.cms||Sukumar Mahato

---||Chandigarh||Farm protest to continue till pending demands met, says SKM||CHANDIGARH: In a four-hour marathon meeting at Singhu border on Saturday, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has decided to continue the farm stir till the central government agrees to concede its demand of minimum support price (MSP) and withdrawal of cases registered against the farmers during the ongoing farmer struggle till their demands, mainly pan-India withdrawal of cases against farmers, committee formation for MSP, action against Union minister Ajay Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, seeking land at Delhi borders borders for farmers to erect a memorial to farmers who passed away during protest, electricity bill and stubble burning bill, compensation, jobs for family members, are not met. A five-member committee, comprising farm leaders from Punjab, Haryana, UP, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, has been formed to talk to the Centre about the pending demands of farmers. Farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal from Punjab, Gurnam Singh Charuni from Haryana, Yudhveer Singh from UP, Shiv Kumar Kakka from Madhya Pradesh and Ashok Dhawale from Maharashtra are the members of this committee. The next meeting of the SKM will be held on December 7.Sources said that after conceding the main demand of repeal of farm laws and forming a committee to discuss MSP, the government was hopeful that the farmers would end the protest, but now it will have to make ground for conceding other demands. The farmer leaders from across the country were of the view that the protest should not be ended before the government concedes all the demands, as the pressure should continue on the government. The meeting between Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar with farm leaders of Haryana is being seen as a step in the right direction. Addressing a press conference after the meeting, BKU spokesperson, Rakesh Tikait said , the committee formed on Saturday by the SKM will coordinate with the Centre. Thousands of cases had been registered against farmers in different states during the ongoing agitation including Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Banglore and other parts of India and this five-member committee will decide another committee at state-level for discussions with the respective state governments. The committee will coordinate between SKM and the central government and the next decision will be taken on December 6 at Singhu border. Farmer leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “The government had been asking to form a small committee for talks, there was big question as the government wanted to debate on amendments in the farm laws but now as the core demand of repeal of farm laws has been met, we decided to form the small committee to hold talks with the government in conducive manner as presently it is talking individually with farmer leaders like Rajewal or me. The SKM has authorised the five members to hold talks with the Centre.” Shiv Kumar Kakka said that the farmers are united over continuing the protest. Some farmers had sat outside the meeting venue by putting iron chains around their arms and legs. They wanted the SKM not to end the struggle without getting a guarantee on MSP. After the meeting, SKM said that the central government has chosen to work informally and in a piecemeal fashion while responding to some of the issues raised by it in a letter to the Prime Minister on November 21. "Farm unions have a bitter experience from the past of securing only oral assurances and ending their agitation and finding that governments' renege on the oral assurances. We will not end this agitation without formal responses on each of the issues being raised by us. We want to see all the cases foisted against farmers and their supporters to be withdrawn and such an assurance coming formally.” 50k cases against Haryana farmers Haryana farmers raised the issue of around 50,000 cases registered against them in different districts. They said it will be the highest number of cases lodged against farmers in Haryana and they should be quashed like Punjab government has announced to take back all cases. They demanded that the Punjab model should be adopted while giving relaxation to farmers at national level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-protest-to-continue-till-pending-demands-met-says-skm/articleshow/88099080.cms||Neel Kamal

Five of them were killed at the dera shops, including two in its canteen branch. Two men on motorcycle committed four of these murders. Again, two shooters were used to kill a dera follower at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in Faridkot district, and only the getaway vehicle was a car. Dera follower Mohinder Pal Bittu was killed inside a jail. After the first theft of a Bir of Guru Granth Sahib was reported on June 1, 2015, at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala, dera follower Gurdev Singh (33) was killed there on June 13, 2016, at his provision store near the village gurdwara from where a copy of the holy book was stolen. On February 25, 2017, dera follower Sat Pal Sharma (72) and his son, Ramesh Kumar Sharma (40), were shot dead while closing their canteen at Naam Charcha Ghar of dera branch at Jagera village in the Khanna police juridiction on the Ahmedgarh-Ludhiana road. On June 23, 2019, sacrilege accused dera follower Bittu (49) was killed inside Nabha’s high-security jail. On November 20, 2020, dera follower Manohar Lal (55), whose son Jatinderbir faced sacrilege cases, was killed at his shop in Bathinda district’s Bhagta Bhai Ka village. On December 3 this year, dera follower Charan Dass (40) was also done to death at his shop in Muktsar district’s Bhundar village. In May 2007, before the sacrilege cases, dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh had angered Sikhs at a Salabatpura event by wearing an attire similar to Guru Gobind Singh’s. The Akal Takht, supreme temporal seat of the Sikhs, issued an edict for severing social ties with the dera. Asked about the deaths since this controversial incident, dera spokesman Harcharan Singh said: "The state government should protect us. We need security. The killings of dera followers are unacceptable. Charan Dass had not even come to the dera for six years. He was killed for entering a gurdwara bareheaded." Asked about these cases, Muktsar senior superintendent of police Sarabjit Singh said: “We are on the lookout for the killers. The murders happened in the dark, so the CCTV footage is unclear. We are searching for the other cameras that might have recorded the crime.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/since-first-sacrilege-case-6-dera-men-killed-in-punjab/articleshow/88099105.cms||Neel Kamal

Talking to the media at Punjab International Trade Expo (PITEX) here, Sidhu said if there could be a trade route between Mumbai-Karachi then why not from Punjab. He said the opening of Attari-Wagah trade wouldn’t just benefit Punjab, but rest of India too since it would open gates to 34 countries to trade. Sidhu gave an example of how European nations opened their borders on a single visa despite fighting against each other during the world wars. He said Indian goods could be sold in the neighbouring country, which is just 20 km from Attari, while the same goods were going to the same destination via Dubai. Stating that he had heard about the installations of scanners at Integrated Check Post (ICP) in Attari in near future, he said he welcomed any step that helped promote trade. He said over 67,000 people had traveled to Kartarpur Sahib, but not a single untoward incident had happened. “I assure that the MSP on wheat and paddy would increase within days of the opening of the border with Pakistan and so would the prices of other vegetables,” he said, adding that 60 years of development would be achieved within six months of opening of trade via Attari/Wagah borders. Politically speaking, Sidhu rubbished the announcement of Rs 1,000 for every woman in Punjab made by AAP. Stating that Punjabis were not beggars, he said these announcements were only deviating tactics by AAP to fleece voters ahead of elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-open-attari-wagah-border-for-better-trade-says-navjot-singh-sidhu/articleshow/88099124.cms||---

---||Noida||Gate protocols under scanner as walk-in thieves strike at condos||Greater Noida: The recent arrest of two thieves, allegedly part of a larger gang, has revealed a new modus operandi being employed to get past security at condominiums. Simply walk in. On November 23, Shahnawaz and Imran were arrested for breaking into housing society compounds that are supposed to be secure. Prohibited bores of bullets and three pistols were also seized from their possession, police said. According to the Beta II police station, the two managed to walk into Eldeco Green Meadows in Sector Pi on November 6 as there were just two guards at the gate. On November 4, they got into Twin Towers AWHO, Gurjinder Vihar by citing a random flat number, which was recorded in the apartment’s visitor management app. These apps send a notification to residents of a flat, who can use the ‘deny’ option if they don’t know who the visitor is. But in this case, the guards were apparently not well trained in the app’s use and the thieves gained access. Police said guards were not well trained in either society and they had written to the Private Security Agencies (Regulation) Act cell to initiate cancellation of the licence of both security agencies. It’s not known how many other societies the gang has similarly targeted but gate protocols at condominiums across NCR, especially the bigger ones with busy gates, will come under scrutiny if gangs are able to gain access by deceiving or distracting guards. Shahnawaz and Imran, police said, would do a recce of the societies – the tower numbers and floors – before trying to get in. They would visit properly dressed, in a car or a two-wheeler, to give the impression of a regular visitor. They spied the visitors’ logbook for residents’ names and flat numbers. If they didn’t find one, they would come up with one and hope it would work. “In case the flat owner or the guard denied them access, they left quietly,” a police officer, who is a part of the probe, told TOI. “However, not all guards are well trained on visitor management apps and the thieves appear to have gained entry at some places where guards did not check the approval status,” the officer added. Once inside a society, they would first take the lift to go to the top floor of a building and then come down using stairs, scanning which flats had locks on them. If they found multiple flats on the same floor locked, they would break into one, police said. DCP (Greater Noida) Amit Kumar said that the two thieves broke into a businessman’s flat at Twin Towers AWHO on Diwali but had managed to enter the society by citing a different flat number. “This family, too, was out of station at the time but the owner had by mistake approved the entry. Though he cancelled the approval immediately after that, the guards had failed to take it into account,” the DCP said. “At Green Meadows, however, there was a clear lapse on the part of the guards who did not stop the accused. The guards, our probe indicates, were busy making an entry for another car and the two thieves simply entered the society unnoticed,” the DCP said. Four flats in the G and I blocks of the society were robbed that day, all of the residents who were out of town for Bhai Dooj. The thefts also show exit monitoring protocols need to be reviewed as well. If a visitor has made an unauthorised entry, the app or the log will reveal that at the time of exit if monitored diligently. Harveer Singh, the owner of HBN security, admitted there were only two guards present at the Green Meadows gate at the time of the incident. He said cameras installed at the gate had finally helped cops identify the two accused. The families who were robbed said except for a few stolen watches, none of the items stolen, worth lakhs, has been recovered. Beta II station officer Anil Kumar said that the accused claimed to have sold off the items. “We had approached police to see the recovered items. We, however, realized none of the items stolen from our houses had been found,” said one of the flat owners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gate-protocols-under-scanner-as-walk-in-thieves-strike-at-condos/articleshow/88097906.cms||Shikha Salaria

It lay about 180 kilometres east-southeast of Vishakhapatnam at 5.30 pm on Saturday and is likely to hit the Odisha coast near Puri around noon on Sunday. The news comes as welcome relief for the north coastal districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam, which faced the wrath of cyclone Gulab in September. Though light to moderate rains along with squally winds were witnessed at some places along the coast due to the impact of Jawad, no major damages like uprooting of electric poles, flooding of roads, and disruption of power supply were reported. A 17-year-old student died at Meliaputti village under Vajrapu Kotturu mandal in Srikakulam district on Saturday morning after a coconut tree got uprooted and fell on her due to strong winds. The deceased, identified as Gorala Indu, was a second year-intermediate student. The incident happened when the girl was returning to her house after attending nature's call. While some areas in Srikakulam district received heavy rains, the damage to crops, particularly paddy crop, and enumeration process will begin after three-four days. Kaviti mandal received 57.4 mm rainfall, followed by Santhabommali (52.8 mm), Sompeta (50.2 mm) and Jalumuru (44.6 mm), while Bheemili in Vizag district received 15.8 mm rainfall. IMD-Amaravati director Stella S said heavy rains and squally winds (60 to 70 kmph) are likely over one-two places in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts from Saturday midnight to Sunday morning. "Jawad lay centred over west-central Bay of Bengal and is moving slightly northwestwards at a speed of 3 kmph. It is likely to move further northwards and weaken into a deep depression in the next six hours and then move north-northeastwards along the Odisha coast and reach Puri (in Odisha) on Sunday noon. Subsequently, it is likely to weaken further and continue to move north-northeastwards along the Odisha coast towards West Bengal," she said. Officials have cautioned people not to take holy bath in rivers, streams, canals, and other water bodies in connection with the holy Karthika month on Sunday as they would be overflowing due to the rains that may lash the upper reaches. Meanwhile, Ganjam district administration in Odisha has provided shelter to over 500 fishermen from Visakhapatnam and nearby areas, and provided space to them to anchor 68 fishing trawlers. The fishermen were out in the sea when the sea turned rough with the storm inching towards the coast. "We have allowed them to berth their boats in Gopalpur port. All are safe," Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said. They will leave after the situation improves, he added. The fishermen are carrying enough ration and fuel with them and prepared their food inside the trawlers, said district fisheries officer Subrat Patnaik, who along with his staff met the fishermen. During the landfall of cyclone Gulab on September 26, AP fishermen were allowed to berth their boats in Gopalpur port.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/cyclone-jawad-weakens-into-deep-depression-spares-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/88099242.cms||Nalla.Babu

The public health laboratory sent test samples to the whole genome sequencing labs in Chennai and Bengaluru to check if the passenger was carrying the Omicron variant. Health minister Ma Subramanian, who was in Villupuram, told reporters that a 25-year-old man from the UK, who travelled via Dubai and landed in Chennai on Saturday, tested positive for Covid-19. Till Friday, three passengers - two from the UK and one from Singapore - tested positive for Covid-19. It will take anywhere between five to seven days for the state to find which variant has infected them, officials said. While three patients are admitted to the government Covid-19 hospital, one patient is in the government hospital in Trichy. Health conditions of patients are stable, doctors said. "They have been asymptomatic and the infection is mild," a senior doctor said. Passengers from 11 high-risk countries landing at all international airports in the state are tested. "They are not allowed to leave the airport without negative results. We allow passengers who test negative to go home but advise them to remain in quarantine until a repeat test on the eighth day," he said. Passengers pay for the RTPCR tests on arrival. The state also draws samples from 5% of passengers from other flights to keep a tab on the infection rate, he said. The passengers don't have to pay for these tests, the doctor added. Patients who test positive are taken to government hospitals for treatment. The state has 200 beds in state Covid hospital at King Institute campus, special wards in Omandurar and Rajiv Gandhi government hospitals. Overall, the state has more than 72,000 beds including 8,722 ICU beds and 40,000 oxygen beds, besides 35,483 beds in covid care centres for Covid-19 care. In addition, the state has 6,425 additional Covid Care Centres. In Madurai, a special ward for dealing with the Omicron variant has been established in Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai. The 30 beds with oxygen support are set aside for patients coming from high-risk countries. "The treatment or isolation protocols are not different from other Covid-19 cases," director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam said. Isolation wards have also been kept ready in Government medical college hospitals in Trichy and Coimbatore. Government hospitals in Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts have also created wards with piped oxygen supply. The state has stocked up on adequate drugs for management of these cases, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-readies-infrastructure-to-tackle-omicron-cases/articleshow/88099273.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Couple cheats 50 families in chit fund scheme||VIJAYAWADA: A couple allegedly cheated over 50 families in an unregistered chit fund scheme at Ponugupadu village of Phirangipuram mandal in Guntur district. The incident happened over a span of five years and came to light only on Friday after several of them approached Phirangipuram police station to lodge a complaint against the couple. The accused were identified as Nidamanuru Bhimeswara Rao, his wife N Subbhayya and another relative N Shiva Prasad. According to Phirangipuram sub-inspector Ajay Babu, the three accused lured several people into the chit fund scheme across Phirangipuram, Guntur town and Narasaraopet areas. Cops said that a total of 50 members collectively lodged a complaint with them stating that Rs 2.5 crore that is owed to them is yet to be repaid and that the chit fund organisers are on the run. According to the police, apart from the existing complainants, the fraud could go up to the tune of Rs 7 crore, as many of them are yet to lodge their complaints against Rao and Subbhayya. The police said they have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC and sections of Andhra Pradesh Chit Funds Act, 1971. Further investigation is still underway as the police are on the lookout for the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-couple-cheats-50-families-in-chit-fund-scheme/articleshow/88099281.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: AIADMK seeks cop cover for its headquarters||CHENNAI: AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami on Saturday filed nominations for the election to the dual posts as a team amid allegations of attacks on potential candidates and police protection being sought for the party headquarters. Party sources said more than 300 nominations were filed and most proposed OPS and EPS for the dual posts. The eligibility criterion for candidates is that the applicants should have 15 proposers and 15 seconders, who should be members of the general council. The scrutiny and withdrawal of nominations would be done on Sunday and Monday. The election was marred by allegations of manhandling of a candidate at the party headquarters for the second consecutive day, with some men, along with expelled leader V Pugazhendi approaching the Royapettah police in Chennai. A Vijayakumar, a functionary from north Chennai, filed a police complaint against an alleged attack on him at the party headquarters. Senior party functionary Aadhi Rajaram lodged a complaint with the Royapettah police seeking police protection for the AIADMK HQ, while former minister D Jayakumar met Greater Chennai Police commissioner Shankar Jiwal with a similar plea. "We got to know that those who are not primary members of the AIADMK, expelled cadres, other party cadres and anti-social elements in the guise of filing nominations are trying to enter the party office with an intent to incite violence and riot and disrupt law and order," Jayakumar said in his petition to the commissioner. Pugazhendi alleged that the AIADMK had become "a goondas party" with rowdy elements pushing out the cadres, who wanted to file nominations. "There are attacks because OPS and EPS want to avoid an election and announce themselves as elected unopposed," Pugazhendi said. Former minister and party election officer C Ponnaiyan termed as "wrong information" the reports of attacks on cadres and refused to reveal the total number of nominations received for the dual posts. The leader, however, said it would be known on Sunday when the scrutiny is taken up. Four years after the merger of the erstwhile factions, OPS and EPS filed a nomination together following an amendment to the bylaw last week by which the dual posts should be elected by a 'single vote' by the primary members. According to party sources, 15 senior leaders proposed the names of OPS and EPS. Another set of 15 functionaries seconded the dual leadership. Withdrawal of nomination is permitted till December 6. Police officials said that an assistant commissioner, four inspectors and sub-inspectors, besides 25 police personnel provided security for the AIADMK office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-aiadmk-seeks-cop-cover-for-its-headquarters/articleshow/88099311.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Retired cop's house burgled when family away for his last rites||CHENNAI: The house of Nallamma Naidu, a retired superintendent of police who died last month, was burgled on Friday. Naidu was former chief minister Jayalalithaa's thorn in the flesh as far as the corruption case against the leader was concerned. He was put incharge of the case by the DMK government initially, but he never flinched from his responsibility even when the AIADMK returned to power, till the ex-CM was convicted for disproportionate assets. Police said Naidu's family members had gone to his native district of Theni to perform some remaining last rites for the office, when the house in Peravallur was broken into and valuables stolen. The theft came to light after one of the relatives went to Naidu's house in Periyar Nagar to clean it and found the main door lock was tampered. He immediately alerted Naidu's son Saravanan about the incident. Saravanan informed his relative to check for the belongings at the safe. The man called Saravanan through the video call and showed the house and the broken safe. Naidu's family estimated that around seven sovereign gold and 50,000 kept in the almirah were stolen by the suspects. Based on his instruction, his relative has filed a complaint at the Peravallur police station. After Naidu's sudden demise on November 16, Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin visited his house and paid homage to Naidu before his body was taken to his native village in Theni. The Peravallur police have registered a case and a team of forensic experts have lifted the sets of fingerprints from Naidu's house to check if any previous offenders were involved in the theft. Chennai city commissioner of police Shankar Jiwal said: "We have collected CCTV camera footage from the residences and shops nearby to trace the suspect. As we didn't know when the incident happened, we are checking the data from November 16." Another officer said that due to incessant rain, policemen on patrol duty didn't visit the area recently. There was a police outpost where the patrolling cops maintain a ledger to sign in at the record book whenever they go on night patrolling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-retired-cops-house-burgled-when-family-away-for-his-last-rites/articleshow/88099320.cms||A Selvaraj

The video has gone viral. M Vanaja, 39, of government headquarters hospital at Mannargudi was travelling in a car with her family from Madhukkur to Mannargudi on her weekly off when she saw the victim lying head down on the road near Lekkanampettai on Madhukkur road. Vasanth, a polytechnic student of Karuvakurichi who was riding a bike, had rammed into a herd of goats, skidded and fallen down. Vanaja got off the car, cleared through the crowd which was looking at the man, and without any hesitation performed CPR on the youth. "He showed signs of life after 30 seconds of pressing. Usually, we require oxygen facility while applying CPR. In this case, I was ready to give him oral breathing but the youth himself breathed," she told TOI. She said she continued the process for two more minutes. "Soon, he caught my hand due to the discomfort of pressing and opened his eyes," Vanaja said. A 108 ambulance vehicle reached the spot and in the next few minutes Vasanth walked to it with Vanaja holding his hand. He was admitted to Thanjavur medical college hospital. Social service outfit urges TN govt to regularise Vanaja’s jobAs he hit his face and the forehead on the road, he became unconscious due to the shock. So we referred him for medical examination,” Vanaja said. As the photographs and video of Vanaja saving the youth in the golden hour went viral, netizens overwhelmed her with wishes. A nursing diploma holder, she has been a contractual employee for the past one year and had recently undergone training in Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency care initiative (TAEI) in Trichy. “The youth is safe now because of Vanaja’s timely action. The medical examination showed he has no life threatening injuries,” said Dr N Vijayakumar, chief medical officer of the hospital where Vanaja works. Meanwhile, a social service organisation called ‘Nesakaram’ of Mannargudi bestowed Vanaja with the title “Nightingale of Mannargudi” at the hospital on Saturday. The outfit appealed to the state government to regularise her job.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-nurse-goes-beyond-call-of-duty-gives-back-life-to-accident-victim/articleshow/88099344.cms||Gokul Rajendran

According to intelligence sources, gurdwaras of Pakistan had received a large amount of offerings from the Sikh devotees who had arrived in Pakistan from various parts of world to celebrate Baba Nanak’s 552nd birth anniversary on November 19 this year. “A large amount of cash and gold ornaments amounting to crores of rupees were siphoned off by the members of golak opening teams constituted in each gurdwara under the chairmanship of PSGPC president Ameer Singh,” alleged sources adding that an internal inquiry was conducted by EPTB, which found the discrepancies. Now, one of its representatives is present during the opening of donations boxes now. According to a notification issued on December 1 by deputy secretary, shrines, ETPB: “After the event of 552nd birthday celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in November, the competent authority has nominated golak team to open the donation boxes placed at different gurdwaras in Pakistan.” Sources said ETPB had allowed the golak team to continue to work under the chairmanship of Amer Singh. “The team will be responsible to count and deposit the amount into the PSGPC account in the bank,” said the orders.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court halts assistant professors appointment process||CHANDIGARH: Finding faults with the criteria prescribed by the Punjab government in the selection of assistant professors in the state-run colleges, the Punjab and Haryana high court has restrained it from making such appointments. The state government’s criteria restricted the benefit of weightage only to the guest faculty/part timers/contractual teachers working in the “government colleges of Punjab”. The HC has now fixed the matter for December 13 for arguments. HC observed that the state is recruiting the assistant professors for the government colleges; thus, it is their prime duty to attract the best talent in the interest of the students as well as the community at large. “Moreover, the decision dated November 28, thereby, debarring the guest faculty/parttimers/contractual teachers from government colleges of other states to avail the benefit of weightage on the basis of work experience is wholly arbitrary and discriminatory in view of the fact that the respondents have failed to show any reasonable basis for making such a classification for the purpose of ongoing selection process. In view of the above, prima facie, this court is of the opinion that action of the state while proceeding with the selection on the basis of the decision dated November 28 is legally unsustainable and the same deserves to be stayed,” observed the judge while staying the selection process. Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu of the HC has passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Kulwinder Singh, a resident of Sangrur district. He had sought directions to quash the impugned clause of advertisement No.6 dated October 19, 2021 issued by the Punjab higher education department for recruitment of 56 assistant professors (college cadre) in computer science. The clause provides that the part time/guest faculty/contractual teachers working in the government colleges clearing the written test will be given extra weightage of one mark per completed academic year of teaching experience subject to a maximum limit of five marks. The clause was incorporated on the basis of a decision taken by the Punjab government vide memo dated October 18, whereby, it was decided to fill up 1,158 posts of assistant professors in different subjects for the state-run colleges. The petitioner mainly argued that the action of the state authorities while denying the benefit of five marks is wholly untenable in law just to favour the candidates who are working in the government colleges of Punjab and thus, prayed for stay of the further process on the basis of decision dated November 28. Observations:It is quite elementary that view of the mandate of Articles 14 and 16 (right to equality) of the Indian Constitution, every public employer has an obligation in our country to make public appointments strictly in accordance with the provision of law applicable for the posts in question and an aberration without proper justification shall negate the rule of law | Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-halts-asst-profs-appointment-process/articleshow/88097484.cms||Ajay Sura

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan made the announcement and read out the notification before a gathering of tribals in Indore to mark the martyrdom day of freedom fighter Tantya Bhil. It came just before the panchayat polls were announced. A fortnight ago, the Centre had asked four laggard states, MP included, to implement the Act. All tribals will be given house in next 4 years, says ChouhanWe have decided to change the lives of tribal brothers and sisters. Tribals comprise more than 21% population (in Madhya Pradesh). For years, it was their demand to implement the PESA Act and today, I am making an announcement by reading this notification. Today, I give you the good news that I am initiating implementation of PESA Act,” Chouhan said. PESA Act seeks to enable panchayats and gram sabhas to implement a system of selfgovernance on several issues, such as customary resources, minor forest produce, minor minerals, minor waterbodies, selection of beneficiaries, sanction of projects, and control of local institutions. The Act aims to empower local self-governments in Schedule V areas to help safeguard tribal traditions. Addressing a gathering from tribal-dominated districts of Indore and Ujjain division, the CM announced that tribals who have borrowed money from unregistered moneylenders won’t have to repay it. “We have framed a law, waiving all debt that moneylenders have distributed (before August 15, 2020) at high interest rates and without obtaining a licence for it. If any moneylender troubles a borrower, they will be sent to jail,” the CM said. Chouhan reiterated his earlier promise of implementing ‘Mukhyamantri Awasiya Bhu Adhikar Yojana’ to allot plots to eligible families, withdrawing minor police cases against tribal people, allowing tribals to prepare liquor from ‘mahua’ and ‘taadi’ as heritage liquor, implementation of ‘Ration Apke Gram Yojana’ and ‘Mukhya Mantri Udyam Kranti Yojana’. “No tribal will be left without a house in the next four years. We will give them money to construct their house. This apart, sand will be provided for free from nearby quarries to reduce cost of constructing their house” he said.“We have allotted ‘patta’ to 2.34 lakh people. This process will continue as many are yet to avail its benefits,” he said. “We have also decided to fill 1 lakh backlog posts,” Chouhan said, adding that the state government will purchase forest products, including mahua and honey, at MSP. The CM emphasised speeding up ‘Madhya Pradesh Sickle Cell Mission’. As per the department of health and family welfare’s annual report (2020-21), four tribal districts of the state -- Alirajpur, Anuppur, Chhindwara and Dindori – account for 75% of sickle cell anaemia cases in MP (4,955 of cases of 6,649 cases).

---||Shimla||Himachal Pradesh high court transfers Sirmaur death case to CBI, police lapses to be probed||SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh high court has moved the Praveen Sharma death case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The man from Waknaghat in Solan district was found dead in Sirmaur on June 9 last year. The principal secretary of the state home department has orders to do an inquiry against the police officials who had worked on the case. The count wants the compliance report on January 5. As Lalita Kumari, wife of late Praveen Kumar, sought in her petition, the court has said that police inquiry must follow the mandate of law but, in this case, the cops had not maintained the case diary, and so their conduct was suspicious. The division bench of justices Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Satyen Vaidya held that exceptional circumstances of the case warranted that an independent agency examined it. Court also held that the petitioner had no specific design behind the prayer for referring the matter to the CBI, except the need to discover the truth. She had stated that Parveen Sharma (32) was found unconscious on a steep hill of ‘Kundu Nullah’ near Pairvi Pul, Sanaura, under the Rajgarh tehsil of Sirmaur district, within the jurisdiction of Yashwant Nagar police post under the Rajgarh police station. He was moved to the regional hospital of Solan but declared ‘brought dead’. It came out in the autopsy report that the he had anti-mortem fractures in the 4th and 8th ribs besides 10 external injuries. The cause of death was "irreversible hemorrhage shock secondary to blunt trauma sustained to the thorax region". The petitioner had moved the high court about three months later. Her grievance was that even though the circumstances pointed to murder, police had "failed to discharge their statutory duty under sections 154 (police officer must reduce oral information into writing) and 157 (procedure for preliminary inquiry) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CRPC)". Allowing the petition, the division bench directed the respondents to handover all record of the case to the CBI through its superintendent of police, Railway Board Building, Shimla. The CBI will register a case. The principal secretary of the home department must examine the roles of Sirmaur’s SP at Nahan, Rajgarh’s subdivisional police officer, Rajgarh’s station house officer (SHO0, and Amar Dutt Sharma, officer in charge of the Yashwantnagar post. The inquiry officer will not be below the rank of an inspector general of police, and the investigation must finish by December 31, with the report filed on January 5. The bench observed on December 3 that: "In no circumstances it can be said that the police had no material to suspect foul play. Else, it would have closed the case in the first instance, so the police proceedings were not lawful."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/sirmaur-death-case-assigned-to-cbi-police-lapses-to-be-probed/articleshow/88097570.cms||Anand Bodh

Santragachhi Jheel in Howrah, Purbashtali in East Burdwan, Rani Pukur near Haldia, Jhaugheria and Kanaichatta in East Midnapore, Amlamethi Char in the Sunderbans and Bilkurul Jheel in Murshidabad have all recorded far fewer bird arrivals by the November-end than in the past. “In two-and-a-half decades of tracking birds, I have never seen so few numbers arrive at the lakes and jheels in south Bengal. Though the peak season for arrival of migratory birds in this region is between mid-December and mid-February with the maximum bird count being recorded around mid-January, usually a fair number of birds start arriving from early November when the temperature begins to dip. But this year, it is still fairly warm and it has rained till very late,” recounted Arjan Basu Roy of Nature Mates that helps nurture bird habitats. Raja Chatterjee of wildlife conservation organisation Junglee, who has been associated with bird habitat conservation for nearly three-and-ahalf decades, says he cannot remember so many extreme events in a year. “South Bengal has experienced four cyclones and over six depressions. If the rainy season gets prolonged, the winter gets delayed. Hence, their delayed arrival. The migration of local birds like lesser whistling duck has been badly affected,” said Chatterjee, who in 1988 discovered Purbasthali was a hotspot for migratory birds. One of the major effects of climate change is the loss of habitats that migratory birds depend on along the migration route. Global warming also influences the routes of many migratory birds and their annual migration rhythm. A lot of migratory birds change their routes, shorten or completely cancel their journey as a result of changing temperatures. Also, mild winters help resident birds to survive and they start to use food resources and breeding places of long distance migrants. This increases the competition between the species for food and breeding grounds. Birders like Suvrajyoti Chatterjee are hoping the climate change is not drastic enough to alter the route of trans-Himalayan birds that arrive from mid-December and bring joy to several hundred passionate bird lovers who eagerly wait for the winter. “We are keeping our fingers crossed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fewer-migratory-birds-trigger-climate-concerns/articleshow/88096525.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The earlier film suggested that in the name of agricultural reforms, the US government had surrendered land and food security to multinational companies. Pain supports the Indian farmers’ movement against the "corporatisation of agriculture". Pain and his assistant, Sristi Aggarwal, had travelled 10,000 kilometres across the United States to meet its farmers. They found that an average American farmer had 150 acres but had lost a lot of it to the corporates. It had destroyed dairy farming and forced many American farmers to commit suicide. The farmer unionists welcomed Pain and his team when they reached Delhi’s Tikri border on Saturday. Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala said: "The farmers’ protest has a global outreach. It forced the Centre to repeal the farm laws and achieved a victory against capitalism, which is why filmmakers, researchers, scholars, and intellectuals want to learn how we did it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/us-filmmaker-to-document-farm-stir/articleshow/88097620.cms||Neel Kamal

They said that BJP had promised in the 2017 elections that if voted to power, a fourfold compensation would be given to farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/support-price-for-apple-farmers-to-intensify-protest-in-himachal/articleshow/88097630.cms||---

During hearing, the state counsel alleged that the railways refused to help the state set up bio-toilets and install waste bins around the Jheel to prevent its pollution and demanded that it needed an express order from the NGT to cooperate in the matter. In an affidavit submitted to the court, the state biodiversity board said it had engaged Nature Mates, an agency that works towards cleaning up water bodies and protecting bird habitats to manage the water hyacinth at Santragachhi Jheel and allotted Rs 8.1 lakh for its removal from 70% of the 33 acre water body. The water hyacinth needs to be retained in a section of the Jheel to provide migratory birds with a resting and nesting place. Environment activist Subhas Datta said the upkeep of Santragachhi Jheel had improved considerably following scrutiny and orders by Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Gupta (expert member) of NGT. Both Howrah district authority and the railways had been forced to act on the Jheel’s clean-up after they were placed under the scanner by the tribunal. Bengal chief secretary H K Diwedi in his affidavit apprised the court that the government was duty-bound to take steps for prevention of pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ngt-seeks-santragachhi-jheel-report-from-dm-rly-officials/articleshow/88096514.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Chennai||Why are we still afraid to step out?||As the pandemic intensified, most of us were anxious at being locked in. But why is it that now, months after the lockdown has eased, some of us are still afraid to step out? Has the fear of the unknown over the last several months morphed into an unknown fear? It is what the months of social isolation have done to some, says counsellor Saras Bhaskar. Lakshmi*, for instance, accepts invitations to impromptu lunches with friends. But when it comes down to stepping out the door, she cannot put one foot in front of the other. Home is her safe space, she tells her counsellor over online sessions, admitting that she has not gone out to buy groceries since the onset of the pandemic. Now she refuses to send her child to school for fear of the virus. “Anxiety levels in some have escalated to the point where they are isolating themselves socially despite things opening up,” says Bhaskar. “This is the case especially in those still grieving the loss of a loved one to Covid-19. It keeps the fear alive. That, coupled with the news of the new variants of the virus, has them withdrawing further into their shells.” The anxiety leading to withdrawal is just the smoke, explains psychologist Aarti C Rajaratnam. “The fire is someplace else.” A teenager, for instance, may feel judged, perhaps because they gained weight in lockdown. Body dysmorphia (need not be a diagnosable disorder) may be the fire, social withdrawal the smoke. “Extreme cases of addiction (to pornography or gambling, for instance) may lead to social isolation. A person may have an underlying mental health condition, which required treatment, or anxiety, and not want to meet people,” says Aarti. Social withdrawal syndrome was first described in Japan as ‘hikikomori’ and defined as the state of confining oneself to one’s house for more than six months and limiting communication with others, says a study published in Front Psychiatry in 2020. In recent years, the existence of ‘hikikomori’, says the study, has been described in other countries and cultures. The study says some factors identified with the appearance of social isolation include the death of a family member, fragmented families, emotional neglect, and child abuse. A higher risk was also observed in families with a high economic level. The truth is that Covid-19 is still out there, says psychiatrist Dr N Rangarajan. “One set of the public is overwhelmed by the confusing information reaching them and that may be one of the reasons people are afraid to go out, to return to school, or work. There is also a second set of people who are pathologically anxious. Today, it is Covid-19, a few decades ago it was contracting HIV, and before that it was tuberculosis. One fear is merely replaced by another.” Seeking professional help, says Dr Rangarajan, can work to overcome that anxiety. “We are by nature social animals. No one can thrive on social isolation, whether an introvert or extrovert. Rajaratnam says the introvert’s brain is powered more by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which makes them feel good when they turn inward and spend time in reflection, which could explain why they fared better in lockdown. Extroverts on the other hand are energised by dopamine, making them seek social interaction, which is why they probably didn’t fare as well in the initial stages of the lockdown. “But in the end, both personality types do seek relationships.” No one is comfortable with change, says Bhaskar. “Whether the change is chaotic or streamlined, which can explain why several people simply don’t want to return to work, or some have quit jobs to be their own bosses. Suddenly, the return to life as it was feels overwhelming, and while for some it is because of an underlying mental condition, for most it is just about getting back to the old balance after the initial resistance and drama,” she says. After a point, the withdrawal is going to show up as loneliness, says Rajaratnam. “We’ve got to pick up from where we left off,” says Rajaratnam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-are-we-still-afraid-to-step-out/articleshow/88099493.cms||Kamini Mathai

Schools in Bhopal seek jab status information from parents||BHOPAL: In a move to encourage vaccination coverage, schools in Bhopal are seeking information from parents about vaccination status of adults in their families. Schools have specifically asked in their forms about the status of the vaccination in the families of the students. Few schools have forwarded an online form in which parents are asked to provide the information. Schools have also issued physical forms to the parents who are willing to deposit it. Schools said that parents will also be encouraged to get the complete vaccination. “It is to ensure that the family members of the students are completely vaccinated. It will encourage those who have taken only one dose so far to go for the second jab,” said a school teacher without quoting her name. Teachers said that they have been encouraging students to get their parents vaccinated. “During online classes, teachers always give some time on the vaccination status in the families of the students. It was very encouraging as students insisted their parents to get the vaccination done,” said another school teacher. Parents too have welcomed the move. “It is good initiative. Schools have started asking parents about the status of the vaccination. This will encourage those eligible to get their vaccine shot. Infact, I have not taken the second dose so far but my son is insisting for my full innoculation since his teacher sent the form to fill. When I told him that I have yet to take the second dose, he was not happy. I will take the second dose in a day or two as I do not want to disappoint him,” said a parent, Nikunj Shekhar. Parents, however, suggested that few schools were hurrying in asking the parents to fill the form. “Instead of making such a hurry, it is better to give time to parents so that they can take the complete doses. It is a good way to ensure vaccination to all,” said another parent, Anil Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/covid-19-not-vaccinated-yet-schools-in-bhopal-seek-jab-status-info-from-parents/articleshow/88099491.cms||Ramendra Singh
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu fisherboys get onboard a game of their lifetime||M Harish was seven when he saw a skateboard for the first time. As the neighbourhood boys rolled, flipped, and flew before him, he got scared out of his wits and ran away from all the overwhelming action. “There’s no particular reason why kids get scared of some things,” says Mukesh Panjanathan a.k.a Mumu, Harish’s uncle, and a popular surfer and coach from Mamallapuram where they live. “It could’ve been the acrobatics or the fear of falling that wary elders are always projecting on to children.” Today, however, Harish exudes the kind of confidence that exemplifies the dreams of hundreds of fisherkids like him. Today, elders, parents, and grandchildren of Mammallapuram’s fishing village watch him with pride and wonder, as he flies across the skate park, prepping tirelessly for an opportunity that could put their community on the national map. The 17-year-old, along with two other boys from the village — B Sivaraj, 18, and A Manikandan, 17 — is set to participate in the national skateboarding championships that will take place in Chandigarh on December 14. They’re being backed by Aine Edwards, who has been promoting kids taking up the sport including skateboarding sensation Kamali. Aine started a fundraising campaign on Milaap to help them get new boards, shoes, tracksuits and cover travel expenses. Within a week, they’ve raised almost 80% of the funds. Skateboarding is governed by the Roller Skating Foundation of India, and every state has organisations promoting talent. Besides a small skate park built by HolyStoked, a skateboarding collective from Bengaluru, with a couple of boards available for kids to use, there’s little infrastructure or resource in Mamallapuram to keep pace with the growing talent within the fishing community. “This is a critical juncture for the boys. They’re all in Classes XI or XII, and this championship wouldn’t just promote them as athletes but could get them scholarships to study higher and government jobs. Sivaraj, for instance, who had dropped out of school, rejoined recently when he saw what the sport could do for his life,” says Aine. “The boys are learning to work through complex paperwork — filling out applications, getting insurances, tests. The opportunity is strengthening their life skills in more ways than one,” she says. Mumu believes this is a milestone that will boost confidence of this first generation kids who are finding a sense of self in the sport and their parents who are learning of its prospects. “We learned everything we did over the years with one shared skateboard, one coach, and several YouTube videos,” says Sivaraj, whose father is a fisherman. “We’re anything but scared to play big. Our passion for skateboarding has been emboldened through nasty falls, injuries, and the determination to master every trick. We’ll face this challenge with joy in our hearts,” says Manikandan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-fisherboys-get-onboard-a-game-of-their-lifetime/articleshow/88099504.cms||Saranya Chakrapani

Visit doctor, urges TN minister||CHENNAI: With several patients kept away from visiting eyecare centres during the pandemic, minister for environment Siva V Meyyanathan urged them to visit ophthalmologists for check-ups. On the sidelines of the inauguration of the two-day Indian intraocular implant and refractive surgery convention annual conference on Saturday, he said early detection of diseases was important for treatment. "Whoever did not go to eye hospitals for check-up during the pandemic, they should do it immediately," he said. The event was organised by the Intraocular Implant and Refractive Society of India (IIRSI). Earlier, addressing the gathering on the occasion, he said about 450 million people require vision correction in the country, according to the World Health Organisation. Tamil Nadu has been a frontrunner in healthcare, particularly in ophthalmology as it home to many premier eye institutes. Delivering his address, Dr Amar Agarwal, secretary general-IIRSI and chairman of Dr Agarwal's Eye Hospital, said there are about 1.2 crore visually-impaired people in the country and of them 55% were affected by cataract. This number has increased because patients were scared to go to doctors and hospitals during Covid and waiting for the maturity of cataract, he said. "We have a major problem of patients who did not visit ophthalmologists across the country during the Covid period. There could be complications in cataract at an advanced stage" he said. Awards were also presented to ophthalmologists on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eye-checkup-pending-in-pandemic-visit-doctor-urges-tn-minister/articleshow/88099507.cms||---

"Sivachandran loved groundnuts, so when I went to their home in Ariyalur she asked me to distribute it to the CRPF personnel in Bengaluru as it contained her blessings," says the Bengaluru-based musician on a journey to visit homes of soldiers who have laid down their lives for the country. Jadhav, who began his road trip on April 9, 2019, has covered 28 states, and six Union territories and met families of 137 martyrs. He is passing through Chennai to go to the Andamans and Lakshadweep before heading back to Bengaluru. "When the news of the Pulwama attack broke, all I could think about was how I would feel if a loved one of mine had been martyred. Everyone mourns the martyrs, but few think about the grief of their loved ones," says Jadhav. It's this thought that prompted him to set out for the homes of martyrs. "I have been visiting the homes of not just the jawans who died at Pulwama, but also other martyrs. I collect soil from their homes and cremation grounds, which will be used to create a memorial in the form of the map of India in Jammu and Kashmir," says Jadhav He first visited the family of CRPF jawan H Guru's family in Mandya, Karnataka. In TN, Jadhav has also visited the family of G Subramanian in Tuticorin. "He was newly married when he was martyred. His brother left his job in Dubai to take care of their elderly parents," says Jadhav, who has travelled 1,50,000km so far. Every family shares anecdotes, photos and memorabilia. "They are happy that a civilian has come to pay respect to their sons," says Jadhav. "When the memorial for the slain CRPF jawans was inaugurated on the first anniversary of the Pulwama attack, I attended the wreath laying ceremony and handed over the urn containing the soil I had collected from their homes." Jadhav travels in a car with other vehicles attached as a trailer that houses the soil and memorabilia, has overcome many hardships. "My trip is not sponsored, it is a selfless act of patriotism to honour the sons of the soil who laid down their lives for our country," says Jadhav, who has slept in petrol bunks at night. The Big Biking Commune and riding and jeepers community helped him with food and navigation, mechanics have serviced his car for free, and strangers sometimes wept on hearing his story.

"The rain-battered roads would be given priority and milling is mandatory," said officials. After the recent rain, the civic body identified 622 asphalt-topped roads, 307 concrete roads, 79 bus routes, and two walkways for repairs. And 109.6 crore was allotted under the TURIP scheme (Tamil Nadu Urban Road Infrastructure Fund) and 37.58 crore under Singara Chennai 2.0. The process will be through e-tenders split into 118 packages ranging from 75 lakh to 1.5 crore, civic officials said. The defect liability period for bitumen-topped roads is three years.  Activists, meanwhile, called for measures to hold contractors accountable if quality suffers. "Strict conditions on whether the contractor would be blacklisted and what action would be taken on him must be mentioned in the tender," said convenor of Arappor Iyakkam Jayaram Venkatesan. Official data shows that 520 people have died in the city in the last six years as a result of 2,320 accidents caused by bad roads. The latest victim of a potholed road was a techie who went under a bus after hitting a pothole on Anna Salai on November 1. Venkatesan said the experience that contractors must have should be raised from five years to 15 to break the lobby. "If it is just five years, the same Class 1 syndicate contractors who were part of tenders under the previous government will take part again. If it is 15 years, the scope is bigger and contractors who took part under the 2006-11 government also may get a shot," he said. Officials said they would take strict action against if road quality is not up to the mark. "Inspections at the spot will be carried out by the quality control teams, project management consultancy, and a third party as well," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-repair-1010-roads-at-rs-147-crore/articleshow/88099550.cms||---
