Zaffar Akbar Bhat, also known as named Mohammad Akbar Bhat, was also running his separatist outfit, Salvation Movement, after surrendering as a militant in early 2000. Bhat is hails from Chadoora in Budgam district and currently lives in Bagh-i-Mehtab, Srinagar. Bhat earned a great deal of money selling Pakistani MBBS seats to the wards of doctors, officers and police officers, the SIA claims. Intelligence sources claimed he operates through his brother, Altaf Ahmad Bhat, who moved to Rawalpindi, Pakistan, after crossing into PoK for arms training. Altaf Bhat is at present in Pakistan and is a known property broker in Rawalpindi, the intelligence sources said. Zaffar Akbar Bhat was chairman of his Salvation Movement, a constituent of the Hurriyat Conference, and also enjoyed a security detail provided by the J&K police till it was withdrawn after August, 5, 2019. The son of a doctor in the urology department of SKIMS hospital, a deceased government officer’s ward and the ward of a police officer, too, were given Pakistan MBBS seats by Hurriyat leaders and others involved in the racket, intelligence sources claimed. The wards of some second-level separatist leaders are also pursuing MBBS degrees from Pakistan, the sources said. The SIA filed a chargesheet under the IPC, CrPC and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a case bearing FIR No. 05/2020 before a special judge’s designated court in Srinagar under the NIA Act. Besides Zaffar Akbar Bhat, the chargesheet has been filed against Fatima Shah of Palhalan Pattan, at present in Bemina, Srinagar; Altaf Ahmad Bhat, currently in Pakistan; Qazi Yasir, the self-styled mirwaiz of Anantnag; Mohammad Abdullah Shah of Kupwara; Sabzar Ahmad Sheikh of Anantnag; Manzoor Ahmad Shah, currently in Pakistan but originally from Kupwara; and Mohammad Iqbal Mir of Cheeni Chowk, Anantnag; and Syed Khalid Geelani. "Police station counter-intelligence Kashmir (sic) on receipt of information through reliable sources that several unscrupulous persons, including some Hurriyat leaders, were hand-in-glove with some educational consultancies and were selling Pakistan-based MBBS seats and seats in other professional courses in various colleges and universities, registered the case in July 2020," the SIA said in a statement. "The information on the basis of which criminal investigations were started into the matter also suggested that the money collected from the parents of the aspiring or potential students was used, at least partly, to support and fund (militancy) and separatism in different ways," it said. During the investigation, the SIA said, oral, documentary and technical evidence were collected and analysis revealed that MBBS and other professional degree-related seats were preferentially given to those students who are close family members or relatives of killed militants. "Evidence also came on record to show that money had been variously put into channels that ended up in supporting programmes and projects pertaining to (militancy) and separatism,’ it said. The SIA, part of the J&K police’s counter-intelligence wing, added that part of the money collected was used to fuel the unrest over the killing of terrorists, including Burhan Wani in 2016. The SIA claimed that the examination of witnesses, corroborated by other circumstantial evidence, indicated that many families approached Hurriyat leaders to avail of compensation extended by Pakistan’s ISI aimed at incentivising militancy by way of free MBBS and engineering seats for the kin of slain militants. The SIA statement said that on average the cost of a seat ranged between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, depending upon the influence of the buyer, while the kin of separatist leaders and wards of other sympathisers got free seats. According to the SIA investigation, a conservative estimate indicated that the money involved could be around Rs 4 crore per annum. The SIA probe also revealed that every Hurriyat leader was given around 40 seats in the Pakistani MBBS programme every year. According to the SIA, four people — Mohammad Akbar Bhat, Fatima Shah, Mohammad Abdullah Shah and Sabzar Ahmad Sheikh — were arrested for allegedly being part of the supply chain at one stage or the other.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sia-files-chargesheet-against-nine-including-a-hurriyat-leader-for-sale-of-pakistan-mbbs-seats-to-kashmiri-students/articleshow/88599955.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Colin Wilson interview||A joint European-Russian mission to Mars, ExoMars, launched in 2016, made history with the discovery of water for the first time near the equatorial region of the Red Planet, Valles Marineris and it was announced recently. The breakthrough was attained by ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) spacecraft. Colin Wilson, project scientist of TGO spoke to Srinivas Laxman. Are Russia and the European Space Agency (ESA) carrying out more investigation into this discovery?The Russian-led instrument which made this discovery continues to map the rest of the planet (Mars) and has already seen signs of other locations near the equator which appear to exhibit high abundances of hydrogen (indicative of water ice) – each of these areas will be studied closely to understand its history. Furthermore, Russia and ESA are collaborating to send a rover to Mars launching in 2022. This will be equipped with a drill capable of drilling up to two m below the surface. Although it will not be landing in Valles Marineris, its investigations will advance our understanding of subsurface processes in general. The discovery of water in the equatorial region of Mars is a major breakthrough. What next?ESA’s fleet of spacecraft will continue to search for water in all of its forms on Mars: in surface ice, in buried ice, in water vapour; this includes two orbiters at Mars now, as well as a rover and stationary lander launching next year (in collaboration with Russia). Later this decade, an International Mars Ice Mapper mission will be launched, whose main scientific purpose will be to map near-surface underground ice. Also, ESA and NASA are working jointly on a Mars Sample Return mission, which will bring back rock samples from the surface of Mars; that will provide yet more insights into the history of Mars and its habitability. Does this find suggest that at one time the Valles Marineris region of Mars could perhaps have been habitable?We know that, at some point in the past, Mars must have been warmer and wetter than it is today. However, it is still not clear how warm these conditions were, or how long they lasted. As to the new findings, we don’t know whether Valles Marineris amassed this large abundance of near-surface water in an epoch of abundant liquid water, or whether some glacial or other process was behind it. So there’s a lot left to research before we can reach conclusions about habitability. While water is known to exist in the cold polar region of Mars, this is the first time it was found hidden close to the equator. How did this happen and its significance?The discovery was made using a neutron mapper on an orbiter. This type of instrument has been carried on a previous Mars orbiter, but the new instrument has a much higher spatial resolution allowing it to pick out small regions in which unusual hydrogen abundances can be found. These instruments do not directly detect water, but they detect hydrogen atoms. What we know about Martian chemistry shows that most of the hydrogen will be found in water ice. When was the discovery made and why was it announced now.The scientists behind this discovery have been accumulating data continuously since the beginning of TGO science observations in mid 2018. By 2020 they had accumulated sufficient data to start analysing their findings for particular regions of the planet. Then they carefully prepared a paper for publication, following a scientific peer review. The paper has just been published, which is why it is being announced now! What was the immediate reaction of the team when the discovery was made?They are delighted, having worked on this for so many years. On a lighter note—to whom does this water belong—Russia or Europe!It belongs to Mars, not to any earthlings!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/colin-wilson-interview/articleshow/88600049.cms||Srinivas Laxman

A soldier who had been reported injured in the Anantnag offensive on Wednesday died in hospital. Lt Gen D P Pandey, general officer commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps, and IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said at a joint presser in Srinagar that the number of listed terrorists active in the Valley had dropped below 200 for the first time since the terror run in J&K started. “It is also for the first time that the number of local terrorists is below 100 – at 85 or 86,” PTI quoted IGP Kumar as saying. Two of the six Jaish terrorists shot dead in Anantnag and Kulgam since Wednesday were part of the gang behind the December 13 attack on a police bus at Zewan that killed three cops and injured 14. Slain Pakistani terrorist Shahid, alias Shahzaid, had been one of Jaish’s main operatives in the Valley for a long time and led a string of terror attacks on security forces and civilians. Another Pakistani intruder, identified as Sultan alias Rayees, was killed in the Kulgam operation. It wasn’t immediately clear who among the two was shot dead in the first gunfight on Wednesday. The other terrorists killed in Kulgam and Anantnag were Mohammad Shafi Dar of Tral, Uzair Ahmad of Mirhama, Nisar Ahmad Khanday and Altaf Ahmad Shah. Nisar was identified as a “recycled” terrorist, a term denoting someone who returned to arms after surrendering once. A couple of M4 and four AK-47 rifles, besides a large quantity of ammunition and other incriminating material, were found on the slain terrorists. In December alone, security forces have killed 28 terrorists, five of them Pakistanis, and seized at least 15 AK-47 rifles. Eleven of them were shot dead over the past five days, including the six Jaish members. “In the latest Anantnag operation, we lost Sepoy Jasbir Singh. Two soldiers and as many police personnel had suffered bullet injuries. The rest are now stable,” Lt Gen Pandey said. SSP Anantnag Ashish Mishra said that based on specific information, a joint team of the police, Army and CRPF had launched the operation at Dooru in Anantnag to capture a terrorist duo hiding in a cowshed behind a cluster of houses. “Due caution was exercised and the operation was over on Thursday morning without collateral damage.” IGP Kumar said 128 local youths had joined the terror ranks so far this year, of whom 73 had already been killed in various encounters with security forces while 16 of them had been captured. Lt Gen. Pandey said that compared to the last two years, recruitment by terror outfits was down in 2021. “Last year, it was more than 180. It shows that there is an awakening in civil society. People have realised the futility of violence. They understand what is happening across (the border),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/most-wanted-pakistani-among-2-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-jk-encounters/articleshow/88600080.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Cyber scammers cheat Odisha IT professional of Rs 42 lakh||BHUBANESWAR: An IT professional from Koraput district of Odisha has lost Rs 42.67 lakh to cyber scammers, who offered him high returns in a short period in online share trading. The 28-year-old victim, who refused to be named and identified, lodged a complaint with the cyber cell of the state Crime Branch in Cuttack on December 28. The complainant said a woman contacted him via WhatsApp on October 11 and introduced herself as a trading agent. After a brief formal interaction, the woman sent him screenshots of some successful investors and overnight growth of their portfolios (investments). “When I inquired further, she sent me successful bank transactions of their existing customers. I agreed and invested some money. I got Rs 9,500 return in quick time. After gaining my trust, they enticed me to invest more, which I did,” the victim complained. Crime Branch said the complainant invested huge money and paid 30% of his total investments to get back his initial deposits as well as the profits. In total, he paid around Rs 42.67 lakh. “When he did not receive any money, he realised he had been cheated. The woman, who had been calling her, did not receive his calls anymore. We are trying to locate the cyber criminals,” a Crime Branch officer said. The police have registered a case under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents to be genuine), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (act done by several persons with a common intention) of the IPC and other relevant section of the IT Act 2000. Police said such type of fraud has become one of the most common modus operandi these days and many fraudsters were operating from different parts of the country to widely publicise investment schemes on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, etc. The crooks use fancy product names claiming to double the investment of the investors in no time. Cyber crimes continue unabated notwithstanding massive awareness campaigns organised by the police and government in regular intervals. In the last few days, the state Crime Branch has been flooded with several fraud cases. While cyber criminals fraudulently withdrew Rs 10.10 lakh from the bank account of a senior IPS officer’s wife, a Koraput-based man lost around Rs 75 lakh to cyber crooks, who offered him Rs 1.5 crore insurance bonus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-cyber-scammers-cheat-odisha-it-professional-of-rs-42-lakh/articleshow/88597035.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Delhi||2021: When strangers turned saviours||In the first half of 2021, as the deadly second wave of coronavirus tore through the country, there was scarcity of health facilities, oxygen, ambulances and medicines. During such a bleak time, citizens from all walks of life came forward to help out complete strangers, spending hours, days and weeks online and on ground coordinating for medical supplies and food. As this difficult year draws to a close, a few COVID survivors tell us about their saviours, who they are forever indebted to. And while this is a miniscule cross-section of all the help that volunteer COVID warriors across the country provided, we dedicate this to those who stepped up when all hope was lost. ‘I’ll be forever indebted to the two strangers who helped my dad get a hospital bed & doctor consultation’I never want to relive what I went through in 2021 but I will also look back at this year with a lot of gratitude, respect, faith and belief in humanity and miracles. My father tested COVID positive and while he was still at home, he also had a cardiac arrest. I took him to the hospital, and the doctors said while he did need hospitalisation, they didn’t have any space. I was helpless and didn’t even know any doctor who could advise me on what should be done. I turned to the principal of the school where I teach, Anjali Aggarwal. She was the only person I knew, and I had started working there just 15 days before this situation came up. She connected me to her son Rahul, who was volunteering to help many others like me, and his friend Vibhu. Vibhu was a complete stranger to me, and he arranged a consultation with his family doctor first and in the meantime also started looking for hospital beds. The doctor guided me on what should be done till my father got a hospital bed. Vibhu managed to get a bed for my father after a few hours. I had never met Vibhu, but I could call him at any time without any hesitation. Both Rahul and Vibhu also gave me mental support and strength when I was facing the toughest time of my life. When I think about it now, I still can’t believe I found them, and today, my father is alive just because of them. I still tell them that for me they are no less than God. I can’t thank them enough; I’ll be indebted to them all my life.  – Shagun Sawhney, a 27-year-old Delhi-based teacher ‘My brother is alive because a stranger donated plasma’I am not active on social media and didn’t even know how Twitter worked till May 2021. In the first week of May, my brother tested COVID positive. He had a high fever and we were advised to take him to the hospital. That was when the ordeal, which many others were already facing, began. I made hundreds of calls and reached out to everyone I knew for an ambulance, which I managed to find after 18 hours of phone calls. We took him to the nearest hospital and they asked us to wait for another 4-6 hours. Meanwhile, my brother’s condition was deteriorating, he started having difficulty breathing, and I was preparing to lose him. After he was admitted to the ICU, we were asked to arrange plasma. We reached out to friends and family, but no one could help, that was when a relative suggested that maybe tweeting the details would help. I asked him to do it since I had no idea how to. After two hours, I got a call from someone in Faridabad saying that he wants to verify details and if I could send him my brother’s COVID positive report and other reports from the doctor. Even then I had no hope as by then some people who I knew could donate had said no. But to my surprise, five minutes after sending the reports, this person called again and said he was reaching the hospital. I offered him transport and he said ‘aap already bahut stress mein honge, ye sab mere upar chhor dijiye’. Within an hour he was there and donated plasma. To me and my family, he was more than God, my brother is alive because of him. Once my brother recovered, we told him the story and he wanted to meet him. So, we invited him and his family for dinner. We even wondered if we could give him something, but then we realised that there is nothing in this world we can offer him in return for what he did. – Subhash Bhardwaj, 46, a Gurgaon-based businessman Read AlsoOmicron spreads wings: Mask up, avoid crowdAccording to Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has indeed increased the chances of a resurgence in Covid cases. “While we cannot stop infections given the highly transmissible nature of the new variant which infects‘A stranger sent me medicines for my 10-year-old son at 1.30am, and now we’ve become good friends’My 10-year-old son had severe COVID during the initial days of the second wave. We were treating him at home with teleconsultation with a doctor. He had a high fever, and the doctor prescribed Fabiflu but we couldn’t find it anywhere. At that time, nobody was able to get these medicines and even hospitals were leaving it to the patient’s family to arrange for it. There was a sense of impending doom and in frustration, I just drafted a message that I need this medicine for my son and posted it in all the WhatsApp groups on my phone at 12.30am. And immediately, I got a text from an unknown number. This guy, whose name appeared as Karan on WhatsApp, asked for my address and said that he will send the medicine. He noted my address, and I received the medicine around 1.30am. I am still getting goosebumps talking about it. Log galat medicine de rahe thay, fraud ho raha tha, so I was scared about that also. I will always be thankful to Karan for sending the medicine that night. Eventually, we met and over the last few months, we have become such good friends. We have been on two vacations with Karan and we must have met over 50-60 times now! As I am sharing this now, I feel like I should make a proper video with my son to express our gratitude to him. – Prashant Jain, 38, a Gurgaon-based businessman ‘Grateful to the citizens’ group that arranged an oxygen cylinder for my father at a crucial time’My family and I got infected with COVID during the second wave. While my case was mild, my dad’s was quite severe, and eventually he had to be hospitalised. It was in May, and we were not getting any beds. Finally, somehow a bed was arranged in a hospital in Manesar. Even at home, my dad was on oxygen for two days, and with his condition deteriorating, he needed oxygen for the 45-minute hospital ride. So after the hospital bed and ambulance, we were struggling to find an oxygen cylinder. I got in touch with the civil defence group (a citizens’ organisation in Gurgaon) because I knew they were helping people. And within an hour, Rajiv ji arranged the oxygen cylinder and I took my dad to the hospital. It was such a great help. That was the time when whoever was going to the hospital, was not coming back. After staying in the hospital for three weeks, my 70-year-old dad came back, and everyone said it was a miracle. Till a few months back, I couldn’t talk about this without breaking down. It was such a traumatic experience. They left the cylinder with us for almost a month so that we could use it. I’m grateful to Rajiv ji and the civil defence group for that timely help and for helping thousands of strangers like me. – Smita Gupta, 42, works with an NGO||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2021-when-strangers-turned-saviours/articleshow/88595957.cms||Niharika Lal

And this year, food delivery platforms and restaurants are expecting even more orders. With restricted dining hours in NCR restaurants, the number of home delivery orders has already seen an upsurge. Many people have already started calling eateries to place their orders in advance. “Going by the number of calls we are already getting, we are expecting the volume of delivery orders to be very high both on December 31 and January 1,” says restaurateur Goumtesh Singh. Restaurateur Amit Bagga adds, “In the last few days, since the time restrictions came into place, we already have seen a spike in food delivery orders. Keeping that in mind we will be having extra riders for December 31.” Restaurateur Vikrant Batra says, “People have already been calling for early bookings for December 31 and the number of orders is surely going to be very high.” ‘Increasing delivery hours till 3am on New Year’s Eve’Some eateries have decided to extend their food delivery hours to meet high demand for food delivery orders on December 31. Says restaurateur Zorawar Kalra, “There is going to be a very huge surge as is always the case when there is a curfew or a lockdown. We are retrofitting two kitchens to start delivery. Our outlets are geared up for a serious increase in volumes and we are increasing delivery hours for some outlets till 3am. We are also ramping up new cloud kitchen openings and are hopeful that at least two more will be operational by December 31. We are also providing backups for order delays by hiring our own delivery partners.” “We see new benchmarks being set every year as this category grows and more people rely on food delivery on New Year’s Eve. We expect this year to be no different and are fully geared for it. We have expanded the capacity of our delivery fleet and our support and operations staff,” informs a spokesperson from food delivery platform Zomato. A spokesperson from another delivery platform, Swiggy, adds, “As most state governments had permitted Swiggy to operate as an essential service through the movement restrictions in 2020 and 2021, we have been shaping ourselves to the rules implemented in every city. With this, we also have an understanding of demand patterns during night curfews and the same is incorporated in every aspect of the business including demand-supply planning and delivery partner availability.” Read AlsoNight curfew in Delhi from 10pm to 5am after yellow alert sounded under GRAP in view of rising Covid-19 casesThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government imposed night curfew in Delhi from 10pm to 5am as yellow alert was sounded on Tuesday under Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in view of rising Covid-19 cases.Restaurant owners rely on food delivery orders to cope with business lossesLast week of December is the busiest time for restaurants and bars. While COVID restrictions will result in major business losses to restaurant owners, they are pinning their hopes on a high number of food delivery orders for revenue essential to keep their kitchens running. On December 27, a day before the Level-I (Yellow alert) of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was imposed in Delhi, National Restaurant of India (NRAI) wrote a letter to Chief Secretary (Delhi government) “to ensure that delivery of cooked food from restaurants continues smoothly as before, without facing any problems/discontinuity.” The letter also mentioned that “This will bring in the much needed relief to the industry at this critical juncture, and help prevent further business closures and job losses for millions of workers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restos-gear-up-for-surge-in-food-delivery-orders/articleshow/88590029.cms||Divya Kaushik

The daily case count has gone up more than 2.6 times since Monday. On Thursday, India had recorded 16,695 fresh cases till late night, with data from a couple of states yet to come in. This is the highest single-day increase in cases in 71 days since 18,388 cases were reported on October 20. Thursday’s final tally is expected to exceed 16,700, 27% higher than the 13,180 infections detected on Wednesday. Cases have risen dramatically in just three days since Monday, when 6,242 infections were recorded. While the biggest spikes are being seen in big metros such as Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Bengaluru, cases are rising in most states except Kerala and those in the northeast. Maharashtra reported a rise of nearly 40% in a day, with 5,368 new cases posted on Thursday. Of these, 3,555 were from Mumbai, which saw numbers spike by 45% since Wednesday. Mumbai’s daily cases have zoomed to the highest since May 5 this year. The surge in Bengal was even sharper. Covid cases in the state nearly doubled in a day, rising from 1,089 on Wednesday to 2,128, with Kolkata’s tally increasing 102%, from 540 to 1,090. Delhi reported 1,313 fresh cases, up from 923 on Wednesday. While Kerala recorded 2,423 cases, the second highest count after Maharashtra, the pandemic continued to wane in the state as this week’s numbers have been lower than those in the corresponding days of last week. The numbers, however, are rising in Kerala’s neighbouring states. Tamil Nadu logged 890 fresh cases, the highest in the state since November 4. At 707, Karnataka posted its highest single-day increase since September 26. Other states where Covid numbers have jumped sharply since Wednesday include Rajasthan (up 92%), Bihar (71%), Punjab (67%), Uttar Pradesh (64%), Goa (54%), Madhya Pradesh (50%), Chhattisgarh (42%), Jharkhand (40%) and Haryana (38%). In all these states, daily cases are still below 500. The highest count among these states was in Jharkhand, which reported 482 new cases on Thursday. Deaths, at 73, remained below 100 for the seventh day running. The overall toll, however, rose by 222 on account of old deaths being added to the total.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-india-cases-up-27-in-a-day-rise-2-6-times-in-just-3-days/articleshow/88600696.cms||Amit Bhattacharya
---||India||Amid nixing call, AFSPA extended in Nagaland||NEW DELHI: Days after it set up a committee to review the application of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in Nagaland, and amid calls for its scrapping as the Manipur elections approach, the Centre has declared the entire state as a “disturbed area” under AFSPA for a further period of six months until June 30, 2022, in accordance with its security assessments. Stating that the central government is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of Nagaland “is in such a disturbed and dangerous condition that the use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary”, the Centre, through a gazette notification issued on Thursday, declared the whole state to be a ‘disturbed area’ for a period of six months with effect from December 30, 2021. This is an extention of the ongoing AFSPA and does not bring any new areas under its jurisdiction. The decision to continue the enforcement of AFSPA across the whole of Nagaland comes amid shrill demands to withdraw the Act from the state in view of the killing of over a dozen civilians in Mon district by 21 Para-Special Forces, allegedly due to “mistaken identity”. The Army and the Nagaland government have constituted separate inquiry teams to probe the incident. Mon district is home to the Konyak tribe, one of the largest in Nagaland, and the December 4 tragedy in which the 21 Para SF killed 13 villagers of Oting in a botched counter-insurgency operation and its aftermath, spontaneously gave rise to renewed demand for withdrawal of the controversial Act that gives sweeping powers to the armed forces to “fire upon or otherwise use force, even to the causing of death” from the state and other states in the northeastern region. The Nagaland legislative assembly on December 20 unanimously resolved to demand that the government of India repeal the Act from the northeast, specifically from Nagaland. In its reaction, the Naga People’s Front, which is a partner along with BJP in the ruling alliance, said it is “aghast” seeing the Centre again declaring the state as ‘disturbed area’. The influential Naga Student Federation said the extension of the Act is “an insult to the Nagas at this time of grief” and warned that it will start protests through a series of “democratic agitations”. The Naga Hoho said by extending the Act, the Centre has invited the wrath of the Naga people. The Konyak Civil Society Organizations said the extension of AFSPA has “added salt to the wound” and alleged that the Union home ministry’s decision is “a total violation of human rights”. “Adding salt to the wound, the declaration of extension of AFSPA is a calculated sign that undermines human dignity and value while the Konyaks are crying for justice. Tagging the region as disturbed when its people have totally denounced any form of violence and are yearning for peace... The Konyak CSOs outrightly state that the integrity of the nation cannot be achieved without people’s support and confidence,” the umbrella organisation of civil society groups said in a statement. What has taken all by surprise is that just four days ago, the Centre, after a meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah and attended by Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio, deputy CM Y Patton, NPF leader TR Zeliang and Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma in New Delhi, announced a six-member panel, headed by secretary (border management) in MHA Vivek Joshi and including Nagaland chief secretary, DGP and Assam Rifles as members, to “review the AFSPA in the state of Nagaland” and “make suitable recommendations within three months”. Incidentally. this is the fourth committee set up by the Centre in the last 17 years to review the imposition of the draconian 1958 law in the northeast. It is expected to submit its report in 45 days. In the interim, since the validity of AFSPA was expiring on December 30, the Centre has extended the same for six more months to maintain continuity and also because it sees the situation in Nagaland as “disturbed and dangerous”. The situation in Nagaland and the recent ambush that resulted in the deaths of a colonel, his wife and son as well as other personnel, has underlined the threat of violent groups operating in NE with support systems in Myanmar and backers in Beijing as well. AFSPA was enacted by Parliament in 1958 to tackle insurgency in the northeast. The Parliament also approved a ‘similar’ Armed Forces (Jammu & Kashmir) Special Powers Act in 1990.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-nixing-call-afspa-extended-in-nagaland/articleshow/88600763.cms||---
---||India||Omicron spreading fast, Delta still dominant strain: Centre||NEW DELHI: The Centre said a rise in Covid-19 cases since December 26 could be part of a global upsurge linked to Omicron, with daily new cases crossing 10,000 and India’s R-Naught value (rate of transmission) stands at 1.22, indicating a wider spread in cases. While attributing the recent case-spike to a possible spurt of Omicron infections in the country, officials maintained that Delta continues to be the dominant strain in India. The government also said that severity issues of the Omicron variant are still not settled though it appears to be mild. Studies are still under way to assess the impact. “We are already aware that this variant is highly transmissible and that perhaps explains the speed with which it is rising in the world,” Niti Aayog member-health VK Paul said. Paul also expressed concern over a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and positivity in certain states including Delhi, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Chhattishgarh, West Bengal and Gujarat. “There is an uptick. Several states are showing a trend which is going up. We believe on scientific basis that RO is now 1.22 as per the available data. So, cases are now enlarging, not shrinking. So far, the deaths are stable in the range of 250-260, below 300 typically, and that remains stable, which is reassuring as of now,” he said. The number of districts with more than 10% positivity has also increased sharply to eight now from two last week. Besides, 14 districts have a positivity in the range of 5-10%. Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat are emerging as states and Union territories of concern on the basis of weekly cases and positivity, said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry. The Centre has also written to eight states and UTs witnessing a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases to enhance testing, strengthen hospital preparedness, increase the pace and coverage of Covid vaccination drive and strict enforcement of restrictions to contain spread. The states are Haryana, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal and Jharkhand. The states have been asked to be vigilant in view of recent increase in domestic travel. Officials said there is no need to panic as the country is prepared in terms of large scale vaccination coverage, health infrastructure and services but cautioned against complacency. “As a nation we have experience and the massive shield of very high coverage of the vaccine. There is no need to panic but there is a need to be prepared, to be responsible and disciplined,” Paul said. Around 90% of the adult population is now covered with at least first dose of Covid vaccines, whereas 63% has received both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-spreading-fast-delta-still-dominant-strain-centre/articleshow/88600828.cms||Sushmi Dey

You were appointed successor to the Gorakhsh Peeth in 1994 when Gorakhpur was infested with crime. You were young and obviously would be facing threats. So, did you get an early training in handling criminals and mafia?It was around 1994-95. There was a well-known family of Gorakhpur which had two big havelis. The state government had allocated both havelis to the mafia. The family brought both buildings down. I met the family the day after they had brought down the buildings and asked what had happened. The person said if he did not demolish the buildings, then he would’ve lost everything, but now at least he could retain the land. In another incident, I got a call from a rich person in Gorakhpur. He said his house was being occupied by a minister. I reached the site to find that his belongings were being thrown out. I told them the owners hadn’t sold this building so how could anyone take it over. The public was watching but nobody was doing anything. When the mafia waved some papers in my face, I told the public to beat them up. Incidents like these made me join politics. Now, nobody can afford to do this kind of activity in UP. All criminals know that if they try to illegally occupy anything then they ’ll have to face bulldozers. Your opponents say that the government crackdown is selective.Mafia is mafia. It should not be linked with caste, community or religion. Mafia is the enemy of society and it is worse than coronavirus. In the previous election, BJP went without a CM face and got a historic mandate. Now, you are the face and this election seems like a referendum on your work. Does that worry you?We don’t get flustered. When we were fighting mafia alone, then we weren’t flustered. When we were fighting encephalitis, we weren’t flustered. Whatever success has been seen in UP has happened due to the inspiring leadership of the PM and his guidance. Will you be disappointed if you get 250 seats?I believe we will not get less than 350 seats SP says there is massive support for its rallies.Everyone can see how much support they are getting. We saw in their behaviour in Kanpur... how confident they are. They are trying to spoil the environment, but they will not succeed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/i-decided-to-join-politics-to-help-people-get-rid-of-mafia-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/88600911.cms||Pravin Kumar

We are analysing all the data that is available... whether it is going to be same vaccine or is it going to be different one,” ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said. “The Drugs Controller General of India and National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation are meeting and that decision will be taken before January 10,” he said. While clinical trials on mixing vaccine doses for boosters in India are as yet inconclusive, experts are considering international data, another official said. “International data show mixing of certain vaccines may result in high reactogenicity. Even though certain countries have mixed vaccines, many of them are witnessing a surge. We have to evaluate all aspects, it is not an easy decision,” a senior official told TOI. Currently, India has only Covishield and Covaxin under the government’s Covid immunisation programme. However, emergency use authorisation has been granted to six others — Serum Institute of India’s Covovax, Biological E’s Corbevax, Russia’s Sputnik-V, Cadila Healthcare’s ZyCoV-D and two other jabs from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. While CMC, Vellore is conducting trials to test mixing of Covishield and Covaxin doses, SII is also conducting trials to test a Covavax booster over two doses of Covishield. Besides, the regulator had recently given permission to Biological E for testing Corbevax as a booster on two doses of Covishield and Covaxin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/call-on-mixing-vaccines-for-booster-dose-by-january-10-icmr/articleshow/88601028.cms||Sushmi Dey

While India has reported close to 1,200 Omicron cases of the new variant, no deaths were reported until now. Maharashtra confirmed the presence of Omicron in a 52-year-old man who recently died of heart attack in Pimpri Chinchwad, but stopped short of calling him the first casualty of the variant and attributed the death to his underlying health conditions. The state added 198 cases on Thursday — its highest single-day tally for the second consecutive day — which is a major indicator that the Omicron wave is here. The total count of the variant in the state has touched 450. India reported 258 Omicron cases on Thursday, taking the total tally to 1195. After Maharashtra, Delhi reported the second highest cases, 25, while Haryana reported 23 cases. Telangana, Odisha and Bengal reported five cases each while Bihar and Punjab recorded one infection each. Omicron has now spread to 24 states and UTs. The man from Pimpri Chinchwad had died on December 28 at the local Yashwantrao Chavan Hospital. The state health authorities refrained from labelling it as the first Omicron death despite the man having a travel history to Nigeria and a Covid positive diagnosis. They said the patient had diabetes for the past 13 years. “The death of this patient is due to non-Covid reasons. Coincidently, the National Institute of Virology report revealed that he was infected with the Omicron variant,” the authorities said in a statement. Health experts in Mumbai said that since the man had a Covid positive diagnosis, the death is most likely going to be classified as a Covid fatality. Across Maharashtra, up to 46% of total 450 confirmed Omicron cases don’t have any international travel history now. Delhi, which recorded 25 new cases, too seems to be heading towards a community spread with health minister Satyendar Jain saying that the new variant has been found in 54% of the Covid samples sent for genome sequencing.

This has come through in data generated by phases II and III paediatric studies on kids aged 2 to 18 years and was uploaded on preprint server medRxiv on Thursday by the vaccine’s developer, Bharat Biotech. With this, Covaxin has become the only Covid-19 vaccine in the world to have studied and generated data from trials on kids as young as two years. Results of the trial showed seroconversion at 95-98% in children of all age groups, four weeks after they received their second dose. This indicated superior antibody responses in children as compared to adults, Bharat Biotech said. The researchers said that no serious adverse events were reported in the trials. Of the 526 volunteers that participated in the trials, 374 children reported either mild or moderate symptoms with 78.6% getting resolved within one day, the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covaxin-safe-for-kids-showed-better-response-than-in-adults-bharat-biotech/articleshow/88601133.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Some studies also show a strong response mounted through hybrid immunity developed in those vaccinated after recovery from natural infection, Bhargava said underlining that vaccination is must for better protection even for those who have suffered from the disease. Stressing on the need to wear a mask, avoid mass gathering and follow Covid-19 protocol even after vaccination, he said vaccine recipients are vulnerable due to intense dynamics of transmission as seen in the case of Omicron. “The transmission of Omicron is three or four times more than the Delta variant. In terms of the precautionary dose, we have to remember one important point — all Covid vaccines are disease-modifying and they do not prevent infection,” Bhargava said. “If you have had an infection and vaccination, your immune response is more than only infection or vaccination. So the important thing is that vaccination is essential,” Bhargava said. “There are three studies, two from ICMR and one from Mumbai, on 284 patients, on 755 patients and 244 that immunity persists for up to eight months, sev-en months and six months (respectively) and these are all published data from infection that occurred in 2020, 2021,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/immunity-after-jab-or-infection-lasts-9-months-balram-bhargava/articleshow/88601399.cms||---

Acknowledging that the ministry of external affairs (MEA) had seen reports to this effect, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “This is not the first time China has attempted such renaming of places in Arunachal. It had also sought to assign such names in 2017.” “Arunachal Pradesh,” he said, “has always been, will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact.” China’s ministry of civil affairs issued a statement saying they have “standardised” names for 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh, to be used on Chinese maps. This is the second time China has renamed the places of Arunachal Pradesh. On October 23, the standing committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislative body, had passed a new law citing “protection and exploitation of the country’s land border areas”. The committee had stated that the new law will come into effect from January 1. The law is not meant specifically for the border with India. China shares its 22,457km land boundary with 14 countries, including India. According to the Xinhua news agency, the law states “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of... China are sacred and inviolable”, and asks the state to “take measures to safeguard territorial integrity and land boundaries and guard against and combat any act that undermines these”. While the Chinese have stated that their border law would not impact existing border arrangements, India has remained on edge about Beijing’s intentions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-renames-15-places-in-arunachal-mea-hits-back-says-wont-alter-facts/articleshow/88601524.cms||---

Naveen also directed the district heads to ensure that no inmate of these organisations suffers, especially from food, security and health-related distress owing to paucity of funds. “Wherever needed, funds from the chief minister’s relief fund (CMRF) can be utilised for this purpose,” the CM said. The state government’s move assumes significance in the wake of the Missionaries of Charity recently asking its centres not to operate any of the foreign contribution accounts as a measure to ensure that there is no lapse. The move followed the ministry of home affairs’ refusal to approve the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) renewal of the Missionaries of Charity, saying it did not meet the eligibility criteria. The Kolkata-based organisation that had arrived in Odisha in 1974 runs 13 centres for the sick, abandoned, elderly, leprosy patients, mentally disabled and orphans. Nearly 1,000 marginalised and underprivileged inmates, including children, are part of these organisations. There are four to five other small centres in the state, officials said. “We have immediately intervened and supplied ration and items of daily needs for the next 15 days. We will continue to offer all help they need until their accounts are restored,” Khurda district collector Sangram Mohapatra said. A senior representative of the Missionaries of Charity in Odisha appreciated the CM’s gesture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-needed-give-money-from-cms-relief-fund-to-moc-naveen-patnaik/articleshow/88601655.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi

The BJP won 437, JD(S) 45 and independents 204 seats. The polls were held on Monday to 58 ULBs, 57 GPs and bypolls to nine ULB wards across Karnataka after a three-year delay. Most ULBs have thrown up a fractured verdict and the JD(S) could play the kingmaker in at least a dozen councils. The voters have responded to the BJP's divisive agenda. The BJP government tried to divert attention by taking up anti-conversion law, but the progressive Kannadigas realise that such issues are meant to serve no one but divisive forces. Successive election results have clearly established that voters care most about price rise, falling incomes, jobs, rampant corruption and the BJP government's apathy towards public welfare.Randeep Singh Surjewala, AICC general secretary in charge of KarnatakaCongress, with 42% vote share, claimed a rise in its support base, while BJP and JD(S) polled 36.9% & 3.8%, respectively.

In Vijayapura, the Congress has wrested three of the six city municipal corporations.

With this, we'll focus on securing a clear majority in the assembly polls.HD Kumaraswamy, former CM and JD(S) leaderBommai said the Congress has done better in these polls because most of these city corporations "are dominated by the minorities". In Bankapura, he said 65% votes belong to the minorities. "Let them (Congress) not rejoice over it. We've won more gram panchayat seats. The results are also favourable to us in city corporations.

With this, we'll focus on securing a clear majority in the assembly polls.HD Kumaraswamy, former CM and JD(S) leaderBommai said the Congress has done better in these polls because most of these city corporations "are dominated by the minorities". In Bankapura, he said 65% votes belong to the minorities. "Let them (Congress) not rejoice over it. We've won more gram panchayat seats. The results are also favourable to us in city corporations. We'll take up development work wherever BJP has won and strive towards bringing the party to power in future elections. Let Siddaramaiah and Congress not worry about that," he added. Former Congress chief minister Siddaramaiah said: "The results show that the public opinion is against the government and the wave is in favour of the Congress. Going by this trend, we are 100% sure the Congress will return to power with a clear majority in the 2023 assembly polls." KPCC president DK Shivakumar said the results reflected the mood of the people ahead of the assembly polls. "Normally, a ruling party does well in the local body elections. But people have backed the Congress in both rural and urban areas," he added. BJP minister KS Eshwarappa ridiculed the claims of Siddaramaiah and said: "He's rejoicing like a couple who get children 25 years after their marriage."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cong-wins-498-of-1184-seats-in-ktaka-ulb-polls-bjp-437/articleshow/88601774.cms||---

The tipping point for Yuvika Reddy, a final-year BCom student who was already at loggerheads with her mother, was Archana's police complaint lodged in the last week of November under Indian Penal Code 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) against her second husband Naveen Kumar V, 33, a gym trainer-cum- realtor, police sources said. A furious Yuvika, living with her stepfather Naveen, decided Archana had to be eliminated and hatched the plan with him, sources said. Woman sent goons to daughter, her loverYuvika became more determined when Archana reportedly sent a couple of goons to their house in Madhumitra Layout, Jigani. The goons warned Naveen of dire consequences if he continued his relationship with Yuvika. "Send Yuvika back to her mother," was the message conveyed to him. Naveen is said to have told the goons that he planned to marry Yuvika after divorcing Archana. While Naveen Kumar and his friend Kasuvanahalli Santosh, who executed the killing after ambushing Archana's Toyota Innova and hacked her to death, were arrested on Wednesday, Yuvika and four men were arrested for on Thursday. Yuvika and her 16-year-old brother are Archana's children from her first marriage. Naveen and Yuvika who lived lavishly were in financial crisis. Naveen who worked as a gym trainer hardly earned around Rs 25,000 a month with some of the gyms he worked in closing down due to the pandemic. Their main source of income was said to be Archana's finacial resources. "Yuvika wanted to become a model and Naveen promised to make her one. He began her fitness training in early 2020. When the gym closed during the lockdown, the fitness sessions continued at home. Around this time Archana and Naveen began having frequent fights over her refusal to transfer some of her properties in his name. In mid-2021 when she got wind of Naveen and Yuvika's affair she warned her daughter that she would not get a share in her ancestral property, if she continued her relationship with her stepfather. Soon the two moved out and started living separately," sources said. Archana's late father was a realtor and owned parcels of land worth around Rs 40 crore in Jigani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-girl-plotted-mothers-murder-with-help-from-stepfather-lover/articleshow/88601787.cms||---

The state had reported more cases — 933 — on September 30 and Bengaluru 611 cases on July 7. The state's active caseload has touched 8,223, its highest in 47 days. The last time the state had reported more than 8,000 active cases was on Nov 13 when there were 8,027 active cases. The lion's share of the state's active case burden comes from Bengaluru that accounts for 6,846 cases (83.2%). In 2-3 months, Delta may be replaced by Omicron: DocWhile the BBMP authorities admitted to a definite rise in Covid cases, they pointed out there is an increase in testing in the city and there is also a watch on the quality of tests conducted. "We need to keep a close watch for the next 10 days," said Dr AS Balasundar, chief health officer, BBMP, adding a majority of the active cases in the city are asymptomatic patients and the ICU admissions have not increased.All other districts have less than 220 active cases. Kodagu stood second to Bengaluru with 216 active cases, followed by Dakshina Kannada 146, Ballari 107 and Udupi 102. Interestingly, Gadag and Haveri districts have nil active cases. Kodagu is the only district in the state that has reported more than 1% Covid test positivity rate in the past seven days. While the state's Covid test positivity rate for a week now has been a little less than 0.4%, five districts, including Kodagu, have reported more than the state's average. The test positivity rate of Bengaluru Urban was 0.6%, Kolar 0.5%, and Uttara Kannada and Tumakuru slightly over 0.4% for the past seven days, as per the state war room data. Experts tracking the Covid graph said a similar spike began ahead of the second wave in January 2021. "It appears the trend is repeating. The virus may have a biological circadian cycle, as we saw in the beginning of the cases in 2020 and 2021. Over a period of 2-3 months, Delta variant is likely to be replaced by Omicron," said Dr CN Manjunath, Covid technical expert committee member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-logs-565-fresh-cases-a-6-mth-record/articleshow/88601803.cms||Sunitha Rao R

A 100-bed makeshift facility, set up at Tau Devi Lal stadium during the second wave, will be operational by January 5, health department officials said. Another dedicated 26-bed facility for pregnant Covid patients has been readied at Sector 31 Polyclinic, they said, adding that both the facilities are equipped with pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants. Currently, the city has a total of 5,653 dedicated beds for Covid patients, including 669 ICU beds without ventilators and another 327 with ventilators. While most of these beds are in private hospitals, at least 501 are under the state’s supervision. According to officials, there are nine Covid patients who are being treated in separate private hospitals across the city at present while none of the Covid facilities is treating any patients. “All arrangements are in place. Tau Devi Lal will start by January 5. We can also increase bed capacity at M3M in Sector 67 by another 100,” Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, said. The Tau Devi Lal centre also has 200 oxygen cylinders’ backup and can provide them to other units in case of an emergency, he added. Currently, the Government College for Girls at Sector 14 has 100 beds, ESI Hospital at Sector 9 has 80 beds, Civil Hospital in Sector 10 has 45 beds, government hospitals in Pataudi and Sohna have 25 beds each, he said. “We have nearly 500 beds in the government facilities to handle Covid cases,” Garg added. At the Civil Hospital, a dedicated 10-bed children’s wing with a high-flow oxygen facility has been set up. It also has a 35-bed unit for isolation of patients with mild symptoms and will and also use the hospital’s dengue ward for the purpose. The facility has two PSA plants too. “We have also identified a place in Manesar where we can set up 500 more beds with oxygen concentrator if needed. We have already directed all hospitals to reserve 25% of their total beds for Covid patients and to have a separate unit for patients with the Omicron variant,” Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said. The SGT and Medeor hospitals in Manesar, both private facilities, also have 700 and 100 beds each. 24 oxygen plantsThe city, which did not have a single oxygen plant a few months ago, now has 24 — 12 each in private and government facilities.

In the past few days, many RWAs that had planned to host parties and community gettogethers have had to cancel the events to ring in the New Year and urged the residents to avoid gatherings. The decision to avoid gatherings comes after the state government imposed strict measures including night curfew from 11 pm to 5 am and capping the number of people in gatherings up to 200 people or 50% of the hall capacity. Moreover, it also directed the organizers to ensure only fully vaccinated persons attend such events. "We were planning to have a New Year celebration with winter carnival but due to a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, we have had to shelve our plans. This is the second year in a row when we have had to drop our New Year plans. But we would rather do this keeping in mind the safety of residents and be safe than sorry," said Chaitali Mandhotra, RWA member of Ardee City. Some RWAs have also started to take measures to check the spread of Covid-19. They have urged residents to be mindful and to celebrate the New Year at home with their families and friends. Rajeev Sinha, RWA president of Essel Tower on MG Road said, "All our plans for the New Year’s eve have now been cancelled as there are 7 positive Covid-19 cases in our society. While we have to suffer some losses as we had already booked things in advance, we cannot prioritize money over the health of our residents. Besides, we also started strict vigil on the ground with social distancing at market complex, wearing face masks in the common areas and have made double vaccination mandatory for visitors from January 1." Echoing a similar view, Hemant Kumar, general secretary of BPTP Park Serene said that there were guidelines issued by the government and due to it they had to cancel the sporting event that they were planning to hold for children in their society. "Following the guidelines issued by the state government, we have decided to cancel the sporting events scheduled for Sunday. Because of a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, people are anxious. These are uncertain times and we have to be cautious," he said. "While we were planning to organise a gala event on New Year’s eve, but with restrictions in place by the state government we have decided to cancel it. Things were gradually moving towards normalcy but we cannot let our guard down especially with new variants which seem to spread very rapidly," said Pradip Rahi, RWA president of Ramprastha Attrium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/rwas-cancel-new-year-festivities-urge-residents-to-avoid-gatherings/articleshow/88601883.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Since February this year, the residents have been raising their concerns after their society being cut off from rest of the city but they say that no measures were taken by the two builders. They have also approached the deputy commissioner seeking his intervention to ensure 24- metre road connectivity.According to the residents, the land on which their 24-metre access road was built was earlier owned by Vipul Ltd, which built the housing society but later sold it to the Landmark Ltd which have now blocked their access to society by installing tin fences. “Our main access road has been blocked by the adjoining developer without any discussion or notice. The entire stretch that connected our society to the revenue road has been excavated and fenced by them forcefully. When we tried to oppose them, we were threatened by the bouncers," said Amit Shekhar, vice president of Lavanya RWA.The project was launched in 2010 and the possession was given in 2014. Since then, the residents have been using this road as their main access. In February this year, the adjoining developer constructed the blocks obstructing their movement and after objection from residents they dismantled it. However, the representative of Landmark Ltd said that they have not done anything illegal as they have only fenced the area falling under their license. "They have built the road on our license area and now we have only fenced our project site to secure it and nothing illegal has been done," the representative said.Meanwhile, Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner said, "Our officials have visited the site and been informed that the existing revenue road connecting to Vipul Lavanya is available. The license for a colony is issued when there is an existing revenue road or there is a proposed road. Vipul had built the proposed road in their license area but it was later acquired by Landmark. This is a 24 meter sector road, and once the project is completed, the developer will transfer the road to the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/vipul-lavanya-road-cut-off-by-another-builder/articleshow/88601886.cms||Akanksha Gupta

Road resurfacing work in DLF-1 and 2, however, has not even started till now, even though the ban on construction due to high pollution levels was lifted 10 days ago.A team of senior officials, including the MCG chief engineer and superintending engineer and a councillor, visited the colonies on Thursday. Before the corporation can take over the colonies, the developer, DLF, is required to complete all pending infrastructure work.“DLF had requested us that the deadline for completion of pending work be extended due to the construction ban. So, we wanted to check the status of work since the ban has been lifted now. But they have not started the work even 10 days after the ban was lifted. We will now serve a final notice to the builder so that the state government can impose a penalty. The matter will now be placed in the grievance committee meeting in January chaired by the CM for the final decision,” MCG superintending engineer Vivek Gill said.CM Manohar Lal Khattar in a grievance committee meeting held two months ago had directed DLF to complete all work by December 31. “The pending infrastructure work that the builder has to complete primarily includes resurfacing of roads in G-block of DLF-1 and L and J blocks of DLF-2. They haven’t started work, defying the CM’s order. We will now take this up in an internal meeting with MCG officials and decide on the further course of action,” said Rama Rani Rathee, councillor of ward number 34.Residents have also been demanding the takeover of DLF colonies so that they can hold a government agency accountable for civic services.“We are facing a number of issues, which haven’t been addressed properly by the builder. After MCG takes over, we can at least hold the civic body accountable. At present, MCG says that they haven’t taken over the colonies, so they can’t do anything. When we go to the builder, DLF says MCG is responsible for it,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of Qutub Enclave RWA in DLF-1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/deficient-infra-work-in-dlf-1-2-yet-to-begin/articleshow/88601887.cms||Vishakha Chaman

Partly cloudy condition also brought the daytime temperature to 18.5 degrees Celsius – two notches below normal. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature settled at 8.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum was at 19.4 degrees Celsius.According to the met department, the minimum temperature is likely to dip further with chances of cold wave conditions on New Year’s day.“Cold winds from the snow-laden mountains have start blowing towards the city. This has resulted into a dip in the mercury level. The temperature is expected to drop marginally over the next three days with a possibility of cold wave condition. Moderate to dense fog conditions are also expected in isolated area," an IMD official said. According to the weekly forecast, there will be partly cloudy condition on Friday, with the minimum and maximum temperature likely to hover around 6 and 20 degrees Celsius, respectively.Meanwhile, the AQI level in the city continued to be in the ‘poor’ category for the fourth day in a row.

---||Gurgaon||DTCP: Illegal commercial activities in Sushant Lok-1 add to infra burden||Gurgaon: A recent survey by the department of town and country (DTCP) has found that several illegal commercial activities were being carried out on residential plots at Sushant Lok-1, which has led to a huge burden on the local infrastructure. The department, officials said, will now carry out sealing and demolition drives in the licensed colony within 15 days.The survey was undertaken by the DTCP after members of the Queen Plaza Shop Association had filed a complaint with the enforcement team against property owners for engaging in illegal commercial activities in violation of the norms. The association members had alleged that despite paying all taxes, dues, and procuring trade licenses, they were facing losses due to illegal shops and commercial activities in the area. Shiv Shankar Rai, a local resident, said with an increasing load on basic amenities due to ongoing construction of fourth floors and delay in augmentation of the infrastructure by the civic body, the local residents were facing several issues related to water supply, sewerage and drainage system, power supply and others.On Thursday, town planner (enforcement) RS Batth said that based on the complaints, the department carried out a survey of the licensed colony and will now launch a sealing and demolition drive in the area. Most of the violations were in 60-yard plots under the economically weaker section category in C-block of the colony, he said.Meanwhile, residents have also alleged that the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) had failed to utilise around Rs 88 crore, which it has received from the DTCP in the form of fees collected from property owners against the increased FAR (floor area ratio). The funds, as per the norms, should have been used for infrastructure augmentation.In 2016, the state government had increased the FAR allowing change of land use (CLU) for residential purposes under the Haryana Building Code, 2016. The building code provides that additional FAR is allowed on the payment of charges as approved by the government from time to time. Currently, the DTCP has stopped the transfer of FAR charges to the civic body due to the non-utilization of funds so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/dtcp-illegal-commercial-activities-in-sushant-lok-1-add-to-infra-burden/articleshow/88601889.cms||Rao Jaswant Singh

---||Gurgaon||Hry launches genome sequencing lab||Gurgaon: Keeping in view the threat from the highly transmissible Omicron variant of Covid-19, the state government on Thursday made a genome sequencing laboratory operational at Maharshi Dayanand University in Rohtak, the first such facility in Haryana. This will speed up sentinel surveillance — monitoring the rate of occurrence of the variant — in the state as random Covid samples need not be sent to Delhi now for genome sequencing, health department officials said.The lab has a capacity of processing 92 samples in one go (four hours) and will take three days to declare results. Samples of foreign travellers coming into Haryana, however, will still be sent to the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi as the lab has only one genome sequencing machine at present.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Haryana, said genome sequencing is the method of figuring out the order of DNA nucleotides of an organism. It helps in understanding how genes work together to direct its growth, development and maintenance, he added.The lab will process samples of sentinel surveillance being carried out by the state. “Each district sends samples of 2% of its Covid-positive cases to Rohtak. These samples used to be sent to Delhi for genome sequencing, which now will be processed here. At present, we have been able to procure only one machine. So, we will continue to send samples of foreign travellers to Delhi,” said Chaudhary.Haryana has been sending 300 samples every month to Delhi for genome sequencing since the end of the second wave of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hry-launches-genome-sequencing-lab/articleshow/88601892.cms||Ipsita Pati

We had sent their samples around 10 days ago for genome sequencing and received the reports on Thursday,” said CMO Virender Yadav, adding that their contact tracing was carried out but no one was found to be infected with Covid.Of these 13 cases, three are women. A health department official said a total of 29 contacts of these 13 patients were traced and tested. “Around nine of these 13 people had travelled to either the US or the UK. All 13 travellers were tested negative at IGI Airport, but were tested positive when they underwent the second test around seven days after they reached the city,” he added. Haryana, meanwhile, reported 23 Omicron cases on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/13-more-cases-of-omicron-reported-all-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88601893.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Noida||4-month farmers’ protest in Noida to end? Talks are near ‘resolution’||NOIDA: A breakthrough in talks between farmers’ representatives and a Noida Authority team was in sight after a marathon meeting between the two sides but Thursday ended with the sit-in agitation continuing outside the Noida Authority office, where farmers have been camping for the last four months. The farmers claimed the government team had agreed to three of their major demands but decided not to call off the protest because they had not received a signed document. Senior Noida Authority officials remained tightlipped on the details of negotiations but claimed a “resolution” had been reached. Farmer leader Sukhvir Khalifa, who is currently in hospital, said there was “distrust” and “doubt” among farmers about the promises made. “Officials had agreed earlier but are now dilly-dallying on giving a signed document. The protest will continue till we get a signed document,” he said. Khalifa, who was discharged from hospital later in the evening, reached the protest site and said that he will remain on hunger strike till the farmers’ demands are met. Another farmer, Ravi Chauhan, who had been on hunger strike, was taken to the district hospital. Sudhir Chauhan, one of the protesters, said after a five-hour meeting on Wednesday that continued till 10pm, another round of talks was held on Thursday afternoon. “They had agreed to three of our major demands – handing over 5% plots to farmers whose land has been acquired since 1977, increasing the quantum of leaseback and keeping farmers’ properties out of the map policy except for the bar on increasing the height over 15 metres,” he claimed. “We had asked Authority officials to give a written document signed by the designated authority to us. However, by Thursday evening, the situation changed as they were not ready to hand over a written document. We also wanted that some of the farmers sitting in protest could be handed over the 5% plots to send a positive message but that wasn’t done either,” he added. CEO Ritu Maheshwari said the Noida Authority will comment “only when the dharna is lifted”. ACEO Praveen Mishra, who led the talks with the farmers along with two officers on special duty, said the issue had been almost resolved but the details would be given only on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/4-month-farmers-protest-in-noida-to-end-talks-are-near-resolution/articleshow/88601894.cms||Shikha Salaria

With this, the district’s tally has touched the 200-mark this month, which is the highest since July when a total of 156 cases were recorded. According to health officials, one of the patients, who had recently returned from abroad, was among the new cases. Currently, there are 135 active cases in the district, most of them in home isolation.Neighbouring Ghaziabad, meanwhile, has registered 15 new cases, three more than Wednesday. Two of the patients had returned from abroad recently, officials said. The district has seen a total of 123 cases this month, which is also the highest since July when 65 cases were recorded. There are 86 active cases in the district, officials said, adding that the maximum cases in Ghaziabad have been reported from Indirapuram followed by Nehru Nagar and Crossings Republik.

The hour was odd – 3.30am when a night curfew is on because of the pandemic. But odder still was a ladies’ purse in a van with five men. What followed were a series of questions by the curious cops, which led to evasive answers, a trail to the hotel in Sector 71 and the eventual arrest of a group of 18 people, who could be involved in leaking question papers of the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (C-TET), which is conducted by the CBSE. Times ViewExamination paper rackets cheat and discourage the honest student and render the entire system hollow in the long run. That such rackets are being unearthed with frequency is a cause for alarm. Such crooks deserve strict punishment from the law.The accidental arrests, police said, could help unearth one of the biggest exam rackets in recent times. Among the 18 are five possible candidates of C-TET as admit cards were recovered from them. They were in the middle of sharing answer keys when the police team raided the hotel — around 4 in the morning on Thursday. The cops are now trying to find out if the answer keys are indeed of questions that were asked in C-TET, which was conducted across several centres on Thursday. Police said one of the gang members, who had a pen drive with the answer keys, escaped by the time they started searching the hotel. The alleged kingpin of the racket — a lawyer from Sonipat — is also on the run. The arrests come days after the UP-TET had to be cancelled because of a question paper leak. “Since night curfew is on, a police team deployed in Sector 60 stopped a Maruti Eeco with five men in it. It was around 3.30am. When the car was being searched, the cops found a ladies’ purse. The men were questioned, and they revealed that it belonged to a woman who was staying at a hotel in Sector 71,” said Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP, Noida. The police team accompanied the five men to the hotel and started a search. There were 13 more persons, all of whom were subsequently arrested. What aroused suspicion among the cops were the 51 admit cards of C-TET that were recovered. The cops are now trying to ascertain the veracity of the documents. “Apart from 51 admit cards of C-TET scheduled for today (December 30), there were three laptops and 20 cellphones. The 18 persons had five cars in total and Rs 36,000 in cash were recovered from them,” the senior officer said. A round of questioning revealed that one of the members of the racket, named Ravi, escaped with the pen drive that allegedly contained all the answer keys. “They had gathered in the hotel to share the answer keys. The candidates were to appear in the test scheduled later in the day,” Singh said. Each candidate is believed to have paid Rs 2.5-3 lakh for the answer keys. Although Noida did not have a centre for C-TET, it was held in Gurgaon, Mathura, Moradabad and several other cities on Thursday morning. The police are now looking for Vinay Dahiya, the lawyer from Sonipat who had been allegedly running the network for three to four years. The arrest of the remaining gang members is crucial to find out how they managed to procure the question papers and the answer keys, police said. An initial investigation has revealed that among the arrested are Bhavani Sharma, a retired CRPF constable from Rajasthan, and Shiv Ram Singh, who is currently posted in Raipur as a CRPF head constable. An assistant sub-inspector in Delhi Police, Vikas, was also among those arrested, the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/how-ladies-purse-lifted-the-veil-off-exam-racket-18-held/articleshow/88601896.cms||---
---||Noida||After CAG censure, sub-leasing of group housing plots in Noida to stop||NOIDA: Division of group housing plots, one of the reasons identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General for Noida’s real estate problems, will no longer be allowed. A formal decision on this is likely at the next Noida Authority meeting. Efforts are on to schedule it before the dates for the assembly elections are announced in January and the model code of conduct comes into effect. In its first comprehensive audit report, which looked into the functioning of the Noida Authority over a 13-year period from 2005-2018 and was tabled in the state assembly on December 17, the CAG pointed out that allowing third party rights on a plot allotted to a realtor to let in another had led to ballooning of dues because of the legal complications it had created, besides diluting the commitment of builders to deliver houses on time. Long delays in delivery timelines and thousands of crores in real estate dues are the two bugbears of Noida’s real estate industry. The national auditor found large-scale irregularities in land acquisition, allotments and approvals in Noida, which it said was due to connivance between realtors and officials. “Audit found significant lapses in the policies adopted by Noida in the area of planning, acquisition of land, pricing of properties and allotment of properties under various categories. Failures were observed at the level of Noida Board, its management and officials,” the CAG report said. Besides doing away with sub-leasing of group housing land, the Noida Authority board is expected to incorporate other suggestions of the CAG in its agenda for the next board meeting to streamline its functioning and strengthen revenue generation. Among these is standardisation of the procedure of allotment of industrial plots by fixing parameters. “The allotment committee will have to go by a standard format in upcoming schemes and everything will be done in a transparent manner to promote industrial development. Unnecessary hurdles will be removed,” a senior officer in the state industries department said. Setting up a mechanism to prepare an audit report every year, discussions on the annual budget for the next fiscal, and a process to fix responsibility of officials responsible for doling out favours to allottees will also be taken up at the board meeting. Officials in the Noida Authority’s group housing section said the Sports City logjam will be discussed with the top authorities. “But at present, we do not have any announcement to make on the issue. Without directions from the state government, it is going to be difficult to sort out the complexities,” the officer added. The CAG was particularly critical of the Sports City initiative, where sub-division of plots led to four large land parcels originally allotted for the initiative to four consortiums being splintered into 81 smaller plots, which threw the scheme into disarray. Noida had sanctioned 46,000 flats in the sports cities – planned primarily in sectors 79 and 150 with some land parcels in sectors 78 and 152 – of which only around 8,000-10,000 have been completed. But the logjam over dues and licence conditions means registries are stuck. Among other important points on the agenda of the next board meeting are a budget for the second stage of the Noida International Airport and a proposal to amend the government order for developing Noida’s satellite city. The state government had in January last year notified 80 villages in Bulandshahr and Dadri to be brought under the control of Noida Authority. Among these, five villages are located at a distance from the other ones while the names of 11 villages in the region do not figure in the government order. The proposal will be to incorporate these 11 villages and keep the five further away out of the satellite city plan. Sources said the board meeting is expected to take place before January 15 next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-cag-censure-sub-leasing-of-group-housing-plots-to-stop/articleshow/88601897.cms||---
---||Noida||Man comes back after three years to see his pet dogs, thrashed by kennel owner in Noida||GREATER NOIDA: Two brothers running a kennel have been arrested for allegedly beating up a 36-year-old man who had come to enquire about his two Doberman dogs whom he had left with them in 2018. Punit Kailash, a resident of Beta 2 area, had left his two dogs with Nazim and Nadim Ali three years ago because there was no one at home to take care of the pets when he went for work at night. Anil Kumar, the SHO of Beta 2 police station, said Punit paid the two brothers Rs 5,000 for keeping the two dogs in their kennel for a month. But after that, Nazim and Nadim allegedly changed their phone numbers and also shifted to another locality. Punit said in his complaint that he tried to contact the two brothers several times and also visited the address where they had set up the kennel, but to no avail. “He recently came to know that the brothers now run a kennel in Gamma 2 area of Greater Noida. So, he visited them and sought to meet his two dogs. But, Nazim told him that there were no such dogs in his kennel. This led to an argument, and Punit was beaten up by Nazim and his family members,” the SHO said. Punit was learnt to have received five stitches on the head and suffered some injuries near the left eye too. “We have registered a case under sections 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC against Nazim, his brother Nadim, and their sister and mother,” Kumar said. On Thursday, the two brothers were arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The police are trying to find out the whereabouts of the two Dobermans that Punit had left at the kennel three years ago. “A worker at the kennel told us that Punit had come along with a few others and started creating a ruckus. After he had handed over the two dogs in 2018, he never enquired about them, the worker told us,” the police officer said. Dogs at the kennel, the worker told the police, are often given up for adoption if their owners don’t turn up after a certain time. “According to the worker, Nazim’s family members had come to rescue him from Punit and the other men. His allegations, too, are being investigated,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-comes-back-after-three-years-to-see-his-pet-dogs-thrashed-by-kennel-owner/articleshow/88601898.cms||Advitya Bahl

---||Ghaziabad||How Covid-ready Noida is after second wave||NOIDA/GHAZIABAD: The health departments of the Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts, taking lessons from the deady second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, have increased the number of oxygen generation plants, hospital beds for use by Covid patients if cases increase, and paediatric beds for children who, doctors predict, may be affected more this time. OxygenDuring the peak of the second wave in April-May, the oxygen demand in GB Nagar was 125 tonnes per day, which the district tried to meet with liquid medical oxygen. In Ghaziabad, the requirement was nearly 80 tonnes. However, only 55-60 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen was available on many days. Hospitals had to face an acute shortage of oxygen, and the government had faced criticism for not planning ahead of the situation. GB Nagar, at that time, had a single PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plant in the entire district, while Ghaziabad had none. The health departments had to use oxygen cylinders to meet the oxygen demand of the Covid patients. Now, GB Nagar has 17 PSA oxygen plants while Ghaziabad has 18. A few hospitals even have more than one oxygen plant. For instance, Noida Covid Hospital has one plant with an oxygen-producing capacity of 500 LPM (litres per minute) and two plants with 1,000 LPM capacity. Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI) in Sector 30, better known as Child PGI, has two plants with an oxygen-producing capacity of 250 LPM and 1000 LPM, respectively. The Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) hospital has four plants, with three having 150, 500 and 1000 LPM capacities. In Ghaziabad, MMG District Hospital and District Combined Hospital (DCH) have four plants, two in each. Of the two plants at DCH, one was defunct and got repaired in preparation for a possible third wave. Additionally, both districts have ordered private hospitals, having over 50 beds, to install oxygen plants on their premises. So far, six private hospitals in GB Nagar and seven in Ghaziabad have followed the order. Hospital bedsBefore the second wave, just four hospitals, having 758 beds, handled Covid cases in GB Nagar. Now, 31 hospitals, having 4,500 beds, are prepared to tackle these cases. In Ghaziabad, there were 13 hospitals with 1,438 beds among them, and now, there are 61 hospitals with nearly 3,500 beds. In the past nine months, the number of hospital beds has increased nearly six times in GB Nagar and two-and-a-half times in Ghaziabad. A limited number of Covid hospitals are functioning at present, but the number of beds, according to the health departments, could go up substantially within a couple of hours. A senior health official in GB Nagar said, “We have done drills to gauge the emergency response, and we are confident of activating the Covid hospitals on short notice.” Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said, “A detailed contingency plan is in place, including when and how many private hospitals would get converted into Covid hospitals. We have identified more hospitals for treating patients and are ready with all the preparations to deal with the cases.” Paediatric bedsDuring the second wave, Ghaziabad did not have pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds for children with Covid because most did not require hospitalisation. GB Nagar had only 50 such beds in their hospitals. However, health experts have predicted that more children may get affected in a possible third wave. So, the number of PICU beds has increased to 440 in GB Nagar. In Ghaziabad, nearly 760 PICU beds are ready in private and government hospitals. However, the shortage of paediatricians is still an issue. A lone paediatrician appointed under the chief medical officer is in charge of all children-related Covid cases in GB Nagar. There are just two paediatricians at DCH, Ghaziabad, for its 20-bed paediatric ward. Staff from other hospitals have undergone training to tackle the situation if the number of children affected by Covid increases exponentially, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/how-covid-ready-noida-is-after-second-wave/articleshow/88604480.cms||Aditya Dev

In a bid to reduce pollution in the river, the waste water will be treated before it is discharged back into the drain.Presently, the Noida Authority has six operational sewerage treatment plants in the city which are enough to treat 231 million litres of waste water on a daily basis. Authority officials say that the daily generation of waste water in the city is 215 million litres.To deal with the future needs, the authority is going to set up two more STPs in the city with a budget of about Rs 260 crore. Chief general manager of the authority, Rajiv Tyagi, said that the trial of the STPs will commence from March next year. While the STPs will augment the treatment capacity of the authority, a permanent solution was needed to deal with the downstream joining the Kondli drain. The authority has identified and divided 30 drains as per their width into major, medium and minor categories with the help of a consultant.Professor CR Babu, from the department of environment in the Delhi University, will be helping the authority in speeding up remedial action plan to tackle the 30 drains."For major and medium drains, biomediation method has been suggested as a long-term solution to the authority. It is cost effective and can be done through in-situ development of wetland and plantation," Babu said.The authority has hired WAPCOS and EIL to prepare the detailed design, estimates and financial outlay which can be executed in a time-bound manner for handling the waste water that is discharged through the 30 drains.The authority has set a deadline of June 2023 to implement the measures. National Green Tribunal has directed the authority to prepare a comprehensive action plan to deal with discharge of waste water into the downstream of the Yamuna river and treat it as per the norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/with-two-more-stps-noida-plans-to-treat-sewage-from-30-drains-before-they-flow-into-the-yamuna/articleshow/88601901.cms||---
---||Noida||’22 to open doors for e-auction of builders’ attached properties||Noida: Come 2022, the district administration will start afresh its drive against developers who have not paid their dues despite receiving recovery certificates.However, it will for the first time dispose of the assets of defaulters through online auction. All this while, recovery certificates issued by the three development authorities — Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway — and UP-RERA were proving to be difficult to execute. The administration has now asked the three authorities to share a list of defaulters along with the properties they own.Traditionally, the collector of a district had powers to attach movable and immovable properties under provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code, 2006. However, the process to realise the amount was extremely complicated and tedious.The local sub-divisional magistrate had to announce the execution of recovery certificates to begin the proceedings. The procedure also involved issuing or pasting notices at the registered addresses of the defaulters and asking them to pay up the amount or appear before the authorities within a certain timeframe. If the defaulters breached the deadline, SDMs had the authority to recommend their arrest for non-payment. Bank accounts, lockers and other assets owned by them were attached if nobody showed up or were arrested. The attached assets were then sold to recover the amount.But over the years, the number of defaulters has been increasing, not so much the recovery. As of now, the Noida administration has to recover more than Rs 400 crore from the top 30 defaulters — all of them builders. The present rate of recovery is under 15%.“A majority of the defaulters are not available at their registered address. Land was allotted to them more than a decade ago and their whereabouts are not known now. Also, we can initiate recovery proceedings only against the names mentioned in the official correspondence provided by UP-RERA or the other authorities. The third issue is finding a buyer who is willing to pay a reasonable price for the land or other properties that have been attached. The real estate sector is down at the moment and local players are not showing interest in taking up big land parcels at the moment,” district magistrate Suhas LY said. Officials said e-auction of the assets could yield higher productivity as players from different parts of the country would be able to participate in the bids. “Plus, a developer from Mumbai, Bengaluru or Chennai interested in foraying into NCR will have a sense of security as he will buy land from the government,” said an official at the Surajpur collectorate. The e-auction route was mooted by UP-RERA in September 2019 in order to improve the recovery rate. The then district magistrate, BN Singh, had forwarded a detailed note to the government in January 2020, stressing upon the need to implement the online auctioning process. On December 15, the UP cabinet took a decision to introduce the fourth amendment in the existing Revenue Code to allow e-auction of immovable properties of the defaulter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/22-to-open-doors-for-e-auction-of-builders-attached-properties/articleshow/88601902.cms||---
---||Noida||Low interest, bigger space: What drove Noida, Greater Noida homebuyers this year||GREATER NOIDA: Contrary to expectations, the year 2021 has been relatively better for real estate players in Noida and Greater Noida. Weeks after emerging from the second wave, potential buyers were back house-hunting, studies by real estate researchers PropTiger and Liases Foras have shown. According to PropTiger, more than 2,700 flats in Noida and 2,800 in Greater Noida were sold between January and September this year. Liases Foras showed a similar trend. Developers in Noida and Greater Noida sold around 4,600 and 5,700 units, respectively, till this November. Developers said low interest rates for home loans and the need for a bigger space because of work-from-home schedules led to this surge in sales. According to another real estate research and consultancy firm, around 1.3 lakh residential units were added across the top seven cities in the country, including Delhi-NCR, while sales were clocked at 1.4 lakh units last year. But 2021 witnessed an upswing. Between January and September this year, 1.6 lakh units were added in these cities and 1.4 lakh of them were sold. There is, however, some anxiety among buyers about the logjam over registry. This has prompted buyers to invest mostly in projects that are partly occupied and in the secondary market. Developers claimed that the registry impasse was a temporary bottleneck that would soon be over. A petition by a group of developers against a Noida Authority order is being heard in the Supreme Court. Amit Modi, president (elect) at Credai (western UP) and director of ABA Corp, said, “Hurdles such as delay in execution of registries should not change the mindset of a buyer who has already chosen Noida as the preferred location. Location is the prime factor for all home-hunters now. And Noida is a highly urbanised city with seamless infrastructural developments.” RK Arora, president of UP Naredco and chairperson of Supertech Limited, expressed similar views. “No other city in NCR offers this kind of connectivity along with so much green cover. Non-registry of flats is an issue for all of us. But the matter should be resolved once the Supreme Court delivers its verdict,” said Arora, who is among the four developers from the city who filed the contempt petition in court in the registry issue. Builders said they focused on delivering flats this year rather than launching new ones. “Giving possession to homebuyers was our priority in 2021. The low interest rate has been an added advantage. It has encouraged fence-sitters to explore the Noida market more,” said Harvinder Singh Sikka, the managing director of Sikka Group. Some buyers said the builders should do more than just talks to instill more confidence among them. “I want to ask the builders’ bodies what action they take when they receive any complaint against their members. I have got no response from them,” said Din Bandhu Nayak, a buyer whose project is stuck. Similarly, Ranjan Samantay of Antriksh Golf View 2 in Sector 78, said, “Some builders are not executing the tripartite agreement and registry despite having the permission to do so.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After discount to builders, BMC reaps Rs 11,000 crore windfall on premiums||MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has received a record sum of over Rs 11,000 crore so far this year from Mumbai’s builders rushing to avail of the 50% discount on premiums offered from January 2021. Civic sources said the final kitty may cross Rs 12,000 crore when the one-year discount window shuts on Friday evening. Early this year, the BMC halved the hefty premiums developers pay to it and the state government for additional construction rights. Over the past decade, the civic administration collected Rs 3,500-4,000 crore each year by way of premiums and other charges from builders. But the 2020 Covid lockdown hit the BMC’s finances badly after the real estate industry took a terrible knock; the civic administration could manage barely Rs 2,500 crore between April 2020 and March 2021. In 2019-2020, the collection was roughly Rs 3,800 crore. But by slashing the premium this year, the BMC earned a massive financial bonanza. Biggest rush for BMC discount among bldrsMunicipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said the total collection could touch Rs 15,000 crore by March 2022. "When I first mooted this proposal, senior colleagues in Mantralaya opposed it, saying the concession would further financially cripple the BMC because of the Covid lockdown," Chahal told TOI on Thursday. "Around 600 construction projects in Mumbai, both redevelopment and greenfield, had become unviable because of the high premiums. One of them was the Godrej Properties project in Wadala (Adarsh Nagar) where the premium was Rs 500 crore and the developer said it was unviable. But with the 50% concession, the premium dropped to Rs 250 crore and the project has now become viable," he said. The biggest rush to take advantage of these concessions were builders from the western suburbs (between Dahisar and Bandra), who paid around Rs 6,500 crore to the corporation between January and December 2021. Most of these are for society redevelopment projects where the market in the western suburbs has suddenly picked up due to the dilution of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms, which restricted construction activity near the coastline. In comparison, builders from the city's eastern suburbs (Mulund to Kurla) have paid roughly Rs 2,500 crore during this period. Developers from the island city (Colaba-Mahim-Sion) are believed to have paid another Rs 3,000 crore. "These concessions have given a huge boost to the real estate industry. Redevelopment proposals became viable, but the government should extend the date for concessions by at least another three months," said architect Manoj Daisaria. "The 50% concession provided an 8-10% reduction in the cost of development of the projects, which helped attain economic viability. Many old projects which were stuck, became economically viable. Improved sales in residential real estate are also another reason to boost the developers' sentiments and confidence," said Pankaj Kapoor of real estate research firm Liases Foras. Said Gulam Zia, executive director of Knight Frank India: "The state government first gave a big reprieve to the real estate industry last year by declaring a sizable stamp duty cut. This resulted in an all-time high of sales transactions in Mumbai; over 1,11,000 apartments sold and registered in calendar year 2021 in Greater Mumbai jurisdiction alone. The revival of sales prompted the state to extend the sops to the supply side by way of discounts in premiums to be paid by a developer for fungible and sales premium FSI." Said Zia, "The revival in sales encouraged developers to buy these FSIs in advance and pay the premium to take advantage of the discounts offered by the government. The government also collected huge revenue while giving a new lease of life to the industry desperately looking out for a helping hand."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-discount-to-bldrs-bmc-reaps-11000cr-windfall-on-premiums/articleshow/88601905.cms||Nauzer K Bharucha

The HC directed the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) to file its reply after the petitioners said the exam contained ambiguous questions. The matter has been posted to January 7.The petitioners, Sagar Bornare and six others, several working at present in the BMC, had filed the petition through advocate Savita Suryanshi, saying that the multiple-choice question (MCQ) paper had ambiguous and poorly worded questions and was full of “manifest errors’’. The candidates said they wasted precious time re-reading the questions. There were negative marks for incorrect answers.When the answer key was published on November 3, petitioners and other aspirants submitted their objections to the question paper and on December 17, the MPSC they said came up with a second answer key and announced “an arbitrary deletion of five questions’’ for 10 marks, hence they approached the HC.Advocate Abhay Patki, appearing for MPSC, submitted that the commission had followed proper procedure while publishing model answers after considering all objections, tand is now in the process of finalising the merit list of successful candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mpsc-exam-paper-full-of-errors-say-petitioners-to-hc/articleshow/88601906.cms||---

According to police, Abdul Kalam alias Munna Shah (38) killed his wife reportedly for pestering him to divorce her. Kalam, who is a regular viewer of TV serials on crime, had taken necessary precautions to escape arrest. The first thing he did was to destroy his mobile handset and SIM card.DCP (Zone X) Maheshwar Reddy said the case was solved purely on human intelligence. Kalam changed at least 15 locations in UP before he was finally located in Barabanki district on December 28. “Kalam, who works as a helper, suspected his wife of having an affair as she had been staying separately for the last six months,” said a police officer. The incident occurred at around 9.45 am when the victim was heading to her workplace – a garment factory.

---||Mumbai||EOW: Rs 5,000 crore cheating cases filed by Cox & Kings promoter ‘false’||MUMBAI: The economic offences wing (EOW), probing two cheating complaints filed by the promoter of now-insolvent travel firm Cox & Kings (India) Ltd, Ajay Ajit Peter Kerkar, involving a total Rs 5,564 crore, has closed the cases and filed ‘B Summary’ reports before the court stating that the two cases are ‘false’. Kerkar is in Arthur Road jail in connection with 10 cheating cases lodged against him, Cox & Kings former chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and others by different private banks and an investment firm. Niket Kaushik, additional director-general and joint commissioner of police (EOW), said, “We have filed B Summary reports in the two cases. The cases were registered at Nagpada police station in 2020 and the probe was transferred to EOW. During the probe, we found that the allegations in the FIRs filed by Kerkar were false. After probing the evidence, we have submitted our report to the court that these are false cases,” said Kaushik. The police have filed ‘B Summary with prosecution’ reports. Advocate Dharmesh Joshi from T D Joshi and Associates, representing Kerkar, said: “Complete copy of closure report is not served upon Kerkar. After going through it, protest petitions and further proceedings will be filed.” Last year, Kerkar had complained to Mazgaon metropolitan magistrate alleging that a few staffers from his firm and banks had conspired and diverted funds without his knowledge. The court took cognizance of the complaint and instructed Nagpada police to file cases. Two FIRs, under various IPC sections including cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy, were registered on July 27, 2020. The probe was transferred to EOW. Those named in the first FIR were a few office-bearers of Cox & Kings, and a private bank’s managing director, manager and other employees. In the second FIR, the joint director of a private bank, its manager and others were named as accused. Investigating officer senior inspector Pradeep Warang said, “Kerkar’s two FIRs were based on the reports of two auditors who conducted forensic audits for his two companies. He gave limited information to the auditors. Auditors said they had sought more reports and hence, their report was inconclusive. Besides that, Kerkar was aware about all the transactions and had signed on several documents too.” The EOW, in its final reports, said, “The investigation reveals that the allegations levelled...by Kerkar are false and frivolous...with an intention to safeguard himself from the onus of criminality arising out of 10 cases against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/eow-5k-cr-cheating-cases-filed-by-cox-kings-promoter-false/articleshow/88601911.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Admissions to ICU remain stable despite surge in cases||MUMBAI: Even as the state’s Covid-19 curve has witnessed a steep rise in the past ten days days, admissions to the ICU have not shown a proportional rise yet. State health department data showed that active cases jumped from 7,068 on December 19 to 11,492 on December 29, a 63% increase. The share of critical cases, however, has remained steady during this period. While on December 19, 1,305 people were critical, it marginally rose to 1,450 on December 29, an 11% rise.  ICU admissions, too, in the same period have remained more or less consistent. State data showed that the proportion of patients in Covid ICUs has, in fact, dropped from 8.7% on December 19 to 5.6% on December 29. In absolute numbers though, the average number of people in ICUs are in the range of 500-600 and that has not seen a major shift. Currently, about 5.6% of the active cases are in ICUs and around 2% are on ventilators.  A state official said that oxygen consumption, too, has not increased. “However, the next three weeks are extremely crucial, since the cases are doubling at a very rapid pace,” he said. He added that while Mumbai built massive infrastructure to tackle a surge in Covid cases, any rapid rise in hospitalisations elsewhere could put a strain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/admissions-to-icu-remain-stable-despite-surge-in-cases/articleshow/88601914.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Row over dog feeding: HC appoints amicus curiae||MUMBAIi: In a fight between residents and management of an upscale residential complex over feeding of stray dogs on the premises, the Bombay high court vacation bench on Wednesday appointed an amicus curiae (friend of the court) observing that the matter “needs to be resolved amicably’’. Few residents of the NRI complex at Navi Mumbai had petitioned the vacation bench to challenge a notice for a fine of Rs 5,000 against them. The Seawoods Estate Ltd (SEL) said it designated three feeding spots outside the complex but the dogs were being fed all over causing concern over the safety of residents and cleanliness. Justices SJ Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav, said, “The bitterness between the parties appears to be very intense, in view of one group of members wanting to feed the dogs inside the complex and the other group making a grievance that the same would create a nuisance for the 5,000 residents residing in the complex.’’ Advocate Anjani Kumar Singh, counsel for the petitioners, said dogs are territorial by nature and questioned the legality of the society’s circular to impose an “exorbitant and illegal’’ fine which had now mounted up to lakhs of rupees. He also sought orders to the civic body to identify seven feeding stations for seven groups of dogs in their territory on the boundary of about 50 acres of SEL. SEL counsel Aditya Pratap said it has three dedicated feeding areas outside the complex gates, with kennels in an enclosure, complying with a Delhi high court order of having such spots in the scheduled area. The SEL counsel said residents were bitten and a fine was imposed only on those feeding dogs outside the designated areas on grounds of “littering on the premises’’. The bench appointed advocate Nausher Kohli as amicus curiae to assist in resolving the dispute and adjourned the matter to January 3, 2022. Till then, no coercive steps against the residents, directed the high court. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) must take charge of two ailing dogs in the complex and immediately treat them, it said,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/row-over-dog-feeding-hc-appoints-amicus-curiae/articleshow/88601918.cms||Swati Deshpande

Monthly statistics released on Thursday shows 14,812 unmasked commuters were caught on WR suburban sections from April to December this year, and Rs 21 lakh was collected as fine. On CR Main and Harbour suburban sections, as many as 2,735 commuters were caught in the same period and fines of Rs 5.3 lakh were recovered.  In December alone, over a thousand commuters were fined colle ctively on both WR and CR for not wearing masks. “There are strict instructions from the general manager office that commuters on suburban sections and also on long distance trains should observe Covid appropriate behaviour. We have caught an average of 300 passengers daily in the past few days for flouting Covid rules at stations along Central Railway (suburban lines and across state). The drive is being intensified from Thursday,” said CR chief spokesperson Shivaji Sutar. There have been more cases and fines recovered on the WR suburban section in the past nine months. “We have allowed the civic marshals to enter the station premises and catch offenders. They keep vigil at the entry/exit points, the booking office area and on platforms and FOBs,” said a WR spokesperson.

---||Mumbai||SBI robbers studied heist videos: Police||MUMBAI: A tracker dog and information from a 10-year-old girl helped the police solve the robbery at Dahisar's State Bank of India within 12 hours of the crime on Thursday. A contractual staffer, Sandesh Gomane, had been shot dead. Investigators arrested cousins Dharmendra Yadav, 21, and Vikas Yadav, 19, who had been preparing for the heist for months by studying internet videos. A major portion of the stolen money has been recovered. The accused have told the police that they intended to scare bank employees by firing, but had not planned on killing anyone. At 3.26 pm on Wednesday, the two men had walked into the unguarded SBI branch at Gurukul society, less than a kilometre from Dahisar station. As Gomane stood up, one of the men shot at him in the chest. Gomane slumped in a chair as the men went about threatening other employees-- most of them women-- and looted Rs 2.50 lakh from the cashier's desk. The entire heist occurred in just two minutes and the robbers fled in foot. From the surveillance footage, investigators gathered the robbers were likely to be amateurs. Eventually, a 10-year-old girl told one of the investigators that she had seen a man rushing home to change. "We broke down the door to find Dharmendra asleep. He was taken into custody, from his YT Road residence," said sub-inspector Deepak Hinde. He led the cops to Vikas in Rawalpada, also in Dahisar. It turned out that Dharmendra's father had run up debts of Rs 4.5 lakh and needed money to pay off the dues. He was not, however, aware of his son's plans, police say. "Dharmendra has studied till class XII and works as a caterer. Vikas moved to Mumbai from their hometown in UP's Bhadohi earlier this year," said an officer. Over several months, the two cousins made preparations to loot a bank. They checked You Tube videos and bought masks and gloves. About four months ago, they got a pistol from Bihar to their hometown in UP where they practiced using the weapon. Dharmendra emptied his savings to pay Rs 40000 for the pistol. They then brought it to Mumbai. The men studied several banks located in Dahisar, looking for an easy target. Earlier this week, they settled on the SBI branch due to its proximity to an FOB and railway station, absence of a security guard and how close it was from their home. "After the robbery, the duo ran all the way home in seven minutes. They planned to leave the city the next day but were caught before they could do so," said an officer. The accused do not have a previous criminal history. Police have recovered a sum of Rs 2.05 lakh so far. "We want to appeal to banks to appoint security guards irrespective of the size of the branch. Had the SBI branch at Dahisar appointed a guard, the robbery could have been averted," said Padwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sbi-robbers-studied-heist-videos-police/articleshow/88601922.cms||Nitasha Natu

Not more than 20 people will be allowed to attend funerals. The new rules came into force from Thursday midnight. Earlier, the government had allowed a maximum of 100 people at weddings in closed spaces, and the limit was 250 for open-to-air spaces or 25% of capacity, whichever was less. The same limit was set for other events. “There were at least four big weddings of children of top politicians in the state in the last one week, and most had a large number of people attending. Many leaders who have tested positive had attended these weddings. It was unanimously decided that crowds at weddings have to be brought down,” said a senior official. The state has also empowered local bodies to impose additional restrictions in public places which attract crowds like beaches, tourist spots and open spaces, in additional to imposing Section 144. It is likely most cities will ban gatherings of any kind in these spaces. Officials said civic bodies and police have been asked to ensure strict implementation of rules. With the Covid-19 numbers galloping, CM Uddhav Thackeray chaired a meeting with the state task force, and it was decided to impose restrictions. Senior officials said the health department had proposed more curbs like reducing operating hours of restaurants, malls and theatres, but many task force members felt that since oxygen requirement and hospital beds are still lying vacant, there may not be a need to press the panic button so soon. Meanwhile, the state on Thursday decided it will place bulk orders for the new oral antiviral molnupiravir which has been cleared for treatment by Drugs Controller General of India. “We will be purchasing the drug and a system of distribution will be followed to ensure there is no shortage like in the case of remdesivir,” said health minister Rajesh Tope. The state has also decided to put to use the S Gene drop out kits in a big way for the next 15-20 days. These kits will ensure early detection of Omicron cases. “It has also been decided to bring a price cap on these kits,” said an official. Meanwhile, a day after Tope said the state was planning to vaccinate those 15-18 in schools and colleges, he did a u-turn and said children in batches will be taken to the nearest vaccination centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fresh-curbs-attendance-at-weddings-capped-at-50/articleshow/88601925.cms||---

The 18-page petition was filed by Amir’s father Mohd Latief. The move came two days after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Jammu & Kashmir Police probing the Hyderpora encounter claimed that while one civilian was killed by a foreign terrorist, two others, including a local “militant”, died in crossfire after being used as human shield by the hiding terrorist. A Pakistani terrorist and three others were killed in Hyderpora on November 15 and the police claimed that all the slain men had links to militancy. The families of the three, alleging foul play, had claimed that they were innocent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hyderpora-encounter-dad-moves-jammu-and-kashmir-hc-for-body/articleshow/88601928.cms||---

Some have cancelled physical services and opted to stream online. Others have scattered parishioners across different venues, and changed timings in order to complete before night curfew begins at 9pm. Large parishes like Salvation Church, Dadar, and Our Lady of Lourdes, Orlem, Malad, have cancelled physical mass. OL Lourdes has a strength of 20,000 Catholics, and despite the best efforts of parish priest Fr Michael Pinto, vast throngs of people arrived to attend midnight mass on Christmas Eve. He said, “We had three masses, still the numbers became difficult to control. So we made a voluntary decision to cancel physical mass and instead stream online. We will only have thanksgiving service, which is attended by not more than 100 people.” Our Lady of Salvation Church (Portuguese Church), Dadar, with a strength of 6,000, has also called off midnight mass. Parish priest Fr Calistus Fernandes said, “We do not want to defy the state guidelines. Omicron is a real threat. But I wish the Christmas rules were allowed to continue. We were allowed to have 50% of our indoor capacity. Our church has a capacity of 1,500, so we had around 500 people seated far apart. But now we are permitted only 100 people. So it is better to stream online.” Fr Dennis Gonsalves, parish priest of Gloria Church, Byculla, will not host mass inside the church but at three convents nearby. “Bigger churches find it easier to host mass in separate venues since they run educational institutions nearby. However, smaller churches may not have that option. Their parishioners may come to us, adding to our rush. The changing rules also tend to cause confusion." Fr Ashwin Castellino of St Michael’s Church, Mahim, said their team of priests will fan out in four different locations to conduct mass at 7.30pm. St Anne’s Church, Pali Hill, Bandra, will start mass at 7pm and end by 8:30pm, said parish priest Fr John Lobo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/churches-tone-down-nye-mass-amid-curbs/articleshow/88601929.cms||---

Of the 40 cases detected in December on the campus, 24 were reported in just the last 10 days. About half of these 24 are students. In fact, eight campus residents, including five students, tested positive on Thursday. The institute had seen a decline in cases post mid-October. Currently, over 7,000 students are on the campus. While the institute was planning to move to hybrid teaching in the new semester starting January 3, the administration will conduct online lectures in the coming week. “We have asked all faculty members to conduct lectures online at least for a week in view of the rising cases. A decision will be taken soon for the semester. We will follow the state government’s directive,” said an official. The institute recently reported a small cluster of cases in hostel 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/40-new-cases-in-dec-on-iit-b-campus-24-in-just-10-days/articleshow/88601930.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Man who tested positive for Omicron dies of heart attack||MUMBAI: Maharashtra confirmed the presence of Omicron in a 52-year-old man who recently died of heart attack in Pimpri-Chinchwad, but stopped short of calling him the first casualty of the variant and attributed the death to his underlying health conditions. On Thursday, Mumbai’s latest genomic surveillance established widespread Omicron transmission within the community as the variant was found in nearly 37% samples. Maharashtra reported 198 Omicron cases, its highest single day jump so far, taking the total count of the variant in the state to 450. The man from Pimpri-Chinchwad had died on December 28 at Yashwantrao Chavan Hospital. State health authorities refrained from labelling it as the first Omicron death despite the man having a travel history to Nigeria and a Covid-positive diagnosis. They said he had diabetes for the past 13 years. “The death is due to non-Covid reasons. Coincidentally, the National Institute of Virology report revealed that he was infected with the Omicron variant,” the authorities said. Health experts in Mumbai said since the man had tested Covid-positive, the death is likely going to be classified as Covid fatality. “What is important here is to see how much of a role the variant played in causing the death,” said Dr Avinash Supe, a member of the Covid death audit panel. While India has reported almost 1,200 Omicron cases, no deaths were reported until now. Mumbai got the first evide-nce that Omicron is gaining dominance as the latest sequencing report found the variant in 37.6% samples. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said of the 375 samples sequenced from the community, 141 (37.6%) were found Omicron positive. “It is an indicator that Omicron is rising in the community since the samples belong to people who don’t have a travel history,” he said. In the last round of genome sequencing, Omicron was detected in 2% samples. Of the 141 cases, the highest (21) were detected from K-West ward—Andheri (W), Vile Parle (W) and Juhu. Eleven cases were reported from D ward (Tardeo, Girgaum, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill), and 10 each from F-North (Matunga, Sion) and H-West (Bandra, Khar and Santacruz west) wards. Importantly, cases were reported from 22 of the city’s 24 wards. Of the infected, 93 are fully vaccinated and three have tak-en one dose. Seven are moderately symptomatic, 39 are mildly symptomatic and 95 are asymptomatic. “Only seven patients are hospitalized, but they don’t have severe symptoms,” a civic official said. Across the state, up to 46% of 450 confirmed Omicron cases don’t have any international travel history. Of the 198 cases confirmed on Thursday, 30 had travelled internationally. Three residents from Kalyan-Dombivli at Mantralaya—a clerk and two police personnel—were found Omicron positive during a weekly testing drive at the state secretariat.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19 in Maharashtra: More healthcare workers start to test positive; govt to revisit quarantine norms||MUMBAI: Healthcare workers across hospitals have started to test positive for coronavirus as cases rise in the city. The state’s public health department, meanwhile, is planning to revisit quarantine and isolation norms for health staffers given that most are fully vaccinated and tend to have mild symptoms.  Parel’s KEM Hospital reported 18 positive cases of Covid-19 among health staffers, including interns, MBBS students and resident doctors this week. It started with two cases on Sunday, that rose to seven on Monday and nine on Tuesday. All the infected are fully vaccinated and have mild to no symptoms. “We are seeing this steady rise in infections among healthcare workers after several months,” Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said. At Bombay Hospital, seven doctors have tested positive this week. All are asymptomatic and none with any travel history, said Dr Gautam Bhansali, adding that they haven’t seen infections in staffers for nearly three to four months. Similarly, three doctors tested positive for Covid at Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital on Wednesday. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of the hospital, said all cases are breakthrough infections. None of them have required hospitalisation but they have been isolated.  Wockhardt Hospital, Mumbai Central, detected four positive cases among its staffers in the past five days. CEO Dr Parag Rindani said, “We do routine temperature checks for health workers, and anyone with the slightest symptoms is tested immediately”. Health workers, particularly resident doctors, falling sick in big numbers is doubly worrying for medical colleges that are already functioning with one-third of the strength, said Dr Deshmukh. With the counselling round yet to start for PG candidates, colleges are short of an entire batch. “If cases rise, working with 200-250 fewer doctors will be a challenge,” he said. State health authorities, meanwhile, will be revisiting the quarantine and isolation period for medical staffers. Dr Satish Pawar, additional director, National Health Mission, said that unlike the previous two waves, most health workers are vaccinated now and appear to have milder symptoms. “In that case, what should be the isolation period for the asymptomatic is a question,” he said. The US recently shortened isolation time for healthcare workers, saying they could return to work after seven days if they are asymptomatic and test negative. The isolation period in state currently ranges between 10-14 days and differs between districts and even institutions. In Mumbai’s medical colleges, anyone testing positive is supposed to be taken off roster for two weeks. “However, during the second wave, doctors were sometimes called back to Covid wards in 5-7 days,” said a resident doctor from Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/more-healthcare-workers-start-to-test-ve-govt-to-revisit-quarantine-norms/articleshow/88601932.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra resident doctors join stir, but will work in Covid wards||MUMBAI: From Friday, resident doctors from across the state will be withdrawing from all non-Covid routine duties, including emergency services, to join the nationwide protest against the delay in conduct of postgraduate medical admissions. The move is likely to hit healthcare services. Over 1,000 resident doctors from KEM and Sion hospitals already joined the protest from 5pm, Thursday. They will, however, continue to work in Covid wards. Hospitals across the country are working with only two-third of the total strength of resident doctors for eight months. With the surge in Covid cases, the doctors are demanding restoration of the counselling process at the earliest. The Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD), which called for the strike, condemned the police brutality against the protesting doctors in Delhi. Dr Sachin Pattiwar, president of MARD-KEM, said senior doctors are replacing them in emergency services. “No surgeries have been called off, but resident doctors have stopped participating in routine duties. More doctors will join from Friday,” he said. Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of major hospitals, said they have started discussions with resident doctors. “We can do little about their main demand as the matter is sub judice.” He said OPD services may be hit though senior doctors will be attending to patients. “Elective surgeries will have to be postponed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-resident-docs-join-stir-but-will-work-in-covid-wards/articleshow/88601933.cms||---

It pointed out that Mumbai (city and suburban), Thane, Pune and Nagpur are seeing a surge, which calls for intensified testing, contact tracing, setting up of containment zones and rapid hospital preparedness. Mumbai and Nagpur have registered 233% and 204% jump in active cases in the past week.  The letter from union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan underlined that testing should be enhanced in these districts with a steady balance between RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests. Addressed to Dr Pradeep Vyas, state’s additional health secretary, the letter also stated that contacts must be traced proactively. Bhushan also asked the state to increase the pace of vaccination. As on December 29, the first dose vaccination was at 87.4% and second dose 57.7% with 22 districts remaining below state average. –Sumitra DebRoy and Nisha Nambiar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-red-flags-5-maha-districts/articleshow/88601936.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Musheer’s omission from Mumbai squad questioned||Mumbai: Mumbai Cricket Association treasurer Jagdish Achrekar and former MCA secretary PV Shetty have questioned Musheer Khan’s omission from the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team for the first two matches, which was announced by the selectors on Wednesday.On Thursday, the 16-year-old left-arm spinning allrounder, continuing his tremendous form, took six for 61 to bowl Mumbai to an six-wicket win over Haryana in a do-or-die game, ensuring them a place in the pre-quarterfinals of the Cooch Behar Trophy (for Under-19) at the Kandukuri Cricket Academy in Vizag. He thus finished the match with imprressive figures of 10-135 (4-74 & 6-61), besides scoring a valuable 66 in the first innings. So far, the prodigious teenager has taken 28 wickets and scored 307 runs in five matches to play a pivotal role in Mumbai Colts reaching the knockouts of the tournament.In an e-mail (TOI has a copy) to MCA president Vijay Patil on Thursday, Achrekar wrote: “While going through the Ranji squad for the first two games, I noticed that the selectors have missed on Musheer whose performance in all senior tournaments in this year has been extraordinary. The initial thought which came to my mind was that the selectors may not be willing to disturb the combination of the U-19 team by shifting Musheer to the higher level. But to my surprise, name of one of his counterparts who is currently representing along with Musheer in the Cooch Behar trophy is appearing in the Ranji squad.”Achrekar felt that the omission would hurt Musheer’s confidence. “Sir, you will agree that we have caused a dent to Musheer’s psyche by our actions. The psychologist suggested for the senior team may be able to throw some light on this. In our meetings we have healthy discussions about nurturing young talent but the actions of selectors speak otherwise,” felt the MCA treasurer has written.Musheer plays for Shetty’s club Payyade Sporting Club in local ‘A’ Division cricket. “He’s performed extremely well with both bat and ball since the past two seasons at all levels. He definitely deserved to be picked for the Mumbai Ranji team this time. Last season, he was the Man of the Tournament in two tournaments — Police Shield and Salarjang Shield, and this year, he was the Man of the Tournament in the Madhav Mantri ‘A’ Division tournament (305 runs & four wickets in three matches). He has consistently produced fine all-round performances for the Mumbai Under-19 team in the Cooch Behar Trophy. That should have been enough for his selection,” said Shetty.Justifying Musheer’s exclusion from the Mumbai Ranji team, Ankola told this paper: “Firstly, this team has only been declared for the first two matches. If some of those players whom we’ve picked don’t perform too well, we can always replace them. The only reason we didn’t pick Musheer is that we looked at the brighter side — with Shams Mulani being there, if he’s not able to play matches in the Ranji Trophy, it is better that he plays and helps Mumbai in the knockouts in the Cooch Behar Trophy.”Musheer has been playing ‘A’ Division club cricket for the last four years. “As an MCA secretary, I never interfered in selection. I don’t want to criticize the MCA, but I feel that selecting players who do well in club cricket and age group tournaments is important,” Shetty stressed. “If you don’t pick players who do well in club cricket, players will lose faith and interest in it. I run three clubs which play in the ‘A’ Division, and Payyade SC is a top team in local cricket. Cricketers these days tell me that why should they waste their time playing club cricket, since no one is watching or considering performances. With all the expenses involved, it’s difficult to run a cricket club” he rued.Even though Musheer is just 16, Shetty felt that it was the right time to “blood him” in the Mumbai Ranji team. “You need to give a youngster a chance when he’s 16 or say 19. After 20, the players don’t develop their skills,” he said.Brief Scores: Haryana 247 & 183 (Musheer Khan 6-61) lost to Mumbai 373 & 62-4 by six wickets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/musheers-omission-from-mumbai-squad-questioned/articleshow/88601937.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tracker dog, 10-year girl lead cops to SBI robbers||MUMBAI: A tracker dog and information from a 10-year-old girl helped the police solve the robbery at Dahisar's State Bank of India within 12 hours of the crime on Thursday. A contractual staffer, Sandesh Gomane, had been shot dead. Investigators arrested cousins Dharmendra Yadav, 21, and Vikas Yadav, 19, who had been preparing for the heist for months by studying internet videos. A major portion of the stolen money has been recovered. The accused have told the police that they intended to scare bank employees by firing, but had not planned on killing anyone. At 3.26 pm on Wednesday, the two men had walked into the unguarded SBI branch at Gurukul society, less than a kilometre from Dahisar station. As Gomane stood up, one of the men shot at him in the chest. Gomane slumped in a chair as the men went about threatening other employees-- most of them women-- and looted Rs 2.50 lakh from the cashier's desk. The entire heist occurred in just two minutes and the robbers fled in foot. From the surveillance footage, investigators gathered the robbers were likely to be amateurs. Eight teams of investigators were put on the case and started combed through footage from at least 30 surveillance cameras. They deduced that the men had headed for a foot overbridge connecting Dahisar West to East. In the meantime, a tracker dog, Jesse, was brought in from Mumbai Police's canine squad. "One of the robbers had left behind a slipper in the bank premises while fleeing. The dog picked up his scent and helped us narrow down the neighbourhood where he lived," said additional commissioner Pravin Padwal. "This neighbourhood-- YT Road at Dahisar East-- was teeming with people and finding out where the robbers were hiding was no easy task. We tapped our informant network and started making discreet inquiries among residents as well," said an officer. Eventually, a 10-year-old girl told one of the investigators that she had seen a man rushing home to change. "We broke down the door to find Dharmendra asleep. He was taken into custody, from his YT Road residence," said sub-inspector Deepak Hinde. He led the cops to Vikas in Rawalpada, also in Dahisar. It turned out that Dharmendra's father had run up debts of Rs 4.5 lakh and needed money to pay off the dues. He was not, however, aware of his son's plans, police say. "Dharmendra has studied till class XII and works as a caterer. Vikas moved to Mumbai from their hometown in UP's Bhadohi earlier this year," said an officer. Over several months, the two cousins made preparations to loot a bank. They checked You Tube videos and bought masks and gloves. About four months ago, they got a pistol from Bihar to their hometown in UP where they practiced using the weapon. Dharmendra emptied his savings to pay Rs 40000 for the pistol. They then brought it to Mumbai. The men studied several banks located in Dahisar, looking for an easy target. Earlier this week, they settled on the SBI branch due to its proximity to an FOB and railway station, absence of a security guard and how close it was from their home. "After the robbery, the duo ran all the way home in seven minutes. They planned to leave the city the next day but were caught before they could do so," said an officer. The accused do not have a previous criminal history. Police have recovered a sum of Rs 2.05 lakh so far. "We want to appeal to banks to appoint security guards irrespective of the size of the branch. Had the SBI branch at Dahisar appointed a guard, the robbery could have been averted," said Padwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tracker-dog-10-yr-girl-lead-cops-to-sbi-robbers/articleshow/88601938.cms||Nitasha Natu

The board also appointed a search committee comprising directors to evaluate candidates for the top position at the bank. Shares of the bank fell nearly 10% on Thursday after it informed the exchanges that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had approved the appointment of interim MD & CEO Rajeev Ahuja for only three months with effect from December 25 or until the appointment of a regular MD & CEO, whichever is earlier. Last weekend, the RBI had appointed Yogesh Dayal as an additional director on the board of the bank, a move which was immediately followed by the bank’s MD & CEO Vishwavir Ahuja proceeding on medical leave. In an investor call on Sunday, RBL Bank said that the appointment of Ahuja — part of the existing management team — as interim CEO was a measure of the RBI’s confidence in the bank. In an exchange notification, the bank said that the search committee will comprise the chairman of the nomination & remuneration committee, two members of the board and one external expert to identify and evaluate candidates for the position of MD & CEO — both from within and outside the bank. According to sources, the bank had been dragging its feet in the search process although there were only six months left for Vishwavir Ahuja to complete his term. Sources also said that the bank had not moved fast enough for the RBI, which requires a few months to complete the fit and proper appraisal of proposed candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rbl-to-hire-search-firm-to-zero-in-on-next-ceo/articleshow/88601939.cms||---
---||Mumbai||U-16 Merchant Trophy canned due to Covid-19||Mumbai: As news trickled in of Mumbai imposing Section 144 in the city and putting certain suburbs of the city under night curfew, the BCCI officials too locked themselves in a meeting to take a call on the upcoming domestic fixtures. The U-16 cricketers scheduled to play the Vijay Merchant Trophy are not vaccinated and the Board, led by secretary Jay Shah, is contemplating cancelling the tournament.There could be a postponement too, but a final call hasn’t been taken yet and the possibility of the tournament now being held look remote. “U-16 cricketers aren’t vaccinated. They can’t be put at risk. Cancellation hasn’t been considered but there’s worry about rising numbers. The immediate solution one can think of is to postpone and wait,” BCCI sources said.While it’s only the Vijay Merchant right now, the thought of Ranji Trophy beginning in the second month of January —at a time when another Covid wave is being expected— is not lost on the BCCI either. The Board will have to take a strict call on all the domestic fixtures, if they must be held and if yes then under the strictest of bio-bubbles.“The last two years, BCCI had to go slow on all domestic tournaments because of the Covid menace but if you look at the bigger picture, it worked out in the best interests of everyone, especially the players. Once again, those calls will have to be taken,” sources added.Right now, the onus remains on Vijay Merchant – a tournament that has been unnecessarily marred by conversations around age-related controversies. While the Board has its own set of plans to tackle the menace, questions are being asked if there is a more efficient way going forward. “Right now, we need to deal with Covid again. But we’ll soon decide whether the tournament can be held at all,” say officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/u-16-merchant-trophy-canned-due-to-covid-19/articleshow/88601940.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Deadline relief: Bank KYC to GST returns||Mumbai/New Delhi: Authorities have extended a raft of deadlines, citing the uncertainty triggered by the new variant of Covid. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended by three months until March 2022 its restriction on banks and finance companies freezing accounts of customers for want of KYC (know your customer) -compliant norms. The RBI said it was extending this relaxation due to the prevalent uncertainty on account of the Omicron variant.In May 2021, the RBI had informed banks and other regulated entities that, in respect of the customer accounts where periodic updation of KYC is due and pending as on date, no restrictions on operations of such account shall be imposed till December 31, 2021 for this reason alone. The exception was for an action warranted under instructions of any regulator/enforcement agency/court of law.The relaxation was granted after several customers complained that they were being forced to visit the branch amid the second wave under threat of their accounts being frozen. Banks had said that they had no choice as the law required them to periodically update records with fresh identity and address proof.The relaxation is timely as industry officials said that there was a likelihood of bunching up of action as, at any given point, there are hundreds of customers whose KYC validity expires. The requirement of updating KYC norms is applied by regulators globally and is part of anti-money laundering initiatives. Entities that have to follow KYC norms include finance companies, mutual funds, broking houses and depositories. The regularity with which customers have to update their records depends on how their accounts are classified by their banks. For customers in low-risk accounts, KYC needs to be updated once every 10 years. However, those classified as high-risk will need to update their account once every two years. Besides this, dormant and inactive accounts also require fresh KYC updates to unfreeze or reactivate them.

The company is set to end the first nine months of FY22 with a gross written premium of Rs 3,600 crore — a year-on-year increase of 65%.The company, promoted by industry veteran Kamesh Goyal and backed by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Group, had announced a fundraise of Rs 135 crore from existing investors in January 2021, valuing it at over $1.9 billion (Rs 14,000 crore). While the 12 months that followed were challenging for the non-life industry, Digit scaled up operations by increasing market share in motor insurance, expanding distribution, entering new geographies and getting into new lines of business.“This year has been a challenge for the general insurance industry because of the second wave of the pandemic, which slowed business and increased claims. The motor business has also been hit because of an increase in own damage claims and slowdown in sales because of the worldwide chip shortage,” said Goyal. He added that the company launched a health insurance business led by Covid products and is now present in all lines of business.Besides scaling distribution and product lines, the company has increased its claim-servicing capacity and handles 25,000-30,000 every month. “We have also demonstrated our ability to pay large claims by settling a fire insurance claim for Rs 140 crore within eight months,” said Goyal. However, the pandemic has taken a toll on underwriting margins, albeit to a lesser extent than industry. “While most of the general insurance companies have seen their combined ratio worsen by 7-8%, our combined ratio has gone up by 3% in 2021 to around 110% as health premium proportion was lower,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/digit-first-unicorn-of-2021-in-top-10-non-life-insurers/articleshow/88601944.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Bengaluru||Change of guard to poll battles, 2021 was a turbulent year||Bengaluru: In 2021, Karnataka, like the rest of the world, struggled to overcome effects of the second wave of Covid-19 in April-May, which saw a record surge in cases and fatality rate. Most of the BJP government’s efforts were concentrated towards fighting the pandemic and ensuring vaccines amid all the political turbulence. State politics saw a huge upheaval in July as 78-year-old Lingayat strongman BS Yediyurappa was forced out of office after he completed a two-year tenure, the fourth stint as chief minister in his five-decade-old career. Speculation was rife of a possible leadership change and the party brass kept denying it till Yediyurappa resigned on July 26 following internal feud and allegations over his style of functioning. The party’s decision to pick Basavaraj Bommai as his successor came as a surprise. After taking charge from Yediyurappa, the new CM made a decent start but his confidence was dented after BJP lost Hangal assembly segment, which is his neighbouring constituency, followed by an unexceptional performance in the council polls. The bitcoin scam allegations and 40% commission charge by Karnataka contractors’ association made his task harder. Despite Union home minister Amit Shah announcing the CM would lead the party in the 2023 polls, leadership change reports continue to haunt Bommai like his predecessor. The state also faced some extreme-weather events in 2021, forcing the BJP government to change tack from development to rescue and relief. For the fourth consecutive year, most parts of the state were affected by torrential rain which caused damage to life and property. According to the government, at least 42 people died and crop loss was estimated at 9.9 lakh hectares. Despite all these odds, the government did manage to push through some contentious bills. The Karnataka Land Reforms Act and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Amendment Act were enacted despite strong protests from farmers and the opposition Congress. Though BJP managed to push the anti-conversion bill in the assembly without much fuss, it failed to clear the council hurdle. Water and border disputes with neighbouring states, mainly Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, continued to create tensions, mainly over desecration of statues and the implementation of Mekedatu balancing reservoir project across Cauvery. The year also saw some keenly fought byelections and it turned out to be a mixed bag for the BJP. In April-May, it won the Belagavi Lok Sabha and Basavakalyan assembly constituencies, while Congress was able to retain Maski. In October, BJP won Sindgi assembly constituency and lost Hangal.Congress too was in the news for all the wrong reasons as there were frequent reports of political one-upmanship between former CM Siddaramaiah and state party president DK Shivakumar. JD(S) faced setbacks as it failed to win any bypolls and showed signs of losing its influence in Old Mysore region in MLC polls. Karnataka is expected to see more intense political turbulence in the year ahead with the 2023 assembly polls fast approaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/change-of-guard-to-poll-battles-2021-was-a-turbulent-year/articleshow/88601947.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: RWAs want BBMP to be more specific about New Year norms||BENGALURU: With hours left for the New Year revelry to begin, apartment owners and resident welfare associations are confused over the rules issued by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on celebrations to usher in 2022. With the Omicron threat looming large, BBMP has banned DJ parties but allowed small gatherings in apartments. However, many apartment associations feel BBMP could have issued specific guidelines for organising New Year parties and not leave everything to the discretion of the associations. “We support the government’s decision but some of us feel celebrations should be permitted inside apartments,” said Vikram Rai, secretary, Bengaluru Apartment Federations. Shantha Kumar, a member of Rajajinagar RWA, said issuing strict rules during the celebration is a must with increasing cases. “Senior citizens will be affected in case of outbreak and their recovery time is very slow. But the government rules are not clear,” he added. Dheeran Prakash Pai, secretary of a private apartment in JP Nagar, said the government should not have given permission for the celebration without restrictions. “If there are gatherings and someone tests positive, BBMP will seal off the whole apartment. Why cannot the government issue specific rules?” Pai asked. Vishnu Gattupalli, president of Trifecta Starlight apartment, said it’s important to keep the New Year celebrations a low-key affair. “The number of cases is rising drastically, and with the outbreak of Omicron, it is important to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to avoid community spread,” he added. BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta, however, said apartment federations and RWAs are allowed to celebrate the occasion after consulting among themselves. “DJs are not allowed, but it would be ideal if these groups follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rwas-want-bbmp-to-be-more-specific-about-ny-norms/articleshow/88601949.cms||Nithya Mandyam

It is the wealth of the government, wealth of the treasury. Crores of rupees are collected by these temples. What political stand are they trying to take looking at other states?” he said. Shivakumar said Congress would hold a meeting on January 4 to discuss the issue and decide on the future course of action. On Wednesday, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, after the state BJP executive meeting, announced that the government plans to table a bill in the next session of legislature to offer autonomy to Hindu temples. The move has received appreciation from BJP’s counterparts in Tamil Nadu, where there is a similar demand. Actress and BJP functionary Kushboo Sundar praised Karnataka’s stand. “It is an extremely important decision as every other religious institution is free,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cong-opposes-move-to-give-temples-autonomy/articleshow/88601950.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19 technical advisory committee for more curbs as TPR inches towards 1% in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The government is likely to impose more stringent curbs in Bengaluru as the Covid-19 technical advisory committee has recommended additional restrictions in the wake of rising cases. The TAC, which met on Wednesday to assess the Covid situation, has suggested a slew of preventive measures to be implemented in BBMP limits, including extension of night curfew beyond January 7. It is likely that the present restrictions that limit the occupancy in hotels, restaurants, pubs and bars to 50% of their seating capacity will continue. “TAC has made certain recommendations to check the surge. We have forwarded them to the government, which will decide depending on the emerging situation,” said KV Trilok Chandra, BBMP special commissioner, heath. TAC chairman MK Sudarshan said, “Cases are likely to surge further. We have suggested continuing night curfew and other curbs till the situation improves.” He added that the trends indicate it could be the start of a third wave and cases could peak in mid-February. “It is not the time to be complacent. Stringent curbs are needed, especially in Bengaluru which is looking to be a hotspot yet again,” he added. In its recommendations, TAC has made three categories: yellow indicates a scenario wherein the test positivity rate (TPR) is below 1%, orange indicates TPR between 1% and 2%, and red is for TPR above 2%. While the TPR in Bengaluru is inching towards 1%, Dr Sudarshan said imposition of lockdown would be necessary only if it crosses 3%. “The trend is showing that the TPR and new cases will surge fast in the coming days and more curbs will be required if the rate crosses 3%. However, the heartening factor is the third wave will not be as severe as the second wave. While it will peak and recede quickly, hospitalisation will be less and symptoms will be milder,” he said. As an indication of the surging infections in Bengaluru, the daily fresh cases jumped from 254 on December 24 to 400 on December 29, when the state total was 566. It further went up to 565 on Thursday (December 30) when the state recorded 707 cases. TPR in the city is also rising slowly but steadily. The weekly TPR, which was at 0.47% till December 24, jumped to 0.62% on Thursday. “We know that industries and traders will be hit. But it is inevitable if the cases continue to rise following this trend. We can only hope the situation will improve with people behaving responsibly and following Covid norms strictly so that another lockdown is avoided,” said Trilok Chandra .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/tac-for-more-curbs-as-tpr-inches-towards-1-in-city/articleshow/88601951.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Report sans QR code: Couple denied boarding at Bengaluru airport||BENGALURU: A couple en-route to the Maldives for their honeymoon was denied boarding at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) after they produced a handwritten RT-PCR negative report issued by the health department of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation which didn’t feature a quick response (QR) code. The civil aviation ministry mandates a Covid negative report with QR code for international travellers. Chartered accountant Bhavesh Gehani, 26, and college lecturer Urmila Nagpal, 24, from Nagpur tied the knot on December 6, 2021 and planned to fly to the Maldives for their honeymoon. As per a pre-booked holiday package worth Rs 2.5 lakh, the two landed at Bengaluru airport on December 9, 2021 to catch the Air India AI 265, a direct flight to Male scheduled to take off at 2.55pm. But a shocker awaited the couple. “We produced a hard copy of the RT-PCR negative report issued by the Nagpur corporation to the ground staff of Air India along with the negative report ascertainment text from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website. But we were not allowed to travel further as the staff demanded a report with QR code,” Bhavesh said. Faced with the possibility of their honeymoon being disrupted, the couple desperately tried to download their reports with QR codes from the ICMR portal at the Bengaluru terminal but were unsuccessful due some technical issues. By then, the Air India staff began the process of removing their bags from the plane. “Finally, we managed to retrieve the reports from the ICMR portal and produced them at 2.30pm before the departure gate staff, who denied us boarding. My wife and I pleaded with them to allow us as we were heading for our honeymoon but they refused to listen,” said a dejected Bhavesh who had to reschedule the trip. Forced to cancel the tickets on Air India to Male, the couple booked an IndiGo flight the following day by paying Rs 46,000 one way. The couple has approached Air India for a refund claiming the rules on RT-PCR test reports were unclear to passengers and questioned as to how a government health department’s report was not acceptable for air travel. Air India sources at KIA said the ministry of civil aviation in May 2021 issued an order stating an RT-PCR test report with QR code is mandatory for passengers flying out of the country in order to prevent fake reports often concealing the Covid status of the flyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/report-sans-qr-code-couple-denied-boarding-at-kia/articleshow/88601952.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Police to use 2,000 body-worn cameras to monitor Bengaluru’s traffic||BENGALURU: If everything goes as planned, cops with cameras fixed on their bodies will be monitoring traffic movement and remain in touch with their colleagues at junctions across the city. The live feeds from the body-worn cameras will help cops in diverting traffic to other roads in case of emergencies. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday inaugurated tech-based facilities to enable smooth and safe traffic movement. The project mainly includes cameras that can be worn by traffic cops and record traffic-related events. The cameras work at night also. City traffic cops were on Thursday given 2,128 such cameras. This apart, automatic number plate recognition cameras (ANPR) were also launched. They use artificial intelligence and detect licence plates of the vehicles that indulge in violations and of suspicious vehicles. Home minister Araga Jnanendra said the body-worn cameras will help avoid unnecessary arguments with police and the public.  “Every day, we have new vehicles on the road. We need to work on the technical front to facilitate and ease traffic movement. We’ve identified 12 corridors where these technologies can be applied,” the CM said. He said these days, traffic police personnel are issuing violation notices through SMSs. “Do you (traffic police) collect the amount directly from the bank accounts of the offenders?” he quipped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/police-to-use-2000-body-worn-cameras-to-monitor-citys-traffic/articleshow/88601953.cms||---

Barbeque kits are out, sleepover plans are being chalked out, ardent partygoers are settling for terrace get-togethers, and some are even busy zeroing in on movies and series that they can binge-watch on New Year’s Eve. G Kalyan Kumar, SAP consultant, will be spending December 31 night at a small get-together on the terrace of his friends’ home in Nelamangala. “It won’ be party lights this year but open sky and fireworks. Usually, my New Year’s Eve is either spent in a happening pub or in arranging a party,” he said. Aslam Basheer, founder of Café Azzure and Rocktfuel Agency, has planned a fun barbeque party with his family. “I have my barbeque grill set dusted which I had used in December 2020,” the Rajajinagar resident said, adding that if it were not for Covid, he would be out camping in the wilderness on the last day of the year. “I don’t like loud music or noise, so I like to keep it sober. Camping, game nights or potluck would have been an ideal NY night,” he said. Amanda Sequeira, a corporate communications professional, is looking forward to a quiet New Year’s Eve. “This year is not going to be very different from the last one for me, especially with the night curfew in place. I’m going to open a bottle of wine, order a large pizza and do a movie marathon. Being a dog mom, I’m quite happy to stay home and spend time with Bailey (pet),” she said, adding that if not for Covid, she would have been on a vacation. “...And would welcome the New Year in some beach resort, sipping cocktails and making new friends,” the Sarjapur resident said. For banking professional Madhumathi Raman as well, New Year’s Eve will be all about binging on new movies and series. “It would have been a get-together with friends, but with restrictions, it’s going to be a virtual one on WhatsApp, FaceTime and Zoom,” she said. With a restriction of operating pubs, restaurants and hotels at 50% capacity, many partygoers are sticking to home parties and sleepovers. Vaishakh and his friends, all students, have a sleepover planned as they won’t be able to return home after their parties. “I don’t want to be stopped by cops at every turn. So, we’ll be spending the entire night at one of our friend’s homes. The party menu is planned, and we’ll start ordering around 8pm,” he said. While saying that pizza from Brik Oven and kebabs from Empire are a must for a party, Vaishakh also has a request: “I urge everyone to tip the delivery executives generously. They are the reason we can relax indoors.” While restaurants and eateries are looking forward to a busy night, some places like the Foodhall@1MG Mall are even offering special party menus, like charcuterie of cheese and meat, artisanal crackers etc. Apartment complexes in the city have also issued Covid guidelines, while organising fun events. Residents have been permitted to party in their flats without creating a nuisance. Nikoo Homes 1 in Thanisandra has organised a flea market with food stalls on December 31 and January 1, but no live music or DJ-type programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/blureans-to-beat-curfew-blues-with-bbq-parties-sleepovers-movie-marathons/articleshow/88601955.cms||Farheen Hussain

Venkatesh, a resident of Ragi Gudda, JP Nagar, and sales executive with an electronics showroom in BTM Layout, parked his bike on the flyover and was talking to someone on the phone for some time. Around 12.05am, he jumped off the flyover and hit the road about 50 feet below. Venkatesh climbed the sidewall of the flyover and jumped from there. He sustained severe injuries and died instantly. Initially, police suspected that he had fallen accidentally, but on verifying the CCTV footage, they found he’d jumped off the wall. Police said he was on a mobile call for over 20 minutes before taking the extreme step. His phone was completely damaged in the incident. Police are collecting call details records (CDR) to find out whom he spoke to before taking the plunge. His parents told police they had no clue about Venkatesh facing any problem which would force him to take the step.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youth-jumps-to-death-from-e-city-expressway/articleshow/88601956.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Mandatory admission for Covid-positive international travellers peeves private hospitals||BENGALURU: International passengers testing positive for Covid-19 on arrival are mandated to get admitted to hospitals owing to fear of Omicron spread. Private hospitals, where most of these patients who are mildly symptomatic or have no symptoms get admitted, have raised concerns over them occupying the wards for not less than 10 days. “They are all vaccinated and have no severe infections and can be easily managed at home or at Covid care centres. Being in the hospital despite having no sickness and waiting for genome sequencing reports is affecting the patients. This is also adding to the maintenance cost of the Covid wards,” said members of the Private Hospitals and Nursing homes Association (PHANA). The members have communicated the same to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), seeking change in guidelines and allowing home isolation for foreign-returned Covid positive people as it may create shortage of beds for non-Covid patients in private hospitals. The matter has also led to clashes between hospital staff and the patients, private hospitals said. As per the BBMP data, there are nearly 180-200 Covid patients in private hospitals in the city and the number keeps varying. At various branches of Manipal Hospitals, 48 Covid cases have been admitted. Suguna Hospital has 24 patients, Apollo 15 at its three branches, and government-run Bowring hospital 17. Dr R Ravindra, PHANA member, said the government must take a stand to allow Covid patients to be admitted in step-down hospitals in hotels. “The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has recently shortened the isolation period for Covid patients to five days amid the Omicron spread. Experts must look into this too,” he said. A majority of international passengers who are turning positive for Covid on arrival are asymptomatic and the mandatory hospitalisation of all of them is draconian in retrospect, said Dr Satyanarayana Mysore, HOD, pulmonology, Manipal Hospitals. “All international passengers who turn Covid positive must be encouraged to be in home isolation and ensure that they strictly follow the instructions. While the intention behind the hospitalisation is to prevent the spread of Omicron, effective monitoring of the home isolation cases can be done,” he said, adding the Omicron surge is expected across the country by mid-January. Dr HM Prasanna, president, PHANA, said the matter was of serious concern which needs to be taken up by the government. “Mandatory admission of Omicron-suspected cases is putting pressure on the hospitals’ resources. The admissions have increased in the last two weeks,” Dr Prasanna said, adding that the organisation will take up the matter with the BBMP and the state government. However, Covid technical expert committee members said the state must have an experience of treating 100-150 Omicron cases before it allows home isolation for all positive international passengers. “We don’t know yet if all the Omicron cases will continue to be mild. We have to see how it pans out. As of now, the patients must be in hospitals for 10 days after which they can be discharged when they test negative for Covid twice in a gap of 24 hours,” said a TAC member. “Unless the state government and TAC change the guidelines, admission of international patients and their contacts testing positive for Covid will continue,” said Dr AS Balasundar, chief health officer, BBMP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mandatory-admission-for-covid-positive-intl-travellers-peeves-private-hospitals/articleshow/88601957.cms||Sunitha Rao R

I have tried to analyse him through a socialist lens. The 720-page book focuses on the makings of Gandhi that began in South Africa.”“There is an ongoing debate on the ideological differences between Gandhi and BR Ambedkar. However, the dialogue between the two is not simple to derive any straight meaning from. It is a complex dialogue I have researched and highlighted in the book,” he said.

Police said foggy conditions prevailed in the area, reducing visibility. Four trucks, two cars, two buses and one mini-goods vehicle were damaged. The driver of a private bus was shifted to a private hospital with fractured legs, while the other injured persons were treated as outpatients at another nearby hospital. The accident occurred near T Begur Cross around 6am when a Bengaluru-bound KSRTC bus brushed against a truck while overtaking it, forcing the truck driver to apply sudden brake. The bus also came to a sudden halt and the mini-goods vehicle, carrying vegetables, rammed both the bus and truck before veering to the left. A private bus coming from behind hit the truck. The impact left the bus driver with fractured legs. Then, another truck, carrying onions, rear-ended the private bus and a car rammed the truck. Finally, another goods truck crashed into the truck that had hit the private bus. People from other vehicles rushed to help the victims. Passengers of the private bus were brought out by breaking open the windshield, while some jumped out through the emergency door. Traffic was disrupted for nearly an hour.“The driver of the KSRTC bus fled the scene. We have taken a statement from the conductor and contacted the KSRTC depot manager. The driver’s rash driving was one of the causes of the accident. Also, the presence of thick fog might have contributed to it,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/12-injured-9-vehicles-damaged-in-pile-up/articleshow/88601959.cms||---

The injured cop, Vinod Rathod, has been hospitalised. Yeshwantpur police were investigating a dacoity case reported on November 29. A gang of miscreants posed as BBMP health staff and robbed two women of 50 grams of gold ornaments at their house in SBM Colony, Yeshwantpur, around noon. Police initially thought it was a dacoity committed by two miscreants. But their investigation revealed that a gang of eight had committed the offence. Police arrested three suspects a few days ago. They came to know that Sagar (name changed), who has five cases of robbery against him, was also a gang member. On receiving information about Sagar’s presence near a farm between Bhoopasandra and Hebbal, Rathod rushed to the spot with two policemen. There was a scuffle and a chase, and when Rathod was about to catch him, Sagar stabbed him and fled. Rathod is said to be out of danger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dacoity-case-suspect-stabs-cop-flees/articleshow/88601962.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||B’luru accounted for third of office space absorption in ’21||Bengaluru: Office space absorption across India’s six major cities rose by 15.5% to 36.9 million sqft in 2021, according to estimates by property consultancy Savills India. New supply rose by 28% to 36.8 mn sqft. These six cities are Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR and Pune.Bengaluru remained the frontrunner, with the city recording 12 mn sqft of absorption for the year. That’s almost a third of the overall absorption across the six cities. It was 54% ahead of NCR, which saw 7.8 mn sqft of absorption. Hyderabad was at No. 3, and Mumbai at No. 4, rising from the sixth position it had in 2020. Bengaluru has been the office space absorption leader for years, because of the demand from the IT, ITeS and technology sectors.Savills said the second half of this year showed remarkable growth, with the third quarter recording a high of 13.7 mn sqft. NCR and Mumbai recorded the highest annual growth in absorption, at 79% and 61% respectively. Hyderabad remained nearly flat.IT continues to drive the office market with 49.2% share of total leasing in 2021. The return of co-working spaces at about 13% was noteworthy, Savills said. The BFSI sector saw a 15.2% share, an increase of about 3 percentage points from 2020. Strong supply infusion was the theme across all four quarters of 2021, the report said. Bengaluru, Hyderabad and NCR witnessed large supply infusions. Chennai had the smallest volume in 2021.The overall vacancy level on a pan-India scale in 2021 has risen by 6 percentage points, as a result of supply infusions, to 17.7%. This kept rentals stable during the year. Private equity investment inflows into the Indian real estate sector stood at $3.4 billion in 2021, a decline of 48%. Savills said this may be because investors were worried about the likelihood of a new variant of Covid infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-accounted-for-third-of-office-space-absorption-in-21/articleshow/88601964.cms||Kruthikaa Lakshman

---||Chennai||Merge cess, surcharges into basic tax, says PTR||Chennai: Tamil Nadu minister for finance and human resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan has called upon the Centre to merge all the ‘cesses and surcharges’ into the basic rate of taxes, so that the states are not deprived of their rightful share of tax revenues. After the Centre more than tripled the ‘cesses and surcharges’ to 19.9% in 2020-21 against 6.2% in 2010-11, the states were deprived of 1.5 lakh crore as their divisible share of revenues in 2021-22, he said.“The increased levy of cesses and surcharges, which do not form part of the divisible pool of taxes, has adversely affected the transfer of resources to the states. The states are deprived of a share of approximately 20% of the revenue collected by the Union government,” Thiaga Rajan said, while urging the Centre to release the pending 16,725 crore due to Tamil Nadu and extend the period for offering “GST compensation” to states by two years from end of June 2022.Addressing the pre-budget meeting chaired by the Union finance minister Nirmala Seetharaman and attended by all state finance ministers in New Delhi on Thursday, Thiaga Rajan said due to the realignment of taxes by the Centre, the ratio of grants-in-aid to share in central taxes has increased from 62.67% in financial year 2010-11 to 130.7% in 2020-21. “While the share in taxes is a legitimate right and provides the state the autonomy to cater to the local needs and aspirations, the grant-in-aid is discretionary and tied funds. This greatly impinges the federal structure enshrined in the Constitution,” he said, while urging the Centre to merge the cesses and surcharges.In recent years, the share of revenue collected from indirect taxes in the gross tax revenue of the Centre has increased sharply and has surpassed the collections from direct taxes in 2020-21. Since indirect taxes are regressive by nature, they disproportionately affect the poor and urged the Centre to maintain a 60:40 ratio between direct and indirect taxes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/merge-cess-surcharges-into-basic-tax-says-ptr/articleshow/88601967.cms||---

Velladurai, who has to his credit several encounters, including the one involving Ayodhyakuppam Veeramani and Manalmedu Shankar, is considered a specialist in handling rowdy elements and anti-socials. His mandate is to counter the resurfacing of criminals in the industrial belt of Kancheepuram.A senior police officer in the DGP office said Velladurai was appointed two weeks ago, as there was a surge in criminal activities in Kancheepuram and its surroundings. When contacted, Velladurai told TOI: “I am assigned to assist Kancheepuram superintendent of police M Sudhakar.” Soon after assuming charge, he has gathered details of the rowdies and anti-socials in Kancheepuram.

The city was unprepared for the seven-hour non-stop downpour that was neither expected by residents, nor forecast by meteorological department officials or independent weather bloggers. Chief minister M K Stalin rushed to the flood control room at Ripon Buildings and held discussions with corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi and other officials. He also visited some of the flood-affected areas late in the evening. As of 8.30pm, MRC Nagar recorded 20cm, while Nungambakkam recorded 18cm, Meenambakkam 13cm and ACS Medical College on Poonamallee High Road 15cm. The all-time highest 24-hour rainfall for December is 294.1mm recorded on December 2, 2015. Thursday’s spell surpassed December’s monthly average rainfall of 177.4mm. As a result, almost every locality witnessed water-logging and traffic snarls extended up to the airport in the south, and to Poonamallee in the west. The meteorological department came out with a ‘red alert’ later in the day, and said there would be heavy rain and thunderstorms for 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cloudburst-brings-chennai-to-its-knees-traffic-piles-up-for-kilometres/articleshow/88601973.cms||---

---||Chennai||Borrow a book, return it at any library in state||Chennai: Soon, a reader can rent a book from a public library and return it anywhere in the state after reading it. Search for books, reservation and renewals too could be done through a mobile app and home delivery of books also could be a possibility, as Tamil Nadu government is keen on reviving libraries and book-lending in the state.A centralised book-returning system will be made possible, as the Anna Centenary Library (ACL) along with Roja Muthiah Research Library, is preparing a union catalogue for all 35 lakh books in the 4,640 public libraries across Tamil Nadu. Roja Muthiah Research Library is curating the catalogue of all books in public libraries to the international standard like Anglo American Cataloguing Rules (AACR2) and Machine-Readable Cataloguing (MARC 21).In the first phase, school education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi released the union catalogue for more than seven lakh books in Anna Centenary Library, Connemara Public Library, Roja Muthiah Research Library and 32 district libraries this week. With the common catalogue, the search for books in all public libraries will get easier. By typing the title or author, a reader will get the details like which libraries have the book, availability, literary form, publisher, edition and material type.“This catalogue could act as a single tool for searching all books available in all public libraries in Tamil Nadu,” said S Kamatchi, coordinator of Union Catalogue Project for Public Libraries. The project is being implemented under the Tamil Nadu Innovation Initiatives (TANII) scheme by the State Planning Commission.Digitising catalogue also will help library authorities to know which books are in circulation and which are not used by readers in the public libraries.“It would also help to know which type of books or subjects is being preferred or not preferred in a particular region. The moving books can be stocked up more and unused books could be avoided while procuring the books for public libraries,” she added.It may also help the library authorities to weed out the titles which are gathering dust and occupying space. Following the union catalogue, the directorate of public libraries may come up with the user mobile app for searching for books. “Like how we know restaurants near us by googling it, this app will enable the book lovers to know which nearest library has a particular book and whether it is available or not,” said G Sundar, director, Roja Muthiah Research Library in Taramani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/borrow-a-book-return-it-at-any-library-in-state/articleshow/88601976.cms||---
---||Chennai||‘States voiced concern over federalism being under threat at pre-budget meet’||Chennai: Tamil Nadu minister for finance and human resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Thursday said that several people who spoke at the pre-budget meeting, convened by Union minister for finance Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi, voiced their concern about federalism being under threat now more than ever before. The meeting was attended by chief ministers, deputy chief ministers and finance ministers.“With Centre opting for the cess and surcharge route, the rightful share of the states have gone down. This is against the concept of federalism and infringing into the autonomy of the states. Several speakers highlighted this in their speeches,” Palanivel Thiaga Rajan told reporters. Thiaga Rajan said that when central PSUs are privatized under the Centre’s monetization policy, the states need to be compensated for the land offered to such projects. “We have acquired huge tracts of land for expansion of airports in Coimbatore, Trichy and Madurai. In the case of Trichy airport, we acquired land from defence ministry and from public, besides offering the state government land. If this airport is privatized, the Centre will get money twice for the same land, while states, having spent huge money, will get nothing.” The amount that the Centre had announced under several packages during Covid has not reached the last mile and MSMEs continue to suffer, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/states-voiced-concern-over-federalism-being-under-threat-at-pre-budget-meet/articleshow/88601977.cms||---
---||Chennai||Office space market declines in Chennai; residential sector upbeat||Chennai: It is a mixed fortune for the city’s real estate market during the still-to-end pandemic. While office space activity has suffered a sharp decline, the residential housing sector is experiencing a revival, matching the demand and sale on par with the pre-covid levels in the city and suburbs.Two years after witnessing a fillip, supply of office space in Chennai has suffered a downtrend, becoming the lowest among 6 metropolitan cities in the country. Real estate experts say the imminent third wave spurred by Omicron variant of covid-19 is likely to hold the decisions of IT and ITES firms from asking their employees to return to office.A report by Savills India on the office market across 6 cities has revealed that absorption has dropped only in Chennai and Pune. While Chennai recorded a 6% decline in the gross leasing activity year-on-year from 2020 and 2021, the city had a substantial fall of 2.7 million square foot of new supply this year, as compared to 2020. Chennai had hardly nine lakh square feet of new supply, the lowest supply in the country this year, according to the report. Vacancy rate in Chennai's office space market continues to be 13.2% in 2021 like last year.Arvind Nandan, managing director, research and consulting, Savills India, said the decline could be attributed to subdued confidence of occupiers during the second wave of Covid-19. "Like other major cities, work from home/anywhere had an impact on office leasing activity in Chennai. Occupiers have been continuously reassessing their real estate requirements," he said. At the same time, around 4.5 msqft of buildings are in final stages of construction and are expected to receive occupancy certificates in the first quarter of 2022, he added.R Murugesan, managing director of ARAM Realty associated with developing an IT SEZ on GST Road, said companies employing 100-150 workers continue to function on remote mode post-covid, while major firms are using the offices with revised rents. "Most of the big IT companies were looking at returning 75% of their employees in offices before January 2022. But, the spurt due to Omicron variant has made them postpone the decisions. Staff will continue to work from home for some more months," he said.Chennai and suburbs have approximately 70 million square feet of IT office space, of which about 50% is on OMR alone.However, S Sridharan, chairman of urban development and housing, CREDAI (national), said absorptions in office space market was improving in Chennai. "Office space offering more than two million square feet coming up on OMR is having traction, which is an indicator that there is demand for the office space vertical," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/office-space-market-declines-in-chennai-residential-sector-upbeat/articleshow/88601979.cms||---
---||Chennai||Fresh Covid cases in Chennai double in 48 hours||CHENNAI: Covid-19 cases doubled in the last 48 hours in Chennai, with the city reporting 397 new cases on Thursday, 103 cases more than its tally on Wednesday, and 203 cases more than what it recorded on Tuesday. Experts warned that the situation is expected to worsen in the weeks following the New Year holidays. “We are seeing a spike of more than 100 cases for the second consecutive day. While we continue to see Delta variants, the rapid spread indicates the presence of Omicron too,” said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. While there are just 46 confirmed cases of Omicron, the state has reported at least 146 international travellers and their contacts with S-gene dropout, which is an indicator of Omicron. City labs are reporting a spike in S-gene dropouts even in those without travel history, officials said. For instance, the cluster of Covid-19 cases from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General hospital rose to 128 on Thursday. The source of infection was one of the patients, a diabetic, admitted for a skin graft procedure on December 17. On Thursday, after testing 4,400 contacts including doctors, nurses, medicos, nursing students, the total number of cases in the cluster rose to 128. Among these, S-gene dropout was noticed in at least 93 patients. All patients carrying the new variant showed mild symptoms of the infection. “They have cold, sore throat, fatigue, and mild temperature. The virus affects the bronchi, but we haven't yet seen patients with lung infections,” said Radhakrishnan. The bigger challenge now is that people with mild or no symptoms are becoming super spreaders, particularly in vulnerable places such as hospitals. In another cluster, with nearly 10 cases on a street, the index case was an attendee to a patient admitted to a government hospital. Corporation officials barricaded the street in Ashok Nagar and declared it a containment zone. “The only way to keep the disease under check is to increase testing,” said Corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. The corporation will increase random sampling in vulnerable areas. “Attenders and visitors of hospitals, people in crowded places, markets, workplaces, and hostels will be tested over the next few weeks,” he said. He said the aim is to conduct at least 25000 tests in the city every day. In a Covid-19 enforcement meeting he chaired on Thursday, Bedi asked officials to monitor all the business complexes and marketplaces on Covid protocol adherence. “A two-member team each for all fifteen zones. We will be imposing fines on people who violate social distancing norms or those who don't wear masks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fresh-cases-in-city-double-in-48-hours/articleshow/88601981.cms||---

The stretch is part of CMRL's corridor-3, which connects Madhavaram Milk Colony with Siruseri. CMRL had already barricaded a portion of the OMR median near the Tidel Park for pre-construction work which included soil testing. Against this backdrop, tree transplantation work, which began on Tuesday, was completed within a short period. Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation (TNRDC) spent 2.9lakh towards this. Palm trees removed from the IT corridor were planted at East Coast Road (along the median) near the Uthandi toll gate area, said a senior TNRDC official. Besides these 55 palm trees, TNRDC had earlier transplanted 35 trees at this stretch for construction of a U-shaped flyover in the corridor. "All these trees are fine now," the official added. While laying OMR, more than 1,200 trees were shifted to various locations in the vicinity. Majority were moved inside the Central Polytechnic College premises in Taramani.

Nungambakkam weather station recorded 18cm of rain till 8.30pm, the highest 24-hour rain since 2016, when the station registered 11cm of rain on December 13. Thursday’s downpour was due to a sudden movement of rain-bearing clouds due to an easterly trough (an elongated region of low pressure) that remained stationary over Chennai coast. IMD officials said none of the forecast observations picked up this weather development. With one more day left in the year, the annual rainfall of 223cm in 2021 has already surpassed that of 2015 (210cm) when the city saw massive floods. As of 8.30pm, Nungambakkam recorded 18cm of rain, Meenambakkam 13cm, MRC Nagar 20cm and ACS Medical College 15cm.

---||Chennai||Record rain overwhelms Chennai, suburbs||Chennai: Surprise showers pelted down on Chennai non-stop for more than seven hours on Thursday, leaving the city paralysed and many roads and residential areas under knee-deep water. What started as moderate shower in the early afternoon became heavy rain by the evening, taking residents, road-users and authorities alike by surprise. Vehicles moving at a snail’s pace were stranded on almost all main roads, including Anna Salai and Poonamallee High Road, for hours, and the worst-hit were the office-goers returning home and other road-users. It was an unprecedented pile-up of vehicles from Royapettah up to the airport, said a commuter. At the end of the day, rainfall ranging from 8cm (airport) upto 18cm (MRC Nagar and Nungambakkam) had been recorded in seven hours. Chief minister M K Stalin visited the corporation control room and some rain-affected areas in the city. City corporation commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the heavy rain came as a surprise as they were not given such a weather update. “The city did not see this much deluge even on November 7”, he said. Bedi, along with other officials, took stock of the scenario from the control room at Ripon buildings. Core city areas such as Nungambakkam, T Nagar, Teynampet, Kodambakkam and Egmore were all flooded and vehicle-users were seen pushing their vehicles that had conked out. Water mixed with sewage entered houses in at least five of the city’s important subways, including the RBI subway on Kamarajar Salai. More than 70% of MTC buses were stuck on road, and highways too suffered bumper-to-bumper traffic. A lot of commuters left their vehicles on the roadside, and thronged the metro stations to get a safe and quick commute home. In response to the demand, CMRL extended its services till midnight to handle extra crowd.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/record-rain-overwhelms-city-suburbs/articleshow/88601994.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Customs men booked in red sanders smuggling||HYDERABAD: A nexus between customs officials and red sanders smugglers in illegally exporting the priced wood by air cargo has been exposed after a probe by the CBI and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. The racket came to light after seizure of multiple consignments of red sanders logs from Rayalaseema, weighing 3,293 kg, being exported illegally by listing them as pipes. Three customs officials and two others have been named in the CBI FIR. The accused officials are superintendents of customs C Venkatesh and Anantha Padmanabha Rao, and inspector Ravinder Pawar of Bangalore Air Cargo complex. The other two were identified as customs house agent T Satish Kumar, whose licence was under suspension, and the illegal exporter Najeeb. Red sanders misdeclared as pipesThe customs officials have been booked by CBI's Bengaluru anti-corruption branch for criminal conspiracy and also under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The red sanders consignment was seized in August by DRI Bengaluru zonal office and a case was booked for illegal export without valid DGFT licence. In the DRI probe it was revealed that customs house agent Satish was smuggling red sanders by bribing customs officials and misdeclaring the logs as industrial ductile pipes. On December 21, CBI submitted its report detailing the conspiracy between customs officials and smugglers. According to the CBI, Najeeb approached customs superintendent Venkatesh through Satish for facilitating clearance of shipments. Between June and July 2021, Najeeb brought a total of seven shipments of red sanders to Satish for clearance in the name of exporters Gurmehar Impex and TEAC Engineers. The probe revealed that the fir st shipment containing red Sanders was declared as industrial pump spares in the name of Gurmehar Impex. "When the shipment was picked up for open examination on June 3, inspector Pawar took 12,000 bribe and submitted a false report stating items in the container were same as that declared in the invoice or shipping bill documents. Satish visited the premises of Air India Sats where the shipment was scanned and was met by Pawar who demanded 8 lakh for himself and superintendent Rao," CBI said in its report. Satish paid 2.5 lakh to Pawar in cash and 1.25 lakh to Rao through banking channel, and a further 1.25 lakh later. Another shipment name was changed from UDL Logisitcs Ltd to TEAC Engineers with UP address. These shipments were neither selected for open examination nor scanned by Air India Sats. The shipments contained red sander logs declared as industrial ductile pipes, the CBI said. Another two shipments were found by DRI in August in the name of Lakshmi Logistics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/customs-men-booked-in-red-sanders-smuggling/articleshow/88602002.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji, while hearing a PIL filed by OU research scholar Poladi Ramana Rao, directed the petitioner to make Tulasi cooperative society a respondent to the case. Poladi had questioned the inaction of the authorities during the lockdown period in protecting the OU land. Following the HC intervention, the OU authorities made a police complaint and the probe by the Amberpet police also came to a conclusion that the land belonging to OU was encroached upon. The bench went through the counter affidavit filed by the OU and also the police department and observed that the Tulasi society acted in an unlawful manner in selling away nine plots over which it has no right or title. A prima facie case of fraud was made out, it said. The court sought a detailed report from the police and revenue authorities and posted the case on Jan 20. The Tulasi society which bought 4800 square yards of land in 1976 fought a legal battle with OU and secured title over this land. A report furnished by a surveyor tilted the court’s opinion in favour of the society. Later the society divided it into 14 plots of equal size, sold 13, and marked one for the park. According to Advocate General BS Prasad, the Tulasi society is now using the surveyor’s report in the old case to justify its taking over of adjacent 3300 square yards of land which belongs to the Osmania University. The petitioner said that the society has sold more than 8000 square yards of land though it does not possess that much land in the first place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-halts-construction-in-nine-plots-inside-ou/articleshow/88602005.cms||---

The discoms estimate it would further increase to 5,325 MU (190%) in 2022-2023 as the state government aims to complete many projects, including rest of Kaleshwaram and other schemes in southern part of the state.Interestingly, power utilities said individual borewells and agriculture sales would come down due to LIS schemes bringing water. “After 24x7 free power for agriculture was implemented in 2018, there was significant increase in agricultural consumption in the state in 2019 over the previous year. But in 2020, due to abnormally high rainfall, the agriculture consumption through borewells reduced in comparison to the actual sales of 2019. The agricultural consumption would come down given the fall in use of borewells and a rise in canal-based cultivation,” the discoms said in their reports submitted to the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lift-irrigation-to-up-power-consumption-in-t-by-190-in-2022/articleshow/88602010.cms||---

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Thursday, KTR appealed to the minister to withdraw the proposal at the GST council meeting which she will chair on Friday. He said the industry and weavers community have staged several protests demanding the Centre to waive off GST on handloom products and its raw material. Instead of waiving off 5% GST on handloom products and its raw material, the Centre was planning to increase it to 12% from January 1, 2022, which will sound a death knell to the industry and lakhs of people will lose their jobs. “The textile and handloom sector provides the second highest employment in our country. This sector is already bearing the brunt of Covid-19 and the Centre has not even provided any relief to the sector. Considering the current scenario, the Centre should extend additional advantages and incentives to the sector,” the minister said.He said the increase in GST will impact 80-85% of handloom and textile production.  Costs of raw materials, yarn, chemicals, packaging material and transportation have gone up post-Covid-19. In addition to these costs, increase in GST will further escalate the production costs by 15 to 20%, he said. Due to this, there will be danger of many textiles and apparels units closing down. “There is possibility of 15 lakh people losing their jobs in the handlooms sector due to the increase in GST,” the minister observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/roll-back-gst-hike-on-textiles-ktr-to-fm/articleshow/88602014.cms||Koride Mahesh

Revanth urged the CM to dispatch a team of ministers to the affected districts (Khammam, Mahabubabad, Kottagudem, Warangal Urban, Warangal Rural, Nalgonda and Suryapeta) to assess the situation and reassure chilli farmers. In addition, he stated that the Congress party would launch a campaign to seek justice for chilli farmers. “Compensation should be paid to chilli farmers who have lost their crops. They should be provided with free seeds and fertilisers for their next crop. Compensation of 10 lakh should be paid to the families of farmers who have died by suicide,” he said. “Farmers expected good returns on their investment of about 1 lakh per acre. The crop, however, was destroyed by an invasive insect from Indonesia that was first observed in 2015,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rescue-chilli-ryots-pay-10l-aid-revanth/articleshow/88602017.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Allow home delivery of liquor in Telangana amid Omicron threat: ISWAI||HYDERABAD: The International Spirits & Wines Association of India (ISWAI), the apex body of the premium alcobev sector in the country, has urged the state government to allow home delivery of liquor in light of the Omicron threat looming large as it would prevent crowding at retail outlets, save jobs, minimise industry disruption and limit spurious and counterfeit products. “The current months are the peak consumption period for the industry, and regularising or formalising of home delivery will ensure minimal disruption to the industry, ensure citizen convenience, and also protect jobs whilst protecting the revenue the state exchequer gets from the alcobev industry,” ISWAI CEO Nita Kapoor said. To bolster ISWAI’s case, Kapoor pointed to a 2020 post-Covid lockdown Local Circles survey on ‘Consumer pulse on home delivery of liquor’ that showed that 52% of 8,078 polled nationwide wanted state administrations to implement home delivery solution. The ISWAI chief also cited excise department figures on the number of home delivery orders place in the states of West Bengal (1.9 lakh home deliveries with a registered buyer count of around 1.5 lakh) and Maharashtra (60 lakh home deliveries) between May 15, 2020, and March 31, 2021, to validate the home delivery argument. “Given the demand among citizens in all states, we believe that if the home delivery model is regularised with all necessary regulations in place, going forward, this can become a potential channel for encouraging responsible drinking beside the growth of revenue for states,” she said stressing on the need to make home delivery a permanent feature of excise policy. ISWAI secretary-general Suresh Menon said the state government should reinforce and frame standard home delivery norms to ensure there is no harassment from authorities and no deliveries are done to underage consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allow-home-delivery-of-liquor-amid-omicron-threat-iswai/articleshow/88602018.cms||---

Close to 60 volunteers enrolled with the Society for Cyberabad Security Council are set to assist traffic cops in regulating traffic from 10 pm to 4 am on the intervening night of December 31 and January 1. For Surendra Uplainchwar, an IT employee, this will be his fifth consecutive year when he will be on the roads assisting the traffic cops on New Year’s Eve. “I join the traffic cops every year to help them clear the traffic, conduct drink drive checks among others. I feel it is my duty to help the society with whatever little I can because there needs to be more awareness about many issues including driving with a license, having a pollution certificate for the vehicle etc.,” said Uplainchwar. With heavy drink and drive checks expected in all three commissionerates, a few volunteers will be helping people board the TSRTC buses. “I would be encouraging people to use the special buses that will be deployed by the TSRTC for the New Year’s Eve at various key junctions. This volunteering gives more self-satisfaction and happiness than chilling on New Year’s Eve,” said Sai Teja, an IT employee. The TSRTC has planned to operate metro express buses for the convenience of the public from 7:30 pm to 3 am with a flat fare of 100 per head in one way. Some residents and colonies are also planning to hold blanket donation drives, cleanliness drives and other events on December 31 and January 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techies-to-turn-traffic-volunteers-in-cyberabad/articleshow/88602019.cms||---

Shopkeepers lifted stocks worth 3,040 crore from depots. This sales figure was also higher than December 2020 sales of 2,765 crore. Officials said it was a particularly happy December this time. With no restrictions on events and gatherings this year, New Year’s eve earnings are expected to be higher. Officials anticipate revenue of around 300 crore on the last day of the year. This year, 36 lakh Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) cases have been sold in December along with 29.6 lakh beer cases when compared to 34 lakh IMFL cases and 27 lakh beer cases in the same month last year. Interestingly, despite chilly conditions prevailing, beer cases are selling at a higher rate this December. According to sources, the excise department’s recent approval of 104 more shops and 159 bars has also contributed to higher sales. In addition to 2,220 liquor stores, the state has over 1,500 pubs, restaurants and tourism hotels, all of which have contributed to increased sales. Except for the border districts of Nalgonda, Khammam, Suryapet and Mahbubnagar, sales are expected to be high in all other areas, particularly in Hyderabad and suburbs thanks to big events lined up for December 31.

Only people who have been double-vaccinated will be allowed at pubs. There is no use of restrictions anymore but people need to exercise caution,” he said.Stressing that since the virus has spread at community level and the best precaution is to follow Covid-19 norms, the officials said that people can wear masks and go to theatres. On the issue of allowing theatres to function despite the third wave beginning, Rao said, “We have asked people to wear mask on mouth and nose and not eyes.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC okay with police steps for noisy pubs||HYDERABAD: Stating that he was pleasantly surprised by the unusually quick response from Hyderabad police for putting in place better arrangements and mechanism to keep Omicron away during the ongoing New Year events, Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana high court on Thursday said he would review the efficacy of the police measures on January 6. The judge on Wednesday sought a reply from the state government and police on the arrangements they were making to rein in noisy pubs and unruly mobs in this season which was caught between celebrations on one hand and Omicron fears on the other. When the matter reached hearing on Thursday, T Srikanth Reddy, counsel for the home department, placed before the judge an official communication sent by the Hyderabad police commissioner that described the elaborate arrangements made by cops. Stating that priority must be given to precautions than to pubs and celebrations, the judge said the arrangements made by police at pubs and various other places were seemingly good. Justice Vijaysen Reddy was hearing a petition filed by Suryadevara Venkata Ramana of Jubilee Hills Residents Association who complained against the loud noises coming from the pubs in residential areas and the inaction of the authorities in controlling them. “We made it clear that noise should not come out of the pubs during the permitted hours. If these pubs equip themselves with acoustic equipment that prevents sound from going out of the pub, then it is ok”, said Srikanth. Petitioner’s counsel PS Rajasekhar wanted the court to direct the state to keep towing vehicles at all pubs where the vehicles parked irregularly can be towed away. Designated drivers should be kept ready to shift the drunk customers instead of allowing them to drive dangerously, he said. The state allowing people to drink till 1 am too has its own problems. Moreover, all arrangements should not be confined to New Year’s day alone. They must be there permanently so that the lives of residents of Jubilee Hills areas witness some relief from the unbearable sounds from the neighboring pubs, he said.  Srikanth reminded the court that the petitioner’s grievance was against the state excise department which was not made a party to this case. The judge asked the petitioner to make excise department a respondent to the plea. “The efforts of police are good. Let us appreciate this first and examine the implementation later,” the judge said and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-okay-with-police-steps-for-noisy-pubs/articleshow/88602027.cms||---

He said that in Telangana, the textile sector employs, directly or indirectly, over 1 crore people.Prakash pointed out that even prices of raw material such as cotton, yarn, fabric, dyes and packaging material, among others, have spiked over the last six months by around 30-40% and any added tax burden will only make the business as well as manufacturing activity unsustainable and even hit demand.

He attended the meeting along with party colleagues Aroop Biswas, Jyotipriya Mullick and Sujit Bose at Banerjee’s residence on Thursday.Sabyasachi, a Trinamool councillor from ward 31, became the first Bidhannagar mayor before he resigned in July 2019 to join BJP ahead of the assembly polls held earlier this year. He returned to Trinamool after he lost the polls to Trinamool’s Sujit Bose.Back in Trinamool, Sabyasachi has got the ticket from the same ward. “I got my leader’s (Banerjee) blessings. She has placed trust in me again. I will seek people’s blessings,” he told TOI.Krishna was sworn in as mayor following Sabyasachi’s resignation in 2019. She too is contesting the election from her home ward 29. “I am a party worker. My party has chosen me to contest as a candidate for the third time. I am grateful to my party, to chief minister Banerjee, to Abhishek Banerjee, Subrata Bakshi and Firhad Hakim,” she said.Among others, Trinamool old guards Anita Mondal, Tulshi Sinha Roy, Minu Das Chakraborty and Chameli Naskar, who have been councillors since 2000, have got poll tickets. As many as 18 of the 41 candidates in the fray are women, constituting 44% of the total candidature.Fresh faces among the women include former deputy mayor Tapas Chatterjee’s daughter Aratrika Bhattacharya. Aratrika is the candidate from Chatterjee’s home ward 3. Alo Das Dutta, wife of former councillor Nirmal Dutta, is contesting from ward 28. The Trinamool Bidhannagar candidate list has a few dropouts as well. Sailen Manna’s daughter Nilanjana, who was ward 33 councillor, had to make way for former mayor-in-council member Banibrata Banerjee after his ward 28 became reserved for ST.In Siliguri, Trinamool fielded former minister Gautam Deb and 16 women candidates of the total 47. In Chandernagore, a Trinamool stronghold since 2010, the party chose to field 14 women out of total 33 candidates (42%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sabyasachi-krishna-get-civic-poll-tickets-for-bidhannagar/articleshow/88602040.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Edu min’s ‘Abol Tabol’ slight after guv’s VC pick jibe||Kolkata: The Bengal governor has questioned the appointments of vice-chancellors to as many as 24 state universities — including Calcutta, Presidency and Jadavpur universities — putting on record that these were made without approval of the chancellor, who happens to be the legal authority. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also warned he would “take action” unless the appointments were “recalled soon”. “These are ex-facie in defiance of specific orders or without approval by chancellor, the appointing authority,” he tweeted on Thursday.Bengal education minister Bratya Basu didn’t enter into a debate with Dhankhar but recalled a poem in Sukumar Ray’s ‘Abol Tabol’ (The weird and the absurd) — “Saat German, Jagai eka, tobuo Jagai lore” — in response to the governor’s appointments jibe. Trinamool senior and MP Saugata Roy said all appointments were “in order” and added that efforts were on to remove Dhankhar from the governor’s post. Higher education department sources cited two laws and rules — The West Bengal University Laws (Amendment) Act, 2011, The West Bengal Universities and Colleges (Administration and Regulation) Act, 2017, and the West Bengal Universities Rules, 2019 — based on which the appointments were made. They said that for each and every case, files were sent to Raj Bhavan. State university officials pointed out that the 2011 Act provides that “the chancellor in consultation with the minister may appoint a person” to VC’s post. But there were instances when the chancellor was found “sitting on” the minister’s proposals for appointment or service extension of a vice-chancellor. One such “bottleneck” over VC appointment to Darjeeling Hill University had come up during the CM’s recent administrative meeting in north Bengal.Officials hinted that the state government might have made use of the provisions under the Acts and rules to remove “bottlenecks”. For instance, Section 20 of the 2017Act provides that “the state government shall have the power to relax any of the provisions of this Act or any rule, notification, order, schemes or by-laws made under this Act”.Taking the cue, the 2019 rules provide that “the state government shall reserve its right to interpret any of the provisions of these rules as and when considered necessary”.Legal experts pointed out that these Acts and rules, which have got the governor’s assent before implementation, gave abundant powers to the government to “interpret and implement” decisions even where rules were silent. Such provisions were also there in the state university Act promulgated by the Left Front regime in 1981 that gave powers to the government to “remove difficulties”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/edu-mins-abol-tabol-slight-after-guvs-vc-pick-jibe/articleshow/88602041.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Murshidabad nawab’s palace set to get a heritage hotel makeover||Kolkata/Berhampore: Taking its cue from the popularity of palaces in Rajasthan, the tourism department in Bengal has embarked on an ambitious plan to transform Murshidabad’s Wasif Manzil — an impressive edifice close to Hazarduari — into a 40-room heritage hotel.Once the stately home of Nawab Wasif Ali Mirza Khan, the riverside property sprawling over five acres on the Nizamat Fort campus in Berhampore currently houses a museum run by the Archaeological Survey of India. If the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation has its way, the property will be leased out for 10 years to run a hotel. Officials also plan to introduce a water taxi service.Wasif Manzil will be Murshidabad’s second heritage hotel after Cossimbazar Rajbari, which is a private initiative. The palace boasts a pediment with the nawab’s emblem and has fascinating corner turrets. A fountain and manicured gardens lead to an imposing Norman archway with iron doors. Inside, marble statues stand like sentinels guarding the rich heritage.A tourism department official said they expected the grand architecture of Wasif Manzil to be a big draw for both domestic and international travellers. “India’s rich history has always been a crowd magnet. Palaces and havelis when turned into heritage accommodations generate a fair amount of revenue too. We are sanguine Wasif Manzil, which is not far from Hazarduari, will increase tourist footfall to Murshidabad,” he said. According to the official, the plan as of now is to carry out some restoration work at Wasif Manzil before handing it over. “Extra care will be taken to preserve the legacy of the place. The proposed heritage hotel will have at least 40 rooms once ready,” he added. The state government plans to finalise a lease deal with interested parties by the current financial year. The hotel will be opened to visitors after restoration work is completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/murshidabad-nawabs-palace-set-to-get-a-heritage-hotel-makeover/articleshow/88602042.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal’s highest Covid spike in 6 months, five new Omicron cases||KOLKATA: Bengal recorded 2,128 new Covid cases in the last 24-hour period on Thursday and five Omicron confirmations, on a day the fresh infection count doubled for the second day straight, with Kolkata alone racking up more than half that figure with 1,090 new cases, even as the state government asked hospitals to remain vigilant and on high alert for the next week or so. The state’s daily case count had last seen such levels six months ago (in June), during the raging second wave. The state’s active “O-count” is now 15. All five latest additions have foreign travel history, with at least four of them — including a five-year-old girl now at AMRI Hospital Mukundapur — coming from London. “We received genome-sequencing reports of six international travellers, of whom five are Omicron-positive,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director, health services, urging everyone to be on their best Covid-appropriate behaviour. Health officials said five of the currently known 16 (cumulative) Omicron infections had no travel history, which suggested community transmission. “Covid cases have been doubling every day for the last few days,” said a senior official in a message to hospitals. “Particularly in Kolkata, we found some evidence suggesting local transmission of Omicron. Five of them, from different areas, were found Omicron-positive but did not have any travel or contact history.” 'We fear Cov case load to be higher than that of 2nd wave'Overall, the rate of rise in new infections is on an upward curve. Bengal's 2,021 new cases comes after the previous day's 1,089; Kolkata's new case-count shows a similar rise, with the last 24-hour count of 1,090 coming after the previous day's count of 540. The daily case count may eventually reach "30,000 to 35,000", says Thursday's message. "The first wave had a slow rise and peaked in October 2020, reaching around 4,100 cases per day. In the second wave, the rise was rapid, when we had about 22,000 cases a day during the peak. But this time, we apprehend the case load to be even higher than that of the second wave." In a meeting convened by Swasthya Bhawan on Thursday, hospitals were asked to swing back to Covid-19 counter-action: scaling up beds, identifying more safe homes, reactivating admissions and telemedicine cells, gearing up with essential supplies like medicines, PPEs and manpower and hiking testing. Saumitra Mohan, secretary, state family and welfare department, said at the meeting that the state already had "infrastructure in place, including CCU, HDU and general beds. All we need to do is to restore all the facilities that we had during the peak of the second wave and activate other facilities developed later in anticipation of the third wave, including paediatric Covid facilities." Chakarborty the director of health services (DHS), raised a concern about the likely massive number of daily caseload and its repercussions on the healthcare system and apprehended mortality. "The DHS told us to scale up Covid beds and other facilities to full capacity within the next two weeks while ensuring that the newly developed paediatric facilities were completely functional. He added that we all might need to work hard for two months hoping that the surge would come to an end by March-April," said the principal of a medical college. The DHS pointed out the rising positivity graph and directed all labs to increase testing mostly using the RT-PCR method by conducting the test both on OPD and emergency patients in government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/states-highest-covid-spike-in-6-months-5-new-o-cases/articleshow/88602043.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Some pvt hosps add Cov beds, others plan extension; doctors say cases mostly mild||Kolkata: A surge in Covid admissions since the beginning of the week has left several private hospitals worried and made them add Covid beds or consider extending their existing units. Even though the rise is not yet very sharp, it has come after almost three months and at a time when the number of non-Covid patients is high across hospitals. But the silver lining so far, hospitals say, is that cases are mostly mild and patients are getting discharged quickly.Woodlands Hospital has added 21 beds to its Covid unit on Wednesday, taking its capacity to 49. There has been an increase in Covid admissions, said CEO & managing director Rupali Basu. “We are seeing a definite increase in the number of patients admitted with Covid. A week ago, the number was seven-eight but now we have 24 patients admitted,” said Basu.She added, “Covid positivity rate is also on the rise. Looking at the trend, we have increased our Covid beds to 49 now, having added 21 beds. We are keeping a close watch on the situation.” Belle Vue Clinic added more Covid beds on Thursday to raise its Covid unit capacity to 75, including 15 for critical care and 5 Omicron beds. The hospital admitted 19 patients on Wednesday — the highest in at least three months.“We are adding beds since the number of admissions is on the rise. Thirty patients are admitted with us now while we will admit 19 more by Thursday night. If necessary, we will add more beds,” said Belle Vue CEO, P Tondon.Peerless Hospital has seen more than a dozen new Covid admissions in the last three days. Since October, Peerless had more than two-three patients a day. “It had dropped further till last week. But there is a surge now and we are considering the possibility of extending the Covid unit. It may not happen immediately since we have a large number of non-Covid patients. We usually conduct planned surgeries and procedures at this time of the year. But Covid remains a priority,” said Peerless Hospital CEO, Sudipta Mitra. The hospital has 31 Covid patients in its 48-bed ward.RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), too, has seen a marginal rise in the number of patients. It has admitted 18 patients in its 47-bed Covid unit. “If the numbers continue to rise, we will increase the beds. Since the infrastructure is already set up, we can add more beds in a very short period of time,” said RTIICS zonal head, R Venkatesh.Medica Superspecialty Hospital, however, is yet to witness a surge. It now has 36 patents admitted in its 47-bed ward. “We are keeping a watch on the situation and will not be adding Covid beds immediately,” said chairperson, Alok Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-pvt-hosps-add-cov-beds-others-plan-extension-doctors-say-cases-mostly-mild/articleshow/88602046.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Six boroughs in central and north Kolkata record spurt in Covid-19 cases||KOLKATA: Neighbourhoods in north and central Kolkata have reported a spike in Covid cases in the past few days, prompting Kolkata Municipal Corporation to reach out to the residents of these localities and asking them to take fresh guard and prevent the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. According to a KMC health department official, civic elections and festive crowds may have fuelled the spike in Covid cases. While half of the Omicron cases have come from abroad, there are an equal number of cases that have been detected among the patients with no foreign travel history. According to the KMC health department, Tollygunge, Anwar Shah Road, Lake Gardens, Golf Green, Garia, Jadavpur and the areas located off EM Bypass have been recording higher number of Covid cases compared to north and central Kolkata neighbourhoods till a month ago while the trend appears to have shifted in December with localities like Rajballavpara, APC Roy Road, Hatibagan, Jorabagan, Girish Park, Burrabazar, Taltala, College Street, Sealdah, Elliot Road recording higher numbers of Covid cases. TimesViewEvery neighbourhood must take fresh guard against the upsurge in cases. There is no need for panic; what is needed is common sense. Congregations should be avoided and neighbourhood groceries and stores should look at going back to last year's regulations and queues.Civic health officials said they are concerned about the six boroughs where the department has noticed a spurt in Covid cases. The KMC Covid combat team has identified major markets in these localities, where large gatherings take place, and said they may recommend micro-containment zones in some of these neighbourhoods to prevent Covid from spreading like wildfire. Already, Covid cases in Kolkata have increased from 380 on Tuesday to 540 on Wednesday and 1,090 on Thursday. Mayor Firhad Hakim has asked the police and the KMC health department borough officials to conduct regular awareness drives at major markets, requesting the shoppers to wear masks. “We have asked the traders in all municipal markets to wear masks and discouraged selling goods to the customers who are not wearing masks,” said a KMC health department official. Similarly, the KMC medical officers at the urban primary health centres have been asked to expedite testing — both rapid antigen and RT-PCR in the areas where the Covid numbers are witnessing a spurt. A KMC medical officer posted in Jadavpur-Tollygunge belt on Thursday said the number of citizens coming for RT-PCR test is going up. KMC councillors have also started keeping a watch on their respective wards. Bappaditya Dasgupta, a Trinamool Congress councillor representing Baisnabghata—Patuli belt, said, “In my ward the number of Covid” patients stood at 40 in the past one month. I am worried to hear that seven persons tested positive on a single day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/six-boroughs-in-central-and-n-kol-record-spurt-in-cases/articleshow/88602047.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Kolkata||West Bengal bans direct UK flight from January 3||KOLKATA: The state government on Thursday wrote to the civil aviation ministry, announcing its decision to temporarily suspend the direct flight between Kolkata and London from January 3 and Covid tests for all incoming passengers in view of the rising Omicron cases globally as well as in India. The last flight from London to touch down in Kolkata before the ban will be on Sunday, January 2. Also till now, only passengers arriving from the UK that was categorized as an ‘at risk’ country due to the high prevalence of Omicron cases as notified by the Union health ministry were required to undergo Covid test on arrival. Additional chief secretary BP Gopalika wrote to Union civil aviation secretary Rajiv Bansal to convey the curb on the once-a-week Air India flight that operates between Kolkata airport and Heathrow and the testing protocol for international flyers. The letter was dispatched hours after chief minister Mamata Banerjee had sounded an alarm over the high incidence of Omicron cases among in-bound flyers and an emergency meeting that followed in the state secretariat on the issue. Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi was present at the meeting. In Kolkata, five of the 10 Omicron cases that were tested in the state had returned from overseas. In the last flight from the UK that arrived on Boxing Day, four persons tested positive to Covid. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing to check if they had contracted the Omicron variant. “I love the UK. But it is being seen that a majority of Omicron cases are coming from passengers from the UK flight. Omicron is spreading rapidly and it is mostly spreading through international flights. Lets see what the civil aviation ministry does now,” the CM remarked in Gangasagar before boarding a helicopter to Kolkata. The ban decision has left the airline and travel agents in a spot. With all flights in January booked to near capacity, it will be a herculean task to accommodate them in UK-bound flights departing from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Amritsar and Ahmedabad. “It will be a logistical nightmare,” said an AI official. The letter to the civil aviation ministry also announced that all international passengers from non-at-risk countries would have to also undergo Covid tests. While 90% will take the Rapid Antigen Test, the rest will have to undergo Rapid PCR or RT-PCR. All passengers have to mandatorily pre-book the test before boarding to reduce waiting time on arrival which the airlines must ensure prior to allowing the boarding. Following the announcement, Pattabhi said RAT kits were being procured to comply with the government order. “We will collect samples when passengers queue up for immigration and have the result ready by the time they clear immigration. In case there is any delay, there is seating arrangement for 350 people that we can augment further,” Pattabhi said. Travel trade industry officials said while leisure travel would stop following the curb and rising infections across the globe, those with emergency travel needs would continue to fly in through Delhi, Mumbai and other airports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-bans-direct-uk-flight-from-jan-3/articleshow/88602049.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The HC told the correctional home superintendent to appear in court in person with the jail register.Buddhadeb Bhowmick had moved the HC, alleging his father, Ranjit, had gone missing from judicial remand. Stating the jail authorities “have not proceeded according to law”, the court ordered for a report on finding Bhowmick on January 4. “It is made clear the CCTV footage of the recording of December 21 in the office of the Superintendent, Presidency Correctional Home shall be produced before court,” the HC said. “We told the court that some unforeseen incident took place with Bhowmick and the state is trying to hide it,” said advocate Srijib Chakraborty. According to the report, Ranjit was released on bail by the ACJM, Uluberia, on December 21. The bail bond was furnished before court, which directed his immediate release. The report says the accused was taken to Presidency correctional home to check if there was any pending case against him. Buddhadeb claimed he was told to visit Presidency jail on December 22 and when he arrived there, he was told Ranjit had been released the day before. Ranjit could not be traced. “Prima facie, it appears the Presidency Correctional Home officers have not proceeded as per jail code,” said the division bench of Justice Shampa Sarkar and Justice Bibhas Ranjan De.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trace-missing-undertrial-hc-to-correctional-home/articleshow/88602050.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

An IIT Kharagpur alumnus, Goyal headed the Special Task Force as its additional director-general. Gyanwant Singh, a 1993-batch officer, will now take the dual charges of CID, which he headed as the additional director-general, as well as that of the STF. Apart from Goyal, Praveen Kumar Tripathi, who is now DIG (Malda range), will return to Kolkata Police as the additional CP. Kolkata Police’s DCP (STF) Aparajita Rai will head for Kalimpong as its police superintendent and SP Kalimpong Harikrishna Pai will become the DCP (STF). Goyal, who has served in several key positions both in Kolkata Police and state police, had joined the Bengal cadre in August 1995. He had worked across Bengal, Kolkata Police, CID and recently, STF. In fact, he was in the thick of action when an STF team gunned down two Punjab gangsters in a New Town complex earlier this year. Goyal was also the director, security. In Kolkata Police, he had worked as a DCP, including DCP (Traffic), rising gradually to the post of an additional police commissioner. He has also studied public policy from a Singapore-based institute. Goyal, however, did not speak on his new appointment immediately. According to officers who have worked with Goyal, he is believed to be always on the lookout for introducing technology in policing. During his work in Kolkata Police and later, in the newly formed STF, Bengal saw the units actively adopting modern investigation tools. In the CID, too, he played a similar role. A senior officer said, “He joins Kolkata Police at a time when it is adopting more technology even for conventional policing.” Alok Rajoria, now the Malda police superintendent, will be the new DIG (Malda Range), replacing Tripathi. Sukesh Singh, who served as DIG (State Armed Police) will be the new DIG (Traffic). Y Raghuvanshi, who was SP Jalpaiguri, will be the new SP of Alipurduar instead of Bholanath Pandey. Pandey will become the new SP of Jalpaiguri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vineet-goyal-to-take-charge-as-cp-today/articleshow/88602051.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

With the Omicron threat looming, the entire Park Street-Camac Street-Shakespeare Sarani belt will be divided into seven sectors, each under a DCP and two ACPs. Feedback from drones and 11 watch towers will let cops know the situation. A joint CP will coordinate with each sector and decide on the overall pedestrian flow and an additional CP will be in charge of the zone. Sources said the movement of pedestrians will be channelized depending on the ground situation. “People can enter through one side and get out from another. We will try to stop two-way movement of pedestrians. In addition, there will be extra deployment for crossing, major eateries and churches, the planetarium and the zoo. The main police deployment was finalized on Thursday,” said an officer. Joint CP (headquarters) Subhankar Sunha Sarkar confirmed there will be 3,000 cops on the road on New Year’s Eve and New Year.

Sahitya Akademi for Basu’s play, many feel, will give the right impetus for recognizing Bengali dramaturgy as a literary work.Stalwart, like Utpal Dutta, was never considered for this award for his plays. Dramatists Badal Sircar, Manmatha Ray, Bijon Bhattacharya, Manoj Mitra and Mohit Chattopadhyay were conferred the Sangeet Natak Akademi awards as playwrights. “It’s true very few playwrights have ever been considered for Sahitya Akademi. I am very happy ,y plays have received this recognition. I think it is tougher to write plays than poetry and novels. Writing plays for me is a search for a craft,” said the education minister of Bengal. Though many talk about the dearth of original plays in Bengal in the over-crowded space of Greek play adaptations, Basu believes the number is not too meagre either. “How many are writing original Bengali novels? Ujjawal Chattopadhyay, Sekhar Sammadar, Tirthankar Chanda, Hara Bhattacharya are a few who write original plays,” he said. The recognition coincided with his 25th year of writing plays. His first work, ‘Ashalin’ (Obscene), was written in 1996, when he was 25, yet to get a job. “The subject was the limitation of language,” he said. Language is also an important part of ‘Mirjafar O Ananya Natak’. “I have used three-four different linguistic styles. Mirjafar speaks Bengali with an Urdu flavour. Miran uses the Bangal dialect. Lord Clive prefers a north Kolkata dialect, along with a Krishnagore-style Bengali. I have also used the colloquial Bengali that we all speak in,” he said. This play also stands out for Basu’s attempt to turn a traitor into a hero. “Plays have been written on Siraj-ud-Daulah but nobody wrote a play with Mirjafar as a hero,” he said. Asked why he wanted to turn the table, he said, “My last play was ‘Fyodor’, a biopic of Fyodor Dostoevsky. A favourite author, he too, selected underdogs and turned them into heroes. Perhaps, I too share this trait of wanting to make heroes out of underdogs and the misunderstood. While writing I cling on to the thought that no one in this world has ever written on this subject or will ever do so. I know it is an absurd thought but that gives me my trigger.” Basu has written 50 plays in Bengali, some of them having been translated into English and Hindi. A French translation is on its way. Varied emotions and exploring various subjects are his forte. “I wrote a play on Jinnah, ‘Antim Raat’. It has three characters including Jinnah’s daughter Dina Wadia and sister Fatima. It is about the last night Jinnah spent in Mumbai and explores everything between interpersonal relationship and the political turmoil. This play would have been read more had I written it in any other language,” he said. On Thursday morning, he spent two hours translating a play by Brecht. “There are days when I burn the midnight oil to write. I don’t have any hours for writing. I stop if I feel exhausted after having written for over an hour or so.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bratya-gets-sahitya-akademi-for-plays-1st-for-bengal-in-54-years-in-this-genre/articleshow/88602055.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The patient has recovered post surgery and rehabilitation therapy.Sangay Pemo had been admitted to an alarming fall in oxygen saturation. At Medica Superspeciality Hospital, doctors detected chronic pulmonary embolism leading to low oxygen saturation even at rest. She had multiple clots in the pulmonary artery, which resulted in blockage of blood circulation. Doctors conducted pulmonary endarterectomy, involving a ‘heart-lung bypass’ machine, to remove clots.“It was a difficult task. But we discharged her after 10 days with significant improvement in exercise and mobility. She is now fine,” said ECMO physician Arpan Chakraborty.Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar, senior vice-chairman of the hospital, said, “Removal of pulmonary artery clots deep in the lungs is high-risk procedure. With proper planning, the patient got through this complicated situation.” Led by Sarkar, others in the team included doctors Dipanjan Chatterjee, Mrinal Bandhu and Chakraborty, apart from technicians and nurses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bhutan-woman-home-after-open-heart-op-in-kol/articleshow/88602057.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 500 pulled up in 2 days for flouting mask rule||KOLKATA: Over 500 people were prosecuted in the past two days for not wearing masks. On Thursday, 82 fresh prosecutions took place. Lalbazar has decided to go for an enhanced mask-up drive in enclosed areas, like Alipore zoo, Rabindra Sadan premises and Allen Park, where chances of crowding are higher. Police sources said a decision on the MaskUpKolkata drive will also depend on the findings of the KMC on the density of fresh cases in certain localities. The Kolkata Police stations have been asked to help KMC identify spots with high density of cases and ascertain if they fall in the vicinity of crowded spots. Localpolicemen, though, said the prosecutions were still a fraction of the April-July numbers. “Now that numbers are steadily increasing, we need to step up prosecutions. But with everything open, and no barricading around markets and malls, this may be difficult,” said an officer. According to police sources, even in the first week of September, Kolkata Police prosecuted 1,842 people for not wearing masks properly — 80% of those checks have taken place outside major markets and malls, which are now not under cop surveillance. The total number of prosecutions can rise only when raids on local markets get included, they said. “We found that even till July, people at least had masks near their chins. But at the beginning of August, we found them missing completely. We have, till now, targeted only a few places where there are regular aberrations,” said an officer. A visit to the city’s main markets showed that prosecutions alone are not enough to instil discipline. “The compliance level, especially among the fully vaccinated, is far below expectation. It seems no one wants to heed warnings from experts,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/500-pulled-up-in-2-days-for-flouting-mask-rule/articleshow/88602058.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Due to Covid protocols, only 50 of the 400-odd members were present during the celebration on Monday.The District was founded on December 27, 1727, a decade after the Modern Freemasonry Movement was established in England. The District of Bengal was the first to be formed outside of England by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), which is headed by the Duke of Kent. Currently, there are 32 District Lodges established between Egypt and China.Since 1863, the Freemasons began inducting Indian Masons, starting with P C Dutt. The District Lodge has since had several illustrious members, including W C Bonnerji, U N Brahmachari, and Narendranath Dutta — Swami Vivekananda.The celebration of the Lodge’s first Founder’s Day was the brainchild of District grand master (DGM) Devendra Lal Thapar and District grand secretary (DGS) Gyanendra Narain Singh. “Our goal is to continue annual celebrations and make Foundation Day an international event by its 300th year, six years from now,” said Singh.Former district grand secretary Sudip Dutta conceded celebrating the occasion had not occurred to him before and lauded Singh for taking the initiative. A re-dedication service was held at the Masonic Temple, during which Masons re-dedicated themselves to the three main tenets of the movement — fraternity, charity and truth. The day was also marked by acts of benevolence, including providing lunch for the 120 residents of the Little Sisters of the Poor home for the aged, procuring an industrial grinder for the home’s kitchen, and providing food for 500 needy people on the home’s premises. The celebrations culminated with a ‘ladies’ night’, one of the few occasions in which women take part in Masonic activities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/294-year-old-masonic-chapter-in-bengal-celebrates-its-first-ever-foundation-day/articleshow/88602060.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Some high-rises cancel Dec 31 bash, some scale down events||Kolkata: Several residents’ associations have sent out alerts to their residents, requesting all to practise caution over the New Year weekend to safeguard themselves and families from the virus. Most have dropped their year-end party plans and many have started setting up infrastructure to isolate and offer treatment to the infected. “It’s a conscious decision to scale down celebrations in the wake of rising cases and alert for a third wave. We had put up a Christmas tree and lit up our complex. ‘Santa Claus’ arrived to entertain the children. But a lot has changed in the past few days and we are not having any celebration on 31st,” said Indranil Chowdhury, secretary of Silver Spring Housing complex. “We are thinking of resuming some restrictions.” South City residents’ association had lined up a New Year bash, which they scrapped on Thursday. “We have dropped the party plans but since many have already bought food coupons, we will have food on the lawn. But we are keeping staggered timings are organising it in a large open area to avoid crowding,” said Manoj Gupta, secretary of the residents’ organisation.A complex in Kestopur has also cancelled the celebrations, calling for caution even for smaller gatherings. “We have 32 apartments in our complex and every year, there is a party on New Year’s Eve. Last year, we did not even think of organising it but this year, we had started preparing for it. But with the cases rising, we decided to cancel the celebrations,” said Vikas Pachisia, a resident of Sangam Complex in Kestopur.At Urbana, residents had plans for a musical evening and a bash on a 5-acre area that can accommodate more than 600 people. Association officials were still at a meeting till late on Thursday, discussing whether to cancel the event or go ahead with it, albeit with more restrictions. “We were allowing only vaccinated residents and performers at the event. But seeing the rising cases in the city, we are in doubt now,” said Debjani Mukherjee, director, Urbana Facility Management.Large parts of New Town that get decked up during this time of the year with celebrations across complexes are also scaling down events. “It is natural for people to be in a mood for revelry. But we have asked our members not to be complacent and let the guard down as Covid cases are rising again. A small mistake can prove dear,” said Samir Gupta, secretary of New Town Citizens’ Welfare Fraternity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/some-high-rises-cancel-dec-31-bash-some-scale-down-events/articleshow/88602063.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Demand falls, organisers slash NY party rates||Kolkata: Several organisers have slashed prices to invitations to some of the most sought after New Year’s Eve parties in the city this year due to the sudden dip in demand after news of a surge in Covid-19 cases started coming in. Many others are contemplating offering complimentary drinks and snacks. Several families and groups have decided to cancel their plans to party outside to avoid crowds and made plans with friends and families indoors leading to a dip in demand for invitations to the parties. Organisers are even willing to provide a discount of 30 to 40 percent as all the arrangements are done and payments made to artists, musicians, DJs and caterers and for the venue. Several bars in central and south Kolkata have also decided not to opt for the government’s offer to stay open till 3am against a fee. “We were getting lots of queries till Christmas, but suddenly people cancelled their plans. We are staring at huge losses so we have decided to give a good discount to recover some of our money,” said Saket Bansal, a party organiser in a Rajarhat resort.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/demand-falls-organisers-slash-ny-party-rates/articleshow/88602066.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||More Kolkata clubs call off New Year parties amid Covid case surge||KOLKATA: A day after Tolly Club, RCGC and Calcutta Swimming Club cancelled their New Year celebrations, more social clubs in the city called off their year-end parties on Thursday, given the spiralling Covid cases and the spread of the Omicron variant. “We are keeping the year-end celebration on hold in view of the rising Covid cases,” said Calcutta Club CEO Somnath Mukherjee. Echoing him, Bengal Club president Ambarish Dasgupta said, “This morning, we decided not to have any 31st event this year. On Friday, it will be a usual club day at Bengal Club.” CCFC on Thursday issued a notice: “We regret to inform you that the club committee has decided to call off tomorrow’s event… we understand the disappointment of the members and the financial impact of this cancellation but it would have been too high a risk to expose our members, their families and our staff to such a large gathering… members who have already collected passes will be refunded.” Members of all clubs were looking forward to the year-end bash, but even Saturday Club announced, “Due to the rise in the Covid and Omicron cases in the past few days, the club has taken a deliberate and conscious decision … to cancel the New Year’s Eve party on 31st December 2021.” Some committee members of both these clubs argued in favour of their open-air 31st events, pointing at their sprawling grounds, but a majority vetoed against the plea. A CCFC office-bearer said, “It’s so sad the Covid situation had to be grave just when everything seemed congenial to ushering in the New Year like we did in pre-pandemic times.” Lake Club, too, cancelled. Subrata Guha, general secretary, Lake Club, said, “We are putting off the New Year bash because people’s safety comes first.”  But Calcutta Rowing Club is going ahead with their event. Club secretary Chandan Roychoudhury said, “Ours will be an extremely low-footfall event in the open grounds and Covid rules will be followed to the hilt.” Restrictions might be continued even after the 31st. Calcutta Swimming Club is not sure whether they would hold the sports events lined up in January or not. Naresh Goyal, president, CSC, also a doctor attached to Belle Vue Clinic, said, “It’s clear there’s a renewed surge of Covid cases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/more-clubs-call-off-new-year-parties-amid-covid-case-surge/articleshow/88602067.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Kolkata||KIFF opening to go virtual||Kolkata: Keeping rising Covid-19 cases in mind, the elaborate physical inauguration ceremony of the 27th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival has been cancelled. The programme was to be held at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on January 7. The Satyajit Ray centenary tribute programme titled ‘Maharaja Tomare Selam’ too has been cancelled. As things stand now, the inaugural ceremony will be a virtual one. In all likelihood, the virtual inauguration will follow last year’s format. Maintaining social distance, the inaugural ceremony of the 26th KIFF had been held at the Nabanna Sabhaghar. KIFF chairperson Raj Chakraborty told TOI that a decision was taken on Wednesday night to drop the physical edition of the inaugural ceremony at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. “We are going ahead with all other plans of the festival. We will take all our decisions keeping an eye on the forthcoming government guidelines. We will follow all the instructions to ensure that health protocols are followed,” he said. The cancellation of the inauguration means the Ray tribute programme being kept on hold. This was a 10-minute-programme to be directed by Chakraborty himself. Plans were afoot to get all the big names from Bengal’s music and television industry to pay homage to the legend. “The likes of Ustad Rashid Khan, Indranil Sen, Babul Supriyo, Rupankar Bagchi, Lopamudra Mitra and Jeet Gannguly were supposed to perform at this event. But that programme now stands cancelled. We had written the script and Anindya Chattopadhyay was fine-tuning it,” Chakraborty. In all likelihood, the virtual inauguration of 27th KIFF will follow the same format as that of last year’s.  Meanwhile, KIFF has already announced the list of the selected films that will be screened between January 8 and 14, 2022. Two films on Netaji – Piyush Bose’s ‘Subhas Chandra’ and Shyam Benegal’s ‘Netaji Subhas Chadra Bose: The Forgotten Hero’ - will be screened in a special segment titled 75 Years of Indian Independence. ‘Madhumati’, ‘Sagina Mahato’ and ‘Mughal-E-Azam’ will be screened as a tribute to Dilip Kumar. ‘Uttara’, ‘Grihajuddha’ and ‘Anwar Ka Ajab Kissa’ will have screenings as Buddhadev Dasgupta’s tribute. Jean-Paul Godard’s ‘Pierrot Le Fou’ and Peter Stephen and Paul Brook’s ‘The Mahabharata’ will pay the tribute to Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Claude Carrier respectively. The Special Screening section has programmed Suman Mukhopadhyay’s ‘Nazarband’, Saibal Mitra’s ‘A Holy Conspiracy’ starring Soumitra Chatterjee and Naseeruddin Shah, Goutam Ghose’s pandemic documentary titled ‘Samayer Shritimala’ (Memories Of Time) and Bratya Basu’s ‘Dictionary’. There will be screening of six films from Finland – which is the focus country of the festival. They are Zaida Bergroth’s ‘Tove’, Aki Kaurismaki’s ‘Toivon Tuolla Puolen’ (The Other Side Of Hope) and ‘Le Havre’, Pamela Tola’s ‘Terasleidt’ (Ladies Of Steel), Jenni Toivoniemi’s ‘Seurapeli’ (Games People Play) and Teemu Nikki’s ‘Sokea Mies Joka Ei Halunnut Nahda Titanicia’ (A Blind Man Who Did Not Want To See The Titanic).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kiff-opening-to-go-virtual/articleshow/88602070.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

A meeting with district collectors was held in this regard. State Election Commissioner Basant Pratap Singh discussed with all the collectors and district election officers through video conferencing on the cancellation of the election process of three-tier panchayats and the annual revision of photo voter list of panchayats on the basis of the reference date of January 1, 2022 on Wednesday. Singh said that revision work should be done compulsorily within the prescribed time limit. Withdrawal of the ordinance by the Madhya Pradesh government has affected the status of delimitation and reservation of three-tier panchayats. The status of three-tier panchayats will be effective as prior to November 21, 2021. According to the present limit of Gram Panchayats, a new voter-list has to be prepared. Due to the effect of delimitation, the present electoral roll has become ineffective. The boundaries of Gram Panchayat and their wards, Janpad Panchayat and Zilla Panchayat and their constituencies have also come into existence as per the existing situation before November 21, 2021. The position of reservation of places / seats has also become effective accordingly, but it will be necessary to follow the order of the Supreme Court in this regard. In these circumstances, it was not lawful to continue with the election process as prevalent earlier. That is why the programme of Panchayat general election issued on December 4, 2021 and all the election related proceedings taken in pursuance thereof have been cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/annual-revision-of-voter-list-soon-across-the-state/articleshow/88602097.cms||---

We will show the change.” The truck union has been protesting for revival of truck unions for more than 25 days. They have been blocking roads and highways, causing major inconvenience to Mohali residents. District vice-president of the union, Amandeep Singh said, “Today, AAP chief Arvind Kajriwal came to meet us and he has assured justice for truck unions.

---||Vijayawada||Crime up 18% in Krishna but policing ahead of other dists||Vijayawada: Crimes in Krishna district went up by 18 per cent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Crimes under major heads witnessed an uptick during the year. Liquor smuggling and gambling cases dominated the crime statistics. Though the number of crimes increased, Krishna district police achieved best rank in many performance indicators. Crime detections, property recovery and chargesheet filing increased substantially putting the district police on top among other districts in the state. SP Siddharth Kaushal attributed the rise in crime numbers to the performance of police personnel. He said it was because of the accessibility of police to public that a greater number of cases were registered. The district unit, especially the SHOs in areas along the Telangana border, worked hard to curb illegal liquor smuggling. Kaushal observed that the number of liquor smuggling cases is on the decline in many district because of the price cuts, but in Krishna district, the number of cases went up from 5,253 in 2020 to 5,420 in 2021. “This shows the effective enforcement work done by Krishna police in curbing illegal liquor. We have also curbed illicit liquor brewing in an effective manner and it was reflected in the number of cases going up from 764 to 1,026.” Gambling cases are the highest contributors to crime in Krishna district. During 2021, 10,818 cases were booked against 12,737 people. The number of gambling cases registered in 2020 stood at 9,671. Property offences rose from 497 in 2020 to 702 in 2021. However, Krishna police detected 632 cases and 92 per cent of the stolen property was recovered. Kaushal termed it an outstanding achievement by the district unit. Crimes against women also witnessed a sharp rise in Krishna district from 1,229 in 2020 to 1,651 in 2021. Kaushal said the increase in crimes against women could be attributed to the effective outreach programmes through Spandana and the Disha mobile application. In other performance indicators, the chargesheeting of cases was bettered by 66 per cent and conviction rate increased from 75 per cent to 77 per cent. The average time taken to complete investigation has come down from 68 to 34 days, improving performance by 100 per cent. The measures taken for prevention of crimes such as binding over of persons with past history, opening of history sheets and beat patrolling have gone up by 64 per cent, 114 per cent and 37 per cent respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/crime-up-18-in-krishna-but-policing-ahead-of-other-dists/articleshow/88598914.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The global benchmark will be discarded for new contracts from December 2021 at the behest of international regulators because of its susceptibility to manipulation and the risks its overuse poses during a crisis. In a statement issued here on Thursday, SBI said that it has already started offering ARR (alternate reference rates) -based products to customers through its domestic and foreign branches. The country’s largest bank has also started knowledge-sharing sessions to increase awareness of the new product among corporate customers. SBI was among the first banks to sign the global protocols in December 2020 and has already demonstrated its preparedness by executing transactions using alternate benchmarks like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for large borrowers in international markets, like Indian Oil. Under the Libor transition process, from January 1, 2022, all new transactions will be referenced to the new benchmark rates as directed by the RBI and global banking regulators. Besides SOFR, Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate (SONIA) is another popular alternative used by lenders. “Libor transition is a significant financial event for international financial markets. As the country’s largest bank, SBI has been assiduously tracking global developments in the Libor space to align with best practices and has proactively modified its systems and processes to embrace the change from Libor to ARR. Our readiness will assist the smooth transition in embracing ARR mechanism in the Indian banking industry at large,” said SBI MD Ashwini Kumar Tewari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-adopts-new-benchmark-rate-drops-decades-old-libor/articleshow/88600262.cms||---

The board also appointed a search committee comprising directors to evaluate candidates for the top position at the bank. Shares of the bank fell nearly 10% on Thursday after it informed the exchanges that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had approved the appointment of interim MD & CEO Rajeev Ahuja for only three months with effect from December 25 or until the appointment of a regular MD & CEO, whichever is earlier. Last weekend, the RBI had appointed Yogesh Dayal as an additional director on the board of the bank, a move which was immediately followed by the bank’s MD & CEO Vishwavir Ahuja proceeding on medical leave. In an investor call on Sunday, RBL Bank said that the appointment of Ahuja — part of the existing management team — as interim CEO was a measure of the RBI’s confidence in the bank. In an exchange notification, the bank said that the search committee will comprise the chairman of the nomination & remuneration committee, two members of the board and one external expert to identify and evaluate candidates for the position of MD & CEO — both from within and outside the bank. According to sources, the bank had been dragging its feet in the search process although there were only six months left for Vishwavir Ahuja to complete his term.

---||Business||Deadline relief: Bank KYC to GST returns||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Authorities have extended a raft of deadlines, citing the uncertainty triggered by the new variant of Covid. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has extended by three months until March 2022 its restriction on banks and finance companies freezing accounts of customers for want of KYC (know your customer) -compliant norms. The RBI said it was extending this relaxation due to the prevalent uncertainty on account of the Omicron variant. In May 2021, the RBI had informed banks and other regulated entities that, in respect of the customer accounts where periodic updation of KYC is due and pending as on date, no restrictions on operations of such account shall be imposed till December 31, 2021 for this reason alone. The exception was for an action warranted under instructions of any regulator/enforcement agency/court of law. The relaxation was granted after several customers complained that they were being forced to visit the branch amid the second wave under threat of their accounts being frozen. Banks had said that they had no choice as the law required them to periodically update records with fresh identity and address proof. The relaxation is timely as industry officials said that there was a likelihood of bunching up of action as, at any given point, there are hundreds of customers whose KYC validity expires. The requirement of updating KYC norms is applied by regulators globally and is part of anti-money laundering initiatives. Entities that have to follow KYC norms include finance companies, mutual funds, broking houses and depositories. The regularity with which customers have to update their records depends on how their accounts are classified by their banks. For customers in low-risk accounts, KYC needs to be updated once every 10 years. However, those classified as high-risk will need to update their account once every two years. Besides this, dormant and inactive accounts also require fresh KYC updates to unfreeze or reactivate them. While there are several options now for regulated entities to comply with KYC norms (video KYC, sharing of documents via DigiLocker), many have still not complied. The Centre has also extended the date for filing the annual GST returns by business for 2020-21 by two months till February 28. “The due date for furnishing annual return in form GSTR-9 & self-certified reconciliation statement in form GSTR-9C for the financial year 2020-21 has been extended from December 31, 2021 to February 28, 2022,” the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs said on micro blogging site Twitter. In another relief for subscribers, retirement fund body Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has said that members can now fill their nominations beyond the deadline of December 31. EPFO has not announced a new deadline but has urged members to file their nominations. There have been demands to extend the deadline for filing income tax returns beyond December 31, but the tax department has so far not relented and has been urging taxpayers to urgently file their returns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/deadline-relief-bank-kyc-to-gst-returns/articleshow/88600297.cms||---

The project, undertaken by Gujarat Education Technologies Limited with assistance from the state department of science and technology (DST), aims to use a pool of feted teachers to hold virtual classrooms for children weak in certain subjects using holograms, interactive videowalls and 3D models for interactive learning. Vinod Rao, secretary, primary and secondary education, told TOI, “Hologram tech is one of the technologies being considered to improve our learning outcomes. Other technologies being considered are 3D animation, interactive learning, gaming and teaching topics through augmented reality.” Rao said the idea behind introducing technological interventions is to push the idea of ‘edutainment’ in the learning process for children and teachers, which can accelerate learning and generate interest in children. The department plans to group students who have difficulties in learning at the taluka-level and have them take lessons from award-winning teachers from government schools, specifically those who have devised unique ways of teaching specific subjects. The lessons will be broadcast to these groups through hologram technology, virtual reality or video walls. “The process of learning will be interactive, where teachers take questions from students spread across the state. They can then explain concepts through 3D models via augmented reality,” said a senior education department official. Among the concepts being explored are digital video content with 2D/3D animation for Classes I to XII along with e-books and assessments. Special content will be developed around augmented and virtual reality for subjects such as science or maths. The department is also set to launch a learning management system for students and teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-holograms-to-boostlearning-outcomes-in-gujarat/articleshow/88600209.cms||Paul John

The company is set to end the first nine months of FY22 with a gross written premium of Rs 3,600 crore — a year-on-year increase of 65%. The company, promoted by industry veteran Kamesh Goyal and backed by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Group, had announced a fundraise of Rs 135 crore from existing investors in January 2021, valuing it at over $1.9 billion (Rs 14,000 crore). While the 12 months that followed were challenging for the non-life industry, Digit scaled up operations by increasing market share in motor insurance, expanding distribution, entering new geographies and getting into new lines of business. “This year has been a challenge for the general insurance industry because of the second wave of the pandemic, which slowed business and increased claims. This year the motor business has also been hit because of an increase in own damage claims and slowdown in sales because of the worldwide chip shortage,” said Goyal. He added that the company launched a health insurance business led by Covid products and is now present in all lines of business. Besides scaling distribution and product lines, the company has increased its claim-servicing capacity and handles 25,000-30,000 claims every month. “We have also demonstrated our ability to pay large claims by settling a fire insurance claim for Rs 140 crore within eight months of the event,” said Goyal. However, the pandemic has taken a toll on underwriting margins, albeit to a lesser extent than industry. “While most of the general insurance companies have seen their combined ratio worsen by 7-8%, our combined ratio has gone up by 3% in 2021 to around 110% as health premium proportion was lower,” said Goyal. The combined ratio compares the claims and management expenses cost to premium income. “The overall expenses ratio is coming down because of the digital capability we have built. We have a management expenses ratio of 36% of the net written premium. This is due to Digit being a relatively new company and larger share of the retail premium,” said Goyal. Many companies have a lower expense ratio because the crop insurance business, which is a wholesale business, does not add to operational costs. Goyal said that the latest round of capital-raising would be enough for the company to grow for at least another year as it now has a solvency margin of 300%, which is double the statutory requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/digit-first-unicorn-of-2021-in-top-10-private-non-life-insurers/articleshow/88600245.cms||Mayur Shetty

A soldier who had been reported injured in the Anantnag offensive on Wednesday died in hospital. Lt Gen D P Pandey, general officer commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps, and IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said at a presser in Srinagar that the number of listed terrorists active in the Valley had dropped below 200 for the first time since the terror run in J&K started. “It is also for the first time that the number of local terrorists is below 100 — at 85 or 86,” PTI quoted IGP Kumar as saying. Two of the six Jaish terrorists shot dead in Anantnag and Kulgam since Wednesday were part of the gang behind the December 13 attack on a police bus at Zewan that killed three cops and injured 14.

---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Omicron, curfew & cold wave play spoilsport||BHOPAL: Night curfew, biting cold and fear of a third wave of Covid-19 are set to dampen the New Year spirit and celebrations on the occasion may again be a low-key affair. Until very recently, it seemed that New Year eve this year will be celebrated with usual zest and zeal as the city and the country appeared to be coming out of the shadow of Covid-19. But, discovery of Omicron variant of the virus and rise in cases of Coronavirus abruptly changed the scene. Not only did it lead to reimposition of the night curfew from 11.00 pm as late as December 23 but the cold wave situation prevailing in the city further dampened the new year spirit, thereby upsetting plans of many people to welcome the new year with a bang. "It is much the same as the last year. We have seen a lot of suffering due to the pandemic this year but as the year progressed, things had improved. We had thought of going to a New Year bash in any of the hotels and have a good time but there is night curfew and of course it's very cold particularly during the night. Then, a third wave seems imminent after the discovery of Omicron. Therefore, we have decided to stay back home, enjoy the evening watching TV shows and order a cake in the evening, which my daughter will cut when it strikes 12.00 am" said Brijendra Sharma, an official with the central government. But, there are also groups, who had planned the celebrations early and are sticking to the plan. "We had decided to ride the cruise on and stay in and around the Boat Club till the New Year arrives. We are sticking to the plan, but we shall have to return home early due to the night curfew," said Vineet Gupta, who plans to go with his family and friends to Boat Club, where MP Tourism (MPT) is celebrating the occasion this year. District administration spokesperson Arun Rathore, when asked about any fresh guidelines for New Year revelers, said except for night curfew and entry to only persons having taken both the doses of vaccine in malls and parties in hotels and restaurants, there are no more restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/omicron-curfew-cold-wave-play-spoilsport/articleshow/88602112.cms||---

Even several people will bring their dinner orders through delivery boys before 11 pm as the administration may not allow anyone to roam during the night curfew. Ratnesh Sahu, a bank employee, had planned to move out with his wife to celebrate the new year. However, the night curfew has played spoilsport. Left with no other option, Ratnesh has decided to welcome 2022 by celebrating at home.“As there will be a night curfew, there is no logic in going outside. I have booked a cake and dinner through a delivery boy for home. I have asked him to drop it before 11 pm as after that it may not be possible for him to visit,” said Ratnesh. Like Ratnesh several others have decided the same. Sonam Verma, a student, has decided to call her friends at home to celebrate at home. “This year delivery boys will play a big role. I have called up other 506 friends at my home. For the celebration, I have booked a cake and dinner. I will get it with the help of a delivery boy. I will ask him to deliver well before 11 pm to avoid any problem,” said Sonam. Even delivery boys are getting a lot of queries. “People are asking me to come around 11.45 with the cake as they have planned surprise parties at home. I have told them it’s not possible due to the night curfew. I can’t move around after 11 pm in any situation as there are instructions for the night curfew. I do not want to create any issue with the police by moving after 11 pm,” said a delivery boy Raju Khan. Delivery boys have also made it clear that they should not be asked to bring anything even after 10 pm. “I can understand that several professionals who are living away from their homes want cakes near 12 to celebrate their new year. However, this is not possible this year. I will not deliver anything after 10 pm,” said delivery boy Mukesh Yadav.As per the administration, there are clear instructions not to move after 11 pm. A senior police officer without quoting his name said that there will be strict patrolling to implement the night curfew. “It is expected from the citizens to follow the instructions and they should not roam after 11 pm,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/gig-workers-in-demand-for-nys-gighome/articleshow/88602114.cms||Ramendra Singh

A recent Union government letter to all state governments calls for clamping containment and restrictive measures at the district level once – ‘test positivity of 10% or more persists in the last one week or bed occupancy of 40% or more on oxygen supported or ICU beds.’ Currently, Ujjain has the highest positivity rate in Madhya Pradesh at 3.3%. However, health ministry advisory quoted by recent Union home ministry directive suggests ‘a normative framework’. With distinct presence of the Delta variant and detection of Omicron cases in many states, there is need for greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision making, and strict and prompt containment actions at the local and district levels, based on the assessment of the situation. Based on current scientific evidence, the VOC Omicron is at least 3 times more transmissible than the Delta VOC. Besides, the Delta VOC is still present in different parts of the country, according to MoHFW. Keeping in mind the higher transmissibility of Omicron, states/Union Territories can take containment measures and restrictions even before these thresholds are reached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/lockdown-if-positivity-above-10-or-40-o2-bed-occupied/articleshow/88602119.cms||Jamal Ayub

We should be fully prepared to tackle the unfolding situation. Chouhan said there are 360 active cases in the state. Cases are coming up in all the four major cities. Gradually, it is likely to spread everywhere. Our strategy is to admit the patient to the hospital if there is no space at home. All the ministers in-charge should pay attention to this. Build a Covid Care Centre in each district. Patients in home isolation should be given advice on dos and don’ts. Disseminate the message on a wider scale. There have been 9 cases of Omicron in the state, all of whom have recovered, he said. Chouhan gave necessary instructions to the Indore collector regarding the strategy to control Corona. Instructions were given regarding activation of Covid Care Centre, fever clinic, testing etc. Controlling Corona in Indore is the most challenging task. Cases will increase rapidly because there is greater mobility of people there, so proper arrangements should be ensured, he said. The chief minister said that all other collectors should also make full preparations. Let there be no shortcoming from your side. Arrange meetings of Crisis Management Groups. So far, 94.8 percent eligible persons have got the first dose and 91 percent have been administered the second dose in the state. Vaccination should continue,he said. Chouhan said that preparations should be made for the vaccination of children in the 15 to 18 year age group. Ensure vaccination in all cities simultaneously. Vaccination is to be done from January 3 on a war footing. Ensure vaccination of 15 to 18 year old children in the form of a campaign. Get involved in this work with priority. There should be an appeal for vaccination during the launch of the campaign. It is up to the people of 60 or more years to get a booster dose.He further said that fever clinics should be started. At present, there are active cases in 20 districts. Meetings of Crisis Management Groups should be arranged in places where they have not been held so far. Information should be taken from the ministers in-charge. People should be encouraged to wear face masks. “Roko-toko” campaign should continue. Crowded places should be avoided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/stock-meds-prepare-for-battle-shivraj-tells-officials-as-cases-rise/articleshow/88602121.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Governor bound to abide by law, says opposition leader||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The war of words between governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the state government over the political pressure on Khan in university matters took an interesting turn on Thursday with the Congress-led opposition targeting the governor for his remarks that he is no longer the chancellor of universities. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the governor has no legal right to relinquish the chancellor’s role on his own while senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said the governor should first correct his mistake of appointing a person as Kannur University vice-chancellor by succumbing to the state government's pressure. "How could a governor speak against law? If it is so, what is the relevance of legislations passed by the Kerala assembly? The governor is not anyone above law or criticism. He is bound to abide by the law prevailing in the state," Satheesan told reporters. "He (Khan) is the chancellor and it's through a Bill passed in the Kerala assembly that the state governor was appointed as the chancellor. Now he says he has relinquished the post. This cannot happen because if he has to relinquish the post, it has to be passed in the assembly. So what he has done is against the law," agencies quoted Satheesan as saying. Several former vice-chancellors and legal experts also said the governor's claims that he was no longer the chancellor of state universities won’t stand legal scrutiny. 'Opposition will take legal recourse'A governor in office is not at his liberty to shrug off the chancellor's responsibility as it has been entrusted by virtue of an act passed by the state legislature, they said. Maintaining that the opposition will take legal recourse on the VC's reappointment, Satheesan said it was illegal for a governor to declare that he won't continue as a chancellor. He said it is not acceptable for him or his party and the governor was not supposed to talk like a child. Chennithala even accused the governor's office of hindering his plans to approach the Lok Ayukta on the matter by not giving details of the letter written by higher education minister R Bindhu to him recommending VC Gopinath Ravindran for a second term. Both the Congress leaders said the governor's offer to relinquish chancellorship won't do any good to the higher education sector. The party fears that a truce between the governor and the chief minister could bury all recent controversies in the higher education sector. "It's very much likely that the governor is also aware of him being held answerable for the VC appointment. He cannot deny the charges which he himself publicly raised regarding the appointment. The only solution is the removal or resignation of the vice-chancellor. For both, Khan will need the support of the state government. If he manages to find a solution, all the other charges of political interference and appointments raised by the opposition will go under the carpet," a party leader said. Meanwhile, Khan on Thursday told reporters that he was ready to hold talks with the government if it is good for universities but no one has come for discussions. He also criticized the government for not defending him against criticism by political parties and youth wing leaders. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan also told a television channel that the party did not see any sinister political agenda behind the governor's remarks. The LDF, he reiterated, has no plans to remove the governor from chancellor's post as requested by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/governor-bound-to-abide-by-law-oppn-leader/articleshow/88602124.cms||B S Anilkumar

Also, there are forces that try to divide people on caste and communal lines.“Even as Guru said man’s only caste is humanity, some are still trying to appropriate Guru,” he said. The CM also appealed to the saints of Sivagiri Mutt to grow more vocal in spreading the teachings of Guru and pass the light of wisdom to more people.“The light spread by Guru had changed a lot of minds. However, certain sections of people are now trying hard to stir up the mind of people. Guru’s teachings of brotherhood and peaceful coexistence must be practised and propagated more vigorously than ever before,” he said.“The message of Guru was to love one another. That’s why he taught people to love each other by breaking the barriers of caste and religion. That’s why he said the caste of man is humanity,” Vijayan said.Guru believed that a humane approach in thinking and actions would help improve the living condition of people. He said people should improve themselves, irrespective of their caste and creed. “But there is a deliberate attempt to project Guru as the icon of a particular section. Guru himself had denounced such attempts before a century. Guru had made it clear that he doesn’t belong to any caste or religion,” the CM Vijayan added. DMK leader Kanimozhi Karunanidhi was among those attended the inaugural ceremony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/need-better-understanding-of-gurus-teachings-says-cm/articleshow/88602126.cms||---

Samples from community clusters are now being collected on a daily basis and sent for WGS. In the case of expatriates, samples are being sent regardless of threshold cycle value (Ct) whereas samples with Ct value less than 25 are being sent for community surveillance. Ct is used to infer the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. It represents the cycle number at which the signal breaches the threshold for positivity. A lower Ct value means higher viral load. A few samples less than Ct value 30 are also being sent for WGS. “With the detection of new variants and Omicron considered to be highly infectious, it is very important that we track its presence within the community. This is crucial to take measures to check the spread of this variant. Clusters are being formed in many places and screening of samples through WGS is an important step in tracking the spread of infection,” said a health official.In a press note issued here on Thursday, health minister Veena George said that although the nature of infection is mild, Omicron is highly contagious and that spread is very crucial for the state considering the high presence of elderly citizens and those with comorbidities. Without proper care, chances of breakthrough infections and reinfections are also high,” Veena George said. Till December, the weekly positivity rate in the district has been on a downward slide. Since the first week of November, the weekly positivity rate in the district dropped from 12% to 7.4% by the fourth week of December. In December, the weekly positivity rate had dipped from 8.8% to 7.4%. Weekly cases had come down from 5,123 in the final week of November to 3,694 in the fourth week of December.However, health team members said that this situation could change drastically with the emergence of new variants. Besides, due to shortage of manpower and general dip in infectivity, there has been an evident drop in the number of testing in the government sector. Since August, testing in the government sector in the district has come down from 48% to 23% by the fourth week of December. According to officials, as restrictions come in place and Omicron variant being closely monitored, testing numbers will have to be increased significantly in the coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/community-surveillance-gets-underway-to-detect-omicron/articleshow/88602135.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The people who wish to visit the newly opened mall at Aakkulam can park their cars in allotted spots in selected bus stations and then catch a low floor AC bus to and fro. One day pass for specified fare will be available or the people can also opt for hop on hop off mode. KSRTC plans to launch this service at Peroorkada, Pappanamcode, Vikas Bhavan, Kaniyapuram and Anayara. While there will be free parking in all the bus stations, paid parking depending on the period of parking will be implemented at Anayara.With the park and ride scheme, KSRTC plans to address the menace of parking on the road and to pocket some good returns out of mad rush to the mall. A trial run was operated on Wednesday. “We had 12 passengers for our trial run. With parking being a key issue, we hope to have a good number of passengers in the coming days. Parking by road side is something which cannot be allowed,” said KSRTC MD Biju Prabhakar.With police also banning parking along the bypass road and parking facilities in the Lulu mall spilling out more often than not, people are likely to embrace the new scheme. Low floor AC buses which had been idling during lockdown are also expected to have a revival with this scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ksrtc-offers-low-floor-ac-bus-ride-to-new-mall/articleshow/88602137.cms||---

Police arrested Sinu (31) of Vellakkinar ward in Alappuzha town, the area where Ranjith also resided. Till date, eight SDPI workers were arrested in connection with the murder of Ranjith. Earlier, BJP state president K Surendran had said that BJP leader’s murder case should be handed over to NIA at the earliest as ADGP Vijay Sakhare had ‘openly admitted the helplessness of the state police’. He added that the state home department has completely surrendered before extremist forces. “Even police are accepting that the killers got help from outside Kerala. This shows the helplessness of Kerala Police,” he said, adding that the government must answer why the investigation should not be handed over to NIA after ADGP spoke the ‘truth’ publicly. Surendran alleged that it was some policemen who had leaked information about BJP leaders to Popular Front of India (PFI). He also alleged that the special branch deputy SP in Alappuzha is helping PFI. He also asked how the killers of Ranjith could leave Kerala without the help of the police. What did the police do after CCTV visuals of the killers on two-wheelers came out? The same thing happened in the murder cases of Sanjith and Nandu, he added. Surendran said that cases linked to extremist forces in state were brought to light by NIA. He said that if justice is denied to BJP, he will begin an agitation in front of the chief minister’s residence. Earlier in the day, ADGP Sakhare had told a section of the media that all murders executed by SDPI are planned and based on inter-state network. He said that they plan escape route and go into hiding outside state after committing a murder. They spend several months in hideouts in other states and do not use mobile phones, he said. The officer added that Shan’s murder was a revenge for the murder of Nandu in February. He also said that it is understood that SDPI team had planned the murder of Ranjith within a short time after the murder of Shan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ranjith-murder-one-more-held/articleshow/88599842.cms||---

Presently, she lives in a rented house near the beach. She has been selling groundnuts at the beach for more than 30 years and this is her only source of income. But the pandemic and the rough sea had other plans. As the tourists are not allowed to the beach side, the number of tourists coming to the destination has also decreased which has also affected her sales.Like Muniyamma, there are around 50 people who find their source of income by selling different products to tourists. This category also includes people from other states as well as Shankumugham natives. Presently, they are not getting any profit, but they continue to do this job hoping that the beach will open soon and the situation will change again. The beach was opened for Christmas but was later closed. Without knowing this, a large number of tourists are coming to the beach, but leaving with disappointment.“The sale went good on the day of Christmas and soon it went back to the miserable condition. We have been working here for so many years and this is our only way to survive. This problem can only be solved by reopening the beach to the tourists,” said Radhika P, a panipuri shop owner. They are waiting for the New Year, hoping that the beach will be again open for tourists and they will also get a good sale. When they asked about the reopening of the beach, the authorities informed that the beach can only be opened once the road works and other safety works are finished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-bleak-year-for-beach-vendors/articleshow/88602138.cms||---

When Sanjay Jagan, 38, the ward member of Vizhavoor, saw the aged Krishnan, he was in such a miserable condition that the elderly man’s body was full of wounds infested with maggots. A severe wound in the leg had turned cancerous. As he was bedridden, he was not able to move out of the bed even for his bowel movements. Sanjay took it upon himself to bathe him, dress him and shift him to General hospital for further medical care. Sanjay cleaned him and took to Thiruvananthapuram General Hospital and got him admitted there. The elderly man is being cared for by the hospital staff. Krishnan has a few relatives who live in the neighborhood. They were the ones who provided him food. As they are financially unstable, they were not able to help him much. They were also unaware of the wound which had gotten severe. They informed Sanjay when the wound festered and began to emanate a stench. Krishnan has been a bedridden patient for more than six months and lived in a single room made of tarpaulin sheets. He came into social service through church activities. Sanjay is accompanied by a team in his social service activities, and they are always ready to help those in need. “I came to politics to make my social service useful to more people. I work along with my team and I am very glad to say that we are able to take it forward in a positive way. This has become a part of my life and I am ready to do anything in terms of service. “Krishnan was a very healthy person and his present situation is quite miserable. We are planning to clean his house and also to make other necessary arrangements for him,” said Sanjay, who is a daily wage worker with Kerala water authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ward-member-rescues-bedridden-man/articleshow/88602141.cms||---

He spent five years to complete the photo series of the novel ‘Smarakashilakal’ written by Punathil Kunjabdullah.The novel ‘Smarakashilakal’ is featured in the photographic exhibition being held at the Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan. It is exhibited in the form of a series of photographs which puts major incidents and elements of the novel in spotlight. The story of the novel has been visually recreated and narrated by 47 photographs.The captions of the photographs are usually prepared after the pictures have been taken. But here, the photographer has selected the major quotes from the novel and then decided to capture those scenes which have been explained by the novelist. The photographer has keenly observed the scenes and has given a remarkable outcome by featuring the elements as explained in the novel. The elements, including landscapes, mountains, rivers, buildings, moon, rain and places of worship are reflected from the novel. The festivals and other rituals were also included. As a result, the photographer has to wait for several years to finish the work. ‘Smarakashilakal’ is his sixth documentation of Malayalam novel. Other Malayalam novels, including ‘Nalukett’ by M T Vasudevan Nair, ‘Khasakkinte Ithihasam’ by O V Vijayan, ‘Mayyazhippuzahyude Theerangalil’ by M Mukundan, ‘Theekadal Kadanj Thirumadhuram’ by C Radhakrishnan were also documented.“While visiting the places, I understood that the natural elements of the places have changed. It can never be the same as the writers said years ago. So, I decided to document those places and things before it disappear. I have been working hard to document Malayalam novels for the past 15 years. My goal is to understand how the writers found those elements and incidents from their lives and how they wrote the novel. My passion towards photography and reading led me to find out a new genre in photography called literature photography,” said Manoj.The exhibition titled ‘Through the Memorial Stones’ will conclude on December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bringing-alive-a-novel-through-photographs/articleshow/88602145.cms||---

GST on textile and apparel will increase from existing 5% to 12% effective January 1. However, after the protest, traders are hopeful that they will see some resolution in the GST council meeting scheduled on Friday – December 31.As part of the protest, at least 10,000 shops across the city remained closed and textile traders staged demonstrations outside the New Cloth Market in Ahmedabad. Shops across textile markets including Maskati Cloth Merchant’s Association, New Cloth Market, Panchkuva Cloth Merchants’ Association, Sindhi Market, VIP Market, Karnavati Market 1-2-3, Ratanpole Cloth Merchants’ Association and Revdi Bazaar among others, remained closed.Industry estimates suggest that textile production will drop by an estimated 30% if the GST rates are increased.“The textile sector did not attract any taxes till 2017. After the new tax regime was rolled out, textile was brought under the lowest 5% tax slab. At a time when traders are barely coming out of the after-effects of Covid-19, raising the tax slab is inappropriate. It will have detrimental impact on the industry. This will increase our working capital needs but will also reduce demand due to costlier apparel,” said Gaurang Bhagat, president, Maskati Cloth Merchants’ Association in Ahmedabad. “Demand is already down due to costlier apparels due to hike in raw material costs. In the long run, this will further impact manufacturing and will lead to employment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/abad-markets-too-observe-total-bandh/articleshow/88602147.cms||---

To banish the spectre of worsening school education outcomes due to Covid-induced disruptions, the state primary education department wants to use hologram technology to project lessons by its best teachers across classrooms, hoping to dazzle students and improve learning. The project, undertaken by Gujarat Education Technologies Limited with assistance from the state department of science and technology (DST), aims to use a pool of feted teachers to hold virtual classrooms for children weak in certain subjects using holograms, interactive videowalls and 3D models for interactive learning. Vinod Rao, secretary, primary and secondary education, told TOI, “Hologram tech is one of the technologies being considered to improve our learning outcomes. Other technologies being considered are 3D animation, interactive learning, gaming and teaching topics through augmented reality.” Rao said the idea behind introducing technological interventions is to push the idea of ‘edutainment’ in the learning process for children and teachers, which can accelerate learning and generate interest in children.The department plans to group students who have difficulties in learning at the taluka-level and have them take lessons from award-winning teachers from government schools, specifically those who have devised unique ways of teaching specific subjects. The lessons will be broadcast to these groups through hologram technology, virtual reality or video walls. “The process of learning will be interactive, where teachers take questions from students spread across the state. They can then explain concepts through 3D models via augmented reality,” said a senior education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/teachers-holograms-to-boost-learning-in-guj/articleshow/88602149.cms||Paul John

In 2012, she was forced to consume acid by her in-laws in Rajasthan and since then her esophagus and colon were ruptured, and she cannot chew her food.Justice Sangeeta Vishen has ordered the State Legal Services Authority to extend full assistance to the 28-year-old victim and her family members to process the application for compensation so that they are not put to inconvenience because they are undergoing tremendous trauma.After the ghastly incident in 2012, the victim was brought back to Ahmedabad Civil Hospital, where she was treated. However, since her esphagus and colon were ruptured, she is not in a position to eat directly and is being fed by pouring liquid into the pipe hanging from her neck. In 2020, the victim had a hope to lead a normal life when AIIMS at Delhi and Apollo Hospital in Ahmedabad opined that the defect can be rectified by surgery. For this, she would require Rs 7.5-8 lakh. She informed the high court that her family borrowed and spent Rs 6.24 lakh by now after her treatment. Her father is an auto-rickshaw driver and unable to bear the expenses for surgery.The victim requested for Rs 5 lakh from the state government under the Central Government Victim Compensation Scheme (CVCF) and Rs 1 lakh from the Centre under the Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF), to which she is legally entitled. Her request was denied by the state for CVCF on the ground that the Centre had given Rs 3.9 crore to Gujarat as one-time fund for 2017-18. The state government disbursed Rs 3.08 crore among victims and returned the remaining amount to the Centre. After hearing the case, the court opined that the victim was entitled to both the schemes and the whole idea behind the schemes is to provide financial assistance promptly and in a simplified manner.The HC has ordered the ministry of home affairs, women safety division to decide afresh and at the earliest for extending assistance to the victim under PMNRF. The court also perused the state government’s schemes and said that she can be extended financial assistance for her surgery under ‘Maa’ and ‘Maa Vatsalya’ schemes. While ordering to take decision within four weeks, the HC reminded both the governments that this victim has not availed benefit of any of these schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-orders-govts-to-decide-on-financial-aid-for-surgery-of-acid-attack-victim/articleshow/88602157.cms||---

The CRSC asked the metro authorities to put in place a ‘park and ride’ programme which is being implemented in Delhi. The CRSC asked the metro authorities to submit their detailed parking plan, as the service can be a potential lifeline for the city. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Mayanksinh Chavda said, “The council asked the AMC and metro authorities to identify parking spaces, so people can park and get onto the metro. CRSC has asked the metro authorities to form a committee for this as soon as possible.” Officials, who asked not to be named, said that if they cannot provide parking facilities near metro stations, the authorities will have to set up facilities to take passengers to the stations. “Unless we provide adequate parking facilities, the metro service will not be a success,” he said. The meeting was attended by officials from the roads and buildings department, AUDA, AMC, Railways, GMRC, AMTS and BRTS and subject experts. GMRC officials did not comment on the issue. The consultative committee also directed the AMC to reduce the sizes of roundabouts to smoothen vehicle flow. The committee has even asked the AMC to ensure that road dividers are extended at major flyovers on SG Road so that vehicles can’t take U-turns to exit by going the wrong direction. Traffic police noted that motorists are taking U-turns after getting off flyovers and this could lead to accidents. At Pakwan Crossroads, during peak hours, cops are deployed to ensure that vehicles don’t take wrong turns to exit. At Pakwan Crossroads going towards Gurudwara, where there is a path to enter the Thaltej underpass, vehicles coming down the flyover often use it to get on to the side road. Moreover, the AMC has been instructed to clear debris and other materials lying under flyovers and clear parking space, especially on SG Road. Officers further said that the committee also asked the AMC and AUDA to design bridges which can accommodate parking under them. AMC officials were asked to ensure that road dividers that are broken, such as near the airport and on Juhapura Road should be repaired to prevent illegal U-turns. The AMC has been asked to finalize its parking policy at the earliest, list prices and make them public. CRSC asked the AMC, experts and other officials to suggest methods to reduce on-street parking in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crsc-asks-metro-authorities-for-parking-plan/articleshow/88602163.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

However, when questioned whether the delegates from several countries – for which the requirement mandates getting isolated for at least seven days – would undergo the same, Patel said that the spike is experienced only for past 2-3 days, and they aim to provide some relaxation. “We have informed the ministry in Delhi that Gujarat is eager to welcome the delegates for such an event with some changes in the (Covid) guidelines,” he said. The minister had earlier said that the conditions for the cap of 400 persons’ gathering and VGGS are different and should not be measured with the same yardstick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/minister-flip-flops-over-vggs/articleshow/88602164.cms||---

Keval Mehta, 52, who was earlier charged with cheating in seven cases filed on the high court’s directions, in his FIR with Sarkhej police said that he was confined to a car, slashed with a knife and driven about the city and Sanand. Mehta said the incident took place on December 24 when he was driving to his office from home. He said two men on a scooter suddenly came in front of his SUV car and fell on to the road. They then began alleging that Mehta had hit them, and demanded money for treatment. Six others persons then arrived in an SUV, down out and began abusing Mehta for hitting the men. Mehta tried to clarify that he did not hit them, but they pushed him into their car and some of them took control of Mehta’s car. These men took him towards Bakrol village in Sanand, where the driver of the car pointed to two men in a hatchback driving parallel to the SUV. Mehta said these two persons were Ashok Patel and his son, Neel Patel, with whom he had a financial dispute. The car driver and the others demanded that Mehta give them Rs 80 lakh, but he told them he did not have the money. They then thrashed Mehta and tried to stab him, causing him to suffer a knife injury to his hand. Mehta said he called a relative to his Ranip office and the accused then took him there. Mehta gave them four cheques: Two for Rs 22.50 lakh, and two for Rs 17.50 lakh. The accused then threatened him with dire consequences if he were to tell anyone about the incident, and left him near Sola. Mehta then approached Sarkhej police and filed a complaint for abduction and other offences under the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/builder-abducted-freed-after-he-pays-80-lakh/articleshow/88602166.cms||---

The deadline for filing IT returns for taxpayers whose account books do not need to be audited is December 31. Tax practitioners are demanding for an extension.Varis Isani, convener, Gujarat Advocate Association, said, “Taxpayers are not able to upload returns on the ITR website. The utility on the new portal itself was launched in September this year and it was not properly functional. At a time when there is a deadline of filing the returns within a day, the portal is not functioning. If taxpayers fail to pay returns in time, they will have to pay a penalty ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 depending on their income. The department must ensure the portal functions.”Isani himself had some 500 returns to be filed and uploaded from his clients and there was no update.Yet another city-based tax advocate, Manish Joshi, said, “The OTP is not being sent on time, the account login has issues due to which return filing is pending. We are getting timely updates from time to time and this is impacting taxpayers unnecessarily. Earlier, we used to file I-T returns late at night and there were no glitches. Some 50 clients are waiting for their returns to be filed and have been constantly following up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/i-t-returns-portal-not-working-a-day-ahead-of-itr-deadline/articleshow/88602168.cms||---

This is being done in addition to sample collection from expatriates. Samples from community clusters are now being collected on a daily basis and sent for WGS. In the case of expatriates, samples are being sent regardless of threshold cycle value (Ct) whereas samples with Ct value less than 25 are being sent for community surveillance. Ct is used to infer the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. It represents the cycle number at which the signal breaches the threshold for positivity. A lower Ct value means higher viral load. A few samples less than Ct value 30 are also being sent for WGS. “With the detection of new variants and Omicron considered to be highly infectious, it is very important that we track its presence within the community. This is crucial to take measures to check the spread of this variant. Clusters are being formed in many places and screening of samples through WGS is an important step in tracking the spread of infection,” said a health official. In a press note issued here on Thursday, health minister Veena George said that although the nature of infection is mild, Omicron is highly contagious and that spread is very crucial for the state considering the high presence of elderly citizens and those with comorbidities. Without proper care, chances of breakthrough infections and reinfections are also high,” Veena George said.  Till December, the weekly positivity rate in the district has been on a downward slide. Since the first week of November, the weekly positivity rate in the district dropped from 12% to 7.4% by the fourth week of December. In December, the weekly positivity rate had dipped from 8.8% to 7.4%. Weekly cases had come down from 5,123 in the final week of November to 3,694 in the fourth week of December. However, health team members said that this situation could change drastically with the emergence of new variants. Besides, due to shortage of manpower and general dip in infectivity, there has been an evident drop in the number of testing in the government sector. Since August, testing in the government sector in the district has come down from 48% to 23% by the fourth week of December. According to officials, as restrictions come in place and Omicron variant being closely monitored, testing numbers will have to be increased significantly in the coming weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/community-surveillance-gets-underway-to-detect-omicron/articleshow/88599858.cms||Aswin J Kumar

According to the police, the robbers had covered up the CCTV camera with a cloth before the theft and so cops are trying to get clues about the culprits. “We have formed a team comprising LCB and SOG personnel and also local police of B Division and have launched an intensive search operation to nab the robbers,” Mehsana DySP RI Desai told TOI on Thursday. “The problem is that there was no security outside the booth to guard the ATM which made it easy for the criminals to get away with their job with ease,” Desai said, adding that cops are working to get clues into how many thieves were there in total as well as trying to trace their escape route. “We are hope hopeful of arresting the culprit soon,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/thieves-decamp-with-over-rs-17-lakh-from-mehsana-atm/articleshow/88599852.cms||---
---||Kochi||SilverLine: FM to seek funds from Centre||T’puram: Finance minister KN Balagopal said the government is going ahead with the SilverLine project and that the state would urge the Centre to sanction its share of Rs 2,000 crore in the upcoming Union budget. The finance minister, who is in New Delhi to attend the conference of finance ministers of all states convened by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ahead of the Union budget, said the issue will be taken up at the conference. “The state will urge that Centre’s share for the project should be included in the ensuing Union budget. Centre’s share has to be released by the Union railway ministry,” said Balagopal while speaking to reporters in New Delhi. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has also made the same request to the Centre during his last Delhi visit. He had also met the Union finance minister and had urged her then to provide Centre’s share in the next Union budget. He had said that SilverLine project had been included in the national rail plan and in the budget speech of 2021 the minister had announced in Parliament that all projects included in the national rail plan will be completed by 2030. However, Balagopal was unsure whether Centre would accept the demand on K-Rail. Also, Centre’s technical clearance for the project is another key factor. The campaign against this project will have some adverse effect since Centre is now dilly dallying with sanctions. Earlier, Centre had taken a favourable stand towards the project. But, once the campaign against the project gained momentum, Centre is going slow on the demands of the state government, he added. Balagopal said the present financial position of the state will be presented. Kerala was badly hit by the pandemic and all sectors too were affected adversely. The state would seek a special package from the Centre to help overcome the present crisis. The SilverLine project aims to improve connectivity between the two ends of Kerala by setting up a semi high-speed rail corridor from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram. Once implemented, it is expected to reduce travel time from 10 hours at present to less than four hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/silverline-fm-to-seek-funds-from-centre/articleshow/88599862.cms||---

The state’s daily case positivity rate shot to 7.2% from Wednesday’s 5.25% and 4% on Tuesday. While Covid infections in the tourist state started rising mid-last week when the daily count breached the 50-mark, on Thursday last, the increase in cases witnessed since Monday has been steep. As many as 543 cases have been reported over the last three days. The state government has, though issued some restrictions, it is yet to stop night activities by imposing a night curfew as is being done in other states. The state has been hesitant to impose tough measures that would restrict movement and social gatherings in view of the festive period ahead of the New Year. The Centre has advised states and Union territories that if any of the two parameters — test positivity rate of 10% or more in the last week or bed occupancy of 40 or more on oxygen supported or ICU beds — are met in any district, then the district level containment measures and restrictions may be put in forthwith, and they be strictly enforced. The district positivity rate between December 21 and 27 for North and South was 3.41% and 2.1% respectively. Meanwhile, the state has enhanced testing and 3,610 tests — North (1,590) and South (2,020) — were done in the last 24 hours of which about 70% were RT-PCR tests. With 61 recoveries reported, the recovery rate was 97.58%. The state has not seen a corresponding rise in hospitalisation though infectivity has shot up. The hospital admissions till Thursday were in a single digit. Only one patient was hospitalised on Thursday. With one death, the fatality count was 3,522. The active caseload for Panaji urban health centre that reported 40 new cases was 120, the highest across all the centres, while that of Margao touched 87 with 26 new cases. Other centres that recorded a significant increase in infections were Cansualim (21), Porvorim (20), Loutolim (19), Siolim (18) and Mapusa (14). To date, the state has reported a single case of Omicron variant, while samples of several travellers who tested positive on arrival and sent for genome sequencing have not been received yet. The health services department collects samples of international travellers, and that from clusters if any, to detect Omicron variant of the virus. It is not known if people with no travel history have also been infected with Omicron even as the state has witnessed a steep rise in infections over the last few days. It will probably have to wait for a while to know which variant is leading the rise, or if a combination of variants is at work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-over-260-new-covid-cases-positivity-in-goa-touches-7-2/articleshow/88600860.cms||Bindiya Chari

After the protest, the state government cancelled the written exam. Gandhinagar police registered an FIR against a mob of 500 people and arrested 93 persons, including members and leaders of AAP, for creating a ruckus at the state BJP headquarters. The complaint was filed by BJP leader Shraddha Rajput. AAP workers were booked on charges of rioting, sexual harassment, assault, trespass, assault on public servants, wrongful restraint and unlawful assembly, among others.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Tax relief for Bopal-Ghuma in offing||AHMEDABAD: Bopal-Ghuma, Chiloda, Kathwada residents, who have been slapped with steep property tax bills — almost 2.5 times their existing — by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), can heave a sigh of relief. The AMC is planning to introduce a tax relief scheme for the newly acquired areas as was extended to Vastrapur, Jodhpur, Thaltej, Bodakdev and adjoining areas in 2006 when these areas were brought into AMC’s fold. On Thursday, standing committee chairman Hitesh Barot said that modalities for the scheme is being worked out. “We are working on whether to extend an instalment scheme or a rebate scheme on existing property tax bills as was extended in 2006,” says Barot. Back then for the first year, residents of Thaltej, Bodakdev, Vastrapur etc areas paid 25% of the billed amount and 50% the following year such that by the end of the fourth year the 100% bill was restored. Prior to the AMC taking over Bopal-Ghuma, 40,000-odd residents of the area were cumulatively paying Rs 5 crore in tax. After the AMC issued tax bills, they expect revenue to go up to Rs 15 crore. “Earlier the property tax system was quite arbitrary. For instance, apartments which came up over past 4 years are paying based on carpet area while other properties were paying a flat charge according to the old blanket assessment system,” said a senior South West Zone tax assessor. Most Bopal and Ghuma areas will be in the ‘C’ category of the municipal tax system, where the land jantri value is between Rs 7,000 and Rs 15,000, except for South Bopal which will be under the ‘B’ category. “Usually the scheme was to be announced when the areas were brought under AMC jurisdiction, but owing to Covid’s second wave, it was avoided. Now that we have served the property tax bills the 2006 scheme is being thought of,” says the senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tax-relief-for-bopal-ghuma-in-offing/articleshow/88602176.cms||---

Superintendent of police (Vizag Rural) B Krishna Rao said Vizag Agency has always faced the menace of cannabis but in 2021 there was a renewed focus and several measures were taken to curb the smuggling of weed. “We managed to seize over 82,000 kg of dry ganja in 566 cases in 2021, which are the highest figures ever to be achieved in Visakhapatnam district. Probably for first time in the country, such a large quantity of ganja was seized in a year,” Krishna Rao added. “We launched Operation Parivartan to root out ganja cultivation and to encourage farmers to grow alternative profitable crops instead of ganja. Apart from destroying the ganja crop in Vizag Agency to completely cut down supply, we are also conducting coordinated operations with police departments of other states to neutralise organized networks,” he said. “Though the cannabis trade has been a problem for decades, with better coordination of various departments, we destroyed ganja crop on more than 7,400 acres in Vizag Agency in the past two months,” Krishna Rao said. Profiling of interstate ganja smugglers onHe added, "We are identifying and profiling ganja smugglers operating from other states by analysing technical data and human intelligence." Cannabis smugglingEight persons have so far been arrested in connection with cannabis smuggling to Madhya Pradesh from Vizag via an e-commerce platform. It may be recalled that the online sale of cannabis was busted by Bhind police in Madhya Pradesh, leading to the arrest of two persons- Suraj Pawaiya and Mukul Jaiswal - and the seizure of over 20 kg of dry ganja. Joint director of Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), Vizag, S Satish Kumar, said an investigation is on to nab the prime accused. "We issued notices to the e-commerce site under Section 91 of CrPC to ascertain the role of employees of the firm," he said.

---||Ranchi||Arrest of top Maoist leaders, decline in Red violence new high for state police||Ranchi: A tactical change and adoption of ‘Covid Diplomacy’ by the state security forces towards controlling the Left-wing extremism (LWE) yielded positive results in 2021, marking the year with the arrest of top leaders and decrease in violence.Police were able to trap some big rebel leaders, including CPI (Maoist) politburo member Prashant Bose alias Kishan da, with minimal collateral damage. The arrest of Bose, who topped the wanted list of Jharkhand Police and NIA, is considered a feather in the cap of the state security forces.The year also witnessed a slight dip in total incidents involving the extremists and casualties. As against 24 incidents in 2020, as many as 21 incidents (involving violence) were documented this year with 24 casualties, comprising 11 civilians, five security personnel and eight LWE members. Apart from a few gunfights, the security forces were able to make 128 arrests apart from 15 surrenders by some of the most wanted leaders who bear hefty amounts on their heads. The year began with the arrest of nine rebels — two of the Tritiya Sammelan Prastuti Committee (TSPC), three Maoists and four of the People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI). The first big achievement came with the arrest of a zonal commander-rank member of CPI (Maoist), Jeevan Kandulna, in February. He carried a bounty of Rs 10 lakh on his head. His arrest paved way for more detentions and busting of rebel camps.Jharkhand Police was also able to shake off its image of going soft on Maoist splinter groups and made 20 arrests from all LWE groups during the early part of the year.The April 26 Bharat bandh by the Maoists to protest police action in Bihar was also by and large peaceful in Jharkhand except for the blowing up of a railway track in the Lotapahar region of Chakradharpur division. In May, 22 more rebels, including an area commander of Maoists and many cadres of TPC and PLFI, were arrested.The following month was also eventful as the police convinced CPI (Maoist) zonal commander Nunu Chand Mahto to surrender. Another zonal commander, Uday Oraon, was arrested from Lohardaga. Both carried a bounty of Rs 5 lakh each on their heads. Two teenage Maoists also surrendered in Garhwa while over two dozen people belonging to different outfits were arrested.The security forces also adopted ‘Covid Diplomacy’ in which they appeal to the rebels to surrender and get themselves treated and vaccinated for Covid infections. In response, three Maoists lay down arms in Hazaribag. During the same period, PLFI strongman Buddheshwar Oraon was killed in an encounter.Another success for the security forces in August was when Maharaj Pramanik, known to be a close aide of slain Maoist leader Arwind Ji and politburo member Prashant Bose, surrendered before the Seraikela police on August 20. Maoist special area committee member Pradyumna Sharma was also arrested around the same time. In separate operations, Maoist commanders Angad and Kishore Singh were arrested.The dent in the Maoist camp continued through November when three members — Bailun Sardar, Suraj Sardar and his wife Raimuni — surrendered before the Ranchi Police. In the same month, a big operation was carried out where Bose was intercepted and arrested in Seraikela along with his wife, Sheela Marandi, a central committee member, and four other aides. Towards the end of the year on December 26, Prakash Gope, the bodyguard of CPI (Maoist) politburo member Ramesh Majhi alias Anal Da, who also carries a bounty of Rs 1 crore on his head, surrendered. DGP Niraj Sinha said they were successful in carrying out big operations this year. “Big operations involving top leaders of the Maoist are a mind game and are better fought without violence so that any collateral damage can be prevented,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/arrest-of-top-maoist-leaders-decline-in-red-violence-new-high-for-state-police/articleshow/88602186.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Presently, she lives in a rented house near the beach. She has been selling groundnuts at the beach for more than 30 years and this is her only source of income. But the pandemic and the rough sea had other plans. As the tourists are not allowed to the beach side, the number of tourists coming to the destination has also decreased which has also affected her sales. Like Muniyamma, there are around 50 people who find their source of income by selling different products to tourists. This category also includes people from other states as well as Shankumugham natives. Presently, they are not getting any profit, but they continue to do this job hoping that the beach will open soon and the situation will change again. The beach was opened for Christmas but was later closed. Without knowing this, a large number of tourists are coming to the beach, but leaving with disappointment. “The sale went good on the day of Christmas and soon it went back to the miserable condition. We have been working here for so many years and this is our only way to survive. This problem can only be solved by reopening the beach to the tourists,” said Radhika P, a panipuri shop owner. They are waiting for the New Year, hoping that the beach will be again open for tourists and they will also get a good sale. When they asked about the reopening of the beach, the authorities informed that the beach can only be opened once the road works and other safety works are finished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-bleak-year-for-beach-vendors/articleshow/88599878.cms||---

The minimum temperature fell to 3.2 degrees Celsius. According to weather analysts, cold waves may continue for another few days. Northerly winds are the reason behind the mercury plunging by 5 degrees Celsius overnight, they said. Safdarjung, which is the base weather station for Delhi, recorded a minimum temperature of 3.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday as against 8.4 degrees Celsius witnessed a day earlier. Narela recorded the lowest temperature at 3.2 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was recorded at 19.5 degrees Celsius as against 21.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. India Meteorological Department forecasts the cold waves to continue till January 1. Last time, Delhi saw a cold wave on December 20, when Safdarjung recorded a minimum temperature of 3.1 degrees Celsius. “The overnight winds that Delhi received had more northerly component and less westerly. The northerly wind flows directly from the upper reaches of Himalayas, which had seen fresh snowing. Thus, a sharp fall in mercury was recorded,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD. “The cold wave may persist for another two days, however, a strong western disturbance is likely to affect the region, which will change the wind directions from probably January 3 or 4. Then the mercury will start rising again,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. On Friday, the maximum and minimum temperatures may hover around 19 and 3 degrees Celsius, respectively. Meanwhile, the air quality of the city continued being ‘poor’. Delhi on Thursday recorded an air quality index of 286 compared with 267 a day earlier. New Year celebrations on 31st night may increase emissions and worsen AQI, but the AQI is likely to stay within ‘very poor’ or ‘higher end of very poor’ for the next three days, stated System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2nd-coldest-morning-of-season-for-delhi-at-3-2c/articleshow/88600620.cms||---

Mukati said that the move is clearly against the Union transport ministry, which in an order issued on September 6, 2021 stated that no operator will be denied from obtaining fitness certification for a commercial vehicle if reflective tapes are not installed by a state authorized agency on his vehicle.“Despite the Centre’s order, the state transport department is going to make it mandatory for transporters to get reflective tapes installed only from an authorized agency and obtain a certificate from it for fitness,” he claimed.Association members alleged that the move will allow the authorised agencies to overcharge, and it will ultimately be a financial burden on transporters. Reflective tapes are installed on the front and rear side of commercial vehicles as per law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/states-mandate-on-tapes-against-centre-order-transporters/articleshow/88602199.cms||---

They didn’t have any kind of symptoms and tested positive in routine checks prescribed for international travellers.” “These asymptomatic people are only given multivitamins. The one case developed fever, body ache and was given analgesic and pain killer,” said Dr Dosi. “Of those six confirmed cases treated at hospital, nobody has symptoms like cough, cold, sore throat, loss of smell, taste like reported earlier”, said Dr Dosi.The district has reported nine cases of Omicron till now in fully vaccinated people with international travel history with over two dozen such reports pending with the National Centre for disease control.“These Omicron suspected people are put in an isolation ward in accordance with guidelines even separating them with other COVID-19 positive cases as a precautionary measure to avoid its spread”, said Dr Dosi. Similarly, HoD Chest and TB department MGM Dr Salil Bhargava said, “These suspect cases are put in separate isolation wards for now. Almost all are asymptomatic cases and medication is decided based on that.” MGM dean Dr Sanjay Dixit based on current trends said, “Covid-19 can be only prevented through testing, isolation, observation. But, because most of these Omicron variant cases were asymptomatic, it poses a major challenge in identification of cases.” “Epidemiologically, asymptomatic cases help in raising immunity to a level called herd immunity preventing further spread by giving milder, asymptomatic infection to others in community”, added Dr Dixit about its effect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/most-omicron-patients-in-district-are-asymptomatic/articleshow/88602203.cms||Antriksh Singh

The instruction comes on the back of a student from Tanzania testing positive for the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus.The student in question arrived in Mysuru by road, after flying into Hyderabad airport, where she was tested for Covid-19. It emerged that she was infected with the Omicron variant of the virus after she reached Mysuru on December 19. Although she has been tested for Covid-19 twice since her arrival in the Heritage City, and tested negative on both occasions, the varsity administration has decided not to take any chances.UoM vice-chancellor G Hemantha Kumar said that they would continue to test students and staff at random. “In the past two days, we have tested more than 300 students, most of whom have come from abroad. We have also been testing students residing in the varsity’s hostels.

However, we will continue with random testing. In all, there are nearly 4,000 students at our postgraduate campus,” he said.UoM’s chief medical officer Dr MS Basavaraj said that all the healthcare staff at the varsity had been tested after the Tanzanian student was quarantined. “All of them have tested negative for the novel coronavirus. We are taking measures to ensure that Covid norms are followed by all on the campus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/take-covid-test-uom-tells-pg-staff-students/articleshow/88602212.cms||Lawrence Milton

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Crime up 18% in Krishna but policing ahead of other districts||VIJAYAWADA: Crimes in Krishna district went up by 18 per cent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Crimes under major heads witnessed an uptick during the year. Liquor smuggling and gambling cases dominated the crime statistics. Though the number of crimes increased, Krishna district police achieved best rank in many performance indicators. Crime detections, property recovery and chargesheet filing increased substantially putting the district police on top among other districts in the state. SP Siddharth Kaushal attributed the rise in crime numbers to the performance of police personnel. He said it was because of the accessibility of police to public that a greater number of cases were registered. The district unit, especially the SHOs in areas along the Telangana border, worked hard to curb illegal liquor smuggling. Kaushal observed that the number of liquor smuggling cases is on the decline in many district because of the price cuts, but in Krishna district, the number of cases went up from 5,253 in 2020 to 5,420 in 2021. “This shows the effective enforcement work done by Krishna police in curbing illegal liquor. We have also curbed illicit liquor brewing in an effective manner and it was reflected in the number of cases going up from 764 to 1,026.” Gambling cases are the highest contributors to crime in Krishna district. During 2021, 10,818 cases were booked against 12,737 people. The number of gambling cases registered in 2020 stood at 9,671. Property offences rose from 497 in 2020 to 702 in 2021. However, Krishna police detected 632 cases and 92 per cent of the stolen property was recovered. Kaushal termed it an outstanding achievement by the district unit. Crimes against women also witnessed a sharp rise in Krishna district from 1,229 in 2020 to 1,651 in 2021. Kaushal said the increase in crimes against women could be attributed to the effective outreach programmes through Spandana and the Disha mobile application. In other performance indicators, the chargesheeting of cases was bettered by 66 per cent and conviction rate increased from 75 per cent to 77 per cent. The average time taken to complete investigation has come down from 68 to 34 days, improving performance by 100 per cent. The measures taken for prevention of crimes such as binding over of persons with past history, opening of history sheets and beat patrolling have gone up by 64 per cent, 114 per cent and 37 per cent respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/crime-up-18-in-krishna-but-policing-ahead-of-other-dists/articleshow/88602231.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Some of them have been installed by the government, but we have also mobilised the citizens of the city to install cameras on their respective buildings on their own,” said police commissioner Jose Mohan.For this, sensitization of the councillors, market bodies, institutions and the other stake holders has been affected and the results are quite promising.“We have included the commercial establishments and religious places besides private residential and commercial units and focusing to decentralize this drive to beat level,” said Mohan adding that beat constables have been asked to take up the issue with each household, shop, institution and religious place.Efforts are also afoot to include the government offices also in this drive with a view to ensuring transparency and accountability in these offices and check the unethical practices.“This will help in realisation of the concept of good governance,” he added.It may be noted that in this order of establishment of the concept of good governance, the government has initiated the process of installation of CCTV cameras in all the police stations, though, in compliance of an order of the Supreme Court and has sought the estimation from all the district administrations.“We have already sent our requisition. We have estimated out requirement of 50 cameras in each police station to cover entire internal and external parts of a police station,” said Mohan welcoming the move.“It will help in bringing greater transparency in the functioning of police at the police station, which is a place directly concerned with a citizen seeking help of the police”, he said adding that they have already begun installing cameras at commissioner office and police line.The drive to bring entire city under the eye of cameras has borne the results and has helped the police in not only cracking some heinous crimes like murders and loots but has also helped in averting threat to the communal harmony and law and order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/police-plans-to-install-8l-cctv-cameras-in-jodhpur/articleshow/88602236.cms||---

The Congress in opposition took the ruling BJP in the council to task, in connection with the video which went viral. In the viral video, a citizen was seen complaining about officials receiving bribes. “I have seen a person distributing Rs 500 each to all here yesterday,” he told the mayor, who reached the spot after receiving complaints. The mayor immediately asked the officials whether the office has CCTV cameras, and took them to task for not clearing files for more than two months. Raising the issue, Congress corporators alleged that people are forced to pay Rs 500 at each table in the MCC. Opposition leader A C Vinayaraj said that people have been discussing corruption in the MCC on social media platforms. Another corporator from the Congress, Naveen D’Souza, said that the mayor had immediately rushed to the section of the MCC, when he received the complaint about corruption. “Such corruption is rampant in all sections of the city corporation. We need to put an end to this menace,” he added. Mayor Premanand Shetty sought details of the corruption. Meanwhile, the issue also led to the exchange of barbs by corporators in the ruling and opposition sides. On the introduction of E-Khata, Nirman-2 building licence application, and online property tax systems in the city corporation, the mayor said that it will ensure transparency. “We have introduced online facilities for the convenience of the public here, ahead of all other urban local bodies in the state. There are a lot of issues with the software, and we are learning by trial and error. All such issues will be sorted out soon,” the mayor said.

In Mohali, record single day vaccination doses were administered to 6,622 persons and in Chandigarh, 11,500 were inoculated on Thursday. People have been making a beeline to vaccination centres for the past one week after the UT administration announced ban on the entry of people who have not had both doses of the vaccine into public places. While Mohali has not issued such orders for now, the move in Chandigarh is enough to disrupt Mohali residents’ activities there if they are not vaccinated. The vaccination count in Mohali, which had not crossed 3,000 this year, has been over 5,000 daily for the past four days. Mohali deputy commissioner Isha Kalia said, “Punjab state is yet to take any such decision of banning entry to public places if both vaccine doses are not taken but as UT did that, residents have rushed to get vaccination. The daily count, which remained just over 3,000, has jumped to over 6,000 per day and we hope it may touch the 10,000 count.” In Chandigarh, the increase has been even sharper. Dharampal, adviser to the administrator, was apprised of the sudden increase in daily Covid vaccination numbers by UT health secretary Yashpal Garg. Previously, about 3,500 daily vaccinations were being conducted. The number has now breached 10,000. First dose has been given to about 115% while second dose to about 87 % of the targeted population. If current pace of vaccination continues for a few more days, then the UT may achieve the target of 100% second dose vaccination within one week. Five more vaccination teams have been added and efforts are being made to add 20 more vaccination teams from tomorrow. All arrangements are in place for vaccination of children from January 3, 2022. Sufficient vaccines have been received and there is no issue with regard to availability and supply of vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/omicron-scare-entry-ban-at-public-places-trigger-vaccination-rush/articleshow/88599910.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

He spent five years to complete the photo series of the novel ‘Smarakashilakal’ written by Punathil Kunjabdullah. The novel ‘Smarakashilakal’ is featured in the photographic exhibition being held at the Vyloppilli Samskrithi Bhavan. It is exhibited in the form of a series of photographs which puts major incidents and elements of the novel in spotlight. The story of the novel has been visually recreated and narrated by 47 photographs. The captions of the photographs are usually prepared after the pictures have been taken. But here, the photographer has selected the major quotes from the novel and then decided to capture those scenes which have been explained by the novelist. The photographer has keenly observed the scenes and has given a remarkable outcome by featuring the elements as explained in the novel. The elements, including landscapes, mountains, rivers, buildings, moon, rain and places of worship are reflected from the novel. The festivals and other rituals were also included. As a result, the photographer has to wait for several years to finish the work.  ‘Smarakashilakal’ is his sixth documentation of Malayalam novel. Other Malayalam novels, including ‘Nalukett’ by M T Vasudevan Nair, ‘Khasakkinte Ithihasam’ by O V Vijayan, ‘Mayyazhippuzahyude Theerangalil’ by M Mukundan, ‘Theekadal Kadanj Thirumadhuram’ by C Radhakrishnan were also documented. “While visiting the places, I understood that the natural elements of the places have changed. It can never be the same as the writers said years ago. So, I decided to document those places and things before it disappear. I have been working hard to document Malayalam novels for the past 15 years. My goal is to understand how the writers found those elements and incidents from their lives and how they wrote the novel. My passion towards photography and reading led me to find out a new genre in photography called literature photography,” said Manoj. The exhibition titled ‘Through the Memorial Stones’ will conclude on December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bringing-alive-a-novel-through-photographs/articleshow/88599897.cms||---

A total of 364 people were killed and 1,523 injured in 1,528 road accidents in Vizag city limits in 2021 as against 1,147 road accidents and 260 deaths and 1,048 injuries in 2020.  City police chief Manish Kumar Sinha said Covid-19 pandemic led to a steep increase in the use of personal vehicles (two-wheelers) for commuting as many are afraid of travelling in public vehicles fearing contracting the disease. The increase of two- wheelers on the road and lack of awareness about traffic norms among some motorists have led to an increase in road accidents. Majority of the fatal accidents were self-accidents. We are chalking out plans to mitigate fatalities and better traffic regulations in 2022, he added.  Roads in Vizag rural claimed more lives than city roads in 2021. As many as 392 people were killed and 661 suffered injuries in 793 road accidents in Vizag rural police limits in 2021 as against 826 accidents, 333 deaths and 724 injuries in 2020. Vizag rural police chief B Krishna Rao said though the road accidents decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020, fatalities increased in 2021. There were several reasons for the increase in fatalities. We have been coordinating with other departments to reduce crashes on the National Highway stretch and a few other roads in the district in 2022, he added.  In Vizianagaram district, road accidents and deaths increased in 2021 when compared to the previous year. A total of 281 persons were killed and 1,139 injured in 850 accident cases in the district in 2021 as against 824 road accidents and 274 deaths and 1,009 injuries in 2020.  Meanwhile, a total of 281 people were killed and 100 injured in 842 road accidents in Srikakulam district in 2021.

---||Jaipur||PM Modi’s silence over hate speech questionable, says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over hate speech at Haridwar. He said, “The message of the prime minister matters. He should have condemned what happened in the Parliament of Religions. He should have condemned what happened in Raipur.” Gehlot was reacting to the media after attending a function at OTS on the arrest of Kalicharan Maharaj by Chhattisgarh police. Gehlot said, “On one hand, you are adopting Gandhi and on the other hand, what kind of words have been used about Gandhi, yet you are not saying anything, these two things cannot go together. Whether they are Union ministers or whoever they are, they should keep in mind that they should not vitiate the unity, integrity, love and goodwill in the country, only then will this country progress,” he said. The chief minister said Haridwar hate speech is the outcome of a worrying atmosphere prevailing in the country. He asked how the Parliament of Religions got the courage to make hate speeches? “When an atmosphere is created like this inside the country, then they muster courage, the atmosphere is very worrying,” said the chief minister. “Writers and intellectuals are saying democracy is in danger, the Constitution is in danger. They are saying that the atmosphere is very worrying, if you disagree, then you are a traitor. Yes, how many journalist-activists were put behind bars?” asked the chief minister. The chief minister said, “This is a very dangerous environment and there should be constant pressure on the central government from the public as well, only then they will understand in which direction we have to go.” He said there is a need to correct the environment and the biggest responsibility lies with the central government, the ruling party, and the opposition is doing its duty. Replying to another question on Uttar Pradesh elections, Gehlot said, “The prime minister and the home minister have left all their work in Delhi and are camping in UP. First they camped in West Bengal, people gave a fitting response, now camping in UP, the more they camp in UP, the less their chances of winning as the public understands everything,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pm-modis-silence-over-hate-speech-questionable-gehlot/articleshow/88602244.cms||---

While the number of tourists to Amber slightly tapered off in the past couple of days, authorities managing the landmark said the number of visitors are better than witnessed last year during this time. The situation in other monuments is no different with people wanting to spend the last days of 2021 with some memories. Rakesh Cholak, superintendent of Albert hall and Nahargarh Fort, said, “Visitors from Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat are visiting in large numbers. The count this year in December is much better than last year.” The hotels and resorts in the city and outskirts are also running 70-80% full despite cancellation that have come in the couple of days. Gajendra Luniwal, president of Jaipur Hotel Association, said, “The bookings in hotels were almost closer to 90% but the news of government imposing night curfew led to some cancellations. Even though night curfew between 11pm-5am does not affect tourists much, it creates a few in the minds of visitors.” He said the month of January does not look good given the rise of Covid cases. “For the hotel industry, the resurgence of cases is not a good sign. We were coming back to normalcy, but again the recovery will be upset,” added Luniwal. While there has been no incidence of cancellations of New year-eve celebrations, going by the cases, it will dampen the spirits of revellers a little. Industry observers said the Covid restriction imposed Delhi had also impact on the inflow of tourists to the state. Most of the rush is driven by the domestic tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/visitors-influx-more-than-last-year-cancellations-hit-industry/articleshow/88602245.cms||---

According to the statistics available with the forest department, in the past one week, the 1st Leopard reserve in India, has earned handsome revenue. Forest Ranger Janeshwar Chaudhary said, “From December 23-29, the forest department earned approximately Rs 55 lakh after the visit of around 1000 tourists to the reserve. As the reserve is now on the world map, it is witnessing a massive response from the wildlife enthusiasts during the winter breaks,” Since the work from home option was available, there has been a heavy footfall of tourists but now with the year-end vacation the reserve has been providing the maximum capacity of the safari facilities daily. “At Jhalana, 168 wildlife tourists can go for a safari in the morning and evening shifts. There are 14 vehicles deployed for safari in every shift. Due to the holidays there is a rush of tourists and safari vehicles are almost booked every day,” said Chaudhary. The forest spreads over just 20 sq km on the southeast of Jaipur. It houses a healthy population of 44 leopards that the tourists can spot from just 10-20 feet. Other than leopards one can also see striped hyenas, Indian civets, desert cats, jackals, Sambar deer, spotted deer, peacocks and a variety of snakes at the reserve. Taking a cue from the Project Tiger launched by the Centre in 1973, the state had launched the project to conserve leopards. Many claim the small forest reserve has become a shining example of wildlife tourism and is a strong competitor for other sanctuaries. “If Ranthambore has tigers, there are Leopards in Jhalana. One of the major attractions here is that tourists can spot leopards from a close distance. Good sightings have put Jhalana safari on the global map. There are several advance bookings of tourists from Mumbai, Delhi and south right up to mid- January,” said a gypsy driver, who wished not to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jhalana-leopard-safari-witnesses-year-end-domestic-tourist-surge/articleshow/88602247.cms||---

The survey also highlighted the same traffic situation at Hawa Sadak. In 2011, 10355 PCUs were recorded per hour whereas the road capacity was just 6361 PCUs. “The traffic at this stretch moves at 17 kmph speed. Once the elevated road is operational the speed will improve to 60 kmph,” said another official.“A decade ago the road was having 1.5 times extra traffic load. Over the years it has increased manifolds,” said an official. Under the project, four ramps would be constructed for traffic to ascend and descend from the elevated road. Once completed, a commuter will reach Ajmer Road via Hawa Sadak within 10 minutes. Commuters travelling from Ambedkar Circle will have an option to ascend at Nandpuri near Hilton Hotel using the ramp. An engineer said, “Two ascending ramps for commuters plying between Ambedkar Circle and Ajmer Road will benefit many. If the ramp was not constructed at Nandpuri, people living in the area would have avoided using the elevated road as they had to take a u-turn from Sodala to reach their destination.” Similarly, the civic body has constructed the 1.8 km-long elevated structure for commuters plying from Ajmer Road end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sodala-elevated-road-to-be-operational-from-feb/articleshow/88602256.cms||---

The civic body has been facing difficulties in maintaining hygiene due to the lack of hoopers. Residents of some wards have complained that the workers were not reporting on time and were inefficient, while people at other wards said there was a shortage of workers. Rajat Bishnoi, councillor of Ward 9, said many sanitation workers were not reporting every day and some of them had bribed the sanitation inspector to regularise their attendance. Hence, the roads and drains in the wards were not being cleaned, he said. Another councillor, Lalita Jaiswal from Ward 72, said there were many marketplaces in the ward and the work done by the sanitation workers was not enough. "Many of them do not come regularly. With the crisis in the Walled City for sanitation as the hoopers are not coming to every lane, we are completely dependent on sanitation workers for road sweeping. Most of them have lethargic attitudes," said Jaiswal. Some councillors said the sanitation workers were not divided as per the ward size and in some wards, there were 80, while others had 15 workers. Vimal Aggarwal, councillor of Ward 22, said with a dozen of workers, sweeping the roads of the entire ward was not possible. Some residents said although sanitation workers are coming on time in their lanes, covering the entire ward every day was not possible for just 12 workers. Some ward councillors have found a way out of the mess. Sunita Mahawar, councillor of Ward 85, has ordered all sanitation workers to collect garbage from the houses and accumulate it in one place. From there, hoopers arrive and pick it up. "It is the responsibility of the councillors to manage the wards. As hoopers can’t go everywhere due to less availability, we provide garbage in one place from where it is being picked up by the hoopers. Workers are not adequate but we have to manage," said Mahawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shortage-of-workers-adds-to-sanitation-woes-in-walled-city/articleshow/88602257.cms||---

Almost all shops in 175 textile markets of Ring Road, Saroli and Punagam along with over 70,000 traders remained closed in the daylong symbolic strike. The textile industry suffered around Rs 150 crore loss due to the daylong strike. Not only trading but transportation of textile goods also came to halt as the transport associations working in textile markets extended support to the strike and discontinued services. Road were practically empty owing to the protest in the Textile Market area as the traders stayed away from their workplace. At a few textile markets workers turned up for duty, but returned finding the establishments closed. “A few traders kept their shops open and did not support the bandh. However, their numbers are very few and do not represent the mood of the industry,” a textile trader said. Various weaving associations from different areas of the city and district staged protests by tying black bands on their arms, waving black flags and beating thalis. The weavers’ associations have held meetings a day in advance and planned protests. “The weaving associations did not close down their units, but supported the protest by organising demonstrations. We will continue the protest if the GST is not maintained at 5 percent,” said Ashok Jirawala, president, Federation of Gujarat Weavers Welfare Association (FOGWWA). The markets will start operating normally from Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-textile-markets-down-shutters-to-protest-increase-in-gst/articleshow/88602265.cms||---

He was speaking after inaugurating a legal awareness camp organised by Karnataka State Legal Services Authority, Dakshina Kannada District Legal Services Authority and Moodbidri Bar Association, at Alva’s College in Moodbidri on Thursday. “In a civil society, it is not acceptable to be silent against atrocities or problems, without bringing it to the notice of police or the court. The legal services authority is there to support those who have no strength to fight for their rights,” he said, and called upon people to approach the authority for any legal assistance. DC K V Rajendra said that the burden of the legal services authority reduces when government officials discharge their duties efficiently. “Officials should go to the doorsteps of people and reach government schemes to the right beneficiaries,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fight-for-your-rights-legally-sc-judge/articleshow/88602267.cms||---

When Sanjay Jagan, 38, the ward member of Vizhavoor, saw the aged Krishnan, he was in such a miserable condition that the elderly man’s body was full of wounds infested with maggots. A severe wound in the leg had turned cancerous. As he was bedridden, he was not able to move out of the bed even for his bowel movements. Sanjay took it upon himself to bathe him, dress him and shift him to General hospital for further medical care. Sanjay cleaned him and took to Thiruvananthapuram General Hospital and got him admitted there. The elderly man is being cared for by the hospital staff. Krishnan has a few relatives who live in the neighborhood. They were the ones who provided him food. As they are financially unstable, they were not able to help him much. They were also unaware of the wound which had gotten severe. They informed Sanjay when the wound festered and began to emanate a stench. Krishnan has been a bedridden patient for more than six months and lived in a single room made of tarpaulin sheets. He came into social service through church activities. Sanjay is accompanied by a team in his social service activities, and they are always ready to help those in need. “I came to politics to make my social service useful to more people. I work along with my team and I am very glad to say that we are able to take it forward in a positive way. This has become a part of my life and I am ready to do anything in terms of service. “Krishnan was a very healthy person and his present situation is quite miserable. We are planning to clean his house and also to make other necessary arrangements for him,” said Sanjay, who is a daily wage worker with Kerala water authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ward-member-rescues-bedridden-man/articleshow/88599917.cms||---
---||Delhi||After row, JNU tweaks counselling order||New Delhi: Following criticism over the wording of an announcement regarding a counselling session on sexual harassment, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration has now removed the contentious statement. The sentence had said that “Girls (are) supposed to know how to draw a tangible line between them and their male friends to avoid harassment.” The statement had received flak from several sections of the university, including students’ bodies, who claimed that the varsity was resorting to victim-blaming. While the university initially revised the statement to “boys will be counselled to clearly distinguish between friendship and behaviour that may be considered sexual harassment,” as of Thursday evening, the section on “why is this counselling session required” was removed from the website. A subhead on “what will be done in the counselling session” talks of answering queries related to sexual harassment, what could be the prospective repercussions if found guilty of sexual harassment and what constitutes sexual harassment, is what continues to be on the website. Earlier, Rekha Sharma, chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW), had also sought withdrawal of the circular and termed it as “misogynist.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-row-jnu-tweaks-counselling-order/articleshow/88600646.cms||TNN

---||Goa||Covid-19: Recommend strong curbs, Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane tells expert panel||PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane said on Thursday that in view of the New Year celebrations it is very important that the expert committee makes strong recommendations to the government. The notable jump in case positivity rate from 0 to 7.23% “is a matter of concern. It is a critical stage as Goa is a small state,” he said. “In view of the New Year celebrations, it is very important that the expert committee makes strong recommendations to the government, so that we can act accordingly,” Rane said. The jump in the positivity rate, he said, indicates the rise in Covid cases in Goa. “I have instructed the director of health services and the GMC dean to hold a meeting with an expert group of doctors and take a review of the situation and suggest stringent measures,” Rane said. Goa has logged 543 fresh cases in the last three days alone. The expert committee on Tuesday had suggested a slew of measures, including imposition of night curfew. Chief minister Pramod Sawant chaired a meeting of expert doctors on Wednesday, and orders were issued later in the evening that visitors should either produce a certification of full vaccination or a Covid negative report for an entry into a casino, spa and parlour, theatre, places of amusement, night club, cinema halls. The order said that casinos should function at 50% of their capacity and Covid protocols in place should be followed thoroughly. Sawant said the recommendation of the expert to impose night curfew immediately was not possible since Goa is a tourist state. Since the beginning of the Christmas week, the state has witnessed a massive rise in footfalls and most coastal belts and other tourist spots have been crowded with mostly domestic tourists leaving hardly any scope to maintain social distance or follow other Covid protocols, a hotelier in North Goa told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/recommend-strong-curbs-vishwajit-tells-expert-panel/articleshow/88601032.cms||---

There are a lot of issues with the software, and we are learning by trial and error. All such issues will be sorted out soon,” the mayor said.SWM: MCC approves startup’s DPRThe MCC council has approved a detailed project report (DPR) submitted by a city-based startup to implement solid waste management (SWM) in the city.

According to the data available, of the total cases reported, 17 were referred to through the Cyber Tipline, the nation’s centralised reporting system for the online exploitation of children. In addition, 14 cases of bank frauds, including OTP scam, online purchase and duping people by sharing links, were registered. The district also recorded seven job fraud cases, 12 cases related to social media posts and two ransomware cases.Dakshina Kannada SP Rishikesh Sonawane said that many financial fraud cases go unreported, because the victims have already lost money. Those who have lost small amounts do not come forward to register a case. In case of any cyber crime, especially financial fraud, it is important to bring the issue to the notice of the police and register a case, so that the bank account can be frozen immediately, he said. He said that due to an increase in time being spent in the digital world by people, there has been a rise in cyber crimes being reported. Most of the cases can be avoided, if victims are alert and don’t share their OTPs and PINs, and don’t click on the links received through SMS, and don’t befriend unknown people over social media, and don’t share personal and private photos as well as videos with unknown persons.The different modus operandi used are lottery and prize money fraud, fake job offers, fake matrimonial profiles, loan offer fraud, phishing, OTP frauds, online classifieds websites, fake customer care numbers, ransomware, UPI related frauds, remote desktop applications and so on. The CEN police had registered a total of 12 cases in 2019, followed by 18 cases last year. The bank and job frauds increased from seven in 2020 to 21 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/financial-fraud-on-the-rise-among-cybercrimes-in-dk/articleshow/88602270.cms||---

The court has asked the state to file its response by January 13 when the case will next be heard. The division bench of Acting Chief Justice Sanjay Kumar Mishra and Justice NS Dhanik added that the probe will be handed over to the CBI in case it is found that not much progress has been made by the SIT. Notably, Rajesh Suri was poisoned on November 30, 2014, when he was returning to Dehradun from Nainital high court. His sister, Rita Suri, alleges that all documentary evidence of scams in the construction of several government properties, including the judge's residence, was stolen from him. Following his death, Rita got a police case filed against several land mafias. Later, in 2015, an SIT was formed to probe the killing of Rajesh Suri. In 2016, the SIT submitted its final investigation report but Rita raised several discrepancies in it. Taking cognisance, the high court, in 2018, scrapped the SIT's first investigation report and asked it to file another one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-seeks-ukhand-govts-response-on-sit-probe-into-activist-rajesh-suri-killing/articleshow/88594947.cms||Sonali Mishra

According to the data available, of the total cases reported, 17 were referred to through the Cyber Tipline, the nation’s centralised reporting system for the online exploitation of children. In addition, 14 cases of bank frauds, including OTP scam, online purchase and duping people by sharing links, were registered. The district also recorded seven job fraud cases, 12 cases related to social media posts and two ransomware cases. Dakshina Kannada SP Rishikesh Sonawane said that many financial fraud cases go unreported, because the victims have already lost money. Those who have lost small amounts do not come forward to register a case. In case of any cyber crime, especially financial fraud, it is important to bring the issue to the notice of the police and register a case, so that the bank account can be frozen immediately, he said. He said that due to an increase in time being spent in the digital world by people, there has been a rise in cyber crimes being reported. Most of the cases can be avoided, if victims are alert and don’t share their OTPs and PINs, and don’t click on the links received through SMS, and don’t befriend unknown people over social media, and don’t share personal and private photos as well as videos with unknown persons. The different modus operandi used are lottery and prize money fraud, fake job offers, fake matrimonial profiles, loan offer fraud, phishing, OTP frauds, online classifieds websites, fake customer care numbers, ransomware, UPI related frauds, remote desktop applications and so on. The CEN police had registered a total of 12 cases in 2019, followed by 18 cases last year. The bank and job frauds increased from seven in 2020 to 21 this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/financial-fraud-on-the-rise-among-cyber-crimes-in-dk/articleshow/88599141.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

They are also questioning the need of such display when people are suffering from financial crisis and fear of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. HV Sheelavant, an environmentalist in Dharwad, has tweeted to the Prime Minister’s Office, BJP national president JP Nadda and CM Basavaraj Bommai questioning the unnecessary orchestration during the pandemic. “Is this an expense in public interest? Flex, flags, buntings displayed in an anti-eco friendly manner all over Hubballi-Dharwad at the cost of city’s beauty,” he added. In his second tweet, he has suggested to be at least human. “Under Covid-19 and Omicron pandemic, instead of spending for such publicity orchestration, donated to bereaved families, farmers. This is not the time for image management (sic)” he added. Sanjay Ashok Salanke, who claims to be a staunch fan of Narendra Modi on Facebook, has clicked photos of roads that are in bad shape holding a placard welcoming leaders and has posted them on social media, tagging JP Nadda and Nirmala Sitharaman. He told TOI that he is fan of Modi but is disappointed with local elected representatives. “While they have been citing Covid for delays of all development works, why was it not a reason for their meeting? They cleaned and beautified Gokul Road and areas around a private hotel, where their meeting was held. But who cares about other areas? After I tweeted to BJP national leaders with pics of worst roads, 45 people have retweeted it and over 150 have liked it,” he added. Some netizens have sarcastically suggested that the party hold such executive meetings in Hubballi itself but in different areas once every three months. Many have made some cartoons and posters showing the tidy atmosphere at the private hotel and the dust, potholes, garbage across the city. They have also shared photos of buntings and banners and have asked if they beautified or defaced the city. District minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppal admitted that development works were deferred after Covid and they will be expedited from now onwards. “We held a meeting officials of HDMC, water board, Hescom, KPTCL and other departments recently. We will ensure cleanliness at all areas in coming days. No special funds were released for beautification during the state executive meeting but available funds were used,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bjp-executive-meet-organisers-face-flack-over-illegal-posters/articleshow/88602309.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

He emphasised on the need to increase it from 50% to 100% to protect Himachali apple and the livelihood of 2.5 lakh families. CM Thakur said apple is the main horticultural crop of the state, which is also the primary source of the livelihood for large population. He said, however, due to a large influx of the imported apples in the market, prices of the Himachal apples had fallen sharply, leading to revenue losses for the state. Therefore, import duty should be increased and apple crop should be excluded from the list of fruits and other commodities brought under open general licence (OGL), he added.He also said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had found the site suitable for construction of Green Field Airport in Mandi district and had also accorded its final technical go-ahead. Therefore, this project may be included in the upcoming Union budget. He demanded to declare the proposed airport as a project of national importance and said the airport was of strategic importance, as it was in close proximity with Leh. The estimated cost for the construction of the airport in Mandi is about Rs 3,000 crore.He said modes of rail and air connectivity were limited in Himachal and three existing airports in Shimla, Kullu and Kangra have small runways making them suitable only for operating small planes.CM also demanded the extension of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation facility for the next three years. He said Himachal Pradesh was a hilly state having tough topographical conditions. The state was receiving GST compensation and revenue deficit Grant (RDG) as a part of the central assistance and out of this GST compensation is effective only till June 2022. Moreover, RDG will also be reduced in the coming years according to the recommendations of the 15th finance commission, which will adversely affect the finances of the state government. Therefore the GST compensation facility should continue, he said.He said Industrial Development Policy 2017 should be extended for the next five years in order to boost the economic growth in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/raise-import-duty-on-apple-himchal-tells-union-fin-min/articleshow/88602325.cms||---

A soldier who had been reported injured in the Anantnag offensive on Wednesday died in hospital.Lt Gen D P Pandey, general officer commanding of the Army's 15 Corps, and IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said at a joint presser in Srinagar that the number of listed terrorists active in the Valley had dropped below 200 for the first time since the terror run in J&K started. "It is also for the first time that the number of local terrorists is below 100 – at 85 or 86," PTI quoted IGP Kumar as saying.Two of the six Jaish terrorists shot dead in Anantnag and Kulgam since Wednesday were part of the gang behind the December 13 attack on a police bus at Zewan that killed three cops and injured 14.Slain Pakistani terrorist Shahid, alias Shahzaid, had been one of Jaish's main operatives in the Valley for a long time and led a string of terror attacks on security forces and civilians. Another Pakistani intruder, identified as Sultan alias Rayees, was killed in the Kulgam operation. It wasn't immediately clear who among the two was shot dead in the first gunfight on Wednesday. The other terrorists killed in Kulgam and Anantnag were Mohammad Shafi Dar of Tral, Uzair Ahmad of Mirhama, Nisar Ahmad Khanday and Altaf Ahmad Shah. Nisar was identified as a "recycled" terrorist, a term denoting someone who returned to arms after surrendering once. A couple of M4 and four AK-47 rifles, besides a large quantity of ammunition and other incriminating material, were found on the slain terrorists. In December alone, security forces have killed 28 terrorists, five of them Pakistanis, and seized at least 15 AK-47 rifles. Eleven of them were shot dead over the past five days, including the six Jaish members. "In the latest Anantnag operation, we lost Sepoy Jasbir Singh. Two soldiers and as many police personnel had suffered bullet injuries. The rest are now stable," Lt Gen Pandey said.SSP Anantnag Ashish Mishra said that based on specific information, a joint team of the police, Army and CRPF had launched the operation at Dooru in Anantnag to capture a terrorist duo hiding in a cowshed behind a cluster of houses. "Due caution was exercised and the operation was over on Thursday morning without collateral damage."IGP Kumar said 128 local youths had joined the terror ranks so far this year, of whom 73 had already been killed in various encounters with security forces while 16 of them had been captured. Lt Gen. Pandey said that compared to the last two years, recruitment by terror outfits was down in 2021. "Last year, it was more than 180. It shows that there is an awakening in civil society. People have realised the futility of violence. They understand what is happening across (the border)," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/most-wanted-pakistani-among-two-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-jk/articleshow/88602327.cms||---

The move came two days after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police probing the Hyderpora encounter claimed that while one civilian was killed by a foreign terrorist, two others, including a local ‘militant’ (Magray), died in crossfire after being used as human shield by the hiding terrorist.A Pakistani terrorist and three other persons were killed in Hyderpora on November 15 and the police claimed that all the slain men had links to militancy. The families of the three, alleging foul play, had claimed that they were innocent, prompting the police to order an inquiry. Lt Governor Manoj Sinha had also ordered a magisterial probe into the incident.“That being close to Amir, the petitioner knew everything good and bad about him, thus can state on oath that his son was never involved into any anti-national activities or was associated with any such outfit that conspires to bring harm to the nation,” Latief, a resident of Gool area of Ramban district, said in his petition.Invoking Article 21 of the Constitution which extends the right to have decent burial as per religious ceremonies and rules, for his son, the petitioner said he has been instrumental in fighting and curbing militancy in Gool and Singaldan area by working as a civilian volunteer with the Army.Referring to an incident of August 6, 2005, when he along with his wife and other family members killed a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist who barged into his house and fired indiscriminately upon the inmates, the petitioner said he was conferred the State Award for Bravery for the year 2012 by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir for showing exemplary courage despite being injured in the firing which also resulted in the death of his cousin.In view of the family's open support to the Army, the petitioner has remained vulnerable to attacks, owing to which security was provided to them, which is still in place outside their house. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/amirs-father-files-petition-in-hc-to-seek-return-of-body/articleshow/88602330.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Respect, not money, should matter in any career: CDS topper Apoorv||Nagpur: Nagpurian by birth and a bachelor of mechanical engineering from VNIT, Apoorv Padghan has secured All India first rank in the Combined Defence Services (CDS) examination, one of the toughest in the country conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). TOI caught up with Apoorv who shared his experiences, struggles and also had some encouraging words for youngsters like him. “Being at home while I preparing for CDS has to be the greatest struggle for me,” said Padghan who confessed that he had put on a lot of weight last year during the pandemic. “It became a challenge for me as civil and defence services are very particular about the physique of a candidate. As I was completing my under-graduation in mechanical engineering, it became a task to balance everything at the same time. However, I didn’t rush into doing things,” he said. He is currently residing in Buldhana. On his preparations for CDS, Apoorv said, “It gradually started in the third year of my UG course. I decided to first accustom myself with the syllabus rather than submitting to the books for this examination. The first aim was to make myself comfortable with the NCERT books and later move on to bigger preparations.” Apoorv’s father is a senior police officer. Since childhood, he had seen his father “working tirelessly and gaining immense respect”, which Apoorv believed is the epitome of any career. “Money can be earned anywhere but respect is something which follows, and I am eager to achieve that standard,” he said. He feels the medical test was the toughest part of CDS. He said, “It is not difficult to get through the written examination and the Service Selection Board (SSB), however, the medical test is of paramount importance. If you fail here, moving ahead might get difficult. This was the only segment I was scared of.” Delighted with his results, Apporv has decided to join the Air Force and will commence his training in Hyderabad in January. He said, “I am looking forward to the training period . It may be rigorous, but I am ecstatic about this new journey.” To young aspirants like him, Apoorv said, “If I can do it, so can you. I was confident about clearing the exam but never imagined about the first rank. It is important to go with the flow and later think about the results.” “Whatever time is dedicated to studies should be utilized effectively. First plan your curriculum before delving deep into books. I studied for about 8-10 hours a day in the final three months which was a challenge. If you set your timetable right from the beginning, it is not difficult. Staying consistent in the final phase is what counts,” he said. He welcomed the decision to grant permanent commission to women in armed forces. In some encouraging words for the youngsters, he said, “It is not a difficult if you are passionate about something. So, pursue things you love and life will follow the course, be it in any field or domain of study.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/respect-not-money-should-matter-in-any-career-cds-topper-apoorv/articleshow/88599980.cms||Anchal Bhatia

Girls were not allowed to go to school because of safety issues. Riots used to erupt anywhere and anytime. But after BJP came into power, the scenario changed. And, loans to the tune of Rs 36,000 crore given to 86 lakh farmers have been waived.

We need your blessings to become the leader in carrying out development work across the country," said Yogi.

He was addressing a public meeting in Samastipur as part of his social reforms campaign. “I had started the campaign against liquor consumption, dowry and child marriage in 2016. Overall, the campaign was for women’s empowerment. For it, girls’ education was promoted and women were given representation in panchayati raj institutions, urban local bodies and government jobs,” Nitish said. “In 2016, I addressed nine meetings across the state. This time, as many as 12 meetings were lined up, and the Samastipur meeting is the fifth one. The social reforms campaign is a continuing exercise and I want your support to the cause,” Nitish said.Jeevika didis from Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samastipur districts were present at the programme. As many as six of them narrated their experience in relation to the prohibition policy and campaign against dowry and child marriage from the stage in the presence of the ministers. Current and former MPs, MLAs and MLCs from the three districts were also present.

Nitish sought active participation of the Jeevika didis in the social reforms campaign launched by him. He asked them to inform people about the dangers of liquor consumption and also work for the eradication of dowry and child marriage. “Child marriage causes various problems. Daughters’ lives are ruined. Do not allow child marriage under any circumstances,” Nitish said.

While several factors were responsible for the damage, an easily preventable dimension of the disaster was deaths caused due to shortage of oxygen supply in hospitals. Taking a lesson, two oxygen generating plants were set up here. One is installed at Madhepura sadar hospital and another of the higher capacity is at Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Medical College & Hospital. The medical college was also give MCI recognition this year. Students pursuing engineering courses were also happy to get their own building of BP Mandal College of Engineering Technology. Earlier, they were attending classes at a building on SNP Higher Secondary School premises. The Madhepura electro locomotive rail engine factory rolled out 150 engines each having a capacity of 12,000 horse power this year. Madhepura town was gifted a newly-built inter district bus stand constructed at the estimated cost of Rs3.65 crore. Sport and cultural events were organized here in the last week of the year, giving the people respite from the prevailing stress due to Covid-19 pandemic. Sportpersons from across the state and artists from various fields had participated in the events. There were few dampeners as well. Hopes of commuters for completion of widening work of NH-106 and 107 across the district remained unfulfilled in 2021 as well. NH-106 connects the district with the east-west corridor in north at Raghopur under Supaul district and Bihpur under Bhagalpur district in south, while NH-107 connects Madhepura to Saharsa in west and Purnea in east. The two NHs are virtually the life line of Kosi region, particularly Madhepura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/for-madhepura-it-was-a-year-of-fear-and-hope/articleshow/88602362.cms||Deo Narayan Saha

Tejashwi said everyone was aware of the social evils and the CM should first try to improve the “system”. Tejashwi, who returned with his wife from New Delhi on Thursday after spending Christmas there, said, “He (Nitish) is saying that one gets AIDS after consuming liquor. Such statement is hilarious. This shows that he has failed on all fronts and started uttering nonsense,” Tejashwi added. “Everyone is aware as to what is right and wrong in the society. People know that theft, consumption of liquor and taking dowry are wrong things. Even Sati was a bad practice and it was banned. Also, Bihar is not the first place where prohibition has been implemented,” Tejashwi said, adding, “But who will work to improve the problems prevailing in Bihar. What about the poverty in Bihar? Why is state at the bottom on all parameters of NITI Aayog? Who will work to get special status for the state?” Tejashwi asked. Hitting back at Tejashwi, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad said the former was in a vacation mode and he had no idea how smoothly the administration was running in the state. “As far as CM’s yatra is concerned, he loves to be among the people.

This means, resident doctors will not attend to patients in OPDs of GMCH Nagpur and IGGMCH Nagpur from Friday. On December 25, TOI Nagpur was the first to report about shortage of doctors in GMCs ahead of the projected third wave. Resident doctors have been constantly appealing to the government to start PG NEET Counseling so that admissions for the new batch can be started in medical colleges. A statement issued by Dr Avinash Dahiphale, president of Central Committee of MARD, read, “It’s been more than six months that we made multiple legal appeals and protested silently but despite working with 2/3rd of the workforce our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. “Last week even more unacceptable and shameful event occurred, where our peacefully protesting resident doctors were brutally thrashed in New Delhi. In the wake of these events we residents feel threatened and insecure, which moved us to take such a decision.” The committee warned that if requisite action is not taken by the authorities, they will have no option but to escalate the strike to include all emergency and ICU services also. The resident doctors in KEM hospital, JJ hospital and Sion hospital have already started strike from December 30. Residents in GMCH, IGGMCH, and GMCHs at Akola, Yavatmal, Gondia and Chandrapur will join them from December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/exhausted-resident-docs-to-go-on-strike-from-today/articleshow/88599989.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has adopted a resolution to name the road from Hamilton Circle to Rao & Rao Circle in the city after Harekala Hajabba, who was honoured for building a government school in his village. Corporator Abdul Latheef from the Congress had moved a proposal, seeking that the MCC council name either Hamilton Circle or any one of the nearby roads after Harekala Hajabba. A council meeting of the MCC chaired by mayor Premanand Shetty on Thursday, resolved to send the proposal to name the road from Hamilton Circle to Rao & Rao Circle as ‘Padma Shri Harekala Hajabba Raod’ to the Town Planning Standing Committee of the city corporation, for due procedure. “Harekala Hajabba, who was born to Kutyami Beary and Beefathima, has opened a school by selling oranges in Mangaluru city. Though uneducated, Hajabba had a dream of building a school for his village, even when he was carrying a basket of oranges on his head. He realised his dream, that none of the children in his village should remain illiterate. He is the pride of Mangaluru, and hence the road where he sold oranges should be named after him,” Latheef said at the council meet. Premanand Shetty said that the proposal will be sent to the government, after it is cleared by the Town Planning Standing Committee. “The standing committee will follow the government directions of 2009, to complete the process, before sending the proposal to the government. The proposal will be published in vernacular newspapers, and suggestions and objections will later be invited from the public,” he added. Sudheer Shetty, chief whip of the ruling party in the council, said that the city corporation should hold a felicitation programme to honour Hajabba. Former mayor M Shashidhar Hegde lauded the council for approving the proposal to name the road after Harekala Hajabba. Hajabba had received the Padma Shri in 2020, from President Ram Nath Kovind, in New Delhi on November 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/road-where-hajabba-sold-oranges-to-be-named-after-him/articleshow/88599166.cms||---

The board held a special meeting to finalise the report.  GSPCB had appointed IIT-Bombay to pinpoint the cause of air pollution in the port town following several agitations to stop the coal handling at Mormugao Port Trust (MPT). Agitators had claimed that there is coal pollution in the town.  IIT-B suggested to prepare an environmental management plan to control the air pollution. However, the study also said that the marine aerosols cannot be controlled as Vasco is a coastal town. From the result of source apportionment study, it was observed that the contribution of vehicular pollution was found to be higher than dust pollution in the port town. The contribution of marine aerosols (tiny suspended particles above the sea) was also found to be higher than dust pollution ats all locations. The major source affecting air quality at Khariwada is marine aerosols since the least impact of port-related activities and biomass burning is observed at this site. The results of source apportionment point to a 20-30% range of contributions from each of these four key sources including vehicular emissions, marine aerosols, port-related activities, and biomass burning and road dust. The elemental carbon-organic carbon (EC-OC) analyses which point to the contribution of coal handling activities is seen in the form of all other activities, whether it is the port or the main town areas affected by vehicles, re-suspended dust, biomass and solid-waste burning, and road sweeping.  The source apportionment study was carried out on representative samples collected at five locations during the sampling period. For identifying the source of pollutants, 100 trial runs were carried out for all cases and from within these, the best possible solution from 3 to 7 factors was determined. The first phase of the report had stated that coal was not the only mineral responsible for the air pollution in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vehicular-pollution-bigger-factor-than-dust-in-vasco-air-finds-iit-b/articleshow/88601079.cms||Murari Shetye

Health minister Vishwajit Rane said all international travellers, including those from countries that were not categorised “at high risk”, will be tested on arrival in view of the rising cases of Covid-19. “We will be testing all international passengers on arrival, travelling from high-risk countries as well as non-high risk,” Rane said. Earlier, Rane said, only 2% of passengers travelling from “not at risk”countries were subjected to RT PCR testing. “The government of Goa has taken a decision in public interest to test all international passengers,” he said. The government has approved capping of the rapid RT PCR test at Rs 1,500, until further review. On Friday, the first charter from Russia landed with 515 passengers, and two of them tested positive on arrival. They are suspected to be the carriers of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and have been transferred to a state-run isolation facility, and their samples have been sent for genome sequencing. Also, a traveller from the UK, who was subjected to a RT PCR test on the eighth day of his arrival, tested positive and was sent to the isolation facility. His sample too was sent for genome sequencing. All international travellers from high risk countries are required to be in home isolation if they test negative on arrival, but have to test on the eighth day. If the test result is negative, he still requires to be in home isolation and self-monitor, further testing is not required. Goa is slated to receive one charter from Russia every ten days, while three charter flights a week from Kazakhstan. Ernest Dias, chief operating officer at Sita Travels, that mostly handles Russian travellers, said that with restrictions in place they were not sure if the charters will come as per the schedule. He said that he fears cancellations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/all-intl-passengers-to-goa-will-be-tested-on-arrival/articleshow/88601011.cms||TNN

Building construction department secretary Kumar Ravi, who is also officiating as OSD of health department and monitoring oxygen availability, said the state’s capacity of oxygen generation has increased from what the requirement was on the peak day during the second wave. During the second wave, Bihar had its peak on May 6 when 377 metric tonnes of oxygen was needed. Ravi 150MT can now be generated from different PSA plants and 308MT from cryogenic tanks in different medical colleges and hospital per day. He added the state has 16,185 oxygen concentrators, 38,259 B-type and 14,616 D-type cylinders. Meanwhile, the state is also preparing to vaccinate teenagers aged 15 to 18 years beginning January 3.

---||Patna||Patna: ‘Exercise caution during celebrations’||PATNA: Amid a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases, health experts now fear that New Year celebrations may lead to faster transmission of coronavirus. They have, therefore, advised people to avoid travelling unless absolutely necessary and postpone plans to visit any tourist spot in favour of strictly adhering to the safety norms. Dr Nitish Kumar Ranjan, the assistant director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, told this reporter on Thursday, “Once again, the virus in the form of an invisible foe is out to infect everyone, and the crowds gathered for New Year celebrations may serve as an open invitation to attack.” Dr Pankaj Tiwari of the Patna Medical College and Hospital stated that coronavirus found an opportunity to spread rapidly last year and early this year as a result of the gathering of people to celebrate Christmas, New Year, and Makar Sankranti. “We cannot rule out a bursting situation within weeks if people do not exercise caution and refrain from participating in picnics or large gatherings,” he warned. A child specialist, Dr Sunil Kishore, explained, “Because the Omicron variant is highly contagious, the chain can be broken only through social distancing. Children who are not protected by vaccines are at a high risk of contracting the virus while participating in outdoor games or having fun with friends in parks. It is now the parents’ responsibility to monitor their children, instil in them the habit of wearing masks, and prevent them from visiting crowded places.” Dr Anil Kumar, the head of the emergency and trauma department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, asked people to “think about surviving this pandemic first”. He added, “Wearing face masks was frowned upon a year ago, but it has become unavoidable now.” Dr Kunal Kumar, a neurosurgeon at Ruban Hospital, claimed that the pandemic had resulted in many people developing psychiatric problems. He continued, “While the government or health experts may issue guidelines, it is an individual’s responsibility to follow them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/exercise-caution-during-celebrations/articleshow/88602368.cms||VK Tripathi

---||Patna||Patna to usher in New Year with curtailed festivities||PATNA: The fear of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has not stopped Patnaites from planning their New Year celebrations. Since the zoo, parks, and Gandhi Maidan have been closed by the state government until January 2, many people are looking at the possibilities and putting together a list of places where there will be no restrictions on celebrations. Due to the fact that cinema halls, malls, restaurants or eateries, and museums will remain open, youngsters have decided to congregate at these locations on New Year. Some of them are also planning private parties on their home’s terrace, as the state does not have a night curfew. Priya Sharma, a law student and Patel Nagar resident, told this newspaper on Thursday, “When it was announced that parks would be closed on New Year, I immediately purchased five movie tickets. I have planned to go shopping with my friends after the movie. In the evening, I will spend time with my family and relatives at a small gathering.” Ashutosh Ranjan, a collegian, had also planned to see a movie, but “had no idea that obtaining a ticket would be so difficult”. “Now, people have very few options for New Year celebrations,” he rued. Ratan Singh, the general manager of a mall in Patliputra Colony, said, “Instructions have been issued to all staff and security personnel to ensure that the mall can accommodate no more than 4,000 visitors at any given time. On December 25, the mall’s total footfall was 67,000, so we are taking additional precautions this time around.” Ritu Sinha, a Boring Canal Road resident, will have lunch outside with her husband and some close relatives on Saturday. She said, “Due to the anticipated rush in restaurants, I have already made a reservation.” On the other hand, Anu Singh and her husband, Utpal, have decided to host a New Year’s Eve terrace party for family and friends. “We are not sure where we will go on January 1 because most of the popular hangout spots will be crowded,” claimed Anu, a Rukunpura resident. Meanwhile, restaurants and hotels in the city have New Year plans that include a special dinner menu, DJ, candlelight dinner, and mocktail party. A theme-based party, ‘Unlock 2022 under the Sky’ will be held at a hotel near Gandhi Maidan. “With a professional DJ, an anchor and a singer, the party will let parents socialise without worrying about their children,” the hotel’s manager explained. While a special food festival will be held at a hotel in New Dak Bungalow area, a Turkish dessert will delight guests at a hotel near J P roundabout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/city-to-usher-in-new-yr-with-curtailed-festivities/articleshow/88602370.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Bihar: Groundwork laid for slew of health-related projects||PATNA: In the year 2021, which is drawing to a close, the health sector in Bihar underwent massive changes. While the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May made life more difficult, its repercussions resulted in the establishment of pressure swing adsorption plants, provision of liquid medical oxygen in different hospitals, and significant infrastructural development in the state. Bihar’s initial capacity of 57.3 metric tonnes of oxygen per day was increased to 505 metric tonnes by the end of the year. The foundation for 620 health and wellness centres, 124 additional primary health centres, and 72 community health centres spread across 124 assembly constituencies was also laid in 2021. 2021 can also be referred to as the ‘digitalization year’ for Bihar’s health sector. The establishment of a control and command centre brought all of the state’s public health institutes under one roof. Even telemedicine services were launched in February this year, with 6.50 lakh people utilising the service to date, ranking Bihar sixth in the country in this category. “I will rate this year as extremely difficult. We fought Covid-19 for two and a half months, but our commitment to development work and service did not wane. This has been an incredible year,” health department’s additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit told TOI, adding that they began the Covid vaccination drive in January and would reach the 10 crore-mark by Friday. Chief minister Nitish Kumar laid the groundwork for a slew of projects this year and even inaugurated several health institutes. He laid the foundation for the redevelopment of the Patna Medical College and Hospital into a world-class hospital. He dubbed it his dream project and directed officials to ensure its completion within five years. On August 10, following the second Covid wave, the health department made a significant leap forward, with the CM laying the groundwork for different projects and even inaugurating several new ones at a cost of Rs 2,705.35 crore. Among the important projects inaugurated that day were a cancer institute at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences and a trauma centre at Loknayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. The government took another step towards strengthening the health infrastructure by launching or laying the foundation for 772 new projects this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/groundwork-laid-for-slew-of-health-related-projects/articleshow/88602372.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Vig raids & arrests — 2021 saw it all||Patna: While academic growth remained muted in the aftermath of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, a vigilance raid on the office and residence of the Magadh University vice-chancellor (VC) on November 17 and subsequent arrest of officials on charges of financial irregularities rocked the state’s higher education in 2021.Following the vigilance raid, chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar forwarded to the governor a letter in which the VC of Maulana Mazharul Haque Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU) levelled serious charges against some Raj Bhavan officials and the VC of Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU). The CM requested that the charges be investigated by the chancellor. And shortly thereafter, the said VC resigned as well, citing an inability to perform his duties properly.The rift between the chancellor’s secretariat and the government was highlighted this year when education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and other officials boycotted a Raj Bhavan function to present the state’s first chancellor’s awards to distinguished academics. Academics raised a hue and cry when the VC of LNMU was presented with the best VC award. However, the chancellor later assured the education minister that the Raj Bhavan would not tolerate corruption and take stern action against anyone found guilty of it.In the midst of vigilance raids and arrests, the education department wrote to the state’s accountant general (AG) requesting that he audit the accounts of all universities in order to prevent the misuse of public funds. The department asserted that the income-expenditure accounts of various universities had been unaudited for several years, a clear violation of statutory provisions.The removal of the political thoughts and philosophy of Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohia from the postgraduate (PG) syllabus of Jai Prakash University and other universities caused ripples in academic and political circles. Eventually the state government took necessary corrective action. The chancellor promptly convened a meeting of the VCs and directed them to incorporate the political ideas of these leaders into their course curricula.On August 26, the state education department decided to expand PG teaching opportunities in all districts. Until now, no higher education institution in at least 10 of the state’s 38 districts offered PG teaching in any subject. Additionally, the department decided to increase the number of seats available in various colleges. Altogether 18,899 seats have been sanctioned for the state’s 75 colleges.On August 19, the governor, in consultation with the CM, appointed up to eight VCs and pro-VCs of various universities. While Munger University, Purnea University, MMHAPU, and Nalanda Open University got new VCs, Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, Patliputra University, Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University got new pro-VCs. However, four universities in the state continue to operate without regular VCs.The Bihar State University Service Commission began the long-awaited appointment of assistant professors in various universities and colleges on July 17. It had advertised 4,638 assistant professor positions in 52 subjects for the state’s 13 conventional universities in November last year.The Covid-19 pandemic compelled several universities to alter their admission policies for undergraduate and PG students during the 2021-2022 academic year. While some institutions, including Patna University, discontinued the practice of conducting entrance exams for admission, others strictly adhered to the Covid protocols by transitioning from an offline to an online mode of admission. Additionally, classes were held in both offline and online modes, depending on the circumstances.For the first time, universities were permitted to issue degrees and certificates bearing the authorities’ digital signatures. Previously, certificates were manually signed by the officials concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vig-raids-arrests-2021-saw-it-all/articleshow/88602373.cms||---

But BJP works on the basis of three V's — ‘Vikas’ (development), ‘Vayapaar’ (business) and ‘Sanskritik Virasat’ (cultural heritage)”. Addressing a rally in Unnao, Shah said, “You have two options: one is under the leadership of Modi Ji wherein Bharatiya Janata Party works for all sections of the society and the other is Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party, which work for ‘Bua’ (BSP supremo Mayawati) and ‘Babua’ (SP president Akhilesh Yadav).” “During SP’s regime, one caste progressed, when the BSP came, the other caste progressed. However, BJP works on the principle of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” he said and added, “Tell me brother which option will you choose, BJP or SP. Both SP and BSP did not develop the people of the society.” He further reiterated that no political party can stop the construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/shah-sp-rule-was-marked-by-3psparivaarwaad-pakshpaat-palayan/articleshow/88602374.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

At present, Maharashtra has two government genomic sequence testing laboratories, and the rest are under the Pune consortium for genome sequencing, besides a tie-up with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB). “As of now, the state has enough facilities. However, in days to come, there is a need to strengthen the existing lab network with more machines and manpower,” stated a senior official of the public health department, choosing to stay anonymous. While testing is now largely focused on international travelers and contacts, the state has to eventually be ready for more samples from the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bolster-genome-sequencing-laboratories/articleshow/88602385.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The decision on restrictions will be taken after consultation with experts and officials concerned. If the cases go up drastically, we may consider introducing restrictions,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the NCP workers’ rally. According to Ajit Pawar, details on the community spread of Omicron cannot be declared without proper information. Consultation with experts will be done before making any official decision, he said. Cases are rising in Mumbai and Pune. Appeals are being made to use masks and to follow social distancing. “This is significant against the backdrop of New Year celebrations,” Ajit Pawar said. He said the capacity of testing has gone up in the state. There are nearly 650 labs across Maharashtra. They will be asked to increase the testing capacity looking at the rise in positive cases. Ajit Pawar said he would “not like to comment” on the talks of forming the government with the BJP in 2019. The key leaders of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi would meet the governor over the state Assembly speaker’s election. Discussions on constitutional provisions and mode of voting would be held with him.

---||Pune||‘Probable Omicron’ means confirmed case: ICMR||Pune/Nagpur: Virologists have clarified that Covid patients tagged as ‘Probable Omicron’ cases following genome sequencing are indeed confirmed cases of the new variant as the genome study conforms to the key mutations mapped in the new strain and only a minor gap in sequencing prompted the use of the term.The health authorities too have told the research labs to stop using the term ‘Probable Omicron’ for minor genomic gaps if the sequencing matches the key changes (mutations).There are two mapping software — Pangolin and Scorpio — that assign or fix lineages of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. This approach is fast and can assign large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in a relatively short span of time.“Pangolin system currently assigns the outlier (distinctive) lineage as B.1.1.529 or Omicron, but Scorpio system gives the additional label ‘Probable Omicron’ because the outlier lineage is missing many of the original pre-defined lists of mutations. Hence, the confusion. We have directed research labs to stop using the term ‘Probable Omicron’ and keep these finer points for academic discussion and internal researches only,” a senior ICMR official told TOI.The virologists have also clarified that two siblings (sub-lineages) of the original Omicron strain (B.1.1.529) are also in circulation in Maharashtra and the rest of the country. “Patients infected with any of the two sub-lineages (BA.1 and BA.2) are also the confirmed cases of Omicron,” the virologist said. A sub-lineage is not a new variant, scientists have clarified.The government has also stopped giving out lab’s Omicron confirmation report to the infected patients. Nagpur’s first Omicron patient had refused to accept the genomic sequencing report, which read ‘Probable Omicron’ in the result column.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/probable-omicron-means-confirmed-case-icmr/articleshow/88602390.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Trichy Corporation has prepared a masterplan for utilising a portion of the civic body’s 575-acre land bank at Panjapur where the IBT is coming up. Apart from the truck terminal and wholesale market proposed, the local body has earmarked exclusive land for residential projects at Panjapur.As the chief minister visited the Panjapur site and laid the foundation stone for the Rs 140-crore IBT to come up in 48 acres, Trichy Corporation had shared its plan to develop Panchapur as a model transit hub and satellite city with amenities. Bordering the Koraiyar river and situated on the Trichy-Madurai NH that connects several southern districts, Panjapur is connected by the semi-ring road project that interlinks a network of five national highways. Trichy Corporation has planned to use Panjapur for residential, commercial and public amenity projects. The civic body will utilise 325 acres including 48 acres for IBT and 25 acres for the truck terminal. A trade convention centre in about 10 acres will also come up in Panjapur.“The proposed projects will spearhead the city's expansion and development. City’s traffic congestion will come down,” Dr M A Aleem, member of Trichy district welfare fund committee said.Other projects proposed by the chief minister include a DPR for a bypass road connecting the district court in Trichy city with Sunnambukaranpatti near Allithurai. It will decongest the oversaturated Vayalur Road residential areas. A new bridge to replace the ageing Cauvery bridge that connects Srirangam with Trichy mainland was also proposed by the CM on Thursday. An MLD sewage treatment plant at Rs 200 crore and UGD for added wards in Thiruverumbur were among the other projects announced by the CM. Projects under the smart cities mission including the Chathiram bus terminus renovated at a cost of Rs 28 crore and illuminated Rockfort hillock were inaugurated by the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/panjapur-masterplan-proposal-to-bring-more-investments-to-trichy/articleshow/88600671.cms||Deepak Karthik

Collector Kavitha Ramu said Pugazhendhi of Kothamangalathupatti was at his grandmother’s house at Narthamalai when the bullet hit him. He was rushed to Thanjavur medical college hospital where he underwent a surgery in the afternoon. The bullet was removed in a four-hour-long surgery. “The boy is unconscious. The next 24 hours will be critical,” superintendent of police Nisha Parthiban told TOI. She said the bullet travelled nearly one and a half to two kilometres before hitting the boy. The SP said the police are working to file a case against CISF on a complaint from the boy’s relative. The incident sparked a protest among the local people who blocked the Pudukottai – Trichy road demanding closure of the firing range which is situated near residential areas. Quoting two previous incidents of local people suffering bullet injuries, Gandarvakottai’s CPM MLA M Chinnadurai also joined the people in raising the pitch for closing the shooting range permanently. “We have ordered to close it temporarily as we have to assess the safety measures to be taken for the villagers nearby after which only the training can resume,” said the collector. MLA Chinnadurai visited Thanjavur medical college hospital and enquired about the boy’s health condition. PMK MP Dr Anbumani Ramadoss sought a probe into the permission given to CISF to use the shooting ground using “powerful weapons”. TMC president G K Vasan said the police must ensure precautionary measures are in place for such shooting trainings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/boy-1-1-critical-after-being-hit-by-stray-bullet-from-cop-firing-range/articleshow/88600670.cms||---

---||Pune||Covid-19: Before imposing curbs, check impact on health infrastructure, say experts||PUNE: Public health experts and virologists on Thursday said curbs should be based on the impact of the surge in Covid cases on the health infrastructure and not just on test positivity rate. Against the backdrop of increase in cases in many states, especially Maharashtra and Delhi, virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang told TOI, “States should not panic and get into a knee-jerk reaction of introducing curbs based on the test positivity rate, which might be high if there is Omicron spread in the community. It is not a long-term solution. A policy for people at high-risk, rather than for those at low-risk, should be in place.” The virologist said there should be a policy to handle not just Omicron but any variants. “The focus should be on a good data policy system, strengthening the health infrastructure, and having a policy on testing, tracking and clinical trials as the way ahead in the coming year,” she said. Dr Kang said, “Lockdowns were fine earlier, when there were not enough tools and the plan was to flatten the curve. In the current scenario with vaccines, drugs and medical interventions, there is a need to plan our current strategy based on devices we have today and not base it on reactions of last year. It is about time that states assess the situation of the last year and this year, especially in terms of healthcare infrastructure because lockdowns are only a stopgap arrangement for readying the infrastructure, which I believe has already been done by the states.” The virologist said the way ahead was to scale up the vaccination and protect the vulnerable population. The states should make note of it, she said. She also stressed on faster testing strategies to isolate infected patients at the earliest. Additional director-general of ICMR Dr Samiran Panda said irrespective of the variant, the important thing was citizens’ adherence to Covid protocols and masking up. He said, “If cases rise rapidly, states should look into the data for state-level action, which are predominantly Covid-appropriate behaviour, avoiding gatherings and ramping up of vaccination.” He also said lockdown was not a child’s play, which could be enforced anytime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/before-imposing-curbs-check-impact-on-health-infra-experts/articleshow/88602394.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The remaining districts will follow suit.”The stress on vaccination on wheels is the impact of a letter from Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Wednesday to Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka and Jharkhand, advising them to enhance Covid-19 testing, strengthen the hospital-level preparedness, and increase the pace and the coverage of vaccination.The state’s daily vaccination came down to around 5-6 lakh in the last week of December, unlike the expected 7-8 lakh. Special efforts are being made to vaccinate people almost near their home.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the chief minister would conduct a review meeting with the officials from all the districts regarding the vaccination drive in two days’ time. “It would be imperative on the districts to ensure that they reach out to the left-out population or those who have skipped the second dose,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vax-on-wheels-in-seven-dists-after-letter-from-union-govt/articleshow/88602395.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Reacting to Pawar’s comments, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress, on Thursday claimed that after the 2019 polls, the BJP was desperate for power and ready to hold anyone’s hand.  Raut said they were aware who was talking to whom and, therefore, the BJP did not succeed. In Mumbai, NCP spokesman Nawab Malik on Thursday said: “Pawar told a public event in Pune on Wednesday that after the 2019 elections, BJP was insisting on formation of government with NCP for providing a stable government. BJP’s message was followed by a high-level internal meeting of senior Nationalist Congress Party leaders to consider the proposal. Then, Pawar had submitted that such an arrangement was not possible. As a result, the proposal was dropped.” (PTI with inputs from Prafulla Marpakwar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/modi-wanted-govt-with-ncp-in-state/articleshow/88602406.cms||---
---||Pune||Mumbai man nabbed after posing as Ahmedabad CP||PUNE: Khalilullah Aiyanulla Khan (41), an unemployed man from Oshiwara in Mumbai, who called and introduced himself to the Pimpri Chinchwad police as the Ahmedabad commissioner of police (CP), has landed in custody for cheating and other charges. Over a week’s time, Khan made at least 24 calls to the Pimpri Chinchwad police control room, asking the officials there to connect him with their police chief and other senior officials, claiming that he wanted to pass on to them information about an “impending weapons deal”. Initially, twin towns CP Krishna Prakash and other officers ignored his calls, but Khan’s repeated approach gave way to suspicion — especially when he asked the police to transfer Rs24,000 via a UPI payment service to an account “for paying the informer”. The matter was then referred to social security cell police inspector (PI) Devendra Chavan, and the police started engaging Khan in telephonic conversation while simultaneously trying to trace his location. The police also transferred Rs24,000 in phases to the account, with the intent to trace him based on bank details and cell phone location. They tracked him down and nabbed him in Jogeshwari. “Khan has no job and a couple of cheating cases to his name at Oshiwara, Goregaon, and Malad police stations in Mumbai. We have sought details of these cases from the Mumbai police,” PI Chavan said. A case of impersonation and cheating has been registered with the Chinchwad police. Chavan told TOI, “Khan used to run couple of furniture shops in Mumbai and one in Pune city. He shut down his business owing to heavy losses and since then, he is not working. He is married and has a son. His brothers and other relatives are supporting him financially. He is a free man and has time. He keeps on calling different control rooms and collects information on top police officers. He also makes random calls to individuals demanding money and has developed a habit of posing as policemen or police informer to demand money from cops.” He added, “Some police personnel pay him thinking that he will provide information. He then switches off his cell phone after receiving the money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-man-nabbed-after-posing-as-ahmedabad-cp/articleshow/88602407.cms||---

As per the CP, around 225 accused are on the run in cases related to Immoral (Prevention) of Trafficking Act (IPTA) registered at Lakadganj police stations in the last 10 years following raids at Ganga Jamuna. Police will now proceed with the legal processes under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to seize properties through court orders. The CP said maximum number of absconders is from Ganga Jamuna. “Keeping the status of ongoing litigations before the high court in mind and not fringing upon any issues being dealt by the judiciary, police will try to bring the absconders to book. The accused are yet to face criminal justice system,” said the CP. On August 11 this year, Kumar had closed down the sex work at Ganga Jamuna leading to socio-political protests and litigation too for contempt of court. After issuing a prohibitory order under section 144 of CrPC, the CP had went ahead to earmark certain venues as ‘public places’ before banning the sex work within the 200 metre as per the law. Kumar had also subsequently issued a notification under IPTA to prohibit customers visiting brothels and sex workers soliciting on the road. Despite protests, Kumar ensured a strong deployment of police force at Ganga Jamuna to stop visitors, especially customers, visit the brothels. He said eight brothels have been sealed and high court too had upheld his decision in a couple of them. “We will continue our crusade against the illegalities. Actions under externment provisions too are being contemplated,” said Kumar. In a latest controversy, it has come to fore the sex workers have started soliciting clients on mobile phones. A sex worker and her customer were also booked for making an audio clip viral in which they were heard levelling allegations against cops and abusing a woman officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-to-seize-properties-of-225-sex-racketeers-from-ganga-jamuna/articleshow/88600009.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||HC rules against police refusal to dalit body event at Reshimbagh||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has turned down the police’s rejection of permission for Bhim Army (Samvidhan Rakshak Dal) — a dalit organization — to hold an event marking the Koregaon-Bhima Shaurya Din event at Reshimbagh ground on January 1. The Hindutva fountainhead RSS’s Smruti Mandir campus is located next to the ground. The foundation day event of RSS is held each year at the ground. This is the second time that police had rejected permission to Bhim Army for holding an event at Reshimbagh citing law and order reasons. On February 2020, Dalit leader from Uttar Pradesh and founder of Bhim Army, Chandrashekhar Azad, had addressed a crowd at Reshimbagh. The permission was initially rejected but later secured through the court. The event against CAA-NRC was perhaps the first-ever such event at Reshimbagh in the recent past. The January 1 event is being held by Samvidhan Rakshak Dal, a splinter group separated from the Bhim Army. The Shaurya Din is observed to mark the bravery of Dalit soldiers in the British Indian army in the battle of Koregaon-Bhima against Peshwa in 1818. A smaller force is known to have taken on the 25,000 strong army of Peshwa. The Elgar Parishad case also had been linked to the Koregaon-Bhima event, ending up in violent incidents in 2018. Most of the accused continue to remain in custody. Praful Shinde of Samvidhan Rakshak Dal said it appears that the Reshimbagh ground has been reserved for a certain organisation. “Even last year police rejected permission on the grounds that a sensitive organization is located in the vicinity. Now, again we had to get the permission through the court. All other permissions required from the civic authorities and health departments were already secured,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-rules-against-police-refusal-to-dalit-body-event-at-reshimbagh/articleshow/88600014.cms||Shishir Arya

While each vehicle can collect waste from 1,000 houses, officials estimated that 370 more vehicles are required to reach 5.5 lakh houses and small commercial establishments. “We studied various combinations and scenarios to find out cost-effective means of doorstep collection and found that waste collection using light commercial vehicle is the most efficient way. Not only it reduces the cost involved, but also brings down manpower requirement. As per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, garbage should see smaller number of changes in hand,” corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara told TOI. Currently, pushcarts are used by conservancy workers to collect waste from houses. The collected waste is shifted to light commercial vehicles, thereby involving more people. “We will focus on door-to-door garbage collection in 2022. Better segregation at the source-level will also help to reduce dumping in the Vellalore yard. We are monitoring the routes of the light commercial vehicles to make sure that they stick to the routes,” Sunkara said.  Bulk waste generators should set up own composting units to treat the waste they generate. “Apartments, hotels and marriage halls constitute the major bulk waste generators. Those who are not able to set up composting units can tie up with the private agencies identified by us and hand over the waste for a fee.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/corpn-to-buy-370-vehicles-for-door-to-door-waste-collection/articleshow/88602416.cms||V Devanathan

---||Meerut||Meerut's Sotiganj market now sells chicken, fast food, clothes||MEERUT: Weeks after Sotiganj, India’s infamous car-breaking and stolen auto-parts market, was shut following a massive crackdown by UP Police, traders there said they have been forced to shift to other businesses. Decades-old scrap shops now sell chicken, fast food and clothes. “We are left with no option,” one of the auto-parts sellers told TOI on Thursday. Aslam Ali, who had been running a tyre scrap shop for two decades, has now started selling woolen clothes. Bittu Miyan’s rear-view mirror shop is now known as ‘Al-Shaquib Restaurant’. Wajid Khan, in vehicle scrap trade for years, is planning to turn his shop into a “fashionable footwear outlet”. Several big shops, whose owners are either under police radar or in prison, have been closed since December 12 after the UP government's recent decision to shut down the market. The state's "bold" move had drawn praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a public event recently. The dramatic makeover of Sotiganj is the talk of the town nowadays. "My father had started our tyre puncture shop when I was just born. It's been 23 years. I don't know why the police are after us. I lost my father last year and now I am the sole breadwinner in the family of six. I have unmarried sisters. I invested all my savings in starting a new business," says Aslam who took loans from friends to buy woolen apparel from Ludhiana. Small traders say they are sandwiched between "criminals and police". "I have legal documents and all the sale and purchase records, yet I was left with only two options -- either change my trade or go to jail," said MS Qureshi who now runs a fast food outlet. Shopkeepers said there is constant surveillance on them. "The PM recently said 'Sotiganj is shut'. We can't fight with the administration now," said Mohd Anwar, who now sells meat. SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary said police are not preventing anyone from doing business; they only want proper documentation. "Traders are changing their line of work on their own and keeping their shops closed," he said. Meerut's Sotiganj, with over 300 shops, has been notorious for its car parts and scrapyard business since the 1990s. TOI, in recent reports, had detailed how police carried out a massive crackdown on traders there leading to the closure of the market where automobiles -- from the most expensive to the least -- would be stolen from towns and cities across India and brought to Meerut. It would then be cut into pieces within hours, its parts sold separately or as scrap to customers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sotiganj-market-now-sells-chicken-fast-food-clothes/articleshow/88602419.cms||Ishita Mishra

This takes the official count of Omicron cases in the state to 14.Two of the 44-year-old’s family members have also tested positive for Covid-19. “The genome sequencing of their swab samples will be done to establish the variant,” Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, director of health services, said. The five new Omicron cases are from among the nine swab samples that tested positive for Covid-19 and whose genome sequencing was done at the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) here.Mohapatra said though the man from Bhubaneswar had no foreign travel history, he had recently been to Raipur and Hyderabad and may have come in contact with someone infected during the domestic travel.The other four, who have contracted Omicron, include two men who returned from the UAE, one from Qatar and a woman who returned from Congo. The condition of all the five is stable, the health authorities said. Two persons are admitted to a hospital in Bhubaneswar, including the one with no overseas travel history, one each in Paradip and Bhadrak while one person is in home isolation in Bhubaneswar.Experts said the local Omicron cases with no travel history is not surprising. “In the times to come, there will be more such cases like in the past waves. Omicron is spreading faster. However, there is no reason to panic. Better preparedness is needed to face any eventuality. People must not lower their guard at any cost,” Binod Patro, a professor of community medicine at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, said. E Venkata Rao, another professor of community medicine at IMS and SUM Hospital, said studies worldwide show Omicron may not be very dangerous. There would be quick jump in the number of cases because it is highly transmissible. However, it should not be a cause of worry since it’s less virulent unless there is further mutation.
