Soon after CM Yogi Adityanath started his address, some people in the crowd started demanding reservation for Nishads. Some people also shouted slogans like "Aarakshan nahin toh vote nahin" and showed placards during the address of Union home minister Amit Shah. After the Union home minister and the chief minister left the venue, UP MSME minister, Sidharth Nath Singh, who has been entrusted with the responsibility of doing away with legal roadblocks in granting reservation to Nishads, asked people not to lose hope and added that the government would fulfil its promise. "We were told that we will be given reservation and an announcement about the same will be made in the rally," one of the agitators said. The statement issued by the Nishad Party about the rally did mention that the BJP leaders could announce reservation for Nishads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-supporters-protest-for-reservation-in-lucknow/articleshow/88348042.cms||---
---||Goa||We have to stick together through FC Goa’s tough period: Aiban||Panaji: Even the severest of doubters wouldn’t have expected FC Goa to lose their first three games in the Indian Super League (ISL). For a team that maintained a record unbeaten run of 15 matches last season, the results shocked everyone. Coach Juan Ferrando tried so much; new players, new formation, new style, new approach, and when nothing worked, his last throw of the dice was a 3-5-2 formation. Goa had never played with three at the back since the Spanish revolution started here in 2017 under Sergio Lobera. But it’s something that has fetched six points for the team from their last two matches. And some respectability on the points table. “We didn’t have much time to prepare for the system, but as players we have to be ready,” said defender Aiban Dohling, who started both winning games. “The coach can change the system anytime and you have to be ready. We have 29 players in the team, and like the coach said, it’s important to be ready for every game, every situation.” After winning the Durand Cup, and given how they performed last season with almost the same squad, many pundits had Goa as their pre-season favourites. The opening loss against Mumbai was thought to be an aberration, but losses against Jamshedpur FC and NorthEast United set alarm bells ringing. “As we all know, it was not a good start to the season, but as professional players, we have to cope with this. To be honest, everyone is hurt at the club, from the players to staff and management. This club is all about winning. “As a group of players, we have to stick together through this tough period. We have now improved as a team. We are looking forward to this (challenge) and we will surely improve with every game,” said Aiban. The centre-back has started three of Goa’s five matches this season and is on course to have more minutes under the belt than the last two seasons. His toughest challenge will be in the next game as Hyderabad FC, with Bartholomew Ogbeche upfront, come calling. “For the last two games, we played as a team, so it doesn’t really concern us that Hyderabad scored five (in the last game against NorthEast United). We are prepared for every aspect. It’s a big game and we are looking forward to it,” said Aiban, who joined Goa in 2019 after a sterling season with Shillong Lajong in the I-League.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/we-have-to-stick-together-through-fc-goas-tough-period-aiban/articleshow/88348187.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||Ferrando calls for collective effort as FC Goa face in-form Hyderabad||Panaji: FC Goa coach Juan Ferrando has sought to play down the absence of Jorge Ortiz and is instead focusing on the team, ahead of an important clash against Hyderabad FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Saturday. Ortiz picked up his first ever red card in the previous game against Bengaluru FC and must now serve an automatic one-match suspension. The Spanish forward is an integral part of the team, creating and finishing chances. This season, he already has four goal contributions and his absence could hurt Goa. Ferrando, though, is focusing on players who are available to him and is keen to continue the repair job after three losses in a row at the start. “The most important detail for me is that the team is focused on the match against Hyderabad,” said Ferrando, whose side, after the initial stutter, has won two matches in a row. “All the 29 players should be ready. There will be injuries, and in this case a red card for Jorge. The other details are not so important. It’s a distraction.” In two seasons, Goa have never lost against Hyderabad, winning three of the four matches. Last season, they secured a draw in the concluding league clash to seal the final playoff spot, ahead of Manolo Marquez’s side. This season, though, Hyderabad have only got better. They are the only team to put it across defending champions Mumbai City and have won three of the last four matches. “It’s a difficult game because Hyderabad have good balance. The young players are in very good physical condition and there are experienced players too. They have a good mix. It’s the best team at this point,” said Ferrando. Marquez wouldn’t agree. On the evidence of the first five matches, Mumbai have appeared to be the strongest, never mind the fact that Hyderabad grabbed all points on offer when the teams clashed. "FC Goa are an interesting team. They play a style of football that I like. They are similar to Mumbai City, but for me, Mumbai are one step ahead of everyone. It will be a difficult game for us, but it will be difficult for Goa too," said Marquez. Hyderabad put up a five-star performances against NorthEast United with 16 shots, six of them on target. Bartholomew Ogbeche scored a brace to take his individual tally to five and the Nigerian striker will be eager to continue with his rich scoring form. “It is not normal that Goa lost three games in a row, after the record unbeaten run at the end of last season. They seem to have changed their system in the last two games, but still play really good football, sticking to their style,” said Marquez. Ferrando tried the 3-5-2 formation against SC East Bengal and Bengaluru, winning both games. The Goans, though, are unlikely to play a similar style against Hyderabad, particularly with Ortiz missing and Spanish striker Airam Cabrera almost certain to return to the starting lineup. “It’s important to focus on the transitions. Hyderabad know when is the best moment (to attack) during transitions. They stay calm and are ready. We have to take care of all these details,” said Ferrando.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ferrando-calls-for-team-work-as-fc-goa-face-in-form-hyderabad/articleshow/88348211.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

In one of the greatest swings in modern times, the Liberal Democrats overturned a majority of nearly 23,000 in the North Shropshire byelection and seized the true-blue stronghold by a margin of 5,925 votes. Johnson said the result was "very disappointing" and he "heard what the voters said", blaming the political earthquake on a "constant litany of stuff about politicians" in the media rather than the booster jab rollout. The byelection in the agricultural constituency of North Shropshire was triggered after Owen Paterson, the MP since 1997, resigned in November after the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards concluded he breached lobbying rules and recommended his suspension. Paterson denies the allegations. A string of stories about Christmas parties in Downing Street and the Conservative headquarters in breach of lockdown rules in 2020 ensued whilst a controversy over donations used to fund the PM’s flat refurbishment resurfaced. A rebellion by 100 Conservative MPs against vaccine passports on Tuesday demonstrating discontentment on the Tory backbenches at Johnson’s leadership encouraged more people to vote Liberal Democrats, said Conservative Shropshire councillor and mayor of Market Drayton Roy Aldcroft. The people of North Shropshire were unhappy with "what was going on in London" he said, and unhappy at the delivery of Brexit, he added. North Shropshire voted "Leave". "There is the Irish problem, the French fishing problem, and we have got HGVs hanging at ports because of all the paperwork required," he added. The people of North Shropshire are also incensed at how Paterson was treated. "He was a long-standing energetic MP who was doing a good job and they feel aggrieved about the way he was forced into resignation. Had he stood he would have won," he said. The Conservative candidate, Dr Neil Shastri-Hurst, a barrister and surgeon of Indian heritage, was parachuted in from Birmingham without local knowledge of the area, said Mark Whittle, deputy mayor of Market Drayton. "More than half the people in the town could not pronounce his name. He was the totally wrong person for Shropshire." Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, has announced he will accept letters demanding a vote of no confidence in Johnson "by email". Fifteen per cent of Tory MPs could trigger a vote. Sir Roger Gale MP said: "One more strike and he’s out."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/questions-raised-over-boris-johnsons-leadership-after-conservatives-lose-ultra-safe-seat-in-bypoll/articleshow/88348698.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Earlier this week, a retired judge of Pakistan’s apex court, Wajihuddin Ahmed, who had resigned from the PTI in 2016, claimed that the now-estranged party leader Jahangir Tareen had been providing Rs 3 million every month for Khan to run his household. The amount, Ahmed alleged during a TV interview, had been increased to Rs 5 million later. According to Ahmed, the public perception of Imran Khan being an honest man was completely wrong. Tareen, in a posting on Twitter, however, denied the allegation. Soon after its telecast, the interview went viral on social media and was subsequently picked up by mainstream media outlets. “Some TV stations made a campaign out of Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed’s allegations,” said information minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, vowing that the government would pursue a case against all channels that had reported on Ahmed’s allegations without verification. The minister further said that the government had also decided to file a “criminal defamation” suit against Ahmed for his allegations. Appealing to the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of all high courts to ensure that the respect of institutions was upheld, the minister suggested the formation of special division benches at district and high court levels to deal specifically with defamation cases. Speaking with reporters in Karachi after the minister’s presser, Ahmed maintained that his statement was accurate and added that he had no problem with the government filing a defamation suit. To a question, he said that Tareen had no choice but to deny the allegation. “These expenses are out of the books and are not accounted for. Hence, it was easy for him to deny it,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pak-minister-threatens-tv-channels-for-airing-allegations-against-pm-imran/articleshow/88348813.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||India||Poll panel & PMO had 'informal' meet; no impropriety, says EC functionary||NEW DELHI: A video-conference between the full Election Commission and the Prime Minister’s Office last month that had helped sort out differences between the law ministry and EC over long-pending electoral reforms, has sparked off allegations from the Opposition parties and even a former chief election commissioner, regarding breach of protocol and Constitutional impropriety. As per the norm, the three EC members maintain a safe distance from the Executive, in the interest of maintaining their independence and neutrality. They do have regular interactions with the law ministry, the nodal administrative ministry, or the home ministry to discuss Central para-military forces’ deployment for polls. When reached by TOI, a senior EC functionary denied any breach of protocol or Constitutional impropriety in the CEC and election commissioners having an online, informal interaction with a senior PMO official. The EC functionary disclosed that the CEC and election commissioners, when requested by the PMO for a short, informal discussion to get a sense of their thinking regarding issues on which EC and law ministry officials were not in concurrence, unanimously agreed to skip the bureaucratic red-tape and come on board to break the logjam that has kept the proposed electoral reforms pending for almost 25 years. A source said the law ministry had earlier written to the EC stating that it “expects” the CEC to attend a formal meeting with PMO on electoral reforms. Incidentally, PMO had, in its original communication to the law ministry and Cabinet secretariat regarding the meeting, never suggested CEC or election commissioners’ presence, another source added. CEC Sushil Chandra is said to have taken strong exception to the letter from the law ministry and told the secretary that it was highly improper to “expect” the CEC or ECs to be part of such a meeting. In fact, all three members of EC concurred that they would not be part of the meeting. The meeting was finally held with EC officials. Yet some differences and doubts – on the number of qualifying dates in a year for registration of a newly-eligible voter, aadhaar-voter ID linkage and requisitioning of premises by EC – remained despite the meeting with EC officials. Around 15-20minutes after the meeting, a senior PMO official reached out to EC, inviting the CEC and election commissioners to an informal video-conference to directly hear their views so that the reforms proposal could be finalised. The CEC and election commissioners agreed to the direct interaction over VC, not wanting bureaucratic procedures and red-tape to delay the reforms beyond the current Parliament session. “It took just 5 minutes to paper over the differences and finalise the draft amendments to R P Act,” an EC functionary told TOI. Former CEC S Y Quraishi, however, alleged impropriety at multiple levels, starting with the PMO to law ministry in that they virtually issued a “diktat” to the Commission members to be part of the meeting. Also, he wondered why EC agreed to the interaction with PMO after having rightly refused to be part of the original meeting. “The reforms have been pending for last 20 years, EC has been writing letters pushing for their implementation. Why this sudden surgery for a chronic illness?” he asked. Quraishi also said the interaction with PMO had led to speculation as to what was really discussed with EC. “Were the dates for the coming assembly polls discussed too?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poll-panel-pmo-had-informal-meet-no-impropriety-says-ec-functionary/articleshow/88348928.cms||Bharti Jain

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Surya Kant and Vikram Nath said that a nuanced and individualised approach needed to be taken towards such people and they be accommodated as per their suitability. Busting the general perception that mental disorders results in violent behavior, the bench referred to various scientific studies and judgments and laws of other countries and said it is extremely important to not stigmatise or discriminate against persons having mental health issues or any other form of disability. "Many people with mental health disorders are willing and able to work. However, socio-structural barriers impede their participation in the workforce. Exclusion from the workforce not only creates conditions of material deprivation, but it also results in isolation and marginalisation," the judgment said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-people-with-mental-disorders-have-right-against-workplace-bias/articleshow/88348984.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

He was addressing a media briefing here after holding a two-day 'Camp Sitting and Public Open Hearing' for human rights violation cases. "There is no room for fake encounters in a civilized society. They are barbaric. There is no room for instant justice in this country and law has to take its own course. Anyone found guilty has to be tried in court and punished in accordance with the law," he said. The state witnessed at least 31 deaths in police action while trying to flee from custody since the BJP-led government took charge in May this year. Delhi-based lawyer Arif Jwadder in July had lodged a complaint with the NHRC over the alleged fake encounters. The case is pending. The NHRC can recommend for compensation, registration of a criminal case against those involved and recommend action against those found guilty if any encounter is found to be fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/barbaric-nhrc-chief-says-on-assam-fake-encounters/articleshow/88349085.cms||Mukut Das
---||India||PM Modi: ‘Tod-phod’ no way to meet modern needs||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said “demolition (todna phodna)” of existing structures while transforming urban areas is not the way to meet the changing needs of modern times, presenting the example of the redevelopment of Kashi Vishwanath temple as an example of merging tradition with rejuvenation. Addressing an all India mayors’ conference in Varanasi virtually, Modi said the work in Kashi shows how redevelopment can meet current requirements while conserving history. "We believe in evolution and we don’t need revolution today. We need rejuvenation of urban areas. Demolition of all old structures and destroying everything that’s old is not our way of doing things. We need to modernise while conserving the old and what we have for years," he said. The prime minister's comments are also significant in the context of the Central Vista redevelopment in the capital where critics have accused the government of not being mindful of heritage. Modi said most Indian towns and cities are rooted in tradition and their rejuvenation should be achieved while conserving those traditions. As chief minister of Gujarat, he had overseen what is now regarded as the successful redevelopment of the Sabarmati riverfront. The PM reiterated his earlier statement that the development of Varanasi (Kashi) could be the road map for the rest of the country. "He remarked that these cities can teach us how to preserve heritage and local skills. The Prime Minister insisted that destroying existing structures is not the way but emphasis should be on rejuvenation and preservation. This should be done in accordance with the requirements of modern times," a statement issued by the PMO said. Modi urged mayors to take actions during their tenures that are remembered by the people they serve. He asked the mayors to have healthy competition between the wards in their municipalities on cleanliness parameters. He also urged the city chief to find out the "birthdays" of their cities and celebrate them in a big way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-tod-phod-no-way-to-meet-modern-needs/articleshow/88349183.cms||---
---||India||Delhi: Schools & colleges to reopen, juniors to resume on Dec 27||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday allowed reopening of schools, colleges and other educational institutions in the city with immediate effect. Schools can resume Classes 6 to 12 for now while the junior students can return from December 27. Most schools said they will be reopening on Monday. This respite has, however, come at a time when Covid cases are once again rising in the city with new cases of the Omicron variant being detected every day. Principals TOI spoke to said parents could now be reluctant to send their children to school, particularly when they remain unvaccinated. The commission said in its order that since it has received a large number of representations with "compelling necessity" to open educational institutions, permission has been granted with the AQI improving from "severe" to "very poor. The order pointed out that the arguments were on the following lines: "Children are out of school for about two years, leading to frustration among them with a serious adverse effect on their studies. A large number of students are not able to get the facility of online education because of connectivity issues. As per the academic programme, schools are required to impart education to children for about 220 days annually. Not opening schools is hampering physical and mental health as well as emotional growth of children." School education in the capital has been badly disrupted by closures because of air pollution and Covid. Senior students (9 to 12) had returned to school, albeit for practicals and clearing of doubts, in September. The junior kids returned on November 1. However, the deteriorating air quality forced the closure of schools once again on November 13 followed by reopening on November 29. That respite didn’t last long and the schools were once again closed on December 3. A lot of parents had pleaded with the Delhi government and the commission, asking for schools to be reopened. The directorate of education (DoE) of the Delhi government and the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights had also written to the commission. Immediately after the commission issued its order, the DoE also issued instructions to the schools, asking them to inform the parents about the decision. Welcoming the reopening, the Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, an umbrella body, said, "As always, the school fraternity looks forward to welcoming our kids back to school. Schools can think of adjusting hours to make it comfortable for kids to reach schools in winter. I am certain that schools will ensure safe and smooth running of physical schooling." Some principals, however, are apprehensive that the spurt in the number of Covid cases may have an impact on attendance. "We will be starting school for Classes 6 to 12 from Monday. Now that the board exams are almost over, we can easily call 50% of the students. However, with Omicron cases rising in Delhi, I am not sure how the parents are going to react," said Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School. Some parents feel that the government will once again close down schools due to rising Covid cases. Tanya Aggarwal, parent of a Class 1 child, said: "A good move but too little, too late. There was no logic to delaying school opening for so long — first for Covid-19 and then for pollution — while everything else was open. We have lost a lot of time for no reason. This opening is meaningless as it coincides with the winter break, and if Omicron intensifies, children and their education are likely to be the first and easiest target of restrictions once again while election campaigns and other activities will continue unrestricted."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-schools-colleges-to-reopen-juniors-to-resume-on-dec-27/articleshow/88349239.cms||---

The three awarded life terms are Mohammad Paigambar Sheikh, Ahmad Ali, alias Kalu, and Nur Alam Momin. The special court of ADJ-XV Gurvinder Singh Malhotra also sentenced Dilawar Hossain, Abdul Karim, Mustafizur Rehman, Arif Hussain and Mohammad Adil Sheikh to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment. All the convicts are from Murshidabad, West Bengal. Appearing for NIA, special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha and additional public prosecutor Pramod Kumar had left it to the court to decide the fate of the convicted terrorists as they had already confessed their involvement in the terror act. The court had convicted them on December 10 after accepting their confessional petitions. The ninth accused, Mohammad Jehidul Islam, is still facing trial in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bodh-gaya-blast-life-in-jail-for-3-10-yrs-for-5/articleshow/88349407.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||India||Avoid mass gatherings, non-essential travel: Govt||NEW DELHI: Underlining that India faces a stage of "worry" with the onset of winters, officials said if daily cases in the United Kingdom and France are extrapolated in the context of India's population, they would mean 14-15 lakh cases a day. The Centre recorded total 101 cases infected with the new SARS-COV2 variant Omicron from 11 states detected through genome sequencing. "As Omicron is spreading very fast across Europe and most parts of the world, there is a need to avoid non-essential travel and mass gatherings. New Year celebrations have to be low-key," ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said. While Maharashtra (32), Delhi (22) and Rajasthan (17) have reported maximum number of cases, Karnataka and Telangana have recorded eight each, Gujarat and Kerala five each, and Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal one each till 4pm on Friday. The government said only one or two cases are without travel history or contacts with those having travel history. However, in such cases, contact tracing is still going on. The government also said that it may be premature at this stage to extrapolate data of Omicron positive cases detected through genome sequencing to do a modelling for absolute numbers. Asked if India is carrying out adequate genomic sequencing, officials said sufficient systematic strategic sampling is being undertaken for genomic sequencing to detect Omicron cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/avoid-mass-gatherings-non-essential-travel-govt/articleshow/88349488.cms||---

The order stated that the Lt Governor “is pleased to accord sanction to the dismissal” with effect from October 21, 2021, by invoking Article 311 of the Constitution. Besides condemning him to rigorous imprisonment, a fast track court in Jammu imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on Abrol on October 23. According to the prosecution, the woman from Ramban in southern Kashmir met Abrol of Jammu when she was contesting a case against her then husband and the judicial officer promised her legal help. In return, he asked her to work as a house help at Rs 5,000 a month in his home as he was living alone. He also promised to pay for her daughter’s education. The mother agreed and took up the job, and Abrol got her marriage dissolved with her husband by getting a divorce deed notarised with one of his security guards as witness, the prosecution said. But the woman’s parents wanted her back with them. “When Abrol got wind that she might leave, he filled her ‘maang’ with ‘babuti’ and told her that she is now his wife,” the prosecution said. By doing so, he secured her consent to have a physical relationship with her. Later, he called a priest and a few friends and “solemnised” the marriage in his house. After a year, she came to know that Abrol has married another woman and had divorced his first wife. She then filed a case of rape and cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rape-convicted-jk-sub-judge-dismissed-from-service/articleshow/88349505.cms||M Saleem Pandit

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai refused to entertain a PIL filed by Delhi riots victims and asked them to approach the Delhi HC. But when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves contended that a petition is pending in the HC for the last two years and nothing was happening in that case, the bench asked the HC to decide the case within three months.tnn Petitioners claim a straight-forward case for registering FIR We are not inclined to entertain this writ petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner, submits that no progress has been made in the writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India before the High Court, though this court directed the HC to decide the writ petition expeditiously two years back. We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petition filed by the petitioner expeditiously, preferably within a period of three months from today," the court said. The petitioners alleged that there was a straightforward case for registration of FIR based on video evidence of speeches already in public domain. It was argued that the delay in deciding the matter was not justified. On March 4 last year, the apex court had asked the HC to hear a plea seeking lodging of FIRs against some BJP leaders for alleged hate speeches which purportedly led to the riots in Delhi. The plea by some riot victims had sought registration of FIR against BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and Abhay Verma besides some others for their alleged hate speeches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-to-hc-rule-soon-on-hate-speech-fir/articleshow/88349574.cms||---

Cops are learnt to have detained a scientist for questioning, an intelligence agency source said. Police suspect the plan may have been to murder a lawyer due to personal enmity. The suspect was allegedly in court along with the target on the day of the blast. When asked if the suspect was connected with Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), a senior police officer refused to comment. Cops are likely to hold a briefing on the case on Saturday noon. Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana had formed over a dozen teams to track down the perpetrators. The teams scanned the footage of over 120 CCTV cameras located at and around Rohini Court. A dozen suspects were narrowed down upon and verified individually. Another team meanwhile scanned the profiles of those present in courtroom 102 on the day of the incident and interviewed them individually. The leads came through this exercise, the source said. An improvised explosive device (IED), assembled in a steel tiffin box and kept inside a laptop bag, exploded inside a courtroom at Rohini Court on the morning of December 9, causing a chaotic situation. The explosion was of very low intensity and a policeman deployed there was the only one injured in the incident. However, the steel tiffin box was blown to pieces. TOI had first reported on December 10 that the IED used in the blast was a nitrate-based device which was activated with a timer and the person who planted it may have left the courtroom just before the blast. The explosion couldn't happen with full intensity because of an improperly woven circuit, cops suspect. The white powder found at the spot was the unburnt explosive powder. With no outfit claiming the explosion, the cops suspected the involvement of a lone wolf behind the incident. Soon after the explosion, it was suspected that a laptop may have exploded but the blast spot pictures circulated internally amongst all units led the cops to launch a full blast site investigation. According to police, the suspicious explosion at room number 102 happened when a court proceeding was underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delhi-rohini-court-blast-a-murder-bid-not-terror-attack/articleshow/88349575.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Bengaluru||Avani ends season on a high||Bengaluru: Teen wonder Avani Prashanth ended her breakthrough season with another title at the Kalhaar Blues & Greens Golf Club in Ahmedabad on Friday. The 15-year-old Bengalurean annexed the IGU All-India junior golf championship with a six-shot victory over Puneet Kaur and defending champion Sneha Singh in Category ‘A’ (15-17 years).Avani, who had clinched the all-India Ladies crown three weeks ago, completed a rare All-India double in both the senior and junior categories. Sneha Singh had done it in 2019 and Indian golf’s poster girl, Aditi Ashok, won the double in 2014.Avani, the ninth standard student of Greenwood High International School, would have hoped to have gone lower, but the windswept course and the tricky greens made scoring difficult.Avani shot two-over 74 on the final day for a cumulative score of six-over 222. Puneet Kaur and Sneha finished on 12-over 228. The highlight of Avani’s round was an eagle two on the par-4 13th hole. She holed a 120-yard gap wedge second shot following a 7-wood tee shot.“It feels great to end the year on a winning note,” said Avani, who also won two Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour titles this year. “My scores could have been better, but Kalhaar was playing pretty tough,” added the highest-ranked Indian on the World Amateur Golf Rankings at 136. The talented golfer, one of the top 100 child prodigies, will receive the prestigious Global Child Prodigy Award in Dubai in February.BIG WIN FOR BINUAnother Karnataka golfer, Shaurya Binu, got a breakthrough win, clinching the boys’ Category ‘A’ title with a seven-shot victory over Krishna Nikhil Chopra. Shaurya, who trains at the Tarun Sardesai Golf Academy based out of Zion Hills Golf County in Kolar, shot a closing one-under 71. He finished with a four-day total of one-over 289.This was the 17-year-old’s maiden title in the junior ranks. Shaurya, who also plays on the IGU amateur tour, had finished third in the Western India amateurs recently.Final scores: Category ‘A’ (15-17 years): Boys: 289: Shaurya Binu (Kar, 73, 71, 74, 71); 296: Krishna Nikhil Chopra (Del); 300: Shat Mishra (Har).Girls: 222: Avani Prashanth (Kar, 75, 73, 74); 228: Puneet Kaur Bajwa (Pun), Sneha Singh (Tel).Category ‘B’ (13-14): Boys: 298: Aarav D Shah (UP); 317: Gurnavjeet S Bhatia (Pun); 320: Manoj S (Kar, 81, 78, 88, 73).

---||Bengaluru||Accenture has stellar Q1, raises rev guidance||Bengaluru: Accenture has demonstrated another “beat and raise” quarter. It’s revenue growth in its first quarter ended November beat analysts’ expectations. And it raised its fiscal 2022 (ending next August) revenue forecast to 19%-22%, from 12%-15% that it had indicated in September. The announcement sent the company’s share price soaring by nearly 7% on the Nasdaq.Analysts expect Accenture’s strong upward revision in revenue forecast to augur well for Indian IT players. On the BSE on Friday, every sector index closed down, barring the IT index, which rose.Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said in an earnings call that “more companies are embracing compressed transformation, underpinned by cloud and digital and are moving to build their digital core and use technology to transform how they operate and to find new ways to compete and grow.” Sweet said cloud has emerged as the centrepiece to the transformation programmes. Moshe Katri, MD of Wedbush Securities, said in a note that he believes the pandemic-driven, multi-year spending cycle on digital transformation initiatives will likely continue to drive strong industry growth. Accenture’s order bookings grew to $16.8 billion, a 30% increase year-on-year, with record consulting bookings of $9.4 billion and outsourcing bookings of $7.4 billion. Accenture added 50,000 people during the first quarter, more than what India’s largest IT company, TCS, adds in a full year. Sweet said when the pandemic hit, “we were ready with capabilities at scale, reflected in 70% of our revenue at that time being from digital, cloud and security.” She said there was a focus on growing “our people through learning, allowing us to rapidly reskill with an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity, and the quality and caring for our people professionally and personally, making us a talent magnet in a tight labour market.”Emkay Financial Services said clients have also become more amenable to price increases. “Accenture has also indicated that it is seeing an improvement in pricing in many parts of its business, which should support margins,” it said. Accenture expects operating margin this fiscal to be between 15.2% and 15.4%, a 10 to 30 basis points expansion over the 2021 fiscal. Phil Fersht, CEO of IT consulting firm HfS Research, said: “We are seeing a strong push to drive new growth to offset margin pressures from several of the market leaders. Accenture is an example of hypergrowth over the past year and will likely surpass 700,000 staff this year. The increasing cost of staff to combat attrition is driving the need for growth at a scale where these costs are absorbed by new revenues and increased deployment of SaaS and automation. However, I do expect there to be some negative impacts on margins across all the market leaders as this growth is ingested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/accenture-has-stellar-q1-raises-rev-guidance/articleshow/88349626.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Both lived together near Da Ra Bendre Park in Yelahanka New Town.Police said Shyam brought an unresponsive Ganga to a nearby hospital in the wee hours of Wednesday and told doctors she had fallen accidentally while cleaning the washroom. The hospital staff suspected foul play, registered a medico-legal case and informed police.When police questioned Shyam, he initially stuck to the same story but later confessed to having killed her. Shyam and Ganga met a few years ago when she joined his yoga class. They fell in love and started a live-in relationship in December 2020. Ganga started demanding that he marry her, but he kept postponing it. Eventually, they finalised the date for February 2022. Meanwhile, Ganga had borrowed Rs 1 lakh from Shyam a few months ago, and he started demanding that she return his money. “On Tuesday night, they fought over the issue. When she abused him, he assaulted her with a blunt object and smothered her to death,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/yoga-teacher-arrested-for-partners-murder/articleshow/88349632.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru doctors OK with raising age for marriage, but not activists||BENGALURU: While many doctors term the Union cabinet’s decision to increase marriageable age from 18 to 21 for women in India a fantastic move, child rights activists have raised concerns. Describing it as a kneejerk reaction, the activists, who are working with the government in prevention of child marriages, say the matter needs to be first discussed with experts on the field. “We are a country that has so far failed in preventing child marriages. There is a need to create awareness among men and women about women’s sexual and reproductive rights,” one activist said. Vasudeva Sharma, executive director, Child Rights Trust, Bengaluru, said: “Efforts at preventing child marriage have failed because of lack of public education and awareness. There are not enough personnel and tools in the women and child welfare department to prevent them.” Raising marriageable age without amending the age for consensual sex in Pocso Act, which is 18 now, does not make sense at all, said Anjali Ramanna, chairperson, child welfare committee (CWC), Bengaluru. “The move will only increase the number of young women in the age group of 18-21 going for medical termination of pregnancy as they won’t be able to start a family till they are 21. This will further have an adverse effect on women’s health,” said Ramanna, who has been witnessing an increase in teenage pregnancy cases before the CWC. According to Ramanna, the move would also lead to more cases of doctored ageproof documents to suit the new age limit for marriage. “The reasons for child marriage in North Karnataka are different from those in places like Bengaluru,” Ramanna said, adding that these reasons and also belief systems need to be tackled to ensure prevention of child marriage, and raising the age limit for marriage is not the answer. She said what’s needed is awareness and stringent implementation of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, by addressing the belief system and parents’ concerns over early exposure to children in cities. According to Sharma, the reasons for failure in preventing child marriages are systemic. The women and child welfare department lacks personnel as well as the required approach in this regard. “This is nothing but a kneejerk reaction, which will only create more criminals in society, as marriage prior to 21 years will now become a punishable offence,” he said. Sharma pointed out that right to education in India is up to 14 years, whereas the Child and Adolescent Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act allows only those above 18 to be employed. “Why is the right to education only till 14? What should they do if their education is not continued after 14? Where is free transport for children in rural areas to go to colleges in urban localities? Are there free hostel facilities for every girl child wanting to study in cities?” he asked. He said the decision to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act cannot be taken in silos, without looking into these aspects. WHY GYNAECOLOGISTS BACK GOVT MOVE:Many gynaecologists support the government move to raise the minimum age for marriage. “Our main concern is about young girls in rural areas who get married at 18 and become pregnant at 19 when they are physically and psychologically not prepared for motherhood. The chances of miscarriage, anaemia, toxemia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) and stress are more in teenage pregnancies,” said Dr Manjula Patil, a gynaecologist and member of Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India. Dr Anupama HS, a gynaecologist working in rural areas of Uttara Kannada district for over two decades, said the move is good considering the larger benefits. “It equalises the eligible age for marriage for both men and women. It’s good for a pregnant woman and her child. A girl has to be intellectually mature to accept motherhood,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/docs-ok-with-raising-age-for-marriage-but-not-activists/articleshow/88349634.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka scribe refused relief; let him suffer, says Supreme Court||BENGALURU: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a Kannada weekly journalist’s appeal challenging his conviction and onemonth jail term for writing defamatory articles against an advocate. Terming the language used by the petitioner tantamount to yellow journalism, the apex court declined to interfere with the verdict of the Karnataka high court dated March 19, 2021. “What kind of journalism is this? We have to protect lawyers too. One month is very less. Let him suffer,” a threejudge bench comprising chief justice NV Ramana and justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli observed while refusing to entertain the petition filed by DS Vishwanatha Shetty, proprietor, publisher, editor and printer of ‘Tunga Varthe’, a Kannada weekly with wide publication in and around Koppa, Sringeri, and Narasimharajapura taluks of Chikkamagaluru district. On January 21, 2013, Shetty was sentenced to one-year jail and slapped with a Rs 6,000 fine (Rs 4,000 payable to complainant) by a trial court at Narasimharajapura under Section 501 of IPC (defamation) for publishing a series of articles against Koppa-based advocate and notary TN Rathnaraj in his publication in 2008. On January 14, 2015, the principal sessions judge, Chikkamagaluru, confirmed said sentence. Thereafter, Shetty moved the high court, contending that he had published the articles in good faith with an intention to expose the complainant and, therefore, he is protected under exceptions contained under Section 499 of IPC. However, the high court upheld his conviction while partly allowing his criminalrevision petition and modified the sentence. The journalist’s jail term was reduced to one month but enhanced the fine to Rs 50,000. It was also ordered that out of the fine amount of Rs 50,000, a sum of Rs 40,000 should be paid to the complainant as compensation and the balance of Rs 10,000 remitted to the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/scribe-refused-relief-let-him-suffer-says-sc/articleshow/88349635.cms||Vasantha Kumar

A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi made this observation while disposing of a city doctor’s PIL. The four-day conference, which commenced on Thursday, is being attended by paediatricians and neonatologists at Golden Amoon Resort, Hoskote, Bengaluru Rural. Earlier, the organisers submitted a memo stating there were only 305 participants and no permission is required from the authorities for holding a conference with under 500 attendees. The court was also told all Covid precautions have been taken and SOPs would be strictly adhered to, with only those testing negative and having taken both doses of vaccine allowed to participate. In its memo, the government submitted that on Thursday, a spot inspection was conducted by taluk health officials and police officers and no instance of violation of the latest SOP conditions was found. However, Shridhar Prabhu, counsel for the petitioner, contended that in an advisory dated November 28, the government had advised healthcare professionals to conduct conferences and seminars virtually for a few more months to “send a positive message” in public interest. He said only one or two paediatricians and neonatologists are usually available per district and it is not advisable for them to attend the conference during a pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/adhere-to-covid-norms-hc-tells-med-conference-organisers/articleshow/88349638.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Canada-bound family not allowed to board over Covid testing issues||BENGALURU: Qatar Airways ground staff allegedly disallowed a Canada-bound family of four, including two children, from taking a flight for which the airline itself had introduced a Doha-London leg, citing Covid testing issues. The family members alleged the airline staff was not convinced that the Canada approved RT-LAMP Covid testing kits they carried for use during their transit in London were a legitimate substitute for RT-PCR tests. The family even relented and agreed to pre-book RT-PCR tests at London, but the staff declared them as ‘no show’. The incident unfolded on Sunday morning after Coimbatore resident Kathiresan Jegadeesan, 33, his wife, sixyear old-son and one-year-old daughter reached Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to board Qatar Airways flight QR 573 (Bengaluru to Doha). The airline had on its own cancelled the Canada-bound family’s Bengaluru-Doha-Montreal trip and rescheduled it by introducing a Doha-London leg for transit to ensure safe travel. “We had initially booked tickets from Bengaluru to Doha to Montreal but Qatar Airways forced us to reschedule them via London citing some Covid testing problems at Doha. Their customer care representative assured us on phone that an RT-LAMP test result was permitted in London for Canada-bound passengers and thereafter, I accepted the tickets for the new route,” Kathiresan, an IT engineer in Montreal, said. “At the check-in counter of Bengaluru airport, the ground staff of Qatar Airways mentioned about pre-booking Covid tests for us during London transit and then I showed them the RT-LAMP self-testing Covid kit approved by Canadian health authorities we would be using to generate results. But they were clueless on what an RT-LAMP test was,” he lamented. Incidentally, Qatar Airways is one of the official partners of Switch Health, the Canadian makers of the molecular diagnostic self-testing kit RT-LAMP, approved by the Canadian government mainly for air passengers returning to their country. The government website of the Canada travel approves the same. However, the ground staff didn’t bother to crosscheck the information despite the desperate family attempting to show them the guidelines. “They were clearly ignorant on the testing method and knew only about RT-PCR,” the techie claimed. “I finally said I will pre-book RT-PCR tests at London but they raised another issue — they said the transit is only for five hours and if the flight reaching London is delayed, there will not be enough time to get an RT-PCR test done,” Kathiresan added. The family was not only denied boarding but also had to suffer mental agony and lose the ticket money. Their attempts to reach the airline customer care for an explanation were futile. Qatar Airways did not respond to queries from TOI on the matter via Twitter and email.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/canada-bound-family-not-allowed-to-board-over-covid-testing-issues/articleshow/88349639.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Discrimination still plagues women in science, say experts||BENGALURU: Science is considered more logical, above and away from conservative mindsets of society. However, the domain is deeply embedded in society and patriarchal in practices, said sociologist Gita Chadha. Chadha, who is at the forefront of developing Feminist Science Studies in India, was a speaker at The Fall of the Apple, a discussion on Gender Inequity in Science at the Bangalore International Centre (BIC) on Thursday. In India, science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) stream comprises 48% women, but the number doesn’t reflect the reality of gender equity, experts said. They said discrimination, instances of sexual harassment that go unreported and sexism are still rampant in the stream. An astrophysicist of nearly four decades, Prajval Shastri, who also speaks on issues around gender inequity in science, said she was in a bubble about gender disparity in science until she went to IIT Bombay. “You are seen as a woman first and then a scientist,” she said, adding how that deterred her from even wearing a sari for official events. Chadha agreed and said this is because women feel a need to defeminise themselves so that they are taken seriously. “Body is a site where culture is written — you express your caste, class, gender through your body and in the way you dress. Women are expected to perform the identity of the profession as well as that of a woman. Science is so masculinised that women feel the pressure to defeminise themselves,” she said Chadha said women in a world outside science feel the need to underline their femininity. “They negotiate that space all the time. Like we also see women scientists wearing a sari, mangalsutra, underlining that they are scientists, but also women,” she added. Chadha said that fear of losing control over their work deterred them from naming their supervisor or colleague harassers. “There is also the fear of not getting recommendation letters for future,” she said. Highlighting sexist tendencies in the field, Shastri said women were asked to take up tasks with free time to tend to domestic duties. “This perpetuates the status quo on women that you can work as a scientist while still balancing your domestic duties,” she said, adding that studies have proven that women are equally productive as men and domestic duties don’t weigh them down. Chadha said the discipline has stereotypes. “Physics is hardened science as opposed to biology/chemistry. People see it as women giving birth, so they should study biology. Probably that’s why women are not seen much in physics,” she said. Indira Chandrasekhar, biophysicist, writer & founder, Out of Print, added that it is not okay to push biology as a soft science. “What could be more profound, intriguing and mysterious than life and reproduction?” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/discrimination-still-plagues-women-in-science-experts/articleshow/88349640.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BMTC Vajra passengers welcome fare reduction but want additional buses||BENGALURU: Passengers using BMTC Vajra AC buses heaved a sigh of relief as their fare reduced by up to 34% Friday onwards. “This is a welcome move. In fact, they should have reduced it at least two years ago. App-based cabs and autos are demanding exorbitant fares and also often cancel trips. Less fare for Vajra buses will encourage more people to shift to public transport. This will also reduce traffic in the city,” said Sheela S, a passenger at Majestic. While Vajra fare for stage 4 (8km) has been reduced from Rs 30 to Rs 25, maximum fare for 50km (stage 25) is down from Rs 90 to Rs 50. However, minimum fare remains the same at Rs 10 for the first 2km (stage 1). There is also no change in non-AC and Vayu Vajra bus rates. The price of Vajra daily pass has been reduced from Rs 120 to Rs 100. This means a passenger can travel in Vajra AC buses across the city for an entire day at the cost of 1 litre of petrol. Occupancy more: BMTCAccording to BMTC officials, occupancy rate in Vajra buses increased on Friday. The fare cut decision was taken after the number of buses operating on IT corridors decreased once the pandemic struck. “Passenger response to the cut has been positive. Vajra buses on routes such as Outer Ring Road, Doddaballapur and Attibele saw high occupancy on Friday,” said a senior BMTC official. “We operated 180 Vajra buses on the day. Every week, 50-60 additional buses will be deployed. Passengers can also suggest routes and timings to BMTC. We have put up advertisements inside buses to create awareness on fare reduction. We are expecting more passengers from January 1, after Christmas holidays,” the official said. Officials said from January 1, monthly pass rate will be cut from Rs 2,000 (including GST) to Rs 1,500. BMTC has 860 AC buses, but only 260, including 78 Vayu Vajra buses, are operational now. ‘Many routes cancelled’Amogh A, a regular passenger, said: “I waited for bus 410FA (Yeshwantpur – Banashankari) for more than 30 minutes but couldn’t get one. Many such routes with excellent patronage were cancelled.” “Vajra buses are cheaper than app-based cabs, but there is no way to track buses. Earlier, MyBMTC app was helpful, but now it is difficult to track buses on real-time basis to plan trips,” said Vinod K, a passenger from Indiranagar. However, BMTC officials said a new app will be launched by March. Narayan Balaji, another passenger, said: “BMTC should rethink the way it issues monthly passes. They should be valid for one month from the date of issue, as done in Mumbai, instead of the current system of being activated from the first of each month. This discourages people from opting for monthly passes beyond the fifth.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-vajra-passengers-welcome-fare-reduction-but-want-additional-buses/articleshow/88349641.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Schools in Bengaluru ask kids with travel history to attend e-classes||BENGALURU: Amid Omicron fears, some schools in the city are taking additional steps to contain any infection on campus by asking students with travel history to attend online classes for some days or take RT-PCR tests immediately. A school in north Bengaluru has sent circulars asking students to continue online classes in case they or anyone in their house has travelled abroad in the past month. The kids have been instructed to not come to campus even if they have visitors from abroad. M Srinivasan, president of Management of Independent CBSE Schools Association, said: “Many schools in the city have made it part of the standard operating procedure to ask the entire family to quarantine for two weeks if anybody in the family travels or they have visitors. We will follow the same when our school reopens for physical classes in January.” “We are holding both online and offline classes this academic year. Such students can attend virtual sessions during these days,” Srinivasan, who runs GEAR Innovative International School, said. Deens Academy has decided to start offline classes only from January 9 in order to give everyone one week’s time to quarantine. Classes will continue online from January 3. “Since we reopened, we have been insisting that if there are guests from overseas, students operate online for a week. No visitors are allowed on campus during school working hours. Apart from this, we get random Covid testing done fortnightly, temperature checks multiple times a day, and send a student home if he or she is unwell,” said Pradeep Pai, admin director, Silver Oaks international schools. SOME SEEK NEGATIVE RT-PCR REPORT:Some other schools have asked students to bring negative RT-PCR reports if they have undertaken interstate travel. “For class 6 onwards, RT-PCR test results should be brought if students are coming from outside Karnataka. Strict instructions have been issued not to visit public places and avoid social gatherings,” said officials from Oxford English School, JP Nagar. “As more cases started getting reported since last week, we enforced RT-PCR test report for students who have travelled out of Bengaluru. These students are allowed to come to school only after two days of reaching the city with the negative report,” said Abraham KC of Kids Global School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/schools-ask-kids-with-travel-history-to-attend-e-classes/articleshow/88349642.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The UK is one of the ‘at-risk countries’ and passengers coming from there undergo testing on arrival owing to Omicron concerns. As per protocol, they are tested after 10 days and their genomic sequencing results awaited. “But in this case, the passengers were found negative during RT-PCR tests done before 10 days. We initially stopped them from taking the flight as their genomic sequencing reports were awaited. But it was learnt they were infected with Delta variant and not Omicron, and were then allowed to travel,” said Dr Balasundar.  BBMP authorities, however, refused to divulge details about the passengers and for how long they had to wait for genomic sequencing reports at the airport before they were allowed to board . tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/uk-duo-gets-nod-to-fly-after-tests-negate-omicron/articleshow/88349643.cms||---

Divyanshi Jaswik Reddy was the son of Ravindra Reddy, an online delivery firm employee. Ravindra’s wife works with a security firm. The couple would usually drop their son off at his maternal grandmom Shobha’s home when they went to work. After Shobha suggested they shift closer to her house, the couple found there was a vacant flat on the terrace of the five-floor Barnika Cast apartment. Ravindra and Shobha went inside the flat, leaving the child behind. He stepped on to a portion of the terrace made of plastic roof, but it broke and he fell. He was rushed to hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead. Ravindra alleged his son’s death was due to negligence of the apartment owner and superviser. Cops booked a case of criminal negligence against them. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/baby-falls-to-death-from-fifth-floor-of-apartment/articleshow/88349644.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||When squabble over Rs 100 turned fatal in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: An autopsy report and a detailed police investigation turned a nearly two-month-old road accident into a murder case. The victim was allegedly killed with a 1kg weighing stone following a fight over a sum of Rs 100. On October17, Pratik Yadav, 31, resident of Mathikere and a private firm employee, was shifted to a hospital with an injury on his forehead. He told his younger brother Nikhil Yadav, 25, that he had met with an accident on his two-wheeler near Mathikere Cross. The next day, Nikhil took Pratik to KC General Hospital in Malleswaram and then to Nimhans. Doctors there advised him to get the wound operated on at the earliest. Pratik got admitted to Baptist Hospital in Hebbal and died on the night of October 20. A case under IPC section 304A (causing death due to negligence) was registered at Yeshwantpur traffic police station. But a couple of days later, police received the autopsy report in which doubt was cast over the injury being the result of a road accident. “The death is due to head injury sustained on the lines of homicide... needs to be investigated. However, final opinion pending for want of chemical analysis report,” the report read. Suspecting foul play, traffic police launched a detailed probe. DCP (west, traffic) Kuldeep Kumar Jain said officials visited the spot where the accident purportedly took place and scanned CCTV footage. “Mathikere Cross is an important junction, with many CCTV cameras in and around it. We checked the days before and after October 17, but there was no accident. We also visited shops and asked them if they had seen any accident on that particular date. They all said no. We then checked Pratik’s mobile tower location on October 17 and it showed he was at Thindlu Circle, Vidyaranyapura,” Jain said. The two areas are about 6km apart. The eyewitnessWhen Jain and his team spoke to Nikhil about this, he recalled Pratik’s friend calling him on the phone about the accident. “We immediately contacted the friend, Subramani, and he spilled the beans,” Jain said. Pratik was allegedly attacked by a meat stall worker at Thindlu on October 17. “Pratik had asked the person, Shamsheer Ahmed, for a hand loan of Rs 100 to buy alcohol. Ahmed refused and, following an argument, hit Pratik on the forehead with a weighing stone,” Subramani said. Cops then started looking for Ahmed, who had fled the city by then. The case was transferred to Kodigehalli police, since the attack took place in their jurisdiction. Recently, cops traced him to his friend’s house in Anekal and arrested him on murder charges. Russian woman arrested for illegal stay:ARussian woman was arrested on charges of illegally living in the city since 2019. The woman in her late 30s stayed in Sanjaynagar with her minor son and allegedly ignored requests made by Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office to renew her visa, which expired in 2019, says the FIR filed with Wilson Garden police. She was booked under Section 14 of Foreigners Act, 1946 for staying in India after expiry of her visa, “She and her estranged husband would appear before a family court here regularly. During a recent hearing, the court observed that she was overstaying and directed the FRRO to register a case against her. She was arrested on Thursday and sent to judicial custody,” a police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/when-squabble-over-100-turned-fatal/articleshow/88349645.cms||---

Joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami said the days of the DMK government were numbered. “The Prime Minister has said one nation, one election. So, the DMK government would last only for the next two years,” the former CM said, insinuating that there would be assembly elections in the state, along with the general elections in 2024. The state-wide agitation was announced hours after the AIADMK elected unopposed OPS and EPS as coordinator and joint coordinator to steer the party for the next five years. Leading the protest in Theni, Panneerselvam said that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa came out with schemes with a long-term vision, which was followed by EPS-led AIADMK regime. “The DMK government lacks foresight and came to power by making 505 false and unfulfillable promises before the assembly elections,” OPS said, reading out poll promises like waiver of education loan, jewel loan, reverting to old pension for government staff and teachers, and employment to 10 lakh people every year. “They (the DMK) promised that Stalin would come and bring in the dawn to Tamil Nadu, but it has still not dawned even seven months after they came to power,” he said. In Salem, EPS said the DMK government should focus on people welfare measures rather than settling scores with the AIADMK. The state government has failed in maintaining law and order and there was no safety even for policemen in the state. In Royapuram, former minister D Jayakumar led the protest. Former minister Sellur K Raju wore black shirt and raised slogans against the DMK in Madurai. In Trichy, AIADMK leaders and cadres led by former minister Vellamandi N Natarajan raised slogans against the DMK government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-holds-state-wide-demo-against-dmk/articleshow/88349646.cms||---

Investigators said they are on the trail of the money, which they suspect has been withdrawn from various bank accounts. According to the chargesheet, CID and Enforcement Directorate (ED) recovered Rs 7 crore of the Rs 11.5 crore. ED has attached Rs 2 crore, while the remaining Rs 5 crore has been frozen in various bank accounts. Soon, the frozen accounts too will be attached. The chargesheet names 26-year-old Sriki and 17 others as accused. Running into more than 500 pages, it explains how Sriki and his friends hacked the portal and transferred the stolen money to bank accounts in states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. The other accused include Hemant Muddappa, Suneesh Hegde, Prasidh Shetty, Bhavana Valke, Ratnakar Valke, Vineet Kumar, Susheel Chandra, Siyaram Paswan, Dhanpal, Nizamuddin, and Satish Kumar. Quoting from an ED statement, the chargesheet said, “Investigation revealed Sriki hacked the portal and diverted Rs 10.5 crore and Rs 1.05 crore in two attempts. The amount was transferred to accounts of Uday Grama Vikash Sanstha, a Nagpur-based NGO in Maharashtra, and Nimmi Enterprises, Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.” “The prime role was played by Sriki along with Hemant Muddappa, Suneesh Hegde and Prasidh Shetty. The other accused were roped in later,” the chargesheet read. The hacking came to light in August 2019, when financial consultant staff of the e-procurement portal were checking the approved list of earnest money deposit refunds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sriki-17-others-chargesheeted-in-hacking-case/articleshow/88349647.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

The civic body officials have already visited most of the locations that the 350-odd contacts of the two index patients visited in the past week. Health secretary J Radhakrishnan has advised everyone to be isolated for a week and on the eighth day they will be tested again. “The protocols are the same. We want all symptomatic patients to be isolated until the test results are released. We have asked all to follow the basic protocols such as wearing masks, washing their hands and isolating themselves in ventilated rooms,” he said. While the fever surveillance workers and other groups have been dismantled, the civic body is using the existing workforce to curb the spread, especially ahead of the festive and new year holidays. Colleges, hostels and educational institutions cannot be used as covid care centres. The civic body plan sto keep the Chennai Trade Centre and the communicable diseases hospital in Tondiarpet ready in case of rise in cases. However, since the Omicron variant doesn’t normally require hospitalization, civic officials said, patients could follow the isolation protocols strictly at home. “We have already formed a team at Ripon Building (GCC headquarters) which is regularly following up with patients and their contacts. We want to ensure that they are healthy,” said deputy commissioner, health, Manish Narnaware. The civic body is also planning to study how this variant reacts in people who have taken at least one dose of the vaccination. “We will intensify vaccination drives for the second dose,” Narnaware said. The civic body is also creating awareness at public places to ensure people follow Covid protocols. “Since many of these contacts have visited super markets, tourist locations, we are ensuring that public follow strict protocols to curb the spread,” Narnaware said.  “We have formed micro containment zones wherever more than three cases have been reported. We will continue to follow the same measures,” said the health secretary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gcc-to-focus-on-contact-tracing/articleshow/88349649.cms||Komal Gautham

Around one lakh people are subjected to RT-PCR tests in the state every day and the average Test Positivity Rate (TPR) has dropped to 0.6%. In Chennai (127 new cases) and Coimbatore (102), the only two districts in TN to report new cases in three digits, the TRP has decreased to 0.8% and 1.1%. This, coupled with a brisk recovery rate in these districts, has helped in reducing the number of active cases. Currently, less than 2,500 patients are undergoing treatment in these districts. Across the state, the figure was around 7,400 on Friday evening. However, there is not much change in the fatality rate. For every 100 confirmed cases, at least one continued to succumb to the disease. Even on Friday, 11 people died taking the cumulative death toll to 36,667. Among them, ten had comorbidities like diabetes or hypertension.  Meanwhile, the state has intensified testing at airports so that the spread can be kept under control. In the last two weeks, more than 14,000 passengers have been screened.  The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has reiterated that e-registration is mandatory for all passengers including those taking domestic trips from other states in the country. But experts say that the implementation is poor at domestic terminals. As far as vaccination is concerned, more than 1.8 lakh people got inoculated on Friday. So, the state has managed to complete 7.5 crore doses, according to official data. Around 83% of the eligible population in TN have got their first doses and 52% have been completely vaccinated.  The health department will be organising its 15th mass vaccination drive during weekends on Saturday at 50,000 centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/erode/covid-cases-in-state-continue-to-decline/articleshow/88351324.cms||---

The incident took place on Monday when Yamini went up to the terrace of her house after her parents questioned her about her swollen belly. She lied to them about weight gain during the pandemic. Fearing that her truth will soon come out after her boyfriend refused to marry her, she jumped from a height of about 30 ft. Yamini and her child were rushed to a nearby hospital where the baby was declared dead. Yamini who had suffered fractures in her leg and spine was shifted to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.

Violations are rampant in core city areas like Nandanam, Anna Nagar, Koyambedu and Thousand Lights, with women among the most blatant offenders, while city outskirts seemed to have better compliance. Though the Greater Chennai Traffic Police registered nearly 2.5 lakh helmet rule violation cases till July this year, Tamil Nadu is one of the few states that has not implemented amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act which allow enforcement agencies to collect penalties and take serious action against violations. In Chennai, from January 1 to September 7, 659 victims lost their lives and 3,325 people sustained injuries in road traffic accidents, with 26% (173) of the fatalities and 37% (1,214) of the injured being two-wheeler riders. A study at key junctions found compliance has increased from 72% to 86%. Wearing a helmet, a 2017 UN study found, can prevent about 15,000 two-wheeler deaths in India annually. It also specifies that helmets improve the chances of surviving accidents by 42% and helps avoiding injuries by 69%. “It is unfortunate that though people know helmets and seatbelts save lives, they continue to be careless with their own safety and those of the passengers. 100% compliance should be first made to the rider, only then the enforcement can be made stricter for pillion riders,” says advocate T L Chandar. A senior police officer said that they had never taken the helmet rule lightly and have always instructed their men to book the offenders. The public should realise all this is being done for their safety and cooperate with police, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/violation-of-helmet-rule-rampant-in-city/articleshow/88349655.cms||---

The loss claims ratio has now climbed to 50%, higher than the 20%-30% recorded before March, 2020.ICICI Lombard General Insurance saw the average cost of premium rise by 40% to 60% compared to an year ago. There is a trend of premium rate increase as well as capacity rationalisation, says its chief of underwriting, reinsurance & claims Sanjay Datta.“Underwriters keep reviewing their exposures and accordingly position themselves. With the loss ratios going up, the capacity is not as freely available as it was earlier, especially for inherently risky and large exposures,” he added.Ritesh Thosani, executive VP and cyber leader, Marsh India Insurance Brokers said, “For a sum assured of $1 million, the premium cost could be in the range of $8,000-$11,000 annually. In recent times, the cost of premium has shot up 100%. In some cases, companies have spent 80% of their budget to strengthen their IT team.”Unlike earlier, demand for cyber insurance has been felt by many non-IT businesses, especially sectors like manufacturing, hospitality, pharma and new-age businesses like gaming industry. The cyber security system offered by businesses on premises turned insufficient when work from home was launched overnight. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has witnessed a 60% higher enquiries for cyber insurance covers from non-IT companies, with the hospitality sector being most vulnerable to consumer data theft or data breach, followed by consulting firms and services sectors like HR. “There is a huge struggle with lack of reinsurer to back these cyber insurance products since the pandemic outbreak with risk exposure increased multifold,” TA Ramalingam, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rising-ransomware-attacks-doubles-premium-for-cyber-cover/articleshow/88349656.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The agitation was withdrawn around 10pm after railway officials at the station promised to meet the two demands - suburban trains on Kancheepuram-Beach should be run on time and that suburban trains should not be detained to allow goods and express trains to cross - submitted by the commuters.Srinivasan, a commuter, who was at Chengalpet, said that Tirumalpur-Beach train via Chengalpet is delayed on most of the days. The train starts late at Tirumalpur and sometimes reaches Chengalpet only at 8.20pm and on some days at 8.55pm.Pandiaraja, another commuter, said that there is a hassle after Tambaram on the Chengalpet route. "Trains are held up for crossing at Guduvancherry or Singaperumalkoil. There is a 15-minute delay. The number of express trains has also increased during evening peak hour causing congestion. Railways should open the third line immediately instead of waiting for January."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/suburban-train-commuters-stage-rail-roko-over-delays/articleshow/88349657.cms||---

Rohit, who has been ruled out of the upcoming Test series in South Africa due to a hamstring injury, gave a pep talk to the U-19 boys ahead of the Asian Cup beginning December 23 in the UAE. Rohit and Jadeja were seen at the NCA with India U-19 captain Yash Dhull in his social media posts. The BCCI also tweeted pictures of Rohit’s session with the squad. Rohit himself played at U-19 level back in 2006. “TeamIndia white-ball captain @ImRo45 made most of his rehab time as he addressed India’s U19 team during their preparatory camp at the NCA in Bengaluru,” wrote BCCI. Rohit, who was named ODI captain last week replacing Virat Kohli, was to travel to South Africa as vice-captain of the Test team for the series starting on December 26 before the injury ruled him out of the red ball leg of the tour. His expected recovery time is between three to four weeks. India ‘A’ captain Priyank Panchal was named in place of Rohit in the Test squad, which reached South Africa on Thursday for the series. The senior opener, who took charge as T20I captain against New Zealand last month, is expected to be available to lead the team for the One-Day International leg of the South Africa tour, which is to take place in January. Jadeja has been ruled out of the South Africa tour due to a knee injury which he sustained during the home New Zealand Test series last month.

---||Chennai||Chennai corporation plans more power plants using meat waste||CHENNAI: The Greater Chennai Corporation is to conduct a feasibility study soon to set up more bio-methane plants across the city.  A senior civic official said currently the plant at Pulianthope generates 40 KVA of electricity that powers up 14 light bulbs in the compound. “Here, we are getting 8 to 9 tonnes of meat waste a day,” the official said.  The city’s two biomethane plants located at Perambur and Pulianthope – were designed by the scientists at Baba Atomic Research Centre (BARC). A five-tonne plant has a capacity to generate 500 cubic metres of methane that’s equal to a 225kg LPG cylinder. This plant has the capacity to generate 40 KVA of electricity. In addition, 500 kg of manure is extracted.  An article published in Science Direct quotes the case of Ethiopia’s Shashemene city, where 3.7 lakh kilowatt is generated from 6.9 lakh kg of meat waste annually. It says such bio-methane plants also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. City corporation officials said that in North Chennai, in places such as Pulianthope, such plants would be useful as the generation of meat waste is high. Officials said a slaughterhouse in such areas produces an average of 8-9 mt tonnes of meat waste daily and it may differ area-wise. After a feasibility study, we will come up with proposals, the officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corpn-plans-more-power-plants-using-meat-waste/articleshow/88349716.cms||Omjasvin M D

According to sources, over 69% of the children in the age group of 6 to 59 months are suffering from anaemia in the state. Nearly 64% of the women also have anaemia (30% mild, 32% moderate and 2% severe anaemia). The World Health Organisation states that anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Its most common causes include nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency. Dr Arun Shah, a paediatrician, told TOI that anaemia, like malnutrition, was a common problem among children in Bihar. “It can easily be solved with proper knowledge about food. Instead of buying expensive fruits or food items which are beyond your purchasing capacity, include pulses, jaggery, ‘sattu’ and freshly grown vegetables in your child’s diet,” he said and emphasised on using “what is available, affordable and acceptable in society”. He also pointed out that anaemia could hamper the mental, physiological and cognitive development of children. Women too are advised to eat proper food to fight anaemia. Dr Usha Didwania, a gynaecologist, claimed that poor diet, early marriage and no gap between two deliveries were some of the reasons for anaemia among women. She continued, “Women should eat a balanced diet because they menstruate, give birth and lactate. There should at least be a three-year gap between two kids and early marriages as well as pregnancies should be avoided.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-eat-balanced-diet-to-keep-anaemia-at-bay/articleshow/88347025.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The civic body has already installed two food waste composting machines near Sardar Patel bus stand here and placed order for five more such machines. “The two newly installed machines have undergone trial with the help of a generator. We have applied for a transformer and both the machines will start making compost from wet waste on a regular basis after getting regular power supply. The capacity of each machine is to make 50kg compost from 500kg wet waste in 24 hours,” Ara mayor Rubi Tiwari said. She added, “It will not only help in disposing of wet waste and save people from foul smell, but also be immensely useful for farmers and fruit growers. We have planned to sell organic fertilizer in 5kg and 25kg packets at an affordable price for the benefit of farmers, fruit and flower growers.” Welcoming the move of the civic body, head of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK)-Ara, P K Dwivedi, said, “The wet waste such as fresh cabbage and cauliflower peels can be easily procured from local vegetable and fruit markets. They are very effective in making compost. If wet waste from household kitchens is wisely segregated and compost is made out of them, it will be very nice.” Dwivedi also had a word of caution for the civic body. “The civic body should not procure wet waste from such places in the vegetable markets where it gets mixed up with toxic dry waste.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/organic-fertilizer-to-be-made-from-food-waste-in-ara-soon/articleshow/88346972.cms||---
---||Patna||Vice-chancellor of MMHAPU resigns||PATNA: The vice-chancellor of Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University (MMHAPU), Md Quddus, resigned from his post on Friday. In a letter submitted to the chancellor as well as the chief minister, Quddus, who had recently levelled various charges against his predecessor S P Singh and some Raj Bhavan officials, said he was resigning on “personal grounds” and “due to unavoidable reasons”. He had joined the university as its VC four months back in August on the recommendation of a search committee headed by his predecessor Singh. Raj Bhavan sources said the VC’s resignation had been received, but not accepted by the chancellor as yet. Quddus told this newspaper that he was facing suffocation in the university as he was not able to discharge his duties sincerely owing to the non-cooperation of the officers and staff. “I did not want to be a party to the illegal activities going on in the university right since 2015,” he said, adding Rs 6 crore had been spent illegally from the university’s internal resources. On December 15, the education department had asked the university to explain its stand on the appointment of nine over-aged staff and also demanded the evidence of implementing reservation roster in university appointments. But, despite his order the registrar did not report at the education department. Besides, no university official was receiving the answer sheets from the printing press even though the examinations were scheduled from December 22, he said. Earlier, soon after the recent vigilance raid on the residence and office of Magadh University VC Rajendra Prasad, Quddus had written to CM Nitish Kumar drawing his attention towards the alleged irregularities in printing of answer sheets of examinations. He had accused an official of Raj Bhavan and another person of pressuring him for payment of money to an agency that printed the answer sheets. The letter was forwarded to the vigilance department. Later, Singh also filed a defamation suit against Quddus in the Patna district court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vice-chancellor-of-mmhapu-resigns/articleshow/88347071.cms||B K Mishra

The CPI, BJP and TDP shared a dais, raising their voice against the three capitals proposal of the YSRC. They also pledged support for Amaravati as the sole capital of the state. Backed by TDP, farmers of Amaravati villages, who had given their lands for the capital in 2016-17, organised the public meeting in T irupati on Friday. This was the concluding meet of the 45-day long ‘padayatra’ from Amaravati to Tirupati. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu was the chief guest at the public meeting, which was held with the permission of the high court. The police had initially denied permission, citing reasons of law and order. BJP, Jana Sena and CPI leaders attended the meeting, while the CPI(M) boycotted it as the organisers had invited the BJP. The CPI(M), said the party was not ready to share the dais with the BJP. Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan skipped the meeting but sent his representative, while BJP sent its former state unit chief Kanna Lakshminarayana. YSRC rebel MP, K Raghurama Krishnam Raju, attended the meeting. The Congress and the TDP moved closer before the 2019 general elections and contested the Telangana assembly elections as an alliance. However, this alliance was not extended to Andhra Pradesh. The Congress was represented by its working president N Tulasi Reddy, a known political rival of chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. It is believed the TDP is strongly lobbying for an alliance with the BJP and the Jana Sena. If their coming together at Tirupati is any indication, Chandrababu Naidu would go with these two parties for the 2024 elections. Though the leaders pledged their support for Amaravati in one voice, it remains to be seen how long this opposition unity would remain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/as-padayatra-ends-opposition-unity-on-display-in-tirupati/articleshow/88347143.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Vijayawada||GMC alumni take over work on hospital unit||Amaravati: Guntur Medical College Alumni of North America (GMCANA) has stepped into complete the construction of first phase of mother and childcare unit in Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur. GMCANA has requested the state government to hand over the entire project. GMCANA will spend close to Rs 35 crore in the first phase. It is also planning to pool another Rs 30-35 crore to complete the five-storied block to provide a dedicated 650-bed unit. “The government has agreed to handover the project for its early completion,” GMCANA president Dr Alla Srinivasa Reddy told TOI. Dr Reddy held discussions with district in-charge minister Ch Sri Ranganatha Raju, principal secretary (health) Anil Kumar Singhal and APMSIDC managing director D Muralidhar Reddy. He said they were ready to launch the work if the government issued a fresh GO. Sources said that the existing contractor would leave if the dues to the tune of Rs 90 lakh were cleared. The state government had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the GMCANA four years ago to share the burden of the project cost. While the Centre has agreed to grant Rs 20 crore, the state government had decided to take Rs 10 crore burden of the Rs 65 crore project. Following the initiative taken by then district collector Kona Sasidhar, old students of Government Medical College (GMC), Guntur, now settled in North America, had agreed to donate Rs 35 crore. They wanted to complete half of the project on their own in order to ensure quality in construction. The government also agreed to their proposal and issued a GO. As per the MoU, the state government had to complete the cellar and first two floors of the block and hand over the project to GMCANA to complete the remaining three floors. However, the work was stalled after YSRC came into power about two-and-a-half years ago due to paucity of funds. Meanwhile, donors in GMCANA expressed their displeasure over delay in completion of the project despite their preparedness to fund the project. After learning that the government was not in a position take the project ahead, the GMCANA had requested the government to allow it to complete the project. GMCANA would hand over the entire block to the government after completion of the construction within three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gmc-alumni-take-over-work-on-hospital-unit/articleshow/88347205.cms||Samdani MN

According to ACB sources, the complainant had earlier filed an application in the court seeking release of his seized moped and a mobile phone from Puna police station. The court had asked the police station’s opinion in the matter and so the complainant had gone to the police station to meet LRD jawan Hardik Jerambhai. The LRD personnel instructed the complainant to bring a lawyer. Meanwhile, a person named Mativar aka Manoj Shreenarayan Tiwari met the complainant and using the LRD personnel’s name sought Rs 10,000 bribe to facilitate the release. After negotiation, the deal was finalized for Rs 3,000.

---||Business||SBI hikes older loan benchmark rate by 10bps||Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) has increased its base rate (BR) — a benchmark used for some of its floating rate loans — by 10 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). The move is seen as a signal that the cost of funds will gradually start moving up. Following the revision from December 21, the bank’s revised BR stands at 7.55%. The change will impact a small section of borrowers whose loans are still linked (since before 2016) to the BR. SBI also revised its prime lending rate (PLR) to 12.3% from 12.2%. This will impact an even smaller number of borrowers with very long-term loans as the PLR was used as a benchmark before the BR up to 2010. Most retail borrowers today have their loans linked to the repo rate. These rates will rise only when the RBI hikes the rate at which it lends to banks. Most economists do not see this happening during the current financial year. Many bankers say that the current lending rates are as good as it gets for borrowers as the central bank has started reducing liquidity in the money markets. This has already started putting upward pressure on government bond yields. BR was introduced as a benchmark in 2010 to replace the PLR, which the RBI felt was not transparent enough as banks offered loans to preferred corporates at sub-PLR. One of the rules for use of BR as a benchmark was that loans had to have a positive spread. In other words, no loan could be advanced below the BR. However, the BR was replaced with the marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) in 2016 as it was felt that banks reduced rates only for new borrowers when interest rates went down. The MCLR was subsequently replaced with the External Benchmark Lending Rate in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-hikes-older-loan-benchmark-rate-by-10bps/articleshow/88348418.cms||---

---||Kolkata||‘Closure of Films Division will erase India’s audio-visual record’||Kolkata: The film fraternity in Kolkata has strongly reacted to the ministry of information and broadcasting’s decision to close all branches of the Films Division, National Film Archive of India (NFAI), Directorate of Film Festivals and Children’s Film Society of India before the end of January. This, they said, will particularly impact the Films Division, which has a branch in Kolkata, that looks into film production and conducting workshops in the northeast. In the wake of the process of merger of Films Division and CFSI with NFDC, the fraternity feels that the closure of these organizations will result in erasing the audio-visual record of India. The Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI) is strongly protesting what it calls a “problematic move”. Its president, Kiran V Shantaram, has written a letter to the PM, requesting him to reconsider this merger. “The Indian chapter of International Federation of Film Critics is holding a national open seminar on this issue,” said Premendra Mazumder, vice-president, Federation of Film Societies of India. “Merger and reorientation of these organizations with NFDC might seem like a good thing, but it is far from the truth since NFDC has been turned into a limited company. Merging these bodies with a profit-earning organization means the welfare activities of these bodies can no longer be done. It will create a complex organizational behaviour and lose its original purpose. The thrust will become market-oriented as opposed to welfare-oriented,” Mazumder said. National Award-winning director Sourav Sarangi said, “Producing a documentary on environmental issues is different from making a fictional film for children. As a film-maker, it makes no sense to me to merge the reputable institutions which will jeopardize the cinematic space of our country created over decades.” Film-maker Debalina said, “The audio-visual content the Films Division has is invaluable. The current dispensation at the Centre is attaching no value to it. Independent film-makers who have been mak-ing films on real India since Independence have been aided by organizations like the Films Division. I don’t know what will happen to that now,” she said. An employee of Films Division shared with TOI that in the recent order, some have been asked if they want to go to different centres of Central Board of Film Certification on a loan basis. “This means they will be sent elsewhere once the loan period is over. The government should come up with a plan on how to make this space better and more helpful to documentary film-makers of India,” the employee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/closure-of-films-division-will-erase-indias-audio-visual-record/articleshow/88348120.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

The minister found that some departments have spent only 68.42 per cent, which he said exposes the disinterest of the bureaucracy towards SC welfare. The minister said that the state government had allocated Rs 18,138.84 crore through various departments for the current financial year as SCs component. However, the departments have spent only Rs 12,409.87 crore towards the welfare and development of the SCs in the states. The minister told the officials to explore new ways and means to develop the SCs in all aspects. He regretted that the bureaucrats have gotten used to following the traditional schemes and not changed according to the times. He wanted the officials to look into the needs of the people and revive the plans and schemes for the welfare and overall development of the SCs in the state. Viswaroop said only 17 departments have spent the funds under the SC component, while the remaining departments have turned a blind eye to the welfare of SCs. He said that these departments were keeping the funds unutilised and asked them to swing into action immediately. The minister told the senior officials to take initiative to work for the welfare and development of the SCs,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/min-expresses-ire-over-sc-funds-spending/articleshow/88347258.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||Rlys, state nod to Santragachhi jheel project for pollution curb||Kolkata: The Railways and the Bengal government have agreed to a proposal to set up a waste stabilisation pond (WSP) instead of a sewerage treatment plant (STP) to reduce pollution around Santragachhi jheel. But the Railways disagreed with a state proposal to set up a public toilet, saying that removal of encroachments must be dealt with first and settling toilets will only make the illegal encroachments permanent. In a statement given to TOI, the South Eastern Railways said that according to the September 2020 order, the state and the Railways would provide for the STP along with drains around the jheel — around 13,75,000 square feet — at a cost-sharing basis to prevent pollution. Railways would provide land for it. The Railways had received a waste management plan and later a request for land by the state. The plan wasn’t proper, so it has asked the state to submit it afresh and a cost estimate has been given to the state. This was followed by the KMDA proposal of WSP on November 24. The Railways, however, pointed out that the 160 encroachers beside Santragachhi jheel could not be removed till date due to non-availability of state police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rlys-state-nod-to-santragachhi-jheel-project-for-pollution-curb/articleshow/88348102.cms||---

Although Arundhati Bhattacharya has not named the liquor baron as the borrower, the circumstances of the case all point to Mallya. “I wanted him to commit cash. Knowing fully well that he was about to throw a lavish birthday bash, I asked why he could not defer that and put the money on the table as a token of his good intent?” said Bhattacharya in her book. Mallya stumped her, stating, “One is 60 only once.” He went on to say that his friends had assured him that he could keep banks in the courts forever.

---||Business||Rising ransomware attacks doubles premium for cyber cover||Chennai: Rising claims from victims of cyber attacks has resulted in doubling cyber cover premium in the past year. The loss claims ratio has now climbed to 50%, higher than the 20%-30% recorded before March, 2020. ICICI Lombard General Insurance saw the average cost of premium rise by 40% to 60% compared to an year ago. There is a trend of premium rate increase as well as capacity rationalisation, says its chief of underwriting, reinsurance & claims Sanjay Datta.“Underwriters keep reviewing their exposures and accordingly position themselves. With the loss ratios going up, the capacity is not as freely available as it was earlier, especially for inherently risky and large exposures,” he added. Ritesh Thosani, executive VP and cyber leader, Marsh India Insurance Brokers said, “For a sum assured of $1 million, the premium cost could be in the range of $8,000-$11,000 annually. In recent times, the cost of premium has shot up 100%. In some cases, companies have spent 80% of their budget to strengthen their IT team.” Unlike earlier, demand for cyber insurance has been felt by many non-IT businesses, especially sectors like manufacturing, hospitality, pharma and new-age businesses like gaming industry. The cyber security system offered by businesses on premises turned insufficient when work from home was launched overnight. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has witnessed a 60% higher enquiries for cyber insurance covers from non-IT companies, with the hospitality sector being most vulnerable to consumer data theft or data breach, followed by consulting firms and services sectors like HR. Its chief technical officer TA Ramalingam said among major concerns faced by new age businesses like gaming and edtech firms, the top most is that a day’s business interruption due to cyberattacks, nearly leads to collapse of the business model putting the company in the edge. “There is a huge struggle with lack of reinsurer to back these cyber insurance products since the pandemic outbreak with risk exposure increased multifold,” TA Ramalingam, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz said. Ramalingam added. Hackers charge a ransom of 1% of turnover, however, the amount could go up if they do not meet the deadline, which is normally an average of five days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rising-ransomware-attacks-doubles-premium-for-cyber-cover/articleshow/88348416.cms||Mamtha Asokan

They had tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week. According to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials, the couple had arrived on December 7. A resident of Fatehpura area, the couple was under self-monitoring as per guidelines as they were not from an ‘at risk’ country. VMC officials stated that the couple had undergone an RTP-CR test at the suggestion of some relatives. The 75-year-old man and his 67-year-old wife tested positive and were advised home isolation. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing. A report by Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre on Friday evening confirmed that they were infected by the Omicron variant. VMC officials have started the exercise of tracing their primary contacts of the couple and testing them. Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours ending 5 pm on Friday Gujarat added 60 more Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 8.28 lakh. The state’s death toll increased to 10,101 with one Covid death reported in Navsari district The new positive cases in Gujarat include 14 from Vadodara, 13 from Rajkot, 8 from Ahmedabad and five from Surat districts.

In all, 4.64 crore are administered first and 4.02 crore second dose of Covid vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vadodara-couple-tests-omicron-ve/articleshow/88347168.cms||---
---||Kolkata||First Covid wave hit seniors in Kolkata; more youths and women affected in 2nd, says study||KOLKATA: The second wave of the pandemic affected more youngsters and the middleaged, along with women, in Kolkata than the first wave that had affected more elderly people, revealed a study conducted by Peerless Hospital that has been published in the Journal of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. The number of asymptomatically infected, the study said, rose significantly during the second wave. Titled ‘Demographic of Covid-19 in two waves in a single centre’, the study compared data from the first wave with that of the second. While around 34% of those who tested positive during the first wave were between the ages of 18 and 45, the figure went up to 40.1% during the second wave. For those above 60, the figure went down from 31.4% during the first wave to 24.4% during the second wave. A total of 67,121 samples tested in the hospital’s molecular testing laboratory between May 2020 and July 2021 were taken for the study. An overall positivity rate of 23.8% was noted during the 15 months. Comparison between male and female Covid-positive individuals revealed that more men were affected than women — around 58% against 42% — during the study period. Age-wise analysis showed male preponderance was mainly observed in the above-60 group — 33.6% in men vs 28% in women — during the first wave. In the second wave, however, women were affected more in both young adult and older adult age groups. “There could be two reasons behind this. While women have better immunity, the vaccination rate for women picked up quite late into the drive,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, one of the co-authors who conducted the study along with Rishav Mukherjee, Dharitri Chaudhuri, Arup Kumar Mitra, Partha Guchhait, Subhrojyoti Bhowmick and Satadal Das. The study found Covishield more effective than Covaxin after a single dose. The efficacy of Covaxin increased slightly after both doses. Among the subjects, 1,744 patients had received the first dose and 828 patients got their second jab of either Covishield or Covaxin. “But whether it is Covishield or Covaxin, the maximum benefit in terms of mortality and severe diseases can be achieved by taking both doses. Therefore, complete vaccination is very important,” said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, Peerless director, clinical research and academics. In the first wave, 59.2% positive patients were symptomatic at the time of testing, whereas 40.8% were found to be asymptomatic. The second wave had 46.7% symptomatic and 53.3% asymptomatic patients at the time of testing. Only patients from Kolkata were considered for this retrospective study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1st-wave-hit-seniors-more-youths-and-women-affected-in-2nd-study/articleshow/88348090.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The SVU recovered Rs 73.5 lakh in cash from Ranjan’s three premises. It also came to light that Ranjan was filing Rs 2 lakh annual return in his driver’s name and owned a 21-room hotel of three-star category at Brahmapura, a prime location in Muzaffarpur. The market value of the hotel is estimated to be over Rs 20 crore. The SVU, which had lodged an FIR against the sub-registrar on Thursday, had knowledge about only Rs 1.62 crore DA of Ranjan. However, the value of DA increased to over Rs 5 crore following raids conducted at his brother’s flat in Patligram Apartment at Bajrangpuri near Biscomaun roundabout at Kumhrar in Patna, Tusli Kunj in Samastipur and another house in Panchawati lane at Kolhua chowk and a flat in Muzaffarpur. The SVU sleuths had also raided his office in Samastipur. Ranjan had joined service in 2010. Sources said Ranjan’s brother works in rural works department of the state government. The SVU sources said Rs 60 lakh in cash was recovered from Kumhrar, Rs 1.5 lakh from Samastipur and Rs 12 lakh from Muzaffarpur. The SVU also found documents of two flats, including one worth Rs 32 lakh, and two plots worth Rs 1.5 crore from Kumhrar during the raid. In Samastipur, the SVU found Rs 1.5 lakh in cash, Rs 8 lakh deposited in bank accounts and documents of four expensive vehicles, including an SUV. In Muzaffarpur, the SVV recovered Rs 12 lakh in cash, documents related to Bramhapura hotel which is being given final touches and a shop worth Rs 22 lakh in Paras Mall. “The vigilance has come to know about immovable property worth several crores amassed by Ranjan in Katihar while he was posted there from 2018 to 2021. The SVU has got preliminary information about three plots and shops in Katihar,” a senior officer said. The officer added a team would soon be sent to Katihar for further investigation. He said Ranjan was laundering ill-gotten money by running at least six shell firms in Patna, Katihar and Muzaffarpur and buying property in the names of his wife, brother, father-in-law, driver and other family members. The SVU sources said further investigation would be conducted to find out in whose names the houses in Samastipur and Muzaffarpur were registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vig-unearths-rs-5cr-da-of-samastipur-sub-registrar/articleshow/88347052.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Though Lammasingi is dubbed as Andhra Pradesh’s Kashmir and tourists visit the spot for its foggy weather and low temperatures (sub-zero), the temperature estimates are based on guesswork and calculations as there is no thermometer there. Setting up an AWS in Vizag Agency will enable the state to keep the entire tribal pocket in Vizag district under surveillance. The AWS will enable the IMD to issue more specific nowcast on rainfall activity and other alerts issued by the Met department.  Speaking to TOI, director of IMD-Amaravati, Stella S said the AWS at Lammasingi will give the exact data after observing various parameters. The AWS is the best tool and initial condition for weather forecasting, in addition to other tools available with IMD. It helps assess current situation of weather parameters, wind, temperature, (minimum and maximum) atmospheric pressure, wind directions, relative humidity and rainfall. “We will get this information every 15 minutes. Members of the public can see the data on the website through their mobile phones,” she added.  Regarding choosing Lammasingi for setting up the AWS, Stella said: “Since Lammasingi emerged as the most popular tourist destination for foggy and cool weather conditions, we decided to set up the AWS at Lammasingi to give accurate weather conditions to visitors as well as the locals in and around the region.” Land has been allocated for IMD to set up the AWS at Lammasingi. If all goes as per the plan, the works for the AWS will begin soon and AWS is expected to be operational by 2022. The AWS will give alerts to the farmers in Vizag Agency region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/lammasingi-to-get-automatic-weather-stn/articleshow/88347221.cms||Nalla.Babu

The Bureau of Energy Efficiency has given its consent to the AP State Energy Conservation Mission (APSECM) for implementing energy efficiency measures in TTD and its allied temples and choultries. Of the total energy consumption of 68 million units per annum in TTD, around 30% of the consumption is being met from solar and wind power generation. The remaining 70% of the electricity needs of 435 lakh units for TTD and its allied temples around Tirumala Hills is being supplied by Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company Limited. The TTD spends around Rs 40 crore towards electricity bill every year. It now wants to reduce the energy expenditure by Rs 4 to Rs 5 crore by implementing energy conservation and efficiency measures. The TTD is examining the recommendations of the ‘investment grade energy audit’ that suggested replacing of its old pump sets with energy efficiency pump sets. The TTD has decided to replace 5,000 ordinary fans with super-efficient BLDC (brushless direct current) fans in the first phase with about Rs 1.35 crore. It is estimated to save 0.88 million units per annum with Rs 62 lakh monetary savings and payback period of 26 months. The TTD is planning to go for 2.2 MW rooftop solar systems in all colleges and schools in Tirupati and TTD buildings in Tirumala with the support of the state-level agencies like New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (NREDCAP). As part of energy efficiency and environmental protection measures, TTD is also promoting electric mobility in Tirumala and Tirupati. During a webinar with the energy secretary and APSECM officials on Friday on the eve of national energy conservation week-2021, TTD executive officer K Jawahar Reddy said the TTD has taken every measure to ensure best services to all its devotees. “Eco-friendly energy efficient practices would showcase TTD as a world class energy efficient temple across the globe,” said Jawahar Reddy. Energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said energy efficiency is equally important for a sustainable future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ttd-to-take-up-energy-efficient-measures/articleshow/88347172.cms||---

In her book, ‘Indomitable: A working woman’s notes on life, work and leadership’, Arundhati Bhattacharya says dire straits and unemployment had forced her father to have second thoughts about having a third child when her mother was expecting her. However, her mother’s belief that the newborn would come with its own destiny resulted in a change of plans. While Bhattacharya’s appointment was celebrated as the coming of age of woman empowerment, not much has been written about the challenges on the way. Bhattacharya’s book, published by HarperCollins, has pointers to how ingrained the bias against women was and continues, albeit to a lower extent. The bias is engraved in the legislation as the SBI Act refers only to a chairman, which is why she had to scrap her first batch of cards that were printed as chairperson. SBI did not have a woman as a probationary officer until 1960. However, decades later, the bank’s offices continued to have washrooms segregated for men, women and officers. Sixty years after the first woman officer joined, if woman bankers have better terms of employment, they have Bhattacharya to thank. Much of the bank’s policies towards woman employees and customers were based on the impediments she experienced in her career. Her first brush with gender stereotyping was when celebrated alumni in her school mocked her ambitions for becoming a biochemist, saying, “You’re sure? Not a kitchen chemist?” One also gets insights into why women were not present in professional courses in the ’70s. Bhattacharya, who qualified for a medical seat following the joint entrance examination, could not pursue medicine as hostels for women were not there. The challenges continued, from the absence of washrooms in the early years to not getting tough departments like credit (seen as a career kick-starter) because of her gender. Even after she was in a position of power, Bhattacharya found that the temperature in the board rooms was regulated keeping in mind men wearing thick suits and not women in sarees. This created in her the habit of using the teacup to warm her hands. “So, on becoming chairman, I thought I needed to assert myself on behalf of the women in the boardroom and requested my male colleagues to leave their coats and ties behind in their rooms,” said Bhattacharya. As chairman, Bhattacharya is credited with introducing a discount of 5bps (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) if the woman was the first holder of the title in a home loan. This feature not only popularised the loan but also ended up reducing defaults. And the success was copied by others and extended to more products, including Jan Dhan accounts where more than half are held by women. She also introduced a two-year sabbatical initially for women, but later extended to males, which has helped retain more women in the bank’s workforce. It was again Bhattacharya, who pushed for a five-day week but had to be content with two Saturdays off in a month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbis-1st-woman-chief-i-may-not-have-been-born/articleshow/88348407.cms||Mayur Shetty

Mahatma Gandhi was from Gujarat. It was Gujarat where the prohibition policy was imposed as an experiment. Yet, liquor is available for licence holders there,” Manjhi told mediapersons. “Bihar should adopt the Gujarat model. In Bihar, the liquor law should be relaxed. The licence holders should be allowed to drink liquor in small quantities, like they take medicine,” Manjhi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-to-govt-adopt-gujarat-model-of-prohibition/articleshow/88346900.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||CM Nitish Kumar urges women to help govt check liquor menace||MADHUBANI/PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday called upon women to take to the streets to put a complete check on consumption of liquor in their neighbourhoods. Addressing a public rally at the D B College ground in Jainagar after launching through remote the formal commencement of works for two major projects of water resources department (WRD), the CM exhorted the women to take out a procession if someone in their neighbourhood is found involved in manufacturing, selling or drinking liquor. The CM said if women start protesting in such a way, it would have a great impact on the state government’s move to put a complete ban on the sale and consumption of liquor. Earlier, the CM formally commenced the construction works of two schemes – barrage on Kamla river at Jainagar and an all-weather road on the right flank of Kamla embankment from Pipraghat to Thengha bridge, a distance of 80km. The estimated cost of the projects is Rs 405.66 crore and 325.12 core, respectively. These projects are likely to be completed by March 2023. Originating from Nepal, the Kamla river enters Indian territory at Jainagar and annually scripts a tale of destruction, affecting lakhs of population. The barrage will have a total length of 550 metres with 36 gates. It will have a clear waterway of 360 metres (barrage) and 100 metres (under sluice). Completion of the barrage would help increase the irrigation facilities from present 18,700 hectares to 28,384 hectares through eastern and western canal systems covering Jainagar, Basopatti, Khajauli, Ladania, Kaluahi, Madhwapur and Harlakhi blocks of the district. Later, addressing a public gathering at D B College, the CM announced construction of an ROB. He was seemingly happy with the presence of Jeevika women in large numbers and reminded the audience of his efforts to empower women. He claimed that his measures for educating girls and their empowerment have yielded stunning dividends. Citing an instance, he said spread of education among girls has led to a significant drop in state’s fertility rate from 4.3% to 3%. WRD minister Sanjay Jha presided the function. Prominent among others present on the occasion were ministers Lesi Singh, Sheela Mandal and Ramprit Paswan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-urges-women-to-help-govt-check-liquor-menace/articleshow/88346878.cms||---

The breakthrough was achieved by the Kakadeo police, who also recovered nearly 7 kg of ‘ganja’ from their possession. Police said during the raid two persons including one HBTU student managed to escape. The four arrested persons have been identified as Dhirendra Kumar and Shivam Gaud, residents of Kakadeo, Anuj Kumar, a native of Hamirpur and Suryakant of Pratapgarh. Dhirendra, Shivam and Anuj were nabbed during a police checking from near Ram Lila park in Sarvodaya nagar and 4.5 kg of ‘ganja’ recovered from the trio, while Suryakant was arrested from Neersheer crossing in Pandu nagar area of city. The police recovered more than 2 kg of ‘ganja’ from him. An HBTU student and one other however managed to flee during a raid at RamLila park in Sarvodaya nagar. “Preliminary investigations revealed that the arrested persons were supplying ‘ganja’ inside HBTU campus for the last several years. Today, they had been planning to supply ‘ganja’ inside the HBTU campus,” said inspector Kakadeo Ram Kumar Gupta. “They said that they were earning good profits. They used to divide the profit. We have been interrogating them to break their network and for this formed a special team,” said a police officer. The Kakadeo police registered a case against the four under the relevant sections of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/drug-peddlers-arrested-for-supplying-ganja-inside-hbtu/articleshow/88348766.cms||---
---||Business||RBI: Partial ban on crypto won’t work||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said in a presentation to its central board that a ban on cryptocurrencies needs to be total and partial restrictions will not work. In the presentation, senior officials highlighted the issue of trackability of transactions, valuation of cryptos, the extreme price volatility, legal issues and identifying the various actors in the crypto transaction chain as areas of concern. Among the board members Revathy Iyer (former deputy comptroller & auditor general) expressed the need to proceed with caution. However, another board member Sachin Chaturvedi (director-general at the Research and Information System for Developing Countries) cautioned against policymakers taking extreme steps and risk being cut off globally. He highlighted instances in the past when the government had to backtrack. Debasish Panda, secretary at the department of financial services, who also participated in the meeting, did not comment on the crypto issue. The 592nd meeting of the central board also discussed the status of the central bank’s digital currency. Additionally, the board took up the half-yearly income statement of the RBI for the six months ended September 30, 2021. The board’s discussion on cryptocurrencies comes at a time when the government has listed Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 for the Winter Session of Parliament. The Centre has been tight-lipped about the legislation. The wording on the bill — stating that it seeks to create a facilitative framework for a central bank digital currency and allow crypto for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology — has given rise to speculation that cryptos may be legalised as an asset. The RBI has been steadfast in its opposition to giving recognition to alternate currencies. While the central bank has been forced to retract its 2018 ban on cryptocurrencies following a Supreme Court order, it has not changed its mind. “There is a need for much deeper discussions (on crypto). When the central bank says it has much deeper concerns from the point of macroeconomic and financial stability, there are far deeper issues involved which form part of this,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said in October 2021 while speaking at an event. He said that there was a need for discussion on these concerns. “The board also discussed various areas of operations of the Reserve Bank, including the functioning of the local boards, activities of select central office departments and the draft ‘Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India, 2020-21’,” the RBI said in a statement. Central bankers present in the board meeting included deputy governors Mahesh Kumar Jain, Michael Debabrata Patra, M Rajeshwar Rao, and T Rabi Sankar. Other directors of the central board Satish K Marathe and S Gurumurthy also attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-partial-ban-on-crypto-wont-work/articleshow/88348353.cms||Sidhartha

The broader Nifty lost 263 points and closed just below the 17,000 level. The US Fed’s decision to speed up the end of its easy money policy, increase in the Omicron variant infections and rising inflation led to selling across markets, which also affected sentiment on Dalal Street, market players said. The interest rate hike decision by the Bank of England on Thursday also unnerved investors as they expect more central banks to follow the decision of the UK central bank. Strong buying in leading technology stocks, however, cushioned the day’s selloff in the sensex with Infosys, HCL Tech and TCS among the five sensex gainers. Like in the last few weeks, foreign funds led the selling on Friday with a net outflow of Rs 2,070 crore. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net sold stocks worth Rs 15,640 crore in this month, data from CDSL and BSE showed. This is the biggest monthly net outflow since March 2020. Friday’s selloff, however, was more severe than in the past few weeks, market players pointed out, which was visible in stocks outside of the sensex also. Compared to the sensex’s 1.5% loss on Friday, BSE’s midcap index closed 2.5% lower, while the smallcap index was down 2.1%. In the broader market, 2,353 stocks on the BSE closed lower compared to 983 that closed higher. According to Emkay Wealth Management research head Joseph Thomas, the main trigger for the fall in indexes was the tightening of liquidity by the US Fed after the last meeting of its policy-setting committee earlier this week and also the central bank’s indication that it would raise interest rates at least three times in 2022. “ The flight of funds, which had reached the shores of emerging markets, as the quantitative easing began with the outbreak of the pandemic, is gradually finding its way back to where it came from, a feature (that was witnessed) with earlier taperings too,” Thomas said in a note. This trend is likely to accelerate further before it could moderate as the excitement relating to the Budget takes over, he said. The session’s slide also left investors poorer by Rs 4.7 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 262.2 lakh crore, BSE data showed. With the US market opening lower and diving deep in the red, dealers here said that the weakness in the domestic market would probably continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-falls-889-pts-on-fed-move-biggest-fpi-selloff-since-march-20/articleshow/88348383.cms||---

Revised prices for CNG are Rs 63.50 per kg and Rs 38 per unit for piped gas. This year, the CNG rate in the Mumbai metropolitan region has been hiked by around Rs 16 in 11 months, a huge burden for over 8 lakh consumers, including over 3 lakh private car users apart from public transport modes like autos, taxis and buses. This is the fourth price hike in the past three months of the essential item. The black-and-yellow taxi and autorickshaw unions are now demanding another hike of Rs 5 and Rs 2, respectively, in minimum fares following the hike. Mumbai Rickshawmen’s Union leader Thampy Kurien said the fare hikes given earlier this year were based on CNG price being below Rs 50, but now this has gone over Rs 60, reducing earnings for drivers. Mumbai Taximen’s Union leader A L Quadros has said due to the huge fuel price hikes in 2021, many drivers want to switch to electric cabs in the near future. Many aggregator cab drivers had switched from diesel to CNG to save costs, but the hikes are impacting their profits too. They are likely to demand an increase in fares which will impact riders, sources said. A spokesperson from Mahanagar Gas Limited (MGL) said the CNG and piped gas rates were hiked to meet the shortfall in domestic gas allocation. “Since there is a substantial increase in natural gas prices internationally, we are constrained to increase prices of CNG and piped gas in Mumbai.” She pointed out that even after the price revision, CNG offers attractive savings of about 60% and 33% as compared to petrol and diesel, respectively, at current price levels in Mumbai. The comparative price of petrol is Rs 109.98 per litre and diesel is retailing at Rs 94.14 per litre. “Also, domestic piped gas offers 24% savings as compared to the current price of domestic LPG cylinder -- nearly Rs 900 per cylinder in Mumbai. Piped gas is safe, reliable and environmentally friendly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cng-piped-gas-rates-hiked-again-cng-up-rs-16-in-1-year/articleshow/88348774.cms||Somit Sen

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Rs 32,000 crore creative economy in last pre-Covid Durga Puja fuelled growth in other sectors||KOLKATA: Durga Puja, inscribed on the representative list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, is not only the biggest religious and cultural event on Bengal’s festive calendar but also a driver of an economy that generates employment across sectors and attracts tourists from across India and abroad. In a study by the West Bengal tourism department along with British Council in 2019, the creative economy around Durga Puja was pegged at Rs 32,377 crore annually, fuelling growth in sectors like retail, food and beverage, lighting and illumination, idol-making and others. The figure was around 2.6% of the state GDP in 2019. Prominent puja organisers in the city said the UNESCO tag will help scale up the festival in both stature and business, adding that the festival celebrated in a muted manner in 2020 and 2021 did help prop up the urban and local economy during the pandemic, generating employment for idol-makers, dhakis, retailers and those in food and beverage business. The research was led by Queen Mary University of London and supported by IIT-Kharagpur. The quantitative report was prepared by Smart Cube India Pvt Ltd.“It is a one-of-its-kind study on Durga Puja exploring the economic impact on various industries associated with the festival. The study showed that months before the festival, industries like idolmaking, retail, manufacturing and advertisement would start getting a financial boost. Just before and during the festival, industries like lighting and illumination, decorators, tourism and food & beverage would start thriving,” said a tourism department official. According to the study, retail got a boost of over Rs 27,300 crore while the food and beverage industry saw Rs 2,854 crore. Installation, arts and decoration saw spending of over Rs 806 crore with maximum happening in Kolkata. Other industries like lights and illumination, idol making, tourism and literature, and publishing also saw spending of several hundred crores. Organisers feel the immersion carnival on Red Road also played a role in bringing recognition. “In the past two years, the festival shrunk due to the pandemic and financial crunch, but it still played a part in enthusing the local economy. The UNESCO tag will help us attract more international attention. This will have a positive impact on the economy of the state,” said Saswata Basu, secretary of Forum for Durgotsab, an umbrella body of over 500 Durga Pujas in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rs-32k-cr-creative-economy-in-last-pre-cov-durga-puja-fuelled-growth-in-other-sectors/articleshow/88348106.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The RJD said the NDA partners were responsible for the state’s poor condition and the differences in their statements over special status were nothing but “noora-kushti”. Addressing mediapersons at RJD headquarters here, party’s spokespersons Chitranjan Gagan, Mritunjay Tiwari, Ejaz Ahmad and Abha Rani accused the two NDA partners of just doing politics in the name of development. Gagan said it was CM Nitish Kumar who had said he would not join hands with those who will not give special status to Bihar. “After forming the government, the NDA partners had claimed that the double-engine government will work for the development of the state. The reality is that both JD(U) and BJP have not let Bihar get the special status during its bifurcation,” Gagan said, recalling how RJD had been raising this issue even though it was not in power when Jharkhnad was carved out of Bihar. BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel dismissed RJD’s allegations and said the Centre had allotted funds to Bihar under special packages.  “However, it is true that the kind of development which should have taken place has not happened. We are discussing it with our alliance partners. As far as special status demand is concerned, it will be granted when a provision in this regard is made.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-jdu-bjp-misleading-people-on-special-status-issue/articleshow/88347163.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Now, education minister pitches for special status to Bihar||PATNA: Senior JD(U) functionary and state education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Friday raised a demand for grant of special category status to Bihar to rid it of its backwardness. Inaugurating a two-day national seminar on ‘Raising agricultural productivity and farmers’ incomes in Bihar’, organised by Patliputra School of Economics (PSE) at Aryabhatta Knowledge University here, the minister said despite the fastest annual growth rate recorded in the country for the last several years, Bihar has been placed at the bottom in the recent report of NITI Aayog on the multidimensional poverty index. Incidentally, NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand was also present at the function. State planning and implementation minister Bijendra Yadav had written to NITI Aayog vice-chairman recently for grant of special status to Bihar. The education minister said plagued with scanty natural resources and perennial floods and droughts, Bihar is unable to make desired socio-economic development. “If the NITI Aayog feels difficulties in meeting the demand for special status to the state, the Centre must allocate its financial assistance to the state in 90:10 ratio to ensure its desired economic growth,” he said. The minister claimed that the state has made remarkable progress in the field of agriculture during the last 15 years through its three well-pronounced agricultural road maps and agricultural cabinet. “With 96% increase in production of rice, 84% in wheat and 125% in maize, the state’s overall agricultural productivity has increased considerably during the period. The farmers’ income has also increased accordingly and this is why the per capita income of the state has increased from Rs 8,000 in 2005-06 to Rs 50,000 at present,” he said. The minister regretted that due to heavy siltation, the rivers of Bihar are drying. He pleaded for formulating a silt management policy at the national level so that the drying rivers could be saved. NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand elaborated some areas where the state is lagging behind and pleaded for special attention for their improvement. He suggested that organic farming and tissue culture should be taken upon on a large scale for enhancing food security and environmental conservation of the state. Education department’s additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar and agriculture department secretary N Sravana Kumar also addressed the seminar. PSE director S K Bhaumik welcomed the guests and introduced the theme of the seminar. Saad Ashgar Moeeini proposed a vote of thanks. Leading economists and academics from premier institutions of the country are participating in the seminar. The topics being discussed in altogether nine different sessions include costs of cultivation and returns to farming in Bihar, agricultural risks and crop insurance, irrigation development and water management for agriculture, climate change and agriculture, problems of agricultural marketing, rural infrastructure development and evaluation of government schemes for agricultural development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-education-minister-pitches-for-special-status-to-bihar/articleshow/88347149.cms||B K Mishra

As many as 16 players moved the court seeking directions to allow them to participate in the national level sports events. The petitioners said they were not being sent to participate in the sub-junior national championship and senior national kabaddi championship due to internal disputes between SAAP, Andhra Kabaddi Association (AKA) and its secretary V Veera Lankaiah. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, Posani Venkateswarlu told the court that there have been internal disputes between the general secretary of AKA, Y Srikanth, and Lankaiah, who claims to be the secretary of AKA. Only the players selected by Lankaiah are being allowed to represent Andhra Pradesh in national level tournaments, the petitioners’ counsel alleged, adding that girl players who sided with Srikanth are not being allowed to represent the state despite being eligible. Considering the arguments and the earlier judgements given by the high court, Justice M Ganga Rao directed SAAP to send the selected players to the tournaments and directed the administrator of Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India to allow them to participate in the events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/send-kabaddi-players-to-national-level-meets-hc/articleshow/88347231.cms||Srikanth Aluri

We are only distributing the wings of the capital to three other regions to balance the development and meet the aspirations of the people of the two regions,” the minister said, and advised the TDP chief to stop “instigating” the farmers of Amaravati. Meanwhile, Naidu said in Tirupati that the capital with all its wings should remain in Amaravati. Stating that he was for the development of all regions in the state, he asked the chief minister to stop “creating rift” among people of the three regions. He said the three capitals was a political decision to create unrest in the state and destroy development. — Gopi Dara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/naidu-is-promoting-real-estate-venture-in-the-name-of-amaravati-says-minister/articleshow/88347157.cms||Gopi Dara

Even though the state has not reported any Omicron case till date, the number of people infected with this new variant is rising considerably in different states and is likely to hit Bihar sooner or later. Health experts predict that a third wave of Covid-19 may be witnessed early next year if the present trend continues. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna Covid-19 in-charge Dr Sanjeev Kumar said as a lot of people are coming to the state from all over the globe and the local people are not strictly adhering to the safety protocols, Omicron variant would certainly hit the state by the second week of January. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant. There is a need for preparedness as the new variant is extremely infectious and it evades immunity. Even people vaccinated with double doses are reportedly getting infected with this strain,” he said, adding that genome sequencing must be done properly at more places in the state. According to Dr Arun Shah, a Muzaffarpur-based senior paediatrician, Omicron cases are spreading like wildfire all over the world. Moreover, it is evading immunity even in vaccinated people or in people with a history of natural infection. There is an apprehension of the emergence of a mutant variant with the persistence of chain transmission. “In a very short period it has affected 82 countries and is spreading exponentially. More than 60 cases have already been reported from our country and if it spreads like this, the third wave will certainly hit the Indian states, including Bihar in a couple of months,” he said. Dr Shah suggested that the government must consider the proposal for the administration of booster dose of vaccine to the people already vaccinated with two doses so that they may be protected from the virus. “Inoculation of children should also be started. Moreover, the government must also strengthen its health infrastructure to meet any eventuality in the wake of a fresh wave,” he added. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar regretted that even though the government is taking all the necessary steps in the wake of Omicron threat, there is no seriousness among the public. “A vast majority of people are neither using face masks nor maintaining social distance, Kumar said. Patna University Central Dispensary chief medical officer Dr Anil Kumar said the third wave of Covid-19 would depend largely on the screening of the travellers coming from outside and the alertness of the locals. “The way people are mixing freely during festivals and marriages, it is bound to create a situation favourable for the emergence of the third wave in near future,” he said, adding that the government should continue to strengthen surveillance, public health and vaccination drives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/third-wave-likely-early-next-year/articleshow/88347093.cms||B K Mishra

KPCC president K Sudhakaran said it was most unfortunate that Tharoor has come out in support of the SilverLine project. “The party will ask him on what grounds he is supporting this unscientific and unviable project,” said Sudhakaran. Congress and the UDF are against the SilverLine project, he added. Former KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran came down heavily against Tharoor for openly supporting the chief minister at a function held in Thiruvananthapuram recently. “Even a small child knows the fact that the SilverLine project is not beneficial for the state. This is a ploy to help the government, and Tharoor has put the Congress party on the defensive with his statement. The high command should intervene in this and should ensure that this MP adheres to the party discipline,” said Ramachandran. Tharoor may be an internationally-acclaimed writer and orator. But being an MP of the Congress party he has to strictly follow the discipline of the party, he added. Opposition leader VD Satheesan also expressed dissatisfaction over the way Tharoor stayed away from signing the memorandum against K-Rail which was handed over to the Union railway minister by UDF MPs. The party will look into this äs to why he had abstained from signing the memorandum,’’ he said. Meanwhile, Tharoor continued to support the chief minister even after criticisms from various party leaders. “Enjoyed discussing Kerala’s development with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. On some issues it is necessary to put political differences aside and get on with growth. The young people of our state deserve opportunities that the current economic situation does not offer them,” wrote Tharoor on social media on Friday. However, former opposition leader and senior party leader Ramesh Chennithala came in support of Tharoor. “He cannot be considered as a full-time politician and he has his own views on several issues. Hence his statements should be seen only that way,” said Ramesh. Jairam Ramesh slams govt Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh criticized the government’s decision to proceed with the K-Rail project. “Kerala Govt is running headlong into another massive infra project—K-Rail without paying heed to upgrading existing tracks.Grave & genuine concerns raised are being wilfully ignored. Frankly,it’s a recipe for ecological disaster & it’s ridiculous CM is terming it a green project!” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/k-rail-cong-leaders-slam-tharoor-for-backing-cm/articleshow/88348018.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Good governance will continue to be our mantra, says Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot said good governance had been the basic mantra of the state government and its scope would be widened in the coming years. He said the main focus would be on speedy service delivery, increasing transparency in government work, minimising human intervention through maximum use of IT and improving working style in offices. Gehlot was discussing good governance and better service delivery with the common man with senior officers of all departments in the conference hall of the secretariat on Friday. He said despite all the challenges including Covid, economic constraints and natural calamities, the state government launched many welfare schemes and implemented them with full commitment. He said 70 per cent of the promises of the jan manifesto were realised on the ground and out of 1,695 budget announcements made in the last three years, 1,473 had been implemented. Gehlot said the Chief Minister Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana, Mahatma Gandhi English Medium School Scheme and Udaan Yojana along with all the flagship schemes of the state government were major steps towards improving the standard of living, health security and improving quality of education. He said effective implementation of these schemes should be ensured till the grassroots level. When officers go to districts, take the feedback of these schemes on the ground and review them and give wide publicity, he said. The chief minister said that registration of every family should be ensured under the Chiranjeevi Bima Yojana. The government has opened Mahatma Gandhi English Medium School with the thought of providing quality education to children from poor background. Eligible teachers should be selected in these schools, basic facilities should be available and student-teacher ratio should be taken care of, he advised. He said the state government is planning to organise Invest Rajasthan Summit to promote industries in the state. “Make it successful with full coordination of the departments concerned,” he added. Gehlot said many times illiterate people were unable to take advantage of government schemes due to lack of awareness. “It should be our goal to reach such people with full sensitivity,” he said. He stressed upon the officers to promote innovation in departmental functioning, maintain regular communication with the lower level personnel and effective adherence to service manuals. Chief secretary Niranjan Arya, other senior officers including additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries and secretaries gave their suggestions regarding good governance at the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/the-scope-of-good-governance-will-be-widened-in-the-state-chief-minister/articleshow/88348779.cms||---

Twitter’s reply before the Dindoshi Civil Court said, “It is denied that Defendant No 3 (Twitter) has a social and moral responsibility towards society at large. It is denied that Defendant No 3 is abdicating its duties owing to the fact that such activities…attracts more users and generates more revenue.” Wankhede and Redkar’s plea will come up for hearing on Tuesday. The reply said that as an intermediary, Twitter is not liable for the content hosted on its platform. It said if an intermediary is to regulate content available on its platform, it loses the “safe harbor immunity” provided under the Information Technology Act. “In fact, it is respectfully stated that given the volume of data which is posted on Twitter, it is impossible for Defendant No 3 (Twitter) to have actual knowledge of any content that may be illegal, unless the same is brought to its actual knowledge...Therefore, the Defendant No 3 cannot be held liable for any objectionable content being posted by its users,” the reply said. It said Twitter functions as a conduit between the author of a tweet and its readers. It said on behalf of the author, it receives, stores, and transmits that electronic record without any editorial review. It also said that hashtags cannot be removed en masse, as they may be used contextually. “Similarly, there cannot be a blanket take down of an account, unless the court finds that all the Tweets are defamatory. This is more so because the plaintiffs have failed to make the account holder a party,” the reply said. The reply also said the place of residence of the plaintiffs was not relevant to determine the territorial jurisdiction in any suit. It said a suit can only be filed where the defendant resides or the cause of action arises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/twitter-responds-to-wankhedes-were-not-liable-for-posts/articleshow/88348790.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC slams Vaghani for ‘rash, shameful’ reply||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday slammed state’s education minister Jitu Vaghani for his “rash and shameful” statement over the condition of tribal children, who were made to sit in the open for their study because their school building was not constructed after the dilapidated structure collapsed during monsoon in 2020. The court asked the minister to be careful in making statements. It said, “We expect a high constitutional functionary like a minister of a cabinet rank to exercise some restrain while making such rash statement in public. We take serious note of this entire episode.” The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta took suo motu cognizance of a news report about tribal students made to study at the house of mid-day meal cook in Vagalwada village in Chhota Udepur district. This is because the school was never rebuilt after it collapsed last year. After reopening of schools, the children gather at the cook’s house and teachers conduct the classes. This negligence to reconstruct the building did not go down well with the court. But what disturbed the court more was the reaction of the education minister Vaghani on the condition of the students. He was quoted as saying, “Many times, during winters, children are made to sit in the open in schools…When I was a student, even I used to sit in the open and study. There is no need to take it otherwise…” On Vaghani’s reaction to students’ condition, the HC said, “What is more distressing and disgusting than the above (condition of students) is the rash and shameful statement made by the education minister of the state of a cabinet rank that there is nothing unusual if this primary school students are made to study outside the collapsed school during the winter. The minister used to study in the same way in the past.” The high court termed the student’s condition for studying in the open as “very distressing and disturbing”. The court also took note of the teachers’ unheeded request to authorities to rebuild the school. “Now the building is gone. The teachers are doing their best to teach the students in the present situation by calling the students from their homes to the house of the mid-day meal cook. The students belong to the poor tribal families and most of them do not even have proper warm clothes to protect from the cold,” the court noticed. The high court has ordered the government to immediately start construction of school and complete it in six months. The court has summoned responsible officers of not below the rank of additional secretary from education as well as road & building departments directing them to appear before the chief justice on January 10 with appropriate reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-slams-vaghani-for-rash-shameful-reply/articleshow/88348787.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC relief for Malik, stay on summons by Washim court||Nagpur: In a relief to state cabinet minister Nawab Malik, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday stayed the summons issued by a sessions court in Washim in a defamation complaint filed by Sanjay Wankhede, a relative of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. Additional sessions judge had, on December 4, directed the minister to appear before the court. “Only non-applicant — Malik — was not required to be noticed or heard, since at this stage the alleged accused has no right of hearing. It is not necessary to make an elaborate reference to the allegations in the application filed by Wankhede,” said Justice Rohit Deo, while issuing a notice to the complainant to reply by January 14. Wankhede had prayed to the sessions court to direct Washim police to probe the complaint lodged by him on November 6 against Malik alleging commission of offence punishable under Section 3(1)(q)(r) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Malik’s counsel J B Gandhi contended that the notice was illegal and the application under CrPC’s Section 156 (3) does not make out a case for issuance of direction to investigate. Moreover, the Washim court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application, said the counsel. —Vaibhav.Ganjapure||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-relief-for-malik-stay-on-summons-by-washim-court/articleshow/88348812.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Allahabad||291 stations under NCR get free WiFi||PRAYAGRAJ: In a major public friendly measure, 291 stations over North Central Railway (NCR) Zone have been equipped with free high-speed Wi-Fi internet connectivity, making around 3,229 route kms of NCR covered with OFC (Optical Fibre Cable). Work of making this facility available at almost 95% of the targeted stations in NCR has been completed. Of these, 124 stations are under Prayagraj Division, 105 under Jhansi Division and 62 under Agra Division. “This project has been taken up in a mission mode for turning railway stations into hubs of digital inclusion and the responsibility to implement this remarkable digital India initiative has been entrusted to Railway Mini Ratna PSU ‘RAILTEL’, said chief public relation officer (CPRO) of NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma. RailTel has so far commissioned this facility at more than 6,000 stations across India, he added. He further informed that Indian railways (IR) intends to provide Wi-Fi at all (except the halt ones) railway stations and only few hundred stations are left to reach the mark where work is in progress. Envisaged in 2015 rail budget, the project of providing free Wi-Fi internet facility at stations aims to bring free Wi-Fi access to railway stations across the country, which also includes small stations located in remote villages as well. Passengers can use this facility for streaming high definition (HD) videos, download movies, songs, games, and do their professional work online. Students, especially those preparing for different competitive exams, can also benefit from the facility at remote locations with limited access to free Wi-Fi facility. Passengers are also using this facility for leveraging entertainments on their personal devices. Feedback from passengers at major stations across NCR, including Prayagraj, Kanpur, Agra Cantt, Mathura, Jhansi, Gwalior etc, have indicated excellent connectivity, seamless data access and great facility for the passengers, said the official. The Railwire Wi-Fi facility is very user friendly. To switch on the connection, passengers need to scan Wi-Fi options and choose Railwire. Once the browser takes the user to the Railwire portal, it will ask for a mobile number, to which a One Time Password (OTP) will be sent. Once connected, the Wi-Fi connection will last for 30 minutes. This helps the rail passengers to stay connected and updated with railway information. “The Wi-fi is free for the first 30 min of usage every day at 1 mbps speed. For using the Wi-Fi facility further at higher speed, the user needs to choose a plan with higher speed by paying a nominal fee. The plans vary from Rs 10/day (for 5 GB @ 34 MBPS) to Rs 75/30 day (for 60 GB @ 34 MBPS), excluding GST. A number of payment options like net banking, wallet, credit card can be used to purchase plan online,” said Dr Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/291-stations-under-ncr-get-free-wifi/articleshow/88348797.cms||---

Kunal chalked out various activities to be undertaken to attract voters, thus ensuring higher participation. He asked the icons to engage youngsters by conducting competitions and other activities to ensure that the main motto of the election commission, ‘No voters to be left behind’, is fulfilled. He also appealed to them to maximise their activity by engaging prominent and popular personalities to attract voter participation. Joint CEO Aisha Vaingainkar said youth have maximum reach in society as they interact with family, friends and have more engagement on social media. “We need to target such youth for maximum outreach,” she said. One of the icons, footballer Brahmanand Shankwalkar, suggested arranging football matches for senior citizens as Goa is known for its football lovers. Another state icon, Tapan Acharya, said he will organise flash mob activities at crowded places while Shankuntal Bharane, a radio jockey, assured that she would organise a live phone-in programme every Tuesday and call in an icon to create awareness about elections. Also discussed were various competitions to be conducted to engage people and activities to be conducted in school, and public places such as bus stands, malls and markets.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt must look for alternatives to SilverLine: Opposition||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government should look for alternatives to the SilverLine project that is being envisaged without considering the geographical peculiarities and without conducting environmental and social impact studies, said opposition leader V D Satheesan. “The project that is expected to cost Rs 64,941 crore will form a great wall connecting north and south and will divide the state vertically into two. As per Niti Aayog’s estimates in 2018, the project would cost Rs 1.33 lakh crore, which will climb to Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2021. As much as 1,382 hectare will have to be acquired for the project,” said Satheesan. An environmental impact study has been conducted only for namesake, and the government has now floated a tender to conduct another study at an expense of Rs 96 lakh, he added. As many as 20,000 families and 50,000 traders will have to be displaced and 145 hectare of paddy land will have to be filled, he said. The revelations by Alok Kumar Verma, a former railway engineering officer who had prepared the preliminary report for Systra, is shocking, said Satheesan. “The government has planned 55% of the project on elevated platforms and in the remaining places, walls will have to be erected on either side. The government agency’s report itself says that there will be change in the land-use pattern on either side of the project site and at 164 points, the natural water channels will be disrupted,” he added. Satheesan said that the Centre has only given an in-principle approval for the project, and the government going ahead with land acquisition for a project that has not been given the final clearance, is mysterious. Verma’s suspicions of whether the project is meant for the real estate mafia is raising concerns, he said. He added that the government should consider constructing new railway lines parallel to the existing lines, and for clearing the curves, only 100 hectare land would be sufficient in addition for which a maximum of Rs 20,000 crore would be sufficient. The Centre is considering Vande Bharat trains travelling at a speed of 160kmph, and the state should explore possibilities for such trains, said Satheesan. UDF will hold a protest against the proposed SilverLine project on Saturday. The protest will be held in front of the Secretariat as well as the district collectorates of 10 districts through which the project would pass. The public march and dharna will be held from 10am to 1pm. The state-level protest will be inaugurated by Satheesan at Ernakulam. The protest in front of the secretariat will be inaugurated by KPCC president K Sudhakaran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-govt-must-look-for-alternatives-to-silverline/articleshow/88348029.cms||---

Bikaner ACB SP Gagandeep Singla said Vikas Meena (27), patwari of Kakda village with an additional charge of Uadsar area, was caught taking Rs 4,000 bribe from 62-year-old Sadaram Sansi to register a mutation in land records in the name of his daughter-in-law. The complainant had applied twice for the mutation registry, even in the Prashashan Gaon ke Sang campaign and finally, the patwari demanded Rs 4,000 to issue the document. When the complainant reached his office, Meena asked him to put the money in a plastic carry bag and leave the bag on the floor of his room. The bureau team nabbed the Meena and recovered the bribe amount. In Churu, a commercial assistant and technical assistant of the Jodhpur discom were arrested while taking a bribe from a complainant for issuing a demand notice for shifting an agricultural electric connection. Singla said the suspect, Murari Das, a commercial assistant or a-consumer clerk, had demanded Rs 20,000 from Gopal Ram Jat for issuing the demand note. When the complainant reached with the bribe and Das asked him to accompany his fellow technical assistant, Manish Kumar, who took him to an e-Mitra owner, Rajpal, but he was not on his seat, he said. Later, he asked him to give the money to a nearby tea-seller, Ramkaran, he said. The bureau team led by ASP Anandprakash Swami recovered the bribe from Ramkaran and arrested Murari Das and his aide, Manish Kumar.

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Babla couple seeks votes on development poll plank||CHANDIGARH: In 2001, Harpreet Kaur Babla won the councillor’s election and now in 2021, she is again contesting on the Congress ticket from ward 10 (sectors 27, 28 and 29). The seat was previously represented by her husband Devinder Singh Babla, Congress’s leader of opposition in the Chandigarh MC. These days, Harpreet Kaur wakes up early and reviews the day’s schedule with her family members, including husband Devinder Babla, sons Yudhveer and Parmaveer, on a breakfast of fruits and paranthas. Ward no. 10 is a prestigious seat for the Congress as Devinder Singh Babla is the party’s leader of opposition and this time, the seat has been reserved for a woman candidate. His wife, the Congress candidate from the ward, is a former councillor. Promising to carry forward the 20-year-old legacy of Babla family’s work for the ward and public, she says people should vote for development work done by her husband and their family over the last 20 years, whether they were in power or not. “I am seeking votes on development and I am confident that people will vote for work and overall development of the ward,” said Harpreet while interacting with media persons at her Sector 27 residence before starting her door-to-door campaign from Sector 27 and 28 markets. In Sector 27, she was joined by former union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, who also campaigns for Babla. Pitted in a triangular contest with BJP’s Rashi Bhasin and AAP’s Avtar Kaur, Harpreet went around taking the blessings of the elderly residents and hugging women in the market. Her husband Devinder Babla made sure that he met each shopkeeper and staff member personally. With slogans like “Vikas ka dusra naam Babla,” her supporters told shopkeepers that Harpreet was the only candidate from the ward who was a graduate. In the market, shopkeepers welcomed the Babla couple and Bansal with garlands. Some had arranged rereshments. A few BJP supporters were seen campaigning for Babla in the market. Interacting with shopkeepers, Devinder Babla said if he is “Babbar Sher,” his wife is “Sherni” and she would always be available to solve the problems of the ward. As Harpreet solicited votes, sitting councillor Devinder Babla was seen signing documents of people who came seeking his help to attest documents. In the midst of campaigning, she also offered prayers at the Sector 27 temple and later, at the Sector 29 mosque. After covering markets of sectors 27 and 28, the Congress candidate and her supporters had lunch and headed to Sector 29 for two nukkad meetings. During the meeting, Harpreet Babla said that residents of the area were neglected by sitting BJP councillor (Sector 29 was part of another ward and this year added in ward no 10) and promised to carry out development of the kind seen in sectors 27 and 28. “Residents should first visit sectors 27, 28 and see the good condition of parks, roads, streetlights and only after verifying, should vote for me and my family. I promise similar development will be carried out in Sector 29 as well,” she promised. Thereafter, the Congress candidate visited the Sector 29 market and attended a small meeting in Sector 27 D. Later, both husband and wife attended a musical programme at the Sector 27 Press Club. After finishing campaigning for the day, the family and supporters sat together to finalise the next day’s schedule and review the social media campaign, which is being handled by Yudhveer Babla and his wife Navyampreet Kaur. Her younger son Paramveer went to interact with youth to mobilise them for campaigning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/babla-couple-seeks-votes-on-development-poll-plank/articleshow/88348021.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

This is the worst government ever in the state, which has taken decisions against the welfare of people. I am shocked at their celebration. What is it for?” asked Poonia. Poonia added that Gehlot’s government betrayed the youth of the state by announcing 1.70 lakh jobs but providing jobs to only 10,000. Raising the issue of poor law and order, Poonia lamented, “Women are most unsafe in the state under the Congress rule. Sisters and daughters are not safe anywhere in the state. Rising rape cases in hospitals, ambulances, roads, schools and police stations shows that the government has lost the moral stand to rule.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-blasts-cong-govt-for-unfulfilled-promises/articleshow/88348819.cms||---

The transfer of technology (ToT) for the kit has happened to Nagpur’s Economic Explosives Limited (EEL), an arm of Solar Group, and Bharat Forge, from Research Centre Imarat (RCI) one of the labs of DRDO. EEL is also working on the guided rocket project and is at an advanced stage. Without the technology for the guidance kits, on which the performance of the rockets hinges, the PSUs had approached the two companies to complete the project. As EEL is also making the Pinaka rockets, getting the kits from it is ruled out. It is learnt that EEL has also not agreed to comply with the conflict of interest clause, on account of its own Pinaka project. The PSUs are learnt to be now close to a deal with Bharat Forge, which has the technology but is not developing the rocket. A source in Bharat Forge confirmed that the company will be supplying the kit. After that, it would be a joint endeavour and the company will ensure that the PSU remains competitive in the pricing. Both EEL and Bharat Forge have got the guidance kit in sub-assembly condition. This means the companies will only be integrating the sub-assemblies into one component to be fitted into the rocket. The same would be passed on to the PSUs. The ToT happened under the development-cum production partner mode, under which the private entity also puts in funds, said a source in one of the companies. Under the model, even private entities are being roped in for development of products through ToTs. However, this has put the PSUs at a disadvantage. Normally, the ToTs from DRDO labs have gone to the erstwhile ordnance factories. In the new scenario, the TOT is with the private players, said sources. Even the ordnance factories had the know-how to make the system if the technology was made available, said a source. After much pushing, the PSUs will now be getting the guidance kits for initial lot of rockets, which would be used for testing purposes. This happened after the matter was escalated to higher levels. Even as it is expected that a further arrangement would continue with the DRDO lab, the private sector route has also been kept open. Pinaka is one of the crucial orders for the factories, which are at present making the Pinaka Mk1 variant. As there are plans to replace Pinaka Mk1 with the advanced versions, even the PSUs will have to match the pace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/guided-rockets-psu-made-to-work-with-pvt-cos-to-get-drdo-systems/articleshow/88348028.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||‘Complainant delayed extortion FIR fearing Param Bir would be reinstated’||MUMBAI: In a detailed order rejecting the bail pleas of police inspector Nandkumar Gopale (51) and assistant police inspector Asha Korke (49), a sessions court in Mumbai noted that builder Shyam Sunder Agarwal had lodged the FIR belatedly due to fear as another accused had told him that the accused former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh would be reinstated “on fall of the Maharashtra government”. While the court accepted that there was a delay in lodging the FIR in July, it pointed out that Agarwal had explained that this happened due to fear of Param Bir Singh who was earlier the police commissioner. The defence argued that Singh was shifted from the post in March, therefore, the explanation was unacceptable. The court said that there was prima facie material against Gopale and Korke showing their involvement. Refusing to grant parity with two other accused who were granted bail earlier, additional sessions judge Deepak L Bhagwat said that the duo being police officers, it was their duty to act as per the law. “However, apparently the applicants, as the material reveals, involved in collecting the extortion money by taking undue advantage of their post, when the expectation is that they ought to protect the people and apprehend the guilty and prevent the crime,” the judge said. The case pertains to a complaint by builder Agarwal at Marine Drive police station against suspended cop Param Bir Singh, DCP Akbar Pathan, ACP Shrikant Shinde, businessman Sanjay Punamia and six other police officers that they demanded bribes. While the bail pleas were rejected on December 8, the detailed and common order copy was made available on Thursday. The defence contented that neither have Param Bir Singh or Akbar Pathan been arrested nor any action taken against them. The court, however, pointed out that the Supreme Court had granted interim protection to Singh. The court said that the investigations are still in progress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-complainant-delayed-extortion-fir-fearing-param-bir-would-be-reinstated/articleshow/88348824.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||Banjaras defy cops, rally to seek noose for murderers||YAVATMAL: Gor Banjara community, a dominant force in the district, took out a massive morcha in Pusad on Friday to demand fast track trial and capital punishment for six accused who stabbed a youth to death allegedly over an inter-faith love affair. Though the police had denied permission for the rally, a large number of community members from several villages, mostly youths, gathered at the local Vasantrao Naik garden to take out the morcha. According to police, one Laxman Sheshrao Rathod from Banjara community was in love with a Muslim girl from the same village. This did not go down well with some in the community. Over a month ago, a clash had erupted between two groups from the communities. Village seniors had intervened and settled the matter. On December 3, six Muslim youths assaulted Laxman after a road rage incident. On seeing this, his younger brother Shyam (23) tried to intervene when the assailants attacked him with sword. Shyam died on the spot. Laxman too was injured. An FIR was lodged with Mahagaon police, who have arrested the 6 accused. According to superintendent of police Dilip Patil Bhujbal, the police had arrested all the six accused within 24 hours. Their PCR was obtained twice and all the accused are now in magisterial custody. Alleging that the investigation was going on at a snail’s pace, Banjara community members, led by Gor Sena national president Sandesh Chavan, decided to take out the morcha to demand justice for the deceased. A large number of protesters, who came in vehicles from different villages, were stopped outside the town by the police. As the police did not allow the vehicles to enter the town, the protesters walked down to join the rally. The morcha culminated into a public meeting at the local Vasantrao Naik Square and was addressed by community leaders. Sitting NCP MLA Indranil Naik tried to meet the protesters. However, the mob started sloganeering against the MLA forcing him to retreat under police escort. Chavan said Naik has no moral right to address the Banjaras as he has done nothing to ensure justice for the deceased, apart from writing a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Heavy police deployment was made in view of the morcha. Later, a delegation met SDO Savan Kumar and submitted a memorandum of demands which include fast track trial, Rs25 lakh compensation to the family of the deceased, protection under atrocities Act etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/banjaras-defy-cops-rally-to-seek-noose-for-murderers/articleshow/88348829.cms||---

Also, while all parties are flaunting their star campaigners to woo voters, SAD does not have a star campaigner, said former Member Parliament Prem Singh Chandumajra. Confident of winning all the seats in the civic body elections, Chandumajra said, “At present, we have no star campaigner. Our candidates in Chandigarh are going all out to campaign.” The claims seems to be exaggerated as Chandigarh SAD president Hardeep Singh Buterla, who is contesting from ward number 30, has not revealed his campaign schedule. Dr Daljit Singh Cheema said the Akali-BSP alliance would win with a huge majority, while Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party would be defeated. Other candidates from SAD are Randeep Kaur from Ward 1, Sunil Rathi from Ward 2, Surjit Singh's wife Karamjit Kaur from Ward 6, Kuldeep Singh from Ward 14, Jagtar Singh Pappi from Ward 24, Gurpreet Singh from Ward 25 and Parjinder Singh Lali from Ward 32. SAD Chandigarh awaits confirmation of names of star campaigners to solicit votes as no names have been announced as yet. Other parties like Congress, BJP and even AAP have already announced the arrival of their star campaigners in Chandigarh. SAD candidates have been maintaining a low profile in campaigning. The candidates can hardly be seen go from door to door or hold public meetings. Sources said that SAD candidates are connecting with voters personally on phone or social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sads-low-profile-betrays-fatalistic-approach-to-polls/articleshow/88348034.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

He said even during the pandemic, the state government’s efficient Covid management measures were appreciated from across the nation including the Prime Minister. “At a time when oxygen supply was taken over by the Centre and Rajasthan was getting less than the required oxygen, the state government did everything possible to save people's lives. Dry ration and food was provided to the needy with the motto of 'no person sleeps hungry',” he added. The state government ensured free treatment for Covid and Black Fungus patients including supply of free ‘expensive’ injections ranging from Rs 40,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Even free transportation was allowed till Haridwar for immersion of ashes of Covid-19 deceased. Accounting the achievements of the state government, he said, 5 lakh medical cover was given to each family under the Chiranjeevi Health Insurance schemes and even the Seventh Pay Commission was implemented for Roadways employees. Financial aid was provided to 3.5 crore people including elderly, disabled, widow pension. He said pattas were being issued to people through special campaigns. The state minister boasted that the government had fulfilled 70% of the party manifesto in three years and the remaining would be fulfilled in the coming days.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Bundi POCSO court convicts 24-year-old rapist to 20-year jail||KOTA: A POCSO court in Bundi convicted 24-year old Banwari Meena to 20-years imprisonment despite the rape survivor and her family members turning hostile before the court. The court, on the basis of scientific evidences of presence of semen DNA of the convict in vaginal swab of the minor rape survivor, also slapped a fine of Rs. 70,000 upon the convict on Thursday. For the speedy trial in the matter, Bundi district police included the case under ‘Case Officer Scheme’ after the minor survivor had lodged a case in the matter in Basoli police station on February 3, 2020 and submitted a charge sheet against the accused in 30 days on March 5, 2020. “The FSL report of ‘presence of semen DNA of the accused in vaginal swab of the minor rape survivor’ proved decisive in the conviction after the survivor had turned hostile in the court. The court held him guilty of rape and convicted him to 20-years of imprisonment,” said the investigating officer in the case under ‘Case Officer Scheme’, DSP and CO Hindoli, Shyamsunder Vishnoi. The convict, along with his friend, Sonu abducted a 16-year old girl around 22 months ago in Basoli police station area of Bundi and raped her. However Sonu was acquitted in absence of evidence against him. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court -1 convicted Meena, a resident of Talera police station area, Bundi for abducting and raping the 16-year old girl from a village under Basoli police station area of the district, public prosecutor at POCSO court – 1, Rakesh Thakur told on Friday. After the family members of the minor survivor turned hostile, the statements of 17 witnesses, including policemen, who had collected the evidence and investigated the matter; medical staff that conducted medical examinations upon the survivor, proved significant in the conviction, he added. “The hostile minor survivor refused to identify the accused in the court after the family members of the survivor had compromised with the accused. Legal action would also be initiated against the hostiles,” said DSP Vishnoi on Friday. Earlier, the rape survivor in her report alleged the convict alongwith his friend, Sonu, abducted her from her house on a motorbike on February 2, 2020 and took her to nearby deserted place, where Meena forcibly raped her while his friend stood guarded.

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Two more found dead at blast site, toll rises to 7||VADODARA: Two more workers of the Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd (GFL) unit in Ghoghamba taluka in Panchmahal district were found dead, taking the toll due to blast and fire at the plant to seven on Friday. Five workers had died in the incident on Thursday even as the search was being conducted in the plant to look for more bodies. In all, seven persons were missing after the incident out of which five bodies had been recovered on Thursday and two on Friday. The blast occurred at around 10am at the unit on Thursday. Such was the intensity of the blast that it rocked the surrounding areas. Smoke started billowing from the plant as it caught fire soon after the blast. The loud blast triggered vibrations that shook up the nearby dwellings leading to panic. People residing in the nearby areas either locked themselves inside their homes or fled the area. Panchmahal superintendent of police Leena Patil said late on Friday evening that four of the seven bodies had been identified. She said that the remaining deceased persons would be identified soon. “The faces of these bodies have not been charred and it is possible to recognise them,” she said. Patil said that the task of identifying more bodies and conducting investigations in the plant was difficult due to the fumes there. It was difficult to breathe at the blast site. Officials and rescue teams were entering the site for some time and had to come out again to catch fresh air. Patil said that experts from the directorate of industrial safety and health (DISH) had visited the site to ascertain the cause of the incident. Forensic experts will also visit the blast site to conduct investigations. Reports will be submitted to the police following which future course of action will be decided. Police security around the plant was increased in wake of the incident of stone-pelting on the plant on Thursday. Irate relatives of a worker and people from their village pelted stones as they were not getting any details about him. It later transpired that the worker had died in the incident. A company official, meanwhile, told media persons the company would give an ex-gratia amount of Rs 20lakh to each of the deceased worker’s kin apart from workman compensation. An ex gratia aid of Rs 7 lakh each would be given to workers who have disabilities, apart from compensation. The company promised to bear the cost of treatment of all workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-more-found-dead-at-blast-site-toll-rises-to-7/articleshow/88347190.cms||---
---||Kochi||Muslim woman moves Kerala HC, questions 90-day waiting period after divorce||KOCHI: A Muslim woman has approached the Kerala high court seeking exemption from the mandatory 90-day waiting period, termed “iddah”, to remarry after divorcing her husband through “khula”. The 25-year-old woman from Thalassery has contended that she had been living separately for over two years and had not had sex with her husband during this period. “Iddah” which, among other purposes, is meant to determine the paternity of a child if one is born after divorce, is therefore unnecessary, she argued. She is willing to prove medically that she is not pregnant, the plea said. After considering the plea during an admission hearing on Thursday, a division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas has issued a stay on a family court’s order of November 19 barring her from remarrying following “khula”, a divorce process initiated by a woman. It was in April this year that the HC had held that “khula” is legally valid. As per the petition filed through advocate TP Sajid, the woman got married in July 2017 and had been living separately since June 2019. She and her one-year-old son were allegedly chased out of her matrimonial home by her husband after she questioned vulgar messages from a woman on her husband’s phone, the petition said. A petition seeking divorce, return of gold ornaments, and payment of maintenance is pending before the Thalassery family court since February last year. Meanwhile, the HC judgment that a woman can initiate divorce through “khula” was delivered and the woman sent a notice to her husband on October 21 informing him of divorce through “khula”. However, the family court at Ernakulam, considering a petition filed by the husband seeking restitution of conjugal rights, had issued an order restraining her from entering into a second marriage on the basis of “khula”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muslim-woman-moves-hc-questions-90-day-waiting-period-after-divorce/articleshow/88348045.cms||---

Meanwhile, forest department intensified search operations by deploying over 230 personnel on the ground (apart from 30 police personnel on the ground); but they could not locate the tiger. However, a family which was travelling in a car reportedly sighted the tiger crossing a road at Puthiyedam late on Thursday night. Also at 1.15am, the animal was seen by the CCTV camera installed at a private firm which is just 300m away from the house from where the tiger had slayed a cow a day ago. Chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas arrived in Wayanad on Friday to oversee search operations. A group of people, led by councillor Vipin Venugopal, protested when a team of forest officials, led by WWS warden Narendra Babu, reached the spot in the morning alleging laxity on the part of the department in carrying out a proper search. A scuffle broke out between the people and forest officials. The situation further escalated when a staff in the search team allegedly tried to brandish a knife during the scuffle. Enraged residents blocked the vehicles of forest department. Later a meeting held at Kattikulam forest office presided over by MLA OR Kelu decided to conduct a probe into the incident. Meanwhile, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi wrote to CM Pinarayi Vijayan urging the government to strengthen and expand steps to capture the tiger and ensure suitable rehabilitation. He also urged for enhancing the compensation for the loss of domestic animals suffered due to wildlife attacks.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP says Sena’s opposition to Jaitapur plant motivated||Mumbai: The Shiv Sena’s opposition to the proposed Jaitapur nuclear plant in Ratnagiri district is politically motivated as the project will increase Maharashtra’s annual revenue by Rs 21,000 crore once it commences, state BJP unit chief Chandrakant Patil said on Friday. The MVA partners however reiterated their opposition to the project. On Thursday, Union minister Jitendra Singh had told Parliament that the Centre had given “in-principle approval” for the project site to set up six nuclear reactors of 1,650 MW each. “The Sena’s opposition to Jaitapur nuclear power plant is politically motivated. I don’t see any policy stand there,” Patil said. “It is a Rs 3 lakh crore project. And once it is operational, 50,000 jobs will be created. Why are political parties opposing it and denying job opportunities to locals,” he said. Patil also lashed out at the Uddhav Thackeray government for the distress caused to farmers due to lack of relief after cyclones in the last two years. PWD minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Friday said consent of the local people was important. NCP minister Nawab Malik said development projects are required, but not without taking locals into confidence. Sena Lok Sabha MP from Sindhudurg, Vinayak Raut, told mediapersons in Delhi that the government’s reply in Parliament was technical. “I have seen this kind of reply half a dozen times in the last few years. The local population is against the project, which is hazardous and which will impact the Konkan coastline,” he said.PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-says-senas-opposition-to-jaitapur-plant-motivated/articleshow/88348838.cms||---

---||Mumbai||State cops found guilty in just 3% complaints in three years||MUMBAI: The State Police Complaints Authority (PCA) could establish guilt in just 3% out of 675 complaints against policemen that it enquired into over a period of three years. The data, obtained through a Right of Information (RTI) Act application, is significant in the backdrop of a former police commissioner of Mumbai and his subordinates making headlines for multiple charges including graft. The state PCA has the power to conduct enquiries, receive evidence, hold hearings and give final orders in the form of recommendations to the police department and state government regarding initiation of departmental proceedings or registration of FIR once a policeman’s misconduct is established. But the state body only has powers for recommendation; the final decision lies with the state government. An RTI plea filed by activist Jeetendra Ghadge shows that between 2017 and 2019, 1,487 complaints were received by the state PCA against various police officials. Of these, 712 were forwarded to divisional PCAs. The state PCA only accepts complaints against officers of ACP rank and above, while complaints regarding senior inspectors and below go to divisional PCAs. Among the 675 complaints enquired into by the state PCA, 113 are pending and policemen were found at fault in only 22. The RTI plea shows that totally, in those 22 cases, 52 policemen have been found guilty of misconduct in these complaints, and a report with their details has been sent to the home department for action. “I decided to pursue further and made another RTI plea, this time to the home department, to understand the fate of these ‘guilty cops.’ While the home department confirmed receiving details of 20 complaints so far, it only directed me further to the state DGP’s office,” said Ghadge. “It is appalling that a handful of policemen are found at fault in the first place, and then there is no clarity as to whether they faced any music,” he added. A report by Praja Foundation this month said five divisional PCAs were supposed to be set up in Maharashtra. But only three -- at Pune, Nashik and Konkan -- are functioning. An RTI filed by Praja shows no meetings regarding PCAs were held by the home department between April 2019 and March 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-just-3-cops-found-guilty-as-5k-complaints-stack-up/articleshow/88348856.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Mangaluru||MU will reduce college transfer fee: VC||Mangaluru: P S Yadapadithaya, vice-chancellor, Mangalore University, said that the varsity will reduce the college transfer fee that a student has to pay while changing their college, during the middle of a course. The current fee is high and many cannot afford it, he said. The proposal was discussed during the third academic council meeting held on Friday. Shankar Bhat P, principal of Government First Grade College, Kanyana, had written to Yadapadithaya, that a student pays a steep fee for obtaining a no objection certificate, whenever they shift to another college in the middle of a course. “This is an economic burden on parents, who find it difficult to afford it. Therefore it must be removed,” he stated. Discussing the issue, Yadapadithaya said that currently a Mangalore University student pays a fee of Rs 3,000, and a student from another university, in order to take admission in colleges under Mangalore University, has to pay Rs 2,300. “I understand this is steep. We will reduce the fee, so that students are not burdened,” he said. Affiliation to colleges discussed During the meeting, affiliation to various colleges was discussed. Yadapadithaya observed that many colleges, especially unaided ones, requested for reduction in intake of students. Some colleges have also applied for cancellation of courses which have no takers.

Out of 3.5 lakh metric tonnes of urea demanded by the state for December, the Centre has so far approved 2.10 lakh metric tonnes leaving a long queue of farmers at registered agriculture shops. This year, the state had raised the demand for 13.5 lakh metric tonnes for the Rabi season from the Centre. The season’s duration is October-January. “The requirement in October and November was 8 lakh metric tonnes and we received 5.4 lakh metric tonnes, which was a shortage of 2.6 lakh metric tonnes. It explains the reason behind long queues of farmers at the shop,” said an official. Even in December, the demand raised by the department of agriculture was 3.5 lakh metric tonnes and so far, a little over 2 lakh metric tonnes have been received by them. “The chances of meeting full demand are highly grim, which is likely to lead to chaos in the several areas,” said an official. The urea is required for wheat, barley, coriander and vegetables. On average, a hectare requires five bags of urea, and the shortage can affect the growth and quality of the crops. “The deficiency of urea will impact the crop productivity leading to loss of revenue for farmers,” said an official who added that they have writing letters to the central government informing them on the current situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-centre-at-loggerheads-over-urea/articleshow/88348862.cms||---

He also sought to recount the votes in a fair and transparent manner by videographing the same.The petitioner filed his nomination as an independent candidate for the election conducted in October. According to the petitioner, certain postal votes were not accounted for or miscalculated. Hence, he sought for a recounting.A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that the rules under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Elections) Rules, 1995, contemplates a specific duty for a contesting candidate or in his absence his election agent, to make an application in writing to the returning officer. It goes without saying that the returning officer is bound to consider the said application.The judges said that when this court put a specific question to the petitioner’s counsel as to when such application for recounting was made, he was unable to answer, since as there was no such application made and he did not have any acknowledgement. Once the candidate has not made a written application for recounting of votes to the returning officer, he cannot seek relief for recounting before this court, which has got no jurisdiction.Dismissing the petition, the judges imposed the cost on the petitioner for wasting the time of this court and directed the petitioner to pay the same to the Chief Justice Relief Fund within six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-imposed-with-rs-10k-cost-for-seeking-recounting-of-votes/articleshow/88348854.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Not only MoUs, new projects will be launched during summit: Industries minister||For the first time, the state government is conducting roadshows of Invest Rajasthan in districts. In an interaction with TOI, minister for industries and commerce Shakuntala Rawat said the government was keen to provide entrepreneurial opportunities to the youth and women in the rural areas and make them self-reliant. Excerpts… What is the objective behind conducting roadshows of Invest Rajasthan summit at district levels? The state government is committed to make growth inclusive. The objective of the government is to make the youth and women in rural areas self-reliant. There are many schemes through which interest subsidy loans are given to such small enterprises. We have already launched an MSME Act where the entrepreneurs are relieved of compliance burden for three years. The roadshows at district levels are another attempt to encourage entrepreneurship in rural areas. Have you set any targets in terms of investment commitments for the investors’ summit? MoUs and LoIs worth Rs 5 lakh crore have already been signed. The priority is to inaugurate as many projects as possible on the days of the summit so that they don’t remain as MoUs only. Many investors who have signed MoUs have already bought land and started construction. The cost of land and power is higher in Rajasthan. Have investors shown concerns? Rajasthan is a peaceful state where the law and other situation is very conducive to business. Here, the environment is also clean. Our administrative system and processes confirm to the highest standards of ease of doing business. If investors have concerns and come to us, we will sit down with them and find solutions. What kind of impact the pandemic had on industrialization in Rajasthan? Like other parts of the country, Covid had an impact on new investments in Rajasthan but we are back on the track. Now, large number of investors are approaching us, looking for opportunities in the state. That’s why we have been able to sign as many MoUs that we did so far during our roadshows. What strategy will you have to promote traditional industries of Rajasthan? The focus has been to revive the cottage and skill-based local industries that provided livelihood opportunities to people in rural areas. Carpets, handicrafts and other small scale industries suffered during the Covid pandemic. We will work not only on reviving the sector but expanding their capacity and reach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-only-mous-new-projects-will-be-launched-during-summit-industries-minister/articleshow/88348880.cms||---

He issued the statement in connection with the mysterious death of a 10-year-old girl from Pachalur in Kodaikanal three days ago. OPS said that it is quite usual for children to leave the class during school and that it is the duty of the respective teachers to monitor the movement of children, ensure that their students return to the classroom and report to the school management if there is undue delay in their wards returning to the classroom. Likewise it is the responsibility of the school security guard and other staff to keep note of the happenings outside the classrooms and on the school premises. Terming the death of the girl in the school ground with burn injuries in broad daylight, the former chief minister cited the incident as a classic example of negligence and mismanagement by all stakeholders in the school.

---||Madurai||DNA test finds man raped minor daughter, arrested in Tamil Nadu's Theni||THENI: A 48-year-old man was arrested by the Theni all women police on Thursday for raping his minor daughter after a DNA test confirmed that he is the father of her child. Earlier, the police had arrested a 22-year-old relative after the girl had alleged that he had raped and impregnated her. However, the DNA test proved that he was innocent and another test conducted with the girl’s father proved he is guilty. The accused, who claims to be a local priest, is from Devadanapatti area of Theni district. He and his wife separated a few years ago due to differences. The couple’s 19-year-old son and 17-year-old daughter stayed with their mother in Dindigul district. In February, the girl was admitted to Theni Medical College and Hospital where she gave birth to a baby boy. Based on the complaint lodged by the girl that her relative had raped her which led to her pregnancy, police arrested him. When he came out on bail, he wanted to prove that he was not the father of the newborn. DNA samples from him and the child proved that it was not his child. “We once again began a probe to find out the real culprit as the girl still believed that the youth was her baby’s father,” inspector P Usha Selvaraj told TOI. On probing the girl’s mother, police came to know that the girl stayed with her father for a few months last year. Suspecting his role, samples from her father and the baby were tested. The DNA test revealed that it was his child. “After tracking the case for three months, we arrested the father. He was remanded in judicial custody till December 29,” the inspector said. The man is being subjected to a potency test and medical examination. “As of now, he has been booked only under one section of the Pocso Act. But he will be booked under multiple sections of IPC and Pocso Act in the chargesheet for raping his daughter, lying to her, making her believe that someone else raped her and for trying to cover up his crime,” Usha added. The baby boy would be given for adoption through government agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dna-test-finds-man-raped-minor-daughter-arrested/articleshow/88348868.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Temperature dips to 13.9 degree Celsius, chilly spell to continue in Kolkata, says Met||KOLKATA: The mercury dropped to 13.9°C in Kolkata on Friday, the season’s lowest so far, even as the Met office predicted a further drop early next week. With the northwesterly winds set to get even stronger, the cool spell will continue till at least the middle of next week, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). The minimum temperature in the city had been 14.2°C since Wednesday. “It will get chillier on Monday and Tuesday as the north-westerly gains further strength. The temperature could plunge to 12°C. But the minimum temperature may spiral up marginally on Saturday and Sunday,” said RMC director G K Das. With temperature sliding, the city’s air quality turned ‘poor’. Across the stations, the air quality hovered around poor (201-300), leaving the city gasping for fresh air. However, the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) located at Rabindra Bharati University campus on BT Road had a surprised reversal — it has continuously been very poor, but on Thursday, it improved to ‘poor’. This is the season’s first chilly spell that commenced earlier this week with a threedegree drop in mercury from 18°C to 15°C on Monday. Since then, the minimum temperature has remained below 15°C. “Now, the mercury is set to drop further,” said Das. The chill has been generated by snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir last week. “It has triggered cool winds that are now flowing across the north Indian plains and have reached south Bengal. Mercury has dropped across the north Indian states and Kolkata is no exception,” said Das. Last week, a low-pressure trough above Bay of Bengal led to clouds and intermittent rain in Kolkata. The minimum temperature got pushed up to 19°C. The cloud cover had also brought the maximum temperature down to 22°C in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/chill-gets-sharper-mercury-to-touch-12-degrees-next-week/articleshow/88348104.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Earlier, it was a one-man show. The PGI administration is also trying to set up a system where waiting list will be displayed on its website. Last month, TOI had reported the lack of transparency in the private room allotment in PGI. “Some recommendations have been given by the committee, which included decentralisation of private room allotment. Implying that each centre, including Advanced Cardiac Centre and Advanced Trauma Centre etc, will have its own waiting list and private room allocation,” said Prof Surjit Singh, director, PGI. He said, “From time to time, the committee will keep on reviewing the recommendations. However, as demand outweighs supply, this will not be so easy.” There are 215 private rooms in PGI, but those looking for admissions do not know where they stand in the waiting list. Daily three to four private rooms are allotted to patients on the basis of seniority after booking the room in advance. PGI considers allotment on the basis of a patient from ICU, emergency, CCU considered fit for transfer. Also, the categories which get priority on the basis of emergency and availability, on the recommendation of the director are health ministry, member of parliament, high court judges, senior bureaucrats of UT, Punjab and Haryana and faculty/staff of PGI. Few years ago, the seniority list of the patients waiting for the private rooms were displayed. This has also stopped lately. The committee has recommended an allocation ratio for emergency, surgery, ICU etc. Once the recommendations of the committee are notified, the waiting list will be displayed in all the centres separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/7-member-team-to-decide-pgi-room-allotment/articleshow/88348100.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The decision was taken by the Bow Barracks Residents’ Welfare Association in the wake of the pandemic and ongoing scare of the Omicron variant. Last Christmas non-residents of Bow Barracks were not allowed to attend the celebrations. This year the association decided to levy a charge of Rs 300 for residents and Rs 600 for non-residents for the musical night along with dinner on December 21. “A lot of people come to attend the musical night so we decided to levy a charge to control the crowd,” said Angela Govindraj, secretary of the association. “We took the decision keeping in mind the safety of the residents. The pandemic isn’t over and now the new variant has also been reported in Bengal, so we don’t want to take any chances,” said Govindraj. Christmas celebrations in Bow Barracks continue for almost two weeks. “On other days, non-residents can come but we request them to keep moving so everybody gets a chance. There should not be overcrowding,” she said. Bow Barracks was built as Garrisons’ mess in 1918 for soldiers during World War I, but they refused to move in.

---||Mumbai||IPS officer quizzed for 3 hrs abouthis posting||Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday questioned IPS officer and Akola superintendent of police G Sreedhar for three hours in the money-laundering case linked to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. On Thursday, they had questioned deputy commissioner of police (traffic) of Pune police Rahul Shrirame and have summoned four other IPS-SPS rank officers to record their statements. The agency is probing if these officials got their postings through consideration during Deshmukh’s tenure. The ED is probing two aspects in the money laundering case registered against Deshmukh based on the CBI FIR. Deshmukh has been accused of misusing his home minister post and asking then police officer (now dismissed) Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from bar owners for him every month.

---||Delhi||Delhi pollution: Only ‘essential’ construction allowed||NEW DELHI: The Commission on Air Quality Management in Delhi and NCR ordered the continuation of restrictions on construction activities except when related to essential and important projects, including healthcare, public utilities and defence. Citing several studies that determine construction and demolition as the major polluter and pointing out on Friday that the city’s air quality was still ‘very-poor’, CAQM prolonged the restriction on residential and other constructions till further orders. Track the pollution level in your cityCAQM allowed construction and demolition work for railways, metro train networks, airports, ISBTs, defence, projects of national importance, hospitals, highways and public utility projects. It, however, added these were subject to strict C&D waste management rules, including dust mitigation. On November 16, the commission had restricted construction activities in the capital in the wake of rising pollution levels. Delhi government had urged the Supreme Court to allow it to resume construction of its hospital in preparation for a possible third Covid wave, in response to which the apex court asked CAQM to take appropriate measures. Keeping the still toxic air of the city in mind, the panel has allowed construction of hospitals and healthcare infrastructure. Citing a 2016 IIT Kanpur study, the committee said that C&D activities in Delhi were the most consistent and third highest contributor source to PM10 pollutants. The study established that C&D created a load of 5,167kg per day of PM10 and 1,292kg per day of PM2.5. CAQM also recalled a 2018 study by Automotive Research Association of India and The Energy and Resources Institute stating that the PM10 contribution of dust sources such roads and construction sites in Delhi and NCR towns was significantly higher in winter and ranged from 23% and 31%, while the contribution to PM2.5 in the same season was 15%. “Taking into consideration these different studies showing C&D is a major contributor of air pollution across the NCR, the commission is of the view that except for above exemptions, C&D activities will not be allowed in the NCR till further orders,” CAQM declared, adding, “Since the current AQI is in the ‘very poor’ category, it would not be advisable to allow operations at all C&D sites. Based on air quality forecast and significant improvement in air quality, the decision will be reviewed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/only-essential-construction-allowed/articleshow/88348906.cms||---

But in a unique case, 23-year-old Jagruti (name changed) was treated inhumanely and held captive by her own parents as her husband failed to give them Rs 20,000, promised by him as per community ritual. Jagruti was tied to the cot at her house by her parents at a village in Padra on Thursday. Her husband called up 181 Abhayam. After rescuing the woman the Abhayam team referred the case to Vadu police. “The woman was previously married to another man and gave birth to two girls. He divorced her as she couldn’t give birth to a boy. Her parents then got her married to a labourer working at a factory in Padra,” said an Abhayam official. “Jagruti belongs to a community in Rajasthan that follows a peculiar tradition. The woman’s family demands money from the husband while marrying off their daughters. The ritual is called ‘daava’. Jagruti’s parents had demanded Rs 20,000 from the man and he had promised to pay the money in instalments. The couple got married some months ago but the husband couldn’t give the promised money to her parents,” the official told TOI. Jagruti’s father then called his daughter home some days ago and told his son-in-law that he will get his wife back only when he pays the promised sum. The husband reached his in-laws’ home in Padra on Thursday but her parents refused to let Jagruti go. When they got aggressive, the husband fled from the spot and called 181 Abhayam for help. “Meanwhile, the woman told her parents that she wants to live with her husband. Enraged, the parents tied her with a rope to a cot in the house,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-fails-to-pay-ritual-money-wifes-parents-hold-her-captive/articleshow/88347216.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court junks PIL against bar on unvaccinated people||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday rejected a PIL against the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) circular restraining entry of Covid-19 unvaccinated people on its premises, hailed the civic body for undertaking the campaign to pressurize people to get vaccinated, and appealed to citizens to get themselves vaccinated and to go for the booster dose as well. While junking the PIL, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta appealed the citizens to get themselves vaccinated. “It is very essential to get vaccinated with two doses as prescribed to protect themselves from the threat of Covid-19, more particularly the new variant, namely, Omicron. It’s time for people to take the third dose of booster.” Five citizens had filed the PIL taking exception to AMC’s September 17 circular by which the civic body prohibited the entry in public buildings and premises of those who have not taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccine. They argued that the Centre has declared that vaccination is not compulsory and therefore AMC could not have issued such a circular and pressurize the citizens for vaccination by restricting their entry in AMC buildings. The petitioners’ advocate cited Meghalaya high court’s orders to support his case that vaccination cannot be made compulsory, but the judges insisted him to ignore any such stance against vaccination. They said, “Even if Meghalaya is very sure about what is going to happen, Gujarat will not do. The state of Gujarat is very vigilant. We don’t want to take any chance.” They also asked the lawyer whether he wants the court proceedings go back to online. The high court dismissed the PIL saying that AMC’s campaign is really in public interest and insisted that AMC should implement its circular meaningfully. The court accepted AMC’s contention that drive has been undertaken to ensure that there is no third wave of the Covid pandemic, as the new variant Omicron is spreading fast and very contagious. AMC would not like to take any chance. The court discarded petitioners’ contention that the circular is without any authority of law or jurisdiction, and hailed AMC’s decision for vaccination awareness campaign and precautions against the wrath of any third wave in the form of Omicron. The judges questioned the petitioners’ counsel whether they are equipped to fight with Omicron by themselves. The high court expressed displeasure at citizens approaching the court demanding interference in measures against spread of Covid-19 on flimsy grounds in the name on public interest. “On the contrary, as law abiding citizens, we expect them to extend full co-operation to the authorities. One should not forget the worst of the nightmares given by the Covid-19 continuously for a period of two years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-high-court-junks-pil-against-bar-on-unvaccinated-people/articleshow/88348110.cms||---

In a reply to Kataria’s comment, Congress CWC member Raghuveer Meena said his comment was a demonstration of his insolvent mind. He said Kataria has always been in the limelight for his derogatory language. “It is unfortunate that in a democracy people respect and vote for persons like Kataria,” he added. On Thursday, during the Jan Aakrosh rally, Kataria had lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for his comment on Hindutva. He challenged the Gandhi family to show at least one photograph of the three generations of the family celebrating Diwali, Holi or Rakshabandhan as proof of them being a Hindu. Meena released photos of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka and told how the leaders of the Gandhi family celebrate Hindu festivals. Meena said Kataria should open his eyes and see whether the Gandhi family celebrates the festivals. Meena questioned Kataria whether he had a picture of Lord Ram in his house. Referring to Kataria's statement on Maharana Pratap, Meena said it was a political gimmick during which he had to face the wrath of the Rajput community for hurting their sentiments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raghuveer-meena-hits-back-at-kataria-for-his-comment-on-gandhi-family/articleshow/88348888.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Railway department to monetise land on Kalka-Shimla section||CHANDIGARH: The railway department is looking avenues to monetise land on the Kalka-Shimla heritage section to generate revenue from vacant railway land using non-tariff measures. A team of Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) recently conducted a survey at all the stations on the Kalka-Shimla section. The RLDA team made measurements and mapped the vacant land at various railway stations on the section. It will also outsource tea selling at all stations on the section. Land monetisation is a transaction which converts a dead or idle asset into an income generating one, explained divisional railway manager (DRM) Gurinder Mohan Singh. The policy has been approved by the NITI Ayog under the national monetisation pipeline scheme of the Government of India. It will look into ticketing, coach maintenance, track maintenance, cleanliness, tuck shop contracts, platform maintenance and other passenger amenities. The DRM said, “Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) is a statutory authority under the ministry of railways set-up by an amendment to the Railways Act, 1989, for development of vacant railway land for commercial use to generate revenue by non-tariff measures. It is an independent body and Ambala division has no role to play.” The vacant land will be put to commercial use, from which railways can generate profits through non-resourceful projects. As per the NITI Ayog policy, most of the commercial activities of the Kalka-Shimla toy trains section will be put under a private company, which may include ticketing, coach maintenance, track maintenance, cleanliness, tuck shops contracts, platform maintenance and other passenger amenities. However, track repair and replacement as well as railway safety assurance will be vested with the ministry of railways. General maintenance of tracks, repair of locomotives and coaches will be out of bounds for the private company. Privatisation will also include rail traffic signaling system, overhead electrification lines, over head equipment (OHE) and general maintenance of tracks. The privatisation process has been initiated and may come into existence by the end of 2022, reads the NITI Ayog report. Indian Railways welcomed passengers on the Kalka-Shimla Narrow Gauge Section, a UNESCO declared World Heritage Site since 2008, listed under “Mountain Railways of India.” The about 118-year-old railway section was commissioned in 1903.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rly-for-land-monetisation-on-kalka-shimla-heritage-section/articleshow/88348108.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

If not for the pandemic, they would have had the ceremony here, but now they have to be satisfied by performing a small Western-type of wedding ceremony, with a limited number of guests in attendance. This trend started after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and has continued till date. Melissa M, who hails from Mangaluru, and recently got married in the UAE, said that she decided to walk down the aisle in a Gulf country, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “Otherwise we would have planned our big day in Mangaluru itself,” she said. Like Melissa, there are many others who have got married abroad, after the pandemic broke out, and some have planned to get married in the coming days. According to them, they are worried that their plans will get affected in India, due to restrictions. “We take leave and come to India to get married, however, our plans got affected due to the restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is better in the Gulf, as there is less uncertainty, and we are not inconvenienced due to this,” said a couple, who got married recently in Kuwait. Godwin D’Souza, who got married two weeks ago in Dubai, said that he decided to marry there itself, since he and his partner had settled down in Dubai. Maria Rinna D’Souza, who works in Kuwait, and is a past president of the Kuwait Canara Welfare Association (KCWA), shared that a lot of NRIs from Kuwait are getting married there. The ceremony is broadcast live on video conference apps, so that their relatives and friends back home can participate. Another couple, who did not want to be named, and got married in Kuwait last year, said that those who decide to marry abroad are the ones who have their fiance and relatives working in the Gulf. “When there are a lot of friends and families in the Gulf, the wedding celebration becomes possible. However, it’s not convenient when the bride and groom are from different countries,” the couple said, stressing that there is also a risk of losing jobs in case one takes long leave, and goes home to get married. Elston D’Cruz, a techie working in Dubai, says that the pandemic has opened up opportunity for a fairy-tale wedding, with a limited crowd, which are prevalent in Western countries. “We don’t know if this trend is here to stay, after the pandemic or not. Only time will tell.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nris-marry-in-gulf-due-to-uncertainty-over-travel-to-india/articleshow/88347379.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The project will cost Rs 9.86 crore. He said that the bridge would be constructed over the nullah and an 80-ft wide road would be constructed in front of the Zila Parishad building. He said that this would be the first 80-ft road connecting villages across Punjab and remarked that the project was a difficult one to conceive of. Sidhu said this would ease travel for residents of 11 villages, who used to come to Mohali from Maloya and other places. The 870 meter stretch of the road was in very bad condition and it was difficult to cross in the rainy season. Elaborating on the benefits of the project, Sidhu said residents of Jujhar Nagar felt as if they were living across a river. If anyone fell ill in the area, it would be difficult to get them to hospital in Mohali, he said, adding that people have to come to Mohali after covering an area of 15 to 20 kilometers in such condition. Sidhu said that work order had been issued after tender and more than Rs 3 crore had been released for construction. The minister announced that work on the road would be completed in the next four to five months. BOX: Badmajra village, colony included in MCBalbir Singh Sidhu said the upcoming road would prove to be very useful for the medical college being constructed in Badmajra village. He also said that there would be additional development works in the slum area as Badmajra Colony and the village had been incorporated into the MC. In future, he said, this area would be known as a medical hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/new-bridge-road-to-ease-traffic-from-mohalis-dara-studio-to-jujhar-nagar/articleshow/88348116.cms||---

It plans to send them to a rescue centre managed by Reliance’s Radhe Krishna Elephant Welfare Trust, Jamnagar, Gujarat. Talking to TOI, Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Maharashtra, confirmed, “In the first phase, all the six elephants at Tadoba’s Botezari camp will be shifted by this month-end, and in the second phase six elephants from Gadchiroli — 3 from Patanil in Allapalli, and 3 from Kamlapur in Sironcha division — will be transported in January 2022.” There are 20 captive elephants in possession of the forest department in Vidarbha. These include 7 in Kamlapur, 3 in Patanil under Allapalli division, 6 in Tadoba, and 4 in Melghat, which are being used for tourism purposes. Reliance is setting up a zoo on 280 acres near Reliance’s refinery at Moti Khavdi near Jamnagar. It will house 100 different species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. It is likely that some of the animals may be used for the zoo, said sources. Earlier, one leopard and three sloth bears were sent to Reliance’s proposed zoo from Dr Prakash Amte’s ‘Animal Ark’ at Hemalkasa in Gadchiroli. “The Ark last month dispatched three sloth bears and a leopard for the Reliance zoo at Jamnagar. The animals were transported after transit pass from the state forest department and requisite permissions from the Central Zoo Authority (CZA),” sources in Amte’s office confirmed. “These animals were surplus. Earlier, animals have been sent to Maharajbagh zoo and Gorewada in Nagpur and Pune zoo,” they added. On sending elephants, Limaye said, “We were not using these elephants for any forestry works and lakhs of rupees are being spent on their upkeep. After the Tadoba elephant killed an employee, we were contemplating shifting these elephants to a good centre. We talked to MoEFCC and ‘Project Elephant’ and they allowed us to shift them to the rescue centre run by Radhe Krishna Trust.” “All the elephants that are being given are untrained. For Tadoba, we plan to bring two trained captive elephants, Lava and Kush, from Karnataka along with the contractual staff. In the second phase, two more elephants will be brought. These tuskers will be used for rescue operations and to handle man-animal conflict. The MoEFCC too has given consent to shift the elephants from Karnataka,” said Limaye. Gadchiroli conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said the three elephants in Patanil are old. Two have retired while one of the elephants was captured from Kolhapur during conflict. These elephants were used for forestry operations but are not in use now. “These animals will be shifted in January at the cost of the Jamnagar rescue centre. The PCCF has already issued orders,” Mankar said. Gadchiroli honorary wildlife Uday Patel welcomed the decision. He said, “Gajraj, the aggressive Tadoba elephant, has killed three persons. These elephants have become a liability and Rs25 lakh are spent annually on their upkeep. Besides, protection staff is also engaged in their maintenance. Secondly, the animals are suffering from herpes disease and may infect other animals too. The tuskers are being sent to a decent place where they will be well taken care of.” Meanwhile, resentment is brewing among local people for the attempt to shift Kamlapur elephants. Earlier, such a move to shift these elephants to Pench was opposed tooth and nail and got political color. “Many people from Gadchiroli and neighbouring Telangana visit the elephant camp for tourism. We will oppose the move to shift the tuskers which provide direct and indirect employment to locals,” said social activist Santosh Tatikondawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tadoba-gadchiroli-tuskers-to-be-shifted-to-reliance-centre-in-gujarat/articleshow/88348115.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

According to the district administration, this is an initiative that aims to enrol as many as 32,000-35,000 students who will become first-time voters. Giving out the details, Dr K V Rajendra, deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada, said that the enrolment will be done through the Voter Helpline App. “Most of those who completed 18 years are in first year UG courses. They concentrate on academics and show no interest in getting enrolled on the voters’ list. So, there is a rush when elections are near. This results in several errors on the list. In order to avoid the last-minute rush, the district administration has come up with this campaign that will be held across the district soon,” he said. According to the plan, principals will be appointed as nodal officers. If that is not possible, then the senior-most faculty member has to be given the responsibility. Further, a lecturer will be assigned to each class and be given the task of collecting details of all students who are 18 on or by January 1, 2023, but have no Voter ID. The college will compile the details and a mass enrolment will be done in the coming days. The dates of the mass enrolment are yet to be finalised, Rajendra said. Karnataka, an education hub, is home to thousands of students. The district administration has estimated that close to 70 per cent of students don’t have a Voter ID. Kumar, the CEO of the Dakshina Kannada zilla panchayat, said there are fewer young voters aged between 18-19 years in Dakshina Kannada when compared to other districts. “Our aim is to enrol new voters through the Voters Helpline app and discourage the manual system. A daylong training for nodal officers heading the campaign is planned on December 23. The nodal officers will be given information and training on which documents to collect for the enrolment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dk-to-enrol-college-students-as-voters/articleshow/88347405.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Kochi||Govt to design special development model for Ernakulam hospital||KOCHI: The government has decided to design a special development model for Ernakulam General Hospital (EGH). As part of the programme, the entire amount for running the super-specialty wing, excluding the salary of employees in the government rolls, should be generated through insurance benefits to patients under Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padathi (KASP), outpatients ticket fee and corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. Authorities are planning to use this model in such a fashion that it would help the hospital to undertake future development projects of the super-specialty wing without further government support. On Friday, a bypass surgery was conducted at the hospital, which is said to be the first-of-its kind surgery conducted at a district-level hospital in the country. EGH was the fourth hospital, and the first one in government sector, in Kerala to get national accreditation board for hospitals and healthcare providers’ (NABH) accreditation in 2009. On Friday, health minister Veena George visited the hospital and met the team which conducted the bypass surgery. Later, she held talks with officials at the hospital to chalk out the design for the new model. She said that the government aims at providing most modern super-specialty treatment at the hospital. Plans were also on for providing round-the-clock functioning of the cardiology operation theatre, George said. This was part of the efforts by the government to provide specialty and super-specialty services at all district hospitals, she said. “The government was providing funds for enhancing infrastructure of the hospital. The government will continue to fund infrastructure development. Once the new model is implemented, the hospital can appoint staff required for manning the super-specialty wing. Post creation is the major procedure which usually causes delay. This can be avoided once the hospital itself appoints staff required for manning the super-specialty wing on a temporary basis. Similarly, delay in sanctioning funds from government also can be avoided. The decisions regarding daily management of the super-specialty wing can be taken here itself,” an official with the hospital said. The super-specialty block of the general hospital was constructed using around Rs 79 crore allotted from Kerala infrastructure investment fund board. The government had provided funds for procuring equipment required for the super-specialty wing and operation theatres. The cardio thoracic surgery department at the hospital, which started now, can provide treatments like bypass surgery, heart valve transplantation, congenital heart disease treatment etc. Prasad, 54, of Ezhikkara in Ernakulam underwent the first bypass surgery on Friday. It was a month ago that Prasad was diagnosed with a block in artery. The doctors at private hospitals said that the surgery would cost around Rs 3 lakh. Prasad, working a temporary driver with Ezhikkara Cooperative Bank, found it difficult to raise the fund. Then, he went to EGH. Doctors at EGH said that the surgery was a success. A team headed by Dr Jayakumar, head of cardio thoracic surgery wing of Kottayam Medical College, conducted the surgery. The patient can be shifted to room within three or four days, hospital officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-to-design-special-devpt-model-for-ekm-general-hosp/articleshow/88347416.cms||---

The killing of the first European Col John Finnis at Meerut on May 10 1857 is the centre of attraction in the museumAmong the documents, which were till now accessible only to research scholars, are rare papers pertaining to the properties of Rani of Jhansi that were taken away by the British, as well as the official order certifying the hanging of Tantia Tope, a key leader of the 1857 war of independence. “These are rare, never seen before documents by the general public, primarily related to 1857 trials against those who stood against the might of the British and whose identities had been lost in the course of time as no one during those days dared to speak or write about them. Many of them were hunted down, some hanged while others banished to prisons in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. But these documents now reveal their names," said Amit Pathak, member, advisory committee of the museum rejuvenation project. Details of the confiscation of Rani Laxmibai's and Nana Sahib's propertiesSurender Singh, the divisional commissioner, Meerut, added that “with the help of these documents, efforts will now be made to identify all those forgotten local heroes and their sacrifices will be acknowledged." Original telegram mentioning the death of Rani of Jhansi and arrival of Maharaja Scindia in GwaliorPathak added that many of the documents are in Persian as civil courts still worked in the Persian language which was the official court language during the Mughal-era. “Only those in which British magistrates headed trials are in English language. So, the translation work is yet to be done,” he said. Accentuating the challenge in translating the documents, Rubina Baig, director, Uttar Pradesh State Archives, said, “These 1,500 documents are the result of nine months of intense study. There are thousands of more documents with us and in the archival sections of individual commissionary offices all across the state. A massive digitisation process is on as the original documents are getting damaged due to constant wear and tear. But, the bigger challenge is to translate them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/over-1-5k-documents-related-to-1857-uprising-gathering-dust-in-archives-put-on-public-display-for-first-time/articleshow/88347411.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Chandigarh||Zirakpur roads choked as truck unions block roads on daily basis||Mohali: Commuters are undergoing an ordeal with All India Truck Ekta union members seizing Patiala and Chhat village crossings, choking Zirakpur roads daily. Commuters coming from Delhi after a four-hour long drive were stuck in a traffic jam for two hours. A number of commuters were seen standing outside their cars, shouting at police for failing to clear the jam. Surinder Kumar driving from Faridabad said, “I have been driving for the past five hours and now I have been stuck for over two hours here. Police could have diverted traffic so that people like us would not get stuck in the jam.” Traffic on the flyover also moved at snail’s pace. All India Truck Ekta union members again seized Patiala crossing as well as Chhat village crossing in Zirakpur on Friday, causing a massive traffic jam on the Chandigarh-Ambala national highway as well as on Zirakpur-Patiala state highway for over two hours. Even though Mohali police had made arrangements to divert traffic from Chhat village traffic lights to other possible roads to prevent a traffic jam, long jams could be seen on the highway from Chandigarh to Zirakpur. The truck union parked a trailer truck diagonally at Patiala crossing in Zirakpur to block traffic movement towards Chhat village traffic light point. District vice-president of the union, Amandeep Singh said, “We will continue harassing the general public so that their cries fall on the deaf ears of the Channi government. We will hold a protest and block traffic movement daily till our demands are met. We demanded that the Channi government revive the truck unions. We also demand increase in rates of transport as truck operators are already suffering from an economic downturn.” Reacting to non-compliance of demands, he said that the next strategy would be decided as per the decision taken at the state level. The move of abolishing truck unions had proved to be “a retrograde one as a new syndicate had emerged, which monopolised the trucking trade, resulting in losses to both owners and traders, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/zirakpur-roads-choked-as-truck-unions-block-roads-on-daily-basis/articleshow/88348144.cms||---

With the increase in ridership, KMRL has decided to reduce timings between each service on Mondays, Saturdays and Sundays. During peak hours on Saturdays and Mondays, the time between two services will be 6.15 minute instead of 7 minutes and non-peak hours, it will be 7.30 minute instead of 8.15 minutes. On Sundays, the time between two services would be 9 minutes instead of 10 minutes during peak and non-peak hours.

On these days, trains will operate with 7 minute & 8.15-minute frequency during peak and non-peak hours, respectively. Additional trains will be kept as standby to cater the sudden surge in passenger ridership. KMRL has been taking a slew of measures to increase the footfall in the Metro for the past few months. Discounts on ticket rates, free passes on special days, various programmes at Metro stations helped in the rise in ridership. KMRL authorities also slashed parking fee for commuters at Metro stations. KMRL is also organizing a Christmas event named ‘Frosty Fest 2021’ from Saturday at various Metro stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/metro-increases-train-frequency-during-peak-hours/articleshow/88347432.cms||---

The protesting teachers said that it was unfortunate that the Punjab government remained indifferent to the month long agitation by Punjab affiliates of AIFUCTO (All India Federation of University and College Teachers Organisation), including indefinite hunger strike by its leadership. Saying that the government could also delink them from UGC pay scales, they added that university and college teachers of the country, except for teachers of Punjab, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh have already availed the benefit of the revised 7th UGC pay scales. As per the existing provisions, implementation of UGC pay scales in Punjab is linked with its implementation in Himachal Pradesh and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Protesting teachers said that AIFUCTO stands firmly with the agitating teachers of Punjab and calls upon its affiliates across the country to send telegram to the chief minister of Punjab to come up with an immediate decision on implementation of revised UGC pay scales. They said that if their demands were not considered, the statutory conference of AIFUCTO scheduled to be held from January 7 to January 9, 2022 would chalk out an All India protest in support of teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-launch-pan-india-protest-for-revised-ugc-pay-scale-aifucto/articleshow/88348150.cms||---
---||Delhi||Mercury likely to dip to 5 degrees Celsius by Sunday, rain possible on Christmas in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The maximum and minimum temperatures have started dipping in the city, with the Met department predicting that the mercury may drop to 5 degrees Celsius by Sunday due to cold and dry northwesterly winds. A wet spell is also likely over northwest India, including Delhi, during Christmas due to a western disturbance, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD). In the meantime, Delhi’s air quality remained in the “very poor” category for the fifth day in a row even as pollution monitoring agencies expect improvement over the next two days. At 329, the air quality index (AQI) was a tad better on Friday than Thursday’s 368. “AQI on Friday indicates ‘very poor’ air quality with foggy condition and northwesterly wind. Due to improvement in ventilation, AQI is going to improve slightly and remain in the ‘lower end of very poor’ category,” System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research stated. Jafarpur was the coldest station on Friday as the minimum temperature was 5.3 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 17.8 degrees. At Safdarjung, the city’s base station, the minimum temperature was 7.7 degrees Celsius and the maximum touched 20.4 degrees, two degrees below normal. According to IMD, the temperatures remained on the lower side at most stations. The Ridge saw the minimum temperature at 6.6 degrees Celsius and the maximum at 19.8. The night temperature dipped to 6.1 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road and 6.6 at Ayanagar. “As we entered the third week of December, the temperatures have been gradually decreasing. The cold northwesterly winds are likely to cause further dip in the temperature,” a Met official said. IMD has predicted that the night temperature may touch 7 degrees Celsius on Saturday and is likely to hover at 5 degrees on Sunday and Monday. The city recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 6.4 degrees Celsius on December 12 and the lowest maximum at 19.8 on December 3. The lowest minimum temperature in December 2020 was 3.3 degrees Celsius in the last week of the month and the lowest maximum 15.2 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-likely-to-dip-to-5c-by-sunday-rain-possible-on-christmas/articleshow/88348937.cms||---

The trial in the case is almost complete and both prosecution and defence will soon produce their final statements and closing arguments in the case. “We cross-examined 45 witnesses in the case and none of them turned hostile. Each of the witnesses corroborated the statement they had given to the police. We have presented a very strong case in the court,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime) who investigated the incident. The police have produced statements of witnesses including the girl’s parents, her friend who was present at the spot, a passer-by woman, a security guard and many others. “We have also submitted all the medical evidence in the court along with the DNA report. The evidence is full-proof,” Chauhan told TOI. The accused identified as Jaso Solanki and Kisan Mathasurya had allegedly raped the minor girl when she was hanging out with her male friend in Navlakhi Compound on the night of November 28, 2019. The accused duo first threatened the boy and pushed him away while dragging the girl in nearby bushes. The duo took turns to rape her and then disappeared in the dark. The boy meanwhile called his friends and also informed the police that reached the spot. The girl emerged from the rear end of Navlakhi Compound after an hour. She was immediately rushed to the hospital for medical treatment. The duo was arrested after 10 days by the Ahmedabad crime branch and they immediately admitted having committed the crime. “Trial in the case began in February last year but soon the courts closed down due to Covid pandemic. The trial re-started this year,” Chauhan added. “The entire trial took seven months due to intervals amid the pandemic-induced lockdowns,” Chauhan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/covid-delayed-trial-on-verge-of-completion/articleshow/88347239.cms||Tushar Tere

Talking to TOI, Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Maharashtra, confirmed the move and said, “In the first phase, all the six elephants at Tadoba’s Botezari camp will be shifted by this month-end. In the second phase, six more from Gadchiroli – three each from Patanil in Allapalli and Kamlapur in Sironcha division – will be transported in January 2022.” There are 20 captive elephants in possession of the forest department in Vidarbha. These include seven in Kamlapur, three in Patanil under Allapalli division, six in Tadoba, and four in Melghat, which are being used for tourism purposes. “All the elephants that are being given are untrained,” said Limaye. Reliance is setting up a zoo on 280 acres of land near Reliance's refinery at Moti Khavdi near Jamnagar. It will house 100 different species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. It is likely that some of the animals may be used for the zoo, said sources. Earlier, one leopard and three sloth bears were sent to the Reliance-proposed zoo from Dr Prakash Amte’s ‘Animal Ark’ in Hemalkasa in Gadchiroli. Gadchiroli conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said the three elephants in Patanil are old. Two have retired, while one was captured from Kolhapur during a conflict. These elephants were used for forestry operations but are now no longer in use. “These animals will be shifted in January, transportation cost of which will be borne by Jamnagar rescue centre. The PCCF has already issued orders,” Mankar said. Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel said, “Gajraj, the aggressive Tadoba elephant, has killed three persons. These elephants have become a liability and Rs 25 lakh are spent annually on their upkeep. Besides, protection staff is also engaged in their maintenance. Secondly, the animals are suffering from herpes disease and may infect other animals too. The tuskers are being sent to a decent place where they will be well placed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/at-least-12-tuskers-from-maha-to-reach-reliance-zoo-by-jan-2022/articleshow/88347575.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The three who were awarded life imprisonment included Mohammad Paigambar Sheikh, Ahmad Ali alias Kalu and Nur Alam Momin. The special court of ADJ-XV Gurvinder Singh Malhotra simultaneously also handed over 10-year rigorous imprisonment to five other JMB terrorists – Dilawar Hossain, Abdul Karim, Mustafizur Rehman, Arif Hussain and Mohammad Adil Sheikh. All convicts hail from Murshidabad in West Bengal. Appearing for NIA, its special public prosecutor Lallan Prasad Sinha and additional public prosecutor Pramod Kumar had left it to the court to decide the fate of the convicted terrorists as they had already confessed to their involvement in the terror act. The court had convicted them on December 10 after accepting their confessional petitions. The ninth accused, Mohammad Jehidul Islam alias Kausar, a Bangladeshi national and head of JMB’s India wing, is still facing trial in the case as he has not moved any confessional petition before the NIA court yet. As per NIA, Jehidul and Mustafizur were senior members of JMB in India. They had planned the bombings on Buddhist symbols in retribution to the alleged atrocities committed on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. They had planted IEDs near Kalchakra ground, gate number four of the Mahabodhi temple and near the entrance of a Sri Lankan monastery in Bodh Gaya on January 19, 2018. The IED planted below a generator set near the ground had exploded. The other two IEDs were diffused by security personnel. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 39,000 each on Paigambar, Ahmad and Nur while sentencing them to life imprisonment under Sections 121, 121A, 122, 123 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and other relevant sections of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and The Explosives Substances Act. Dilawar, Abdul and Arif were fined Rs 34,000 each and Mustafizur and Adil Rs 34,000 each under different sections of IPC and two other Acts. As per NIA chargesheet, the terrorists had made Masaurhi in eastern Patna and Jehanabad their hideouts. They had also held meetings in Chennai. NIA had filed chargesheet against Paigambar, Ahmad and Nur on September 27, 2018. It later filed a supplementary chargesheet against other six terrorists on January 28, 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bodh-gaya-blast-3-terrorists-get-life-term-5-others-10-yr-ri/articleshow/88347202.cms||Debashish Karmakar

But Dandi of Navsari, known for Salt Satyagraha by Mahatma Gandhi, did not include itself in the ‘election’ list. This village chose not to hold any panchayat elections as a mark of respect for the father of the nation. This year too, when state’s village panchayats will go on the election mode on December 19, villagers here will place Nikita Rathod (27) as their sarpanch who they have already selected sans ballot — through the concept of Samras village — a tradition they have been adhering to for nearly six decades now. Villagers claim that the concept of Samras village has now been introduced in Gujarat recently in which villages do not elect, but select members and sarpanch. “This year the seat is reserved for Scheduled Tribe women and Rathod being one of few educated women from the village has been chosen for the responsibility. Since Panchayati Raj started in Gujarat Dandi never held elections for gram panchayat,” outgoing sarpanch Vimal Patel told TOI. “Villagers finalized my name and I am proud of becoming the sarpanch of this historical village. It is also a matter of pride for the village that we unanimously select our leader,” said Rathod. “Many Gandhian workers continued welfare activities in Dandi after the historical march and for Independence. Due to the awareness created, villagers chose not to hold elections since Panchayati Raj was introduced in Gujarat in 1964 and the tradition is continued till now,” said Satyakam Joshi, in-charge director, Centre for Social Studies, Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/in-bapus-dandi-panchayat-is-always-selected-not-elected/articleshow/88347364.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Noida||Noida: Why the housing dream turned sour for buyers||NOIDA: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has drawn up a comprehensive map of all that’s wrong with Noida’s prized real estate scheme – group housing societies. The legacy of years of lapses and gaps in allotment procedures is the severe distress that homebuyers now find themselves in. Out of a total 113 projects that were initiated in the period under audit (2005-06 to 2017-18), only 63% (71) were either completed or partially completed, the CAG said. And out of the 1.3 lakh sanctioned flats, occupancy certificates have been issued for just 44%. Though in terms of growth, the 2009 to 2011 period was the best for real estate developers in the city, this was the time things went south for buyers as the Noida Authority eased financial eligibility criteria while allocating plots for group housing, but at the same time, started offering bigger plots. Having tweaked its rules so that allottees had to pay less upfront payment, citing recession in the western world, the Noida Authority started accepting bids from companies that had lower net worth. As a result, a plot valuing about Rs 500 crore was being offered to a company with a net worth of Rs 75 crore for an upfront payment of Rs 50 crore. The CAG report points out builders with limited financial capability were able to corner larger plots, one of the main reasons for a large number of housing projects running years behind schedule. Originally, the Noida Authority used to take 30% of the land premium upfront, the rules were revised during 2009-2011 with land being allocated on payment of just 10% of the premium. The remaining 20% was demanded within 60 days of the allotment. The CAG report highlights a case of allotment that was done in April 2007. Despite not making a payment beyond 30% for more than four years, the Noida Authority did not take any penal action against the allottee apart from issuing notices, thus condoning the action of such builders. A clause to allow the exit of the lead member was also introduced by reducing its shareholding from 51% to 26%. The change in rule allowed small players to take over the big land parcels that had been given based on participation of the lead member. The CAG has asked the state government to take strict action against the Plot Allotment Committee (PAC), a team of senior authority officials who vetted the applications of the builder and recommended allotment of group housing plots. The PAC comprised the officer on special duty, AGM (group housing), finance controller, chief project engineer, chief architect planner, chief legal advisor and administrative officer. The CAG also explained how allowing sub-division of plots contributed to the group housing mess by leaving large land parcels in the hand of players who did not have the capability of executing the project. The auditor noted that sub-division of plots was allowed as a one-time relief measure during the recession for allottees in financial trouble up to March 2011. However, the Noida Authority CEO “embedded the one-time concession… as a permanent feature by incorporating it in its brochures commencing November 2009 and benefitting not just existing allottees encountering difficulties but also all prospective allottees”, the audit report said. The report also observed that the Noida Authority made multiple allotments to group companies of Amrapali and Unitech “who were in default in payment of dues for earlier allotments which amounted to Rs 9,828.49 crore as of March 31, 2020”, the auditor said. Both Amrapali and Unitech have a large pendency of flats, which have required the Supreme Court’s intervention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/why-the-housing-dream-turned-sour-for-buyers/articleshow/88349313.cms||---

Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer, said, “In the workshop, we invited views of villagers and suggested to them how to put an end to man-animal conflict.” Sub divisional forest officer Hari Singh said, “There are 15 villages along ATR and Corbett. Volunteers who work for preservation of wildlife in these villages and locals participated in the workshop.” At the workshop, farmers aired their grievances pointing out that wild animals enter their fields and destroy crops but getting compensation for their loss takes time. Sometimes, carnivores lift their cattle as well, said Singh. Suggestions were welcomed for better coordination, the forester said. Villagers were asked to connect to officials in case they spotted suspicious people near their villages. Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Kehari village, said, “Our village is located near ATR. Elephants and other herbivores enter our fields and damage our crops. We apply for compensation but it is not given to us on time. We have to make rounds of the forest department offices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/atr-corbett-officials-villagers-exchange-views-on-man-animal-conflict-poaching/articleshow/88347469.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Campaign soon against juvenile drivers||AHMEDABAD: The death of a teenager Rudra Sharma, 15, in a road accident has jolted the authorities out of their slumber and they have decided to launch a week-long drive outside schools and colleges to nab underage drivers. Sharma, a resident of Shreenath Apartment in the Nava Vadaj area of the city, was hit from behind by an AMTS bus on Friday afternoon outside the gate of the apartment as he was returning to his home on his father’s two-wheeler. In his complaint at the B-division police station, his father Rajendra Sharma stated that his son had taken the two-wheeler without his knowledge and had gone to his school. Joint commissioner of police Mayank Singh said that the traffic police and the RTO will take up a drive to act against teenagers who are driving vehicles without a valid licence. The drive will be taken up especially outside schools where the violation is the maximum. “We will evaluate the cases on the spot and register cases under the Motor Vehicles Act.” According to an RTO official, the latest revision in the Motor Vehicles Act has made it clear that “where an offence has been committed by a juvenile, the guardian of the juvenile or the owner of the motor vehicle shall be deemed to be guilty and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.” The officer said that action has to be taken against the owner of the vehicle even if it was without his knowledge. The officer said that provisions are very clear and hence the parents cannot shun their liability by saying that they were not aware of the matter. Moreover, the act clearly states that the RTO will not issue the driving licence till the defaulter attains the age of 25 years, he said. A traffic expert said that despite the amendment in the act, not a single parent has been booked for giving his vehicle to his teenage son or daughter. “Usually, it is the parents who give the vehicle to their kids to avoid the pain of dropping them at schools or tuition classes. Unless cases are registered against vehicle owners, such drives will have no meaning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/campaign-soon-against-juvenile-drivers/articleshow/88348165.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: NBCC fined Rs 1 crore for violating construction ban at Netaji Subhash Nagar||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Friday slapped a fine of Rs 1 crore on National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) for continuing construction work despite a ban. DPCC said that despite restrictions, the construction was being carried out “in a hidden manner during night time”. The environmental compensation was imposed on NBCC for continuing the construction for project ‘Redevelopment of general pool residential accommodation colony’ in Netaji Subhash Nagar. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said that earlier too, a fine of Rs 5 lakh was imposed and a showcause notice was issued to NBCC for the same project. “NBCC was recently caught trying to covertly continue construction activities in pitch-black darkness at night at its Netaji Nagar site. The same site had previously been inspected by DPCC on December 3, when a notice was issued and a fine of Rs 5 lakh was imposed on NBCC. Despite this, the agency was found to be repeatedly violating the ban and hence, a fine of one crore rupees has been imposed on them,” Rai said. DPCC in a letter pointed out that the agency hired to complete the aforesaid project had through a letter informed it that the construction was completely stopped at the site. “The prevailing conditions indicate that excavated earth is being removed from the site through trucks,” DPCC stated in its notice to NBCC. It further claimed that it was evident that construction activity was being done in a clandestine manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nbcc-fined-rs-1-crore-for-violating-construction-ban-at-netaji-subhash-nagar/articleshow/88348946.cms||---

Focus will be on seven talukas lagging behind in the first dose coverage, said collector Sanjay Meena. Though the district has accomplished 78.91% target of the first dose, around 1.76 lakh eligible people are yet to take their first jab. The ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive, starting from Monday, will focus on vaccinating 1.25 lakh people within the first week. Meena said as many villages and hamlets in the district are located in remote areas, it is not possible for the general public to reach the immunization centre. Hence, the health department will reach out to the villages and hamlets under the immunization campaign. Total 508 teams of health workers have been formed for the drive. Each team will be allotted a set of villages each day to create awareness about the vaccination and to also administer jabs to eligible citizens. Earlier, the department had carried out house to house vaccination and also in agricultural fields on an experimental basis. With the looming threat of the Omicron variant and the third wave, Meena has decided to expedite the vaccination through ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign. In the first phase, house to house vaccination drive will be implemented in seven talukas — Sironcha, Bhamragarh, Etapalli, Aheri, Mulchera, Chamorshi and Dhanora — which are lagging in the vaccination. A target of vaccinating 1.25 lakh people with the first dose of vaccine in 830 villages has been set for the first week (December 20 to 27). The department teams will rope in village kotwals, talathis, gramsevaks, Asha and anganwadi workers for the cause. Meena said total 1,424 immunization sessions will be conducted to complete the target of 1 lakh vaccination. It includes 123 vaccination sessions in Dhanora taluka, Mulchera 81, Aheri 449, Bhamragarh 105, Sironcha 165, Etapalli 308 and Chamorshi 193. “The campaign will be more useful for the people who are engaged in agriculture work as well as farm labourers. The teams will be vaccinating day and night as required,” he said, calling upon the unvaccinated people to respond to the drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/har-ghar-dastak-drive-in-gadchiroli-from-monday/articleshow/88347418.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Kozhikode||CPM ‘othering’ minorities, implementing BJP agenda in Kerala: IUML||KOZHIKODE: IUML state general secretary PMA Salam has said that CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's criticism that the party leaders were becoming champions of the Muslim League (All India Muslim League) that existed during the Partition was an attempt to divert attention after the CPM moves to create divisions in the community and for othering Muslims have been exposed. Salam told reporters in Malappuram on Friday that the CPM was repeating time-worn allegations rejected by the people long ago. "The CPM is implementing the political agenda of the BJP in Kerala... It is now in the dock over many issues. Kodiyeri's remarks are part of attempts to divert attention from them," he said. Balakrishnan had, in an article in CPM mouthpiece Desabhimani on Friday, accused the IUML of experimenting with Muslim communalism to regain its losing ground in state politics. Alleging that the Congress was meanwhile pursuing soft Hindutva, he said Rahul Gandhi's Jaipur rally and IUML's Kozhikode rally were signposts of political parties losing their way. Salam said the Kerala society knew that the IUML had never stood for communalism in its 70-year-old history. "We are the Indian Union Muslim League and people know that we have always stood for communal amity. Nobody will be able to wreck that by levelling false allegations," he said. Salam said the CPM had recently initiated several moves to take back many benefits availed by the Muslim community. "Also there had been deliberate attempts from its part to create divisions in the Muslim community. It is now leveling communal charges to hide the embarrassment of the Kerala society having seen through their attempts," he said.' The IUML leader also wanted the CPM to answer why it is part of a front with his party in Tamil Nadu if it was pursuing a communal agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-cpm-othering-minorities-implementing-bjp-agenda-in-state/articleshow/88348186.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Jamaat-e-Islami spirit has possessed IUML: CPM Kerala secretary||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a two-pronged attack against political opponents, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said that IUML is possessed by the spirit of Jamaat-e-Islami while Congress, under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, is advocating soft Hindutva without qualms. In an article written in CPM mouthpiece Deshabhimani, Balakrishnan accused IUML of being trapped in deep communal politics. League leaders have become champions of the ideals espoused by Muslim League during Partition and the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami. “Rahul Gandhi’s Jaipur rally and IUML’s Kozhikode rally are signboards of losing pathways in Indian politics. Both signal the doom of secular politics. What led to this is the bottomless political abyss both Congress and IUML have slipped into. While one is consecutively out of power at Centre, the other has lost it continuously in state.” wrote Balakrishnan Congress is getting leaner in state politics too. League used to stay afloat by way of indulging in corruption using the power it used to get off and on. Both parties have no clue as to how to get out of the trench they are trapped in. Both see redemption in communal politics practised by BJP and RSS. While Rahul is trying to flare up Hindu sentiments in search of political gain, League is experimenting with Muslim communalism to gain lost ground, he said. The concept of ‘Hindu country and Hindu rule’, espoused by Rahul at Jaipur, supports the Hindu nation concept propounded by RSS, said Balakrishnan. “When our country becomes a theological state, it is dangerous not only for non-Hindus, but for Hindus as well. In India, as is perceived in the Constitution, no religion or caste has preference. In this context, Hindu nation concept should be opposed tooth and nail, he wrote. “What an anti-Muslim frenzy has BJP forces unplugged? Birth control act and Love Jihad act were passed in UP. Sangh Parivar has declared economic jihad to ostracize Muslim traders,” he added. Instead of exposing this, Rahul is raising a slogan that promises the rule by real Hindus. “Is it a few appointments in the Waqf board in Kerala or the dangerous Hindu nation policy of Rahul that affects minorities? Is Congress trying to replace its soft Hindutva with loud Hindutva? Why is the League silent on this?” asked Balakrishnan. Since LDF started winning in places that were considered as the citadels of IUML, it is spewing plain communalism to circumvent the new political atmosphere. “The anti-LDF rally of IUML in Kozhikode bared this move,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/jamaat-e-islami-spirit-has-possessed-iuml-kodiyeri/articleshow/88347511.cms||---

This bail plea was filed as the new SIT probing the case claimed the attack on the farmers was a “premeditated conspiracy” and added fresh sections, including ‘attempt to murder’ and ‘voluntarily causing hurt’ of IPC and sections under the Arms Act, in the FIR against Ashish and 12 co-accused. So far, three bail applications of Ashish have been rejected; including one by the district sessions court. The first bail application in CJM court was rejected on October 13. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “Since the allegations are serious and the sections slapped on him are non-bailable, honourable judge Mona Singh, acting CJM, rejected the bail application. Bail application in the same case can be filed in the same court several times depending on changing circumstances.” Ashish’s counsel Awadesh Singh said a bail application of Ashish was pending in Lucknow bench of high court, but after fresh sections were added in the FIR, a fresh bail application with the updated sections was required to be moved. On December 14, the CJM court dropped the lesser charges in the case such as causing death by negligence, and included sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death), 34 (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC, along with sections 3/25/30 and section 35 of the Arms Act on a request by SIT. These sections will go along with the initial charges of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy. Meanwhile, SIT recorded the statement of key witness Tejinder Singh Virk before the court under section 164 of CrPC. Virk, a prominent farm leader from Uttarakhand, was grievously injured by the convoy of the minister’s son. His statement is crucial to the probe. After the incident, videos surfaced showing a Thar jeep trying to run over Virk. In another video, Virk is seen lying on the ground, his face covered with blood. He was rushed to a hospital in Lucknow and later shifted to Delhi where he underwent treatment for over a month. After recording his statement, Virk said, “I was nearly killed by the convoy of the Union minister’s son. The Thar jeep used in the attack belonged to the minister, and this makes him an accused in the case. SIT is yet to summon him for questioning. I have taken legal advice, and SIT can question the minister on the basis of my statement.” The senior prosecuting officer said, “Five farmers from Uttarakhand, including Virk, have recorded their statements before the CJM. Four of them, including Virk, were injured during the October 3 violence. So far, statements of 99 farmers have been recorded. SIT has been requesting witnesses to come forward with their evidence in this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-cjm-court-rejects-2nd-bail-plea-of-union-ministers-son/articleshow/88347507.cms||---
---||Goa||GSL workers hold meet to show unity||Vasco: In a show of strength, workers of Goa Shipyard Ltd (GSL) held a huge meeting on Friday in Vasco sending a clear message to the management about their unity. Cyril Fernandes, a senior trade union leader and an activist from Chicalim was the guest of honour. He addressed the workmen and guided them on certain issues. Arjun Ansurkar, who has been instrumental in seeking ‘justice’ for the workmen, said the union members should remain firm on their resolve. Recently, GSL has seen workplace disturbances due to non-payment of minimum wages to workers and newly recruited tradesmen. It has been feared that the management was pushing for a new promotion policy through backdoor tactics.  The fixed term employees (FTEs) have alleged exploitation, discrimination and denial of basic rights. The GSL management recently introduced some changes to its work practices and timings too, which the workmen claimed were detrimental to their welfare. It was halted after a dialogue with the management, but workers are apprehensive that it may be introduced through backdoor tactics. At the general meeting held recently, resolutions were passed demanding minimum wages to workmen equal to what the state government pays to its lowest category workmen.  Similarly, they demanded that all FTEs should be made permanent with immediate effect. Transparency in revision of the promotion policy was also one of the demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gsl-workers-hold-meet-to-show-unity/articleshow/88348973.cms||---
---||Delhi||Omicron spreads wings: Mask up, avoid crowd||NEW DELHI: India confirmed the first case of a patient infected by the Omicron variant of the Covid coronavirus on December 2. Within 15 days, the number has gone up to 101. This is despite the travel restrictions and heightened surveillance measures adopted by the government to screen and isolate persons arriving from countries where the new variant has been detected. The fear is that the number of infections is only likely to rise. Will this lead to the third Covid wave in the country? If yes, what should the government do to reduce the impact of such a surge and prevent the devastation seen during the second wave? According to Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has indeed increased the chances of a resurgence in Covid cases. “While we cannot stop infections given the highly transmissible nature of the new variant which infects even fully vaccinated individuals, we can certainly slow it through Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Reddy. While reports available so far suggested that the Omicron variant was able to subvert the immunity developed through vaccination or previous infection, the disease caused by it was milder compared with the Delta variant, which was responsible for the second wave. However, Reddy added, if the Covid cases surged suddenly, the healthcare infrastructure could get overwhelmed. “We might not have enough beds or home care facilities to treat even 1% of the possible infection cases numbering, say, thousands every day,” he said. The Omicron variant was reported first from South Africa at November-end. Since then, the new variant has been detected in more than 79 countries and has been linked to a sharp rise in cases in the UK, US and Denmark. The world is responding with a slew of measures to halt the speed of its spread. Denmark, for one, has again restricted public gatherings. The UK has, in addition to advising against large public gatherings, expedited the administration of a third or booster dose to its eligible population. In India too, booster doses should be allowed without delay for those at high risk of infection, experts say. The demand has been studied carefully, but not approved as yet by the central government. “Immunity accorded by vaccination reduces over time. People may require a booster dose for better protection from the disease and developing complications due to it,” reiterated Dr Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent, Lok Nayak Hospital. Dr Uma Kumar, professor of medicine, AIIMS, confirmed it was even more important to ensure full vaccination of all eligible individuals. Kumar also emphasised the need to increase testing and random screening of people visiting hospitals to pick up asymptomatic cases early.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omicron-spreads-wings-mask-up-avoid-crowds/articleshow/88348967.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Road accidents have claimed the lives of 74 pedestrians so far this year. The number was 34 in 2020. Inadequate facilities for the pedestrians, smaller roads and driving at high speed are some of the most common causes behind the accidents, reported more in areas such as Deccan Gymkhana and Shivajinagar, besides Warje, Kothrud and Baner. “The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Smart City Project have made some roads pedestrian-friendly. But these initiatives are limited to some pockets,” said Prashant Inamdar, president of Pedestrian First. Activist Vivek Velankar said, “The civic authorities have misplaced their priorities while developing the infrastructure, such as zebra crossings, foot-over bridges and footpaths, revolving around pedestrians. Proper channelisation of vehicles and pedestrians is a must.” Sandeep Gaikwad, a senior programme associate with NGO Parisar, said, “Nearly all the government policy for roads is for motorized vehicles.” Pune DCP (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said, “We have urged the PMC to enhance the number of pedestrian crossing signals on the city roads, particularly at the major crossings such as Swargate, Katraj, Kharadi, Alka Talkies and Shivajinagar. We have also urged the civic body to properly paint the zebra crossings. On our front, we are taking stern action against the motorists involved in rash and negligent driving.” (With inputs from Shiladitya Pandit)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/74-pedestrians-died-on-road-till-nov-end-over-twice-from-2020/articleshow/88348198.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi tally rises to 22 as 12 more Omicron cases are confirmed||NEW DELHI: Twelve more Omicron cases were confirmed in Delhi on Friday, taking the total tally of cases from this new novel coronavirus variant to 22. Health minister Satyendar Jain said 10 of these patients had been discharged while the rest were in isolation. “All the patients suffering from Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant have so far reported only mild or no symptoms. We haven’t had to administer oxygen therapy to anyone,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital where most of the Omicron cases are being treated at present. Delhi’s first Omicron patient, a 37-year-old man from Ranchi, was discharged on Monday after he tested negative for Covid-19 twice. More than 80 people with a history of travel have been admitted to Lok Nayak with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis in the past two weeks. Of them, 40 people are still admitted, officials said. They confirmed that the number of hospitalisation for non-Omicron Covid-19 patients was also increasing. “We had only about five patients admitted in the Covid ward till November-end. Now, it has touched 50,” said an official. On Friday, Delhi recorded 69 new Covid cases and the positivity rate was recorded at 0.12%. No death was reported due to the disease in the past 24 hours. The city now has 466 active cases of the viral infection. Of them, 187 patients are hospitalised and 210 under home isolation. The number of cumulative cases stands at 14,42,004, of which 14.16 lakh patients have recovered. The death toll from the pandemic is 25,100 in Delhi. Two Covid deaths have been recorded in December so far, on December 6 and 8. In November, seven Covid deaths were reported, the highest in the last three months in the national capital, according to official data. The city recorded four Covid deaths in October and five in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-tally-rises-to-22-as-12-more-omicron-cases-are-confirmed/articleshow/88348974.cms||---
---||Goa||Navy felicitated Sharma on Dec 14 for his role in Anjediva operation||Auditto was placed in command and Kelman was second-in-command. “The men were put through basic training like crawling while carrying weapon such as rifles, Bren and Sten machine guns, mortars, grenades and demolition equipment. After a brief but intensive training, the beach assault troops embarked on the INS Trishul at Cochin on December 16 and sailed for the island off Karwar,” says Auditto, who retired as a rear admiral, in his writings. INS Trishul arrived just off Karwar, and on December 18, the 80-man ground assault team woke up at 4am, nervous but eager to storm the island. Ironically, the landing spot was known as Ladies’ beach. However, in the early daylight, lookouts noticed that the Portuguese garrison on the island had hoisted a white flag on the hill top in the northern end of the island. The first wave of the landing party quickly got into the boats and made their way to the island without incident. The remaining sailors under the command of Kelman started to make their way to the island 15 minutes later. Sharma was part of the second wave, and this is when the Portuguese opened fire with machine guns from the rampart overlooking the beach. “I don’t remember much of what happened at that moment. I was doing the seaman gunnery course at INS Vendruthy, and the next moment, I was fighting on land on the island,” says Sharma, speaking to TOI. He was felicitated by the Indian Navy on December 14 for his role in the operations. The Portuguese machine gun fire killed five sailors instantly and Kelman received gunshot wounds on both his thighs. “Kelman, with great presence of mind, continued towards the beach, zigzagging the boat to counter the gunfire,” says Commodore Srikant Kesnur as he recounted Kelman’s heroics. Sharma, along with the other sailors, took cover behind anything — a rock, bush or tree — jumping from cover to cover as they made their way to the Portuguese garrison. After a few rounds from INS Trishul’s 4.7 inch Bofors guns, the Portuguese troops realised it was futile and laid down their arms. “My last posting was in Goa and I decided to settle here since my home town in Punjab was restive due to the Khalistani movement,” says Sharma. Auditto, Kelman and others involved in the action were conferred with gallantry awards. A memorial was later erected on Anjediva Island, to commemorate those who had made the supreme sacrifice. A pioneer of the navy’s submarine arm, Rear Admiral Arun Auditto passed away earlier this year in April at the age of 86. Naval war hero and Kirti Chakra awardee Commander Noel Kelman passed away in August 2019 at Porvorim, at the age of 92.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/navy-felicitated-sharma-on-dec-14-for-his-role-in-anjediva-operation/articleshow/88364560.cms||---

Delivering a lecture on ‘Growth and Policy Coordination in the context of Covid-19’ at ICFAI, he said “Due to Covid-19, the economy has lost two years – one in decline and another to cope up with the decline and there is a need to go back to high growth in 2022.” He said that in the second half of the year, government expenditures are warranted in a big way to stimulate this growth. Though it looks achievable, uncertainty about the new variant of virus Omicron prevails, he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rangarajan-bats-for-high-govt-spending/articleshow/88348201.cms||---
---||Agra||NGT seeks report from govt on Yamuna Mission ‘encroaching’ on floodplains in Mathura||Agra: The National Green Tribunal has directed a joint committee of the central and state pollution control boards, Mathura district magistrate and executive engineer, upper division, Agra canal, to file within two months, a factual and action taken report in connection with the alleged encroachment of Yamuna floodplain by Yamuna Mission in Mathura. In his plea, applicant Behari Lal Chaturvedi claimed that the mission was encroaching on Yamuna floodplains in the name of preserving and clearing the river and undertaking a plantation drive. He filed photographs showing construction on the ghats and copies of the various complaints made to the authorities. The tribunal, comprising Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Justice Sudhir Agarwal and expert member, Dr Nagin Nanda, has listed the matter for further consideration on February 28, 2022. In his plea, Chaturvedi alleged that the Yamuna Mission, founded in 2015, claims to preserve, beautify and cleanse the holy river. But their deeds have “established the fact that they are perfect encroachers into the precincts of holy river Yamuna for their wrongful gains”, he alleged. In his plea, Chaturvedi said the Yamuna with its total flow length of 1,376 kilometres travels through a number of historical, religious and large cities — Delhi, Faridabad, Vrindavan, Mathura, Agra, Kalpi and Allahabad, where it merges with the Ganga. Each of them has a special and unique history. The importance of Mathura and Vrindavan can be understood through their history itself, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ngt-seeks-report-from-govt-on-yamuna-mission-encroaching-on-floodplains-in-mathura/articleshow/88347533.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Pune||Maharashtra exam council head, consultant arrested for TET-2020 malpractice||PUNE: The Pune police on Friday arrested Maharashtra State Council of Examination (MSCE) commissioner Tukaram Supe and Abhishek Savarikar, a consultant to the education department, on the charge of conniving with the director of a software company to tamper with the marks of some candidates during the Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) 2020 held last January and declare them eligible, after securing illegal gratification. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta citing ongoing investigations told reporters, “Supe, Savarikar and Pritish Deshmukh, the IT firm director, collected a total of Rs4.20 crore (between Rs50,000 and Rs1 lakh per beneficiary) from over 700 candidates to alter the marks and declare them eligible. Of this amount, Tupe received Rs1.70 crore while Savarikar and Deshmukh got Rs1.25 crore each. The volume of the fraud is quite large. We are in the process of establishing the links and there will be more arrests.” The council is the state’s premier exam conducting body which organizes the TET. Education diploma holders are required to be declared as eligible in this test to secure a job in schools and institutions run by state and local self-governing bodies. The council’s chairman Dattatray Jagtap, who is a complainant in the case, said, “At the moment, there is no plan to cancel the TET-2020 results. The police are investigating the malpractices. Once their investigation is over, we will get details about the candidates, involved in the cheating. Supe has been removed from the exam commissioner’s post and we are awaiting the government orders on appointing a new commissioner.” He said, “We will send the probe’s details when we get them to the government for appropriate action. We will not be cancelling the result of the entire examination because it will be injustice to the candidates who appeared for the assessment honestly and succeeded. This year’s TET is not under the scanner because it was not conducted by the same agency. The candidates need not worry about it.” On the midnight of December 11, a Pune cyber police team had arrested GA Software Company director Pritish Deshmukh and his two aides for an alleged bid to leak the question paper of the MHADA recruitment exam on December 12 , which had to be put off. Investigation by the police found incriminating material from Deshmukh’s house pointing to irregularities in the TET-2020 for which the same company was tasked with setting papers, compiling and releasing the final results online. On Thursday, the police had summoned Supe and other MSCE officials for questioning and then arrested Supe and Savarikar. “Our investigating team has recovered Rs88.5 lakh in cash, a 5gm gold coin, 50 tolas of gold jewellery and an FD receipt of Rs5.50 lakh during a search at Supe’s house. The probe also revealed that Supe had given huge amounts to his friends,” Gupta said. The police also seized a laptop containing the list of TET-2020 candidates, whose marks were tampered with from the house of Deshmukh’s aide in Buldhana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-exam-council-head-consultant-arrested-for-tet-2020-malpractice/articleshow/88348203.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: KGMU doctors perform rare surgery on five-year-old boy||LUCKNOW: After undergoing four unsuccessful surgeries at a private multi-specialty hospital in New Delhi, a five-year-old boy suffering from hypospadias, in which the opening of the urethra (the tube through which urine drains from the bladder and exits the body) is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip, was successfully operated at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in just one attempt. Four surgeries of the boy were done between 2018 to 2020 in a multi-speciality hospital in New Delhi. His parents spent more than Rs 10 lakh, but the boy continued to leak urine from opening on the undersurface of penis, with multiple streams wetting the lower limbs. Then the patient’s father discovered on the internet about the research work of prof SN Kureel on hypospadias and came to KGMU. Prof Kureel, ex-head of paediatric surgery at KGMU, who conducted the procedure, said, “The surgery of the boy was quite challenging because the penis was deformed, there was a problem of scarring, shortage of tissues and skin due to previous surgeries.” Here, a single-stage surgical technique developed by prof Kureel to treat such a congenital problem was applied. In this procedure, surgeons use a magnetic resonance imaging or MRI of the area to locate micro-veins before operating. During the operation, surgeons ensure these veins are kept intact. As a result, the success rate is almost 99%. “The medical (urology) literature around the world shows a 10-26% failure rate in the surgery that is needed to correct this problem, which is reported in one in 250 live births. However, at KGMU paediatrics surgery has an exemplary success rate. The boy underwent the procedure on December 3 and was discharged on Friday. He will not require any further intervention and will lead a normal life from now on. The father of the boy was elated on seeing his son able to pass urine from the tip of the penis” said prof Kureel. Dr Archika Gupta, Dr Gurmeet Singh, Dr Survesh Kumar Gupta, Dr Satish Verma (anaesthetist) and sister Sunita were part of the surgery team. Prof Kureel is among a few surgeons in the world who can perform this procedure. He was also selected as Global International Faculty on hypospadias and delivered five lectures at Istanbul, Turkey recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kgmu-doctors-perform-rare-surgery-on-five-year-old-boy/articleshow/88348979.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Chargesheet filed against Monson Mavunkal in Pocso case||KOCHI: The Crime Branch team, investigating the case against Monson Mavunkal for sexually abusing a minor girl, filed a chargesheet against him on Friday. The final report of the investigation team runs into 270 pages and accuses him of offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The report was filed before the additional district and sessions court for the trial of cases relating to atrocities and sexual violence against women and children. Investigation officer (IO) DSP YR Rustom filed the chargesheet, and it refers to statements of 36 witnesses and around 60 documents. The report was filed 59 days after registering the case. With this, police managed to complete their investigation and file the final report within the stipulated 60 days for completing the probe in Pocso cases. According to the chargesheet, Monson committed sexual abuse and rape of a minor girl on multiple occasions in 2019. Monson is the sole accused in the case. The FIR was registered based on a complaint by the survivor, who had become an adult at the time of lodging the FIR. The investigators found during the probe that the accused coerced and persuaded the survivor when she was a minor and sexually exploited her at his home on multiple occasions in 2019. He had allegedly promised assistance in her education and offered to train her to become a cosmetologist. Monson had posed as a cosmetologist as part of his elaborate frauds. Police said that Monson had promised the petitioner and her mother a new house and got their house at Kumbalangi demolished. He then made them shift to a rented place near his house at Kaloor. Monson allegedly raped the petitioner a week before his arrest as well. A separate case has been registered for the alleged rape committed after the petitioner became an adult. Monson was arrested in the Pocso case on November 16 after his arrest was recorded in various other cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chargesheet-filed-against-monson-in-pocso-case/articleshow/88347602.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Patients suffer as resident doctors go on strike again||NEW DELHI: Emergency services at several leading public hospitals in the national capital, including Safdarjung, Ram Manohar Lohia and Lok Nayak, were affected after resident doctors decided to withdraw from all services, including elective surgeries and trauma care, to protest the delay in the NEET-PG counselling. Earlier, the doctors put on hold the agitation on December 9 for a week after Union health ministry officials assured them that the cases of NEET-PG would be fast-tracked in court. The resident doctors alerted ministry officials on Wednesday through a letter about the withdrawal of services from Friday. Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) issued another letter on Friday, stating that the agitation would continue. Several patients were turned back as admissions were refused. “The first day of the agitation saw massive participation of resident doctors across healthcare institutions. Subsequently, a virtual meeting of resident doctors’ association representatives of Delhi hospitals was convened by FORDA and it was unanimously decided that the agitation will continue until our demand is met,” the association said. The term resident doctor, it clarified, stands for all resident doctors — non-academic junior residents, postgraduate students, superspecialty candidates and senior residents. “It has been brought to our notice that resident doctors in multiple healthcare institutions are being threatened by the administrative authorities in various ways to abstain from the agitation. Such threats are not going to deter the resident doctors who stand united in this fight for justice and against any punitive action,” FORDA said. Several patients who came from various places in Uttar Pradesh were turned away at Lok Nayak and GB Pant hospitals . Many people squatted outside the hospitals, hoping for admissions. Several protesters pointed out the “acute shortage” of resident doctors across the country as the counselling of the NEET PG 2021 batch had already been delayed by eight months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/patients-suffer-as-resident-doctors-go-on-strike-again/articleshow/88348997.cms||---
---||Pune||Panel to decide mode of SPPU’s semester exam||PUNE: Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) has constituted a committee to recommend the mode of examination for the current semester. The committee has been told to give a report within a week based on which a final decision would be taken on whether the examination will be held offline or online. SPPU officials have hinted in the past that they would be pushing for an offline examination for all students. The drastic increase in the pass percentage in the online examinations conducted for the past two semesters have raised multiple questions about the quality and transparency of the examination. SPPU officials were of the opinion that to keep the sanctity of the examination and the university’s standing, it was important to conduct the examinations offline. The university officials are stating that the backlog examinations will be held in the online mode most probably from January 15, the regular, end-of-semester examination will most probably be held offline from February 11 or February 12. A senior official from the university on the condition of anonymity said, “Courses like law used to have 17-18% pass percentage during the offline examination. The same in the last two exams which were held online have been 93-94%. Even individual scores of children have increased manifold with a lot of them scoring above 95%. All this shows that online examinations are easy to manipulate. But the committee, made up of four deans, will look at all points of view and recommend the best way out.” Another SPPU official said that while there will be difficulties in conducting the offline exam, there is no other way out to test the students transparently and fairly. “The students are going out almost every day. They are using public transport, visiting public places and going about. Then why not take examinations? But, instead of a three-hour written paper, we can have an OMR-based exam at a centre with invigilators. Many options can be explored such as roping in colleges from across the state to conduct the examination so that the students need not come all the way to Pune, Nashik or Ahmednagar or we can check if MS-CIT exam centres which are already present in all districts in the state can be used for examination,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/panel-to-decide-mode-of-sppus-semester-exam/articleshow/88348209.cms||Ardhra Nair

The last ATM transaction was for Rs 650 in Karimnagar, which is only 80km from his home in Pothyreddypalli of Cheriyal mandal in neighbouring Siddipet district. Police, however, are yet to confirm if the transactions are by Sai himself. “In all, money was withdrawn six times with his ATM card since he disappeared,” said a Siddipet cop probing the case. “When Sai came home on November 16, he had about Rs 70,000 in his account and he gave Rs 50,000 to his family. On December 6, Rs 19,000 was withdrawn at various places between Bhatinda and New Delhi, almost emptying the account,” said an investigator. The 21-year-old gunner had gone missing on December 6 from Bhatinda railway station in Punjab while on way to join his unit in Faridkot. He had reached Hyderabad from his home on December 5 and taken a flight to Delhi. From Delhi he took the Patalkot Express on December 6 from Safdarjung railway station and vanished at Bhatinda station around 9.30am. A Siddipet police team landed in Bhatinda on December 13, a week after Sai went missing and started tracking his movements from there. A cab driver from Bhatinda confirmed that he dropped Sai in New Delhi on December 6. Cops have now found CCTV footage of Sai getting down from the cab outside New Delhi railway station on December 6 evening with a trolley bag and a backpack. He spoke to a lodge agent and walked into an alley with the two bags. When he walked out of the lane, he had only the backpack with him, cops said. The police team checked with the lodge agent and managers of various lodges/PG accommodation, but could not get any details about Sai checking in or keeping his bag there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/is-missing-jawan-back-in-t-cops-track-atm-transaction/articleshow/88348226.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Kolkata||Private hospitals in Kolkata set up isolation units for Omicron patients||KOLKATA: Private hospitals in Kolkata have started setting up isolation units for Omicron patients, apart from taking various other measures to detect and treat those suffering from the variant. Several hospitals that had earlier been considering a scale-down of its existing Covid units have decided to persist with the same number of beds in the wake of the first Omicron case in Bengal this week, which followed two suspected cases that turned out to be negative. Belle Vue has set up two Omicron isolation rooms within its 40-bed Covid unit. “The rooms were created after we received a message from the health department to step up arrangements for Omicron. There will be no change in the size of our Covid unit and depending on the situation, we might increase the number of Omicron isolation rooms,” said Belle Vue CEO, P Tondon. RTIICS has planned an eight-bed Omicron unit within its Covid section comprising a four-bed general ward and a four-bed HDU. “Depending on the situation in the wake of the new strain, the unit can be functional within the next few days. We have a 45-bed Covid unit with an occupancy of 20 beds now. We plan to keep the existing unit intact,” said RTIICS zonal head, R Venkatesh. Woodlands Hospital has identified a two-bed isolation unit for Omicron patients and is ready to extend it if necessary. It has earmarked 16 beds for Covid, of which nine are occupied. “The Omicron unit will also be used for international patients whose gene sequencing test report is awaited,” said Woodlands CEO. Rupali Basu. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has set up an eightbed Omicron unit. “That apart, screening has been made more stringent. It is now compulsory for each health worker to wear double masks, face-shields, gloves and eye-protection at the Covid ward. Each Covid suspect is being asked for a detailed travel record,” said Medica chairperson, Alok Roy. AMRI Hospitals decided to persist with the existing 50 beds. It has revived its Covid Task Force Committee formed soon after the onset of the pandemic last year and includes an infection control team, microbiologists and critical care experts. “They are now engaged in collecting data on Omicron and are keeping a check on the situation in the city and around the country. They are also consulting experts and contacts in USA. Based on their feedback, we will introduce isolation beds for Omicron. We are preparing to do that at a short notice. Our health workers have been asked to be careful and stick to all safety measures since this variant is apparently more transmissible,” said CEO Rupak Barua. The first Omicron suspect in Bengal — an 18-year-old who later turned out to be Omicron negative — was treated at AMRI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-set-up-isolation-units-for-omicron-patients/articleshow/88348221.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The meet was held under the chairmanship of president cantonment board (PCB), Brigadier Abhijit Chandra. SCB is the third cantonment board, after Pune Cantonment Board and Delhi Cantonment Board to exclude certain areas of buildings from calculations of FSI. TOI recently exposed FSI exclusion in its ‘uniform civic code’ under SCB merger into the GHMC campaign. According to the board’s resolution, areas that will be excluded are cellar/stilt/basement earmarked for parking, staircases, corridors, ducts, balconies, lift rooms, overhead water tank area, generator and watchman's rooms. The SCB calculates 1.5 FSI at silt/floor level in all residential colonies under Cantonment limits and is regulating fee for composition of charges in accordance with the provisions of the Cantonment Act 2006.  SCB chief executive officer, B Ajith Reddy moved this proposal as a supplementary agenda item in the board. The Secunderabad cantonment MLA, G Sayanna and civil nominated member, J Rama Krishna unanimously agreed. Cantonment board CEO later speaking to media said, “The board should follow norms applicable in the adjoining municipal corporations for exemption of certain areas under calculation of FSI.” He added that they have been hearing a lot complaints that the FSI norm led to corruption. “People are also blaming SCB engineering wing officials. This decision has been made to remove the stain of ‘corruption’,” said Ajith. Secretary of the Confederation of Cantonment Residents Welfare Association’ (CCRWA), DLS Sreshti, welcomed the move.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/scbs-ny-gift-fsi-relaxed-for-cellarsearmarked-for-parking-staircases/articleshow/88348239.cms||Sunil Mungara

As part of the three-day events to mark the historic incident, the artists of Lalit Kala Akademi are drawing a series of sketches on a 75m long single canvas. The Kakori Train Action took place on August 9, 1925, when revolutionaries of the Hindustan Republican Association looted the money being transferred to the British government treasury through a train. They wanted to buy weapons from the money for an armed struggle against the British. Most of the revolutionaries who took part in the action were arrested. Four of them were hanged to death between December 17 and December 19, some were deported to cellular jail (‘kaala paani’) in Port Blair while others were imprisoned in various jails. Rajendra Nath Lahiri was hanged in Gonda jail on December 17, 1927. Two days later, Ram Prasad Bismil was hanged in Gorakhpur, Ashfaqullah Khan in Faizabad and Thakur Roshan Singh in Naini jail in Allahabad. Amit Kumar, an artist participating in the initiative, told TOI: “We read about the Kakori Train Action and then prepared sketches keeping minutest of details in mind. Images were enlarged and printed on canvas paper. The entire process took 15 days.” “We have not only depicted the entire incident, but also the meetings of revolutionaries that took place to plan the action,” said Kanha Behera, another artist. “Students are now filling colours in the sketches,” he added. ‘Kavi sammelan’ and ‘mushaira’ were also held on Friday in which social worker Uday Khatri was the chief guest. Khatri is son of revolutionary Ram Krishna Khatri, one of the close associates of Ram Prasad Bismil. “My father was sentenced to 10-year imprisonment after the incident. He was not directly involved in Kakori Action but was associated in other activities with Ram Prasad Bismil, Ashfaqullah Khan and Chandrashekhar Azad,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/reliving-history-artists-recreate-kakori-train-action-on-75m-canvas/articleshow/88349025.cms||---

The magistrate rejected their bail plea for the second time in a week. The two, ASI Sandip Pal and civic volunteer Abhisek Malakar, were in judicial custody since Monday. The 25-yearold woman had reportedly identified them during the TI parade in Dum Dum jail and later recorded her confessional statement before a Salt Lake magistrate. Cops appealed for a fresh police custody of the two accused for further questioning and a reconstruction of the events. The duo’s lawyers demanded bail but the state counsel stressed the need for reconstruction of the event and need to seize their cellphones. The additional chief judicial magistrate of Bidhannagar Court, Santanu Ganguly granted the police custody while criticising the civic volunteer again on Friday for remaining in uniform for almost 12 hours since his duty got over and that it was the uniform which made the woman approach them for help. Meanwhile, sources in Bidhannagar police said the woman had also submitted a short mobile video in which she had captured one of the riders in uniform misbehaving with her. Multiple CCTV footage submitted before the court has also verified the woman’s claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/salt-lake-molestation-tainted-cops-sent-to-police-custody/articleshow/88348241.cms||---

Nisha Monteiro, a resident of Kondhwa, said, “It is our family tradition to put up our Christmas tree, and decorate it on December 1. My two children then start working on their letters to Santa. The house smells like Christmas many days prior to the festival as I start preparing sweetmeats, a popular favourite being rose cookies. The lunch comprises of traditional Mangalorean preparations, such as chicken rice curry with a coconut milk base and pork sorpotel, a spicy curry.” “The Christmas tree was bought by my husband 15 years ago when we lived in the Gulf. It has travelled with us to Kerala and then to Pune. Every year, we put up the same 9ft tree, but keep adding a new ornament to the decorations. We have a lavish feast featuring all kinds of Kerala-style curries comprising duck, pork, mutton, chicken. Egg roast, mutton stew, appam and parota are mandatory additions to the spread. Another tradition we participate meticulously is making preparations for the plum cake 30 days prior to Christmas,” said Sheeba Chacko, a resident of Salunke Vihar. Marissa Soares from Vishrantwadi said, “As children, we were excited about Santa Claus placing gifts by our bedside. My siblings would squabble over placing the top star on the Christmas tree. When we grew older, we realised that the essence of the festival is not about receiving gifts, but in giving. For many years now, our routine has been to attend Christmas mass at church and then proceed either to an old age home or to Mother Teresa’s home on Tadiwala road to spend some time with those less fortunate and give them gifts, before heading home for Goan feast with roast meat, grilled fish and festive delicacies, such as bebinca pudding, perad (guava cheese), neureos (a type of karanji), and crispy kormola.” For families with members live in different cities or countries, it is time to catch up and feast on nostalgia along with delicacies. Lana Dopaishi, a resident of Baner, said, “By December 24, all my siblings living in different cities make it a point to travel to Kolkata to celebrate my grandmother’s birthday, and Christmas the next day. She is 87 years’ old, but still insists on preparing the Christmas feast for her grandchildren and great grandchildren. She cooks traditional Anglo-Indian dishes such as pork jhalfrezi, yellow rice, and so on. It has been a tradition for us to have salt meat with bread and butter for breakfast on Christmas day before heading off to church to attend the service together. The children make a triffle pudding and keep it in the fridge to have as dessert after lunch the next day. Though we could not get together last year due to covid, this year we will all resume the tradition and fly to Kolkata.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/time-to-make-merry-and-feast-with-family/articleshow/88348233.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Meanwhile, PMC anti-encroachment department head Madhav Jagtap said, “The survey of these vendors will be carried out. We will check if they have got any permits from the earlier gram panchayat and other documents. The history of their trade will also be checked.” However, Sanjay Shanke of Janiv, an organisation that works for roadside vendors, pointed out, “The availability of such business proof is tough for these people. Gram panchayats hardly had any system to register vendors. The PMC survey should just ensure that genuine traders in villages get trade licences.” PMC has had 34 villages merged into it, including 11 in 2017 and 23 in July 2021. Janiv has now submitted a letter to the civic administration to resolve the vendors’ issue. Around 4,500 permits will be needed for the across villages, and if the traders get the licenses, they will be able to reap the benefits of the hawkers’ policy and other schemes of the state and Union governments. The civic areas already have some 21,000 licensed hawkers. The hawkers’ policy was drafted to set up norms for roadside vendors. Under it, PMC plans include introduction of a colour code and logo for identifying authorised hawkers. A biometric system will also be provided for cross-verifying the authenticity of vendors. All these benefits will be available to hawkers in merged villages after their registration. According to PMC officials, the civic body needs to establish 288 hawker zones to accommodate all vendors. If the hawkers from merged villages are added, they will have to be included either in the existing zones or new zones will have to be created.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vendors-from-newly-merged-areas-seek-pmc-trade-licence/articleshow/88348242.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

As per records, over 70 per cent medicines are not available at the district hospital and SN medical college. Skin, neurology, cardiology, ENT, antibiotics and syrups for children are out of stock. When asked what steps were being taken to meet the shortfall, health department officials said the tendering process for supply of medicines has been finalised. Medicines will be available by next week, they added. A resident of Shahganj, Rajkamal Gautam, who is diabetic, said he was able to get only 1 out of 4 medicines prescribed by the doctor at SN medical college. “Last month also, I was able to get only 2 medicines. Now, I will have to go to some medical store to buy the ones I could not get at the hospital.” Unable to get medicines – which are free of cost -- at district hospital, Wazirpura resident, Vimal Verma, said, “I have rashes on my back and the pain is excruciating. The doctor had prescribed two medicines and an ointment. I have been asked to come after 3 days as right now neither of the two is available. Earlier also, I was not able to get them and had to spend Rs 300 at a private medical store for Rs 300. I am a daily wager and cannot afford treatment at private hospitals.” SN medical college principal, Dr Prashant Gupta said, “There is a shortage of medicines at present. The tendering process for supply of medicines has been completed. We will ensure that the hospital is stocked up within a week.” Superintendent in-charge of district hospital, Dr AK Agarwal, said, “The list of medicines which are out of stock is being prepared.

He was speaking at a session on ‘Urdu Sahitya aur Humari Sanjhi Virasat’ at the Metaphor Lucknow Litfest premiered online on Friday. Author and academician Khwaja M Ekramuddin emphasized that the Urdu language is not confined to any boundaries. “It is not just Hindustani but beyond the boundaries of the country and the subcontinent,” he said while deliberating on ‘Sanjhi Virasat’ in Urdu Shayari. Expressing concern over decreasing popularity of various languages, Kidwai said, “Monolingualism seem to be in vogue as for the last 15 years, about 160 languages have become extinct and it is believed that in the next 50 years only five will survive due to the dominance of languages like English and Spanish.” Insisting that not just Urdu but every language has its own adage and ‘tehzeeb’, experts said along with Urdu, one must also learn to understand Parsi, English, Hindi, Sanskrit, Persian and other languages and their cultural heritage. Earlier, a session titled, ‘Saeeda Ke Ghar’ and ‘Anya Kritya’ was held in which a talk with Lucknow University professor Ranu Uniyal on poetry collection ‘Saeeda ka Ghar’ was held. Prof Uniyal shared that men and women have been writing for centuries but when it comes to women writers they have always been sidelined. “Women always write in a different consciousness of their own but still they are sidelined,” said Uniyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/urdu-transcends-all-boundaries-not-associated-to-any-religion/articleshow/88349029.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Multiple hospitals said they are closely monitoring the situation in the state and elsewhere. They said whether or not to allow foreigners into the state for treatment is a policy decision that has to be taken by the government and at this stage they cannot refuse treatment after a patient reaches a hospital. “All foreign patients are thoroughly screened for RT-PCR negative results and elective surgeries are being performed,” said Radhey Mohan P, vice president, International Business Development, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills. He said that the patient arrivals have decreased due to the pandemic. In the last seven days, Apollo hospitals have seen 73 fresh registrations from patients from countries such as Tanzania, Yemen, Somalia, Oman, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Fiji. Mohan said the hospital is following international travel guidelines and alerts by the Centre. “All our foreign patients are being updated from time to time before they travel to India. Special focus will be on countries that are listed as ‘high risk’ by the government,” he added. Dr Sambit Sahu, medical director and head of MICU, KIMS hospitals, Secunderabad, said, “With Omicron cases now in Hyderabad, we have put Covid-19 protocols in place for all foreign patients irrespective of outpatient or in-patient cases.” He added that the number of foreign patients had just started picking up.

It may be noted that so far, 101 Omicron positive Covid-19 cases have been reported in India across Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Karnataka,Telangana, Gujarat, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Confirming the development, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare Amit Mohan Prasad said that all essential steps are being taken to contain the spread of coronavirus and screen the variant. Health officials stated that the two persons, who tested positive to the new variant of novel coronavirus, were confirmed by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. They had travel history to Maharashtra where 32 cases of Omicron have been reported. “The patients have been taken under medical care while contact tracing has been completed. The samples of the suspected contacts have been sent for testing,” health officials said. Officials at the state surveillance unit for Covid-19 claimed that UP has sent three batches of samples for genome sequencing. In the first batch, 22 samples were sent of which 21 tested positive to delta variant while one was wasted. In the second batch, 24 samples had been sent. In two of these, omicron was isolated. Outcome of the third batch comprising 33 samples is awaited.

This contradicts the claims of Telangana chief electoral officer on recovery of money during the bypolls and the estimated amount spent by various political parties to woo the voters, the FGG said.  Out of the five cases filed, only two were election-related. FGG secretary M Padmanabha Reddy said: “During the Huzurabad by-elections, large-scale money was distributed to voters. Votes were purchased at the rate of Rs 6,000 per vote. Persons who did not get the money or got less amounts resorted to dharnas and rasta rokos, which is a sad reflection of how the elections are conducted. Contesting elections in Telangana is becoming a costly affair. A trend has set in that votes are for sale. Without exception, voters are expecting money from all the contesting candidates.” An analysis made by FGG from data obtained from the police authorities concerned with regard to cases booked for distribution of money to the voters had revealed that Rs 3.8 crore was seized in 94 incidents. However, FIR was issued only in five cases. Out of them, two were booked under the Gaming Act and the rest three cases under IPC section 171E (bribing the voters). “Money was distributed and votes were purchased by all political parties. At least Rs 300 crore was distributed for purchase of votes by the parties,” the FGG said. Cases booked for bribing the voters were merely three and the amount involved was only Rs 18 lakh. Further, no case for distribution of money was registered against the contesting candidates. Statement of CEO of Telangana that an amount of Rs 3.5 crore was seized during the by-elections was far from the truth, it said. Urging Election Commission of India to issue guidelines in the cases of money seized during elections, FGG demanded that seized money should be deposited in court and FIR issued. “At present, there is no uniform procedure in dealing with the cases of money distribution to the voters in the elections,” said Padmanabha Reddy. Out of the 94 cases which were reported during the bypolls, an FIR was lodged only in five cases. In the rest 89, no case was registered and money was released to the person from whom it was seized||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/only-rs-18l-seized-in-bypollfor-huzurabad-reveals-rti/articleshow/88348253.cms||---

Digambar’s sister, Pooja (22), who was in love with childhood friend Govind Karale, was married to Jethiba Varshewar in June 2017 against her wishes and she had later eloped with Govind. On July 23, 2017, Digambar, accompanied by Mohan, attacked Pooja and Govind and slit their throats with a sharp weapon at Bhokar in Nanded. The Nanded rural police had arrested the two, who were tried for murder and other charges. “We are not inclined to convert death punishment of appellant accused Digambar into life imprisonment,” the HC bench of Justice VK Jadhav and Justice Shrikant Kulkarni said in a judgment on December 13. “The appellant accused could have cut-off social relations with Pooja and Govind. But they have committed cold blooded murder of Pooja and Govind in a pre-planned manner. The appellant accused Digambar had cruelly executed his plan of murder.”  “It is time to stamp out barbaric and feudal practice of honour killing, which are a slur on our nation” the bench said. “This is necessary as a deterrent for such outrageous, uncivilized behaviour,” the bench added. It relied on a Supreme Court ruling while observing, “Honour killings, for whatever reasons, come within the category of rarest of rare cases, and as such deserving death punishment.” Additional public prosecutor Rajendra Dasalkar told TOI, after the murder, Digambar had himself approached the police and confessed to have killed the two victims but he remained silent on Mohan’s role, which came to the fore during the police investigation. Apart from the death penalty and the life sentence, the sessions court had sentenced the duo to seven years in jail for destruction of evidence and life imprisonment for conspiracy charge. The HC expressed shock over the manner in which the two victims were done to death. “It was done not only with the sole intention to protect the honour of the family but also it was done by hatching conspiracy to punish both of them,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-confirms-death-to-honour-killing-convict/articleshow/88346707.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Both DU councils okay common entrance for undergrad courses||New Delhi: Delhi University’s Executive Council on Friday gave its nod to a common entrance test for various undergraduate courses from the next academic session. According to DU officials, a 100% weightage will be given to the entrance examination and the board exam results will be treated only as the qualifying criterion. A decision on setting up Institute of Nanomedical Sciences was, however, deferred and a committee was constituted to look into the issues afresh. DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh told TOI, “The entrance test will have full weightage. The board examination results will only be treated like qualifying marks and a basic requirement of 50% or 60% marks will be set.” The move comes a week after the university’s Academic Council approved the entrance examination following the recommendations of a committee set up by DU to assess the admission pattern. The sky-high cutoff marks at DU colleges for the merit-based undergraduate programmes had led to the constitution of the committee. In its interim report, the committee had noted that as admissions were based on cutoff marks, it was difficult to control over-admissions as all applicants who are eligible within a cutoff could seek admissions. The board-wise distribution of admissions across UG courses were also assessed. “Merit and only merit of a prospective applicant is the sole criteria in his or her category of admission,” it stated. The Executive Council passed the proposal with two members, professor Seema Das and advocate Ashok Agarwal, dissenting to it over the 100% weightage criteria. The council also approved a proposal for maternity leave for ad hoc teachers and contractual employees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/both-du-councils-okay-common-entrance-for-undergrad-courses/articleshow/88349052.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Hyderabad||Telangana govt to go for caste-wise census of BC||HYDERABAD: While the central government is in no mood to take up census of the Backward Classes in the country, the state commission for BCs has decided to take up the massive exercise in Telangana. The commission will rope in the services of expert agencies like Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI), Centre of Economic and Social Studies (CESS), Bureau of Economics and Statistics, Centre for Good Governance, among others, to prepare a road map for caste-wise enumeration of BCs. The gigantic exercise would require a huge manpower in the form of enumerators to reach every doorstep in the state. The Maharashtra government too has taken up such exercise which is expected to cost at least Rs 400 crore. Chairman of Telangana State Commission for BCs Vakulabharanam Krishna Mohan Rao confirmed to TOI that they have, in principle, decided to take up enumeration of BCs, including the case-wise data. “We would also send teams to Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other states to study how the respective BC commissions or dedicated commissions as suggested by the Supreme Court have collected the empirical data of BCs before going for the task in Telangana,” he said. Explaining the need for taking up the exercise, he said the Supreme Court had directed the Maharashtra government to notify 27 per cent OBC reserved seats as general category seats for local body elections as the state had failed to submit scientific data of OBCs to the apex court. The apex court has clearly stated that state legislations cannot simply provide uniform and rigid quantum of reservation of seats for OBCs in the local bodies without a proper enquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness by an independent commission. The commission will follow with the triple test that is required to be compiled by the state before reserving seats in the local bodies for OBCs. The commission will consult the experts to prepare questionnaire to start the caste-wise enumeration of BCs once government approves the funding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-govt-to-go-for-caste-wise-census-of-bc/articleshow/88348259.cms||Roushan Ali

The 1973km expressways spread across the state are not only transforming the lives of many but are also leaving a positive impact on businesses. After Purvanchal Expressway, the foundation stone for Ganga Expressway is set to be laid. The economic impact that the Rs 36,230 crore project will have on 12 districts, namely Meerut, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj, will bolster growth in eastern parts of the state. Ganga Expressway, like other expressways, is touted to be the centrepiece of Chief Minister Yogi’s Adityanath’s efforts to spur economic progress in East UP and help the country become a USD 5 trillion economy. Since 2017, when Yogi came to power and authorized the six-lane (can be expanded into eight lane) Ganga Expressway, the state agencies have poured crores of rupees for land, labour, construction material and equipment. Work on the project is on at a great speed despite the roadblocks of Covid-19. At least 98% acquisition has been completed by the administration of districts concerned, against the acquisition of 123 hectares. Payment to all the farmers has also been done. Almost 94% of the land needed for the purpose has already been acquired by the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), the nodal agency for the project, which aims to complete the project by 2025. The expressway covers 140 water bodies and has seven road overbridges, 17 interchange roads, 14 big bridges, 126 minor bridges, 28 flyovers, 50 vehicle underpasses, and 946 culverts. Once functional, it is expected to reduce travel time between Delhi and Prayagraj from the current 10-11 hours to just 6-7 hours. The state government further plans to extend the expressway at both ends – by 110 km from Meerut to Tigri on the Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand border and by 314 km from Prayagraj to Ballia, in the second phase of the project. Real estate prices along the roads have risen by as much as 30 times, putting adjoining land among the nation's most expensive property. Around expressway interchanges and exits, new hotels, restaurants, gas stations and industries are expected to spring up. Many isolated communities —placed within commuting time of cities by the new roads—will come alive and prosper. To take advantage of the expanded labour force and markets made accessible by expressways, the industry will set up new plants on land surrounding the interchanges. The Ganga Expressway will act as an industrial corridor and connect far-flung production units and agricultural production centres to the state and national capital. By reducing the travel time from Meerut to Prayagraj, it would provide a huge impetus to perishable agri product industry. It would also act as a catalyst for establishment of new industrial units, food processing units, dairy industry as well as small and medium units in the region. Tourism will also flourish once the expressway is functional. As roads continued to expand, there was an urgent need for a strategy for effective conservation of the area around the expressways, especially considering the fact that the project was delayed since 2007 for the want of environmental clearances. To ensure ecological balance, ROW land will be powered by solar power. Moreover, 18,55,000 trees will be planted alongside the expressway. For Uttar Pradesh’s economy, the road ahead definitely looks bright. The link between infrastructure investment and prosperity for citizens is clear. The Yogi government is to be commended for recognising the importance of infrastructure to economic growth and job creation.

He warned that if people do not pay power bills, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited will not be able to sustain and eventually private companies will enter and take over the distribution process. Raut was in Aurangabad to attend a series of meetings. The issue of ensuring power supply during daytime was taken up with the minister, who assured of taking appropriate steps. Later, he said, “Nobody is going to get power supply free of cost. If people are consuming power supply, they’ll have to pay the bills. MSEDCL does not get power supply free of cost. It pays a log of money for it. Also, the electricity manufacturing companies have spend a lot of money on power generation.” He said that if people do not pay power bills, MSEDCL will shut down, eventually paving way for the entry of private companies. “If people want private companies to take over MSEDCL, then let them do what they want to,” he said. Reacting to the statement, BJP MLA Prashant Bamb said that farmers are not asking for free power supply. “Currently, farmers are going through difficult times and we want the government to take a considerate view.” Later in the day, farmers threw power bills on Raut’s convoy as a mark of protest against the strong recovery drive being carried out by MSEDCL and cutting of power supply to the farms failing to clear the arrears. Nashik Zone MSEDCL officials said that over 7.45 lakh farmers in Nashik and Ahmednagar districts have pending dues to the tune of over Rs 8,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/nobody-including-farmers-will-get-free-electricity-raut/articleshow/88346717.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Speaking during a press conference, health department director G Srinivasa Rao said that current guidelines allow only 2% random testing among passengers from non-risk countries and strict isolation is required. State officials have discussed the issue with the Centre. “Airports are not under our authority. The restrictions are set by the Centre. We are strictly following standard operational standards, and we are following a model to locate persons who are positive. We are largely testing unvaccinated people and those who only received a single dose,” Rao said. State authorities can conduct only random testing of people coming from non-risk countries. He said only two of the nine people who were Omicron positive after airport screening got immunized. Health director announced the cost of Covid-19 tests will be cut at the airport. The official said that within 36 hours genome testing results are obtained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-must-allow-more-testing-of-pax/articleshow/88348265.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Paddy row: TRS to hold protests across T||Hyderabad: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has decided to intensify its fight against the Centre on the paddy procurement issue. As part of it, the ruling party will organise protests against the Centre’s ‘anti-farmer’ policies in every village in all the 119 constituencies on December 20. In another important decision, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the Rythu Bandhu scheme will be extended to farmers even if they continue to cultivate paddy. KCR, who held an emergeny meeting with party MLAs, MPs, MLCs, members of Rythu Bandhu Samithis and DCCB presidents on Friday, is believed to have pulled up the MLAs. Mincing no words, he advised the legislators to go to people immediately and explain to them on various welfare schemes and programmes. “Also, explain to the farmers by holding meetings at Rythu Vedikas as to why we are advising them to go for alternate crops. It is my responsibility to see that you are re-elected to the state assembly. But, if you do not maintain good relations with people, no one can save you,” he warned. Demonstrations and dharnas and burning effigies of the Centre will be part of the protest programme on Monday. He is believed to have pulled up MLAs and MPs for failing to rebut state BJP and Congress leaders on their criticism of the government on the paddy procurement issue. “Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay and Union minister G Kishan Reddy attacked the state government on the paddy issue. They are spreading lies on paddy issue and Dalit Bandhu scheme and created a ruckus at procurement centres. Except some ministers and MLAs, many others have not reacted. This sends a wrong message,” KCR said. Allaying fears of farmers, he said government would continue to provide Rythu Bandhu benefit even if they go for paddy. “CM rejected proposals of senior officials to stop giving Rythu Bandhu benefit for those who continue to grow paddy without paying heed to the requests of the government,” Niranjan Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-row-trs-to-hold-protests-across-t/articleshow/88348264.cms||Koride Mahesh

While one person went to West Bengal after testing positive, in a first, a woman from Hanumakonda also tested positive. “Out of a total of 6,764 samples (Since December 1), taken from Rajiv Gandhi International Airport from at-risk countries, only two cases tested positive. Amid the 2% random sample testing done, seven people were identified with the Omicron variant and all of them are asymptomatic,” said director of health G Srinivasa Rao at a press conference. He stated that seven of the nine cases are from Hyderabad, with only one case from an at-risk country, six cases from non-risk countries. One case is from Hanumakonda which is also from an at-risk country. One boy who tested positive left for West Bengal. Dismissing any surveillance lapse on the part of the state government, he said, “the woman from Hanumakonda did not test positive during airport surveillance, but under isolation at Hanumakonda. She tested positive and genome sequencing proved that she had Omicron variation.” According to the health director, the positive cases, which have been traced, are being monitored by health authorities. Three cases were from Kenya, two from Abu Dhabi, two from Dubai, and one each from Sudan and the UK.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nine-cases-of-omicron-in-state/articleshow/88348271.cms||---

Additional director general, prosecution, Ashutosh Pandey said the award was given for digitisation of entries before court, including postmortem, forensic and DNA reports, which helps secure conviction. “We have trained 900 prosecution officers and the infrastructure and technical boost provided by the government helped us put 56 lakh entries at just one click, giving us the prestigious award,” said Pandey. Pandey said that due to efforts of police and prosecution, life sentence was awarded to criminals like Sanjeev alias Jeeva of Muzaffarnagar, Babloo Srivastava of Lucknow police commissionerate, as well as Sunder Bhati and Singhraj Bhati of Noida police commissonerate. “In its effective perusal of cases of crime against women, prosecution department convicted four to death sentence and 134 to life imprisonment in two months. This was possible because of increase in number of forensic labs and training of prosecution officers,” said the ADG. He said that innovation and improvements in the system are underway on the instructions of UP DGP Mukul Goel. Online submission of chargesheets has already begun, which has reduced delay in courts. Earlier, submission of a hard copy of chargesheets was required. UP DGP Mukul Goel said that “we have embarked on a futuristic strategy to evolve a better synergy between police, prison and prosecution through maximum use of technology to automate the criminal justice system to help the judiciary in expediting the trial leading to better convictions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-police-bags-top-spot-for-highest-entries-under-icjs/articleshow/88349053.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In response to a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal demanding that all coal-based industries should be shifted to natural gas to improve the ambient air quality in Gujarat, the high court asked the state government: “Why should the gazette notification dated 26.10.2017 or any similar notification/order by which it declares coal to be an approved fuel under Section 2(d) of the Air Pollution Act be not struck down?” The GPCB has replied that the notification was issued after consultation with the state government by using powers available under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and therefore the court may not consider removing coal from the list of approved fuel in Gujarat. The high court had also sought details from the government about how many industries function on coal and what is the consumption of coal in Gujarat. GPCB has informed the high court that total 4,308 industrial units across the state function by using coal as fuel. All industries employing steam for their production use coal. Major industries that run on coal are power generating units, pharmaceuticals, steel, chemical industries, textile etc. On consumption of coal, GPCB stated that average coal usage in Gujarat every day is 4,58,435.12 metric tonnes. The district of Kutch tops in coal consumption with 1,70,232 MT. Industrial units in Ahmedabad district consume 57,379 MT coal with city units using 5,761 MT daily. Gandhinagar consumes 12,453 MT, Surat uses 35,052 MT coal.  GPCB further submitted that Gujarat has installed capacity to generate 26,428 MW per hour as against total capacity of 3.82 lakh MW generation in India. Against 53% coal use in power generation in India, Gujarat’s usage of coal is 51.9%. The court was also informed that 70% plus energy catered in Gujarat is from coal based units and only 9% is from gas based power stations. The court has posted hearing on this issue on January 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dont-nix-approval-for-coal-as-fuel-pleads-gpcb/articleshow/88348282.cms||---

A road section of about 1.5km will be under watch through the day till late in the evening. Squads have been formed to restrict illegal waste dumping. Heaps of garbage along the road have been cleaned in the last few days, and the authorities said they intend to put up boards to alert citizens not to throw garbage in the open space. The drive will be extended at the ghat section in the future, the authorities said. Daily commuters and local residents had raised concerns over dumped garbage that led to mosquito menace in the area. Viraj Kanchi, a regular traveller to Bopdev Ghat, said the entire stretch had turned into an illegal dumping space and waste throwing had increased. An official with the Kondhwa-Yevlewadi ward office said, “We conducted a major cleaning drive in the last few days to lift and clear the waste from the area. We also got support from local organisations and institutes. Most garbage dumped on the roadside has been cleared. This drive shall continue. So far, we have imposed a fine of Rs9,000 against garbage throwing.” Another official said it has been observed that besides individuals, vegetable vendors and those running eateries and food stalls are also dumping the waste in the open space during the night. “Our teams have imposed fines and have warned the offenders. We are planning to hold awareness drives among the vendors and eateries to collect the garbage and hand it over to waste collectors,” he said. The civic administration has taken similar steps in Katraj Ghat areas in the last three months where the squads are conducting inspections till late in the night. Ongoing initiatives are part of the administration’s efforts to restrict throwing of garbage on the roadside and in the open spaces in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/vigil-at-bopdev-ghat-rd-to-stop-open-dumping/articleshow/88348268.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Tracing tough as passengers give false info||Hyderabad: Officials heaved a sigh of relief on Friday after locating an Omicron positive person from an African country at a private guest house in Banjara Hills. Officials filed a complaint with the Banjara Hills police station after he provided incorrect phone number and address after submitting his sample for testing and disappeared. Officials are now scouting for his contacts and asked the guest house staff to isolate themselves. Since Omicron cases have been discovered from both non-risk and risk countries, officials have been concerned that some people are disappearing (particularly from non-risk countries). According to sources, a man, who tested positive for Omicron on Thursday, astonished officials when he told them that he knew he was positive before boarding the plane and that they just found out later. “However, he contacted a local corporate hospital and isolated himself, taking doctor’s recommendations online,” the source said. Another woman, who tested Omicron positive claimed she hasn’t met anyone. With the exception of the person discovered by police on Friday, officials have identified 21 first contacts in the seven Omicron cases. The results of these, as well as the more than 500 samples collected from the Paramount colony, are still expected. Officials are concerned because the first case from Somalia necessitated that at least a dozen personnel — including doctors from private hospitals — go in for home isolation when it was revealed that he had visited a few facilities. Some immigration workers at the airport were also advised to go in for home isolation. “There could be at least 200 secondary contacts for him, tracing of which will be tough,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tracing-tough-as-passengers-give-false-info/articleshow/88348276.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

According to him, to effectively battle the ongoing semi-conductor shortage, ramping up manufacturing within India is required. Munjal was in Ahmedabad on Friday to deliver a talk on ‘Impact leadership: An India Story’ organised by Ashank Desai Centre for Leadership and Organisational Development (ADCLOD) and hosted by Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A). “Electronics account for second highest imports in India and over the next three years, these will become the highest imported commodities in the country. Home-grown manufacturing of electronic hardware is extremely important and for this, government support is required. A push from the government can go a long way in setting up a manufacturing cluster for electronic hardware,” he told media persons during an interaction ahead of the discussion. At present, shortage of semi-conductors is causing major supply chain bottlenecks in automobile and other industries. “Manufacturers are left with no choice but to reconfigure their equipment minimizing the use of electronic hardware,” he further added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/munjal-need-govt-support/articleshow/88348297.cms||---

Local farmers, while harvesting their sugar cane crops, had spotted the cub. Accustomed to finding lost leopard cubs during sugar cane harvesting season and aware of the need to take quick action, the villagers immediately contacted the forest department, who got in touch with the Wildlife SOS team operating out of the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Center and reunited the cub within a few hours. The Wildlife SOS vet, Dr. Nikhil Bangar, conducted an on-site medical examination to ensure the cub was fit and also to ascertain its age and gender. The female cub, approximately three months old, was physically fit, the doctor found. The team then placed the cub in a basket so that it doesn’t stray again and waited for the mother to find her. “Camera traps were installed in the location that confirmed the mother found the cub within an hour.

Apart from the plant, both the companies also agreed to cooperate in other areas of mutual interest. The MoU was signed in the presence of chief minister Bhupendra Patel. The cost of the project is estimated to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore and it is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately Rs 1,500 crores. The project will also generate direct and indirect employment for around 700 individuals, the state government said on Friday. The proposed plant will use corn/broken rice as feedstock with eco-friendly technology and it will produce 500 KLD bioethanol, which will be utilised for blending in petrol. As by-products from this plant, 135 KTPA protein-rich animal feed and 16.50 KTPA of corn oil while using corn as feedstock are also expected to be produced. With Dahod, Panchmahal, Aravalli and Mahisagar being the major corn-producing districts in Gujarat, the bioethanol plant is likely to come up in one of these districts. A detailed feasibility study through a third party is in progress for the project. Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a roadmap for 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025 to reduce import of crude oil and save valuable foreign exchange, the state government also added that an estimated savings of $70 million per year in foreign exchange outgo is expected through this project. According to GACL, the long term supply contract for corn will encourage corn farming with sustainable, multi-fold income for farmers through increased productivity and assured market. Steps will also be taken to improve the productivity of corn in the state with the help of the maize research centre in Godhra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gacl-gail-team-up-to-establish-bioethanol-plant-in-gujarat/articleshow/88348307.cms||---

A quick scan on social media reveals a barrage of complaints from flyers who rue how they are not only forced to wait long hours for a cab regularly but are also left to battle last-minute cancellations and exorbitant fares. For instance, a 40-km cab ride from Sainikpuri to RGIA that earlier cost a passenger between Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,300 is now revised upwards to Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,000. And this, even during non-rush hours. While there are a few alternatives – including the RTC-run bus service, Pushpak – passengers say they are either infrequent or very time-consuming, thus forcing them to rely heavily to cab aggregators, Ola and Uber. “Due to uncertainty in availability of @Olacabs and @Uber_India cabs to and from #HYDAirport, passengers are requested to avail other authorised cab services or Pushpak Bus,” the RGIA management recently tweeted, opening the floodgates for sharp reactions from passengers. Many demanded that the Ola and Uber kiosks be removed from the airport for good and more economical public transport facilities be put in place connecting the city with the airport. “The licenses of @Olacabs and @Uber ought to be revoked. When @RGIAHyd was set up, it was to support the city planning and commutation a part of it. It's being compromised and there's predatory pricing. Shame!” wrote one of them even as another asked: “What are the other authorised cabs? Do you have any reputed cab service providers that you can mention or are you referring to the touts roaming around all over arrivals? Why don’t you remove the Ola & Uber kiosks from the parking lot”. While Ola and Uber officials refused to comment, some passengers said that the drivers attribute the high rates for airport drops to poor footfall at the international facility. “I had this problem where the Uber cab driver called me and asked for amount (twice the bill) for airport drop stating lack of passengers at airport,” tweeted a flyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/steep-cab-fares-cancellations-nightmare-for-passengers-at-rgia/articleshow/88348309.cms||---

Results announced by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) showed that 49% cleared the exam while 51% could not. The psychologists appointed by the TSBIE admitted that of the majority of calls that they have received from students, many are worried about preparing for two exams of different years at the same time. “Many students are stressed over how the exams will be held and when they will be held. They are worried that their performance would be affected if they have to appear for the backlog papers and the second year papers simultaneously,” said Dr Mazher Ali, one of the six psychologists appointed by the TSBIE. Students admit that appearing for the backlog exams along with the second-year exams would be mentally tasking. “I failed in four subjects as I was unable to cope up with the online classes. Now, I will have to appear for these four subjects in addition to the second-year subjects which will be an uphill task for me,” said a first-year student. Several students took to social media blaming the state government for its ‘inappropriate’ decision to conduct exams during the pandemic. “This is to inform you honourable @KTRTRS @TRSTechCell @SabithaindraTRS We, the students of Telangana intermediate have got our results. 51% of us have failed, I am one of them. If anything happens to us then it’s your responsibility for our lives!,” tweeted Naidu, a student. Members of Students Federation of India and National Students Union of India also held a massive protest in front of the TSBIE office in Nampally on Friday. TSBIE officials argue that they had to conduct the exam considering the same set of students were promoted unconditionally last year without SSC exams. Following hue and cry by students, the Telangana education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy ordered to reduce the re-verification fee by 50%. “Students should not be disheartened by the results as they can repeat the exams in April, 2022 for any subject," said Jaleel. “If we had not conducted the first year exams, learning of these students would not have been assessed for two years. These were extra-ordinary circumstances but promoting them without exams would have been unfair,” said Omar Jaleel, secretary, TSBIE, adding that even before the pandemic, the pass percentage of first year students was 50-60%. He added that since the regular first year exams were held in October, 2021 instead of March, the board does not have the margin time to conduct separate supplementary exams||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inter-backlog-students-worry-over-2nd-yr-exams/articleshow/88348311.cms||Preeti Biswas

It has been about two months and Patel is still waiting for a call from the dealer. “It is likely that I will get the car only after Uttarayan. Because of the semiconductor shortage, the dealer does not have enough inventory,” he said. There are many like Patel who continue to wait for the cars they had booked. Even though the consumer sentiment has remained upbeat since the onset of 2021, supply-chain woes triggered by the global semiconductor shortage has curtailed vehicle sales in Gujarat. Car sales grew by 15% from January 1 to December 13 this year against the same period last year, suggests the data of the Union ministry of road transport. “There has been a considerable increase of four-wheelers in rural areas and smaller towns,” said a senior official of the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Gandhinagar. “The overall car sales are up, thanks to good income from agriculture.” The sales of cars in 2021 was 3.13 lakh which was higher than in the pre-pandemic year 2019. Car sales were at 3.03 lakh units in 2020, and 2.70 lakh in 2019. The registration of vehicles in 2021 was 11.93 lakh, against 11.23 lakh in 2020. Officials said that with another fortnight to go, they expect registrations to cross 12 lakh this year. A senior RTO official said: “We expect 30,000 more car registrations this year. But deliveries are slow. In January and Feburary, car sales were over 30,0000 and they increased to 41,000 in June. After that, registrations never touched 30,000 and have remained between 25,000 and 28,000.” Car dealers say that they could not cash in on demand due to supply-side constraints. The problem made car sales for November decline 29% year-on-year, from 31,747 to about 22,518 this year, according to data provided by the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA). Overall festive season sales remained weak due to supply-chain difficulties. Pranav Shah, chairman of FADA for the Gujarat region, said: “Car sales continue to see the effect of the semiconductor shortage. New launches are keeping customer interest high, but the lack of supply is preventing this finishing in sales.” Shah added: “The extended waiting period is starting to make customers jittery and may lead to loss of interest in vehicle buying.” Dinesh Shah, an Ahmedabad-based businessman, said: “I had booked a mid-sized segment car for my son in September and was told that the vehicle would be delivered by Diwali. I am yet to get the car. I am now told that it will be delivered by the first week of January.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/semiconductors-pothole-for-car-sales/articleshow/88348322.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

This key communication was corroborated to police by SEBI which even made a vain follow-up with Parthasarathy and others in KSBL to revoke the client securities. In response to a clarification sought by SEBI in early 2019 on the need to revoke the pledged securities of the clients, Parthasarathy in his email expressed regret by calling it an ‘irregularity’ and tendered his apology. Besides, he gave a commitment to SEBI to comply with its June 20, 2019 order and sought time till September 30, 2019, to revoke the pledged clients’ shares. But, KSBL allegedly could not comply and SEBI gave further reminders before barring KSBL to do trading in November. “In that email from Parthasarathy, there is a clear mention of pledging clients’ securities and he apologised to SEBI. While taking the loan from the banks, KSBL represented by Parthasarathy claimed that those securities, being pledged to the bank for taking loans, belong to the company,” sources in Hyderabad police told TOI while confirming about the email. In the chargesheet filed by Hyderabad central crime station a few days ago in Nampally criminal court in connection with KSBL’s allege default of Rs 137 crore to IndusInd Bank a few days ago, the email reference was mentioned. Using this loan, KSBL representatives allegedly transferred the money to 22 primary subsidiary companies. From these subsidiary companies, the money was again shifted to another 140 subsidiary companies whose investigation is still being done. From most of these subsidiary companies, stock trading was done. “To transfer money from a parent firm to its subsidiary firms, there has to be board resolutions. In this case, there were insufficient documents to back this claim. In a few cases, there were KSBL resolutions to divert the money to a subsidiary firm like Karvy Realty & Services Limited. But at least in one case, there was more fund diversion than what was resolved in the board meet,” sources told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karvy-cmd-apology-mail-helps-cops-nail-loan-fraud/articleshow/88348313.cms||Srinath Vudali
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra has given one vaccination shot to 85% of those above 45 years||MUMBAI: More than 85% people above 45 years have received at least one shot of vaccine against Covid-19 in Maharashtra. Almost 39% of the state’s eligible population for vaccination (9.1 crore) comes from this age category. According to recent data shared by the state health department, almost 2.9 crore people out of 3.5 crore in this age group have taken at least one shot of the vaccine. Across age groups, more than 84% people have taken at least one shot in the state. Vaccination in the age group above 45 years has made a dent in Covid hospitalisations and deaths and could continue to do so even in the face of a new variant, said experts. “More than 80% of Covid-19 deaths have been seen in people above 45 years. With comorbidities, they have been the most vulnerable,” said Dr Avinash Supe, who heads the city’s Covid death audit committee. But as vaccinations started for the general population in March and April, a gradual decline in deaths was noted, said Supe. Analysis of recent fatalities has shown that deaths are common in people who are unvaccinated or those who didn’t develop a good response to vaccination, an intensivist from BYL Nair Hospital said. “We are recording deaths once every two to three days and they are seldom among healthy vaccinated individuals,” said the doctor. “Omicron may have immune escape properties, but vaccines are still expected to prevent hospitalisation and death,” he said. The outcome of a third wave, if it comes, could depend a lot on the vaccine coverage of vulnerable populations. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said out of 40 Omicron cases, almost all adults are fully vaccinated barring two. “One of the reasons why we haven’t seen severity could be because they are all vaccinated,” he said, adding that some have even taken the booster shot. Moreover, the Omicron cohort includes people between 40-60 years. In Mumbai, civic authorities said nearly 20 lakh people between 45 and 59 years and 11 lakh beyond 60 years have taken a single shot. Over 100% single dose coverage has been achieved in these age groups, a civic official said. A total of 12.7 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the state, of which 7.9 crore are first doses and 4.8 crore are second doses. From the 18-44 age group, nearly 77% have taken one shot. The state has fully immunised around 52% of its adult population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-has-given-1-vax-shot-to-85-of-those-above-45-years/articleshow/88348337.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The Gujarat government representatives spoke about the Prime Minister’s GatiShatki Master Plan, Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, transparent and predictable tax system, reducing compliance burden, Ease of Doing Business and Ease of Living and Make in India to attract investments to the state. Desai said that the summit, scheduled to be held from January 10 to January 12, would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar and would be attended by Union ministers, global and Indian business heads and thought leaders. “In 2020, the PM gave the clarion call for ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ to leverage India’s strengths, skills and capabilities to become self-reliant. The theme of the 10th Vibrant Gujarat summit is ‘From Atmanirbhar Gujarat to Atmanirbhar Bharat’. Gujarat’s focus on building a robust industrial infrastructure has helped the state stay on the top in the Logistics Ease Across Different States rankings for three years,” he said. Talking about Gujarat being a policy-driven state, the minister said that policies like the Industrial Policy 2020, Integrated Logistics and Logistics Park Policy, Electric Vehicle Policy, Solar Energy Policy and Tourism and Textiles policy 2021 had provided significant incentives to industries to enter these sectors. Commending UP on its diverse industrial landscape, Desai extended an invitation to industrialists in the state to invest in Gujarat and expand their businesses. “UP is one of the largest producers of foodgrains and other crops and home to a number of agro-processing and agri-business based industries. Gujarat is also reviving its Agro Business Policy to encourage and support industrialists in the sector. The policy provides benefits and incentives to both existing and new entrepreneurs in this field in terms of loan assistance, project cost subsidy and interest subsidy. The policy also supports MSME units through freight subsidy, in both air and sea transportation,” he said. Desai described Gujarat’s efforts to become a global hub in the renewable energy sector and work being done in sectors like next-generation infrastructure, energy and digital networks, emerging technologies, financial technologies, startups, electric vehicles and financial services. “To enhance ease of doing business, the Gujarat government has created portals for land bank and investor facilitation. Mega industrial infrastructure projects of Dholera SIR and GIFT City will drive the next wave of growth in Gujarat,” the minister added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/vibrant-gujarat-invites-industrialists-from-up/articleshow/88349076.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man held for availing of bank loans using forged papers||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has arrested an alleged conman who along with his associates duped banks and other financial institutions by availing of loans using forged papers and already mortgaged properties. The accused has been identified as Maheshwar Sharma, a resident of Kotla Mubarakpur area. Cops are looking for his associates. According to police, the accused availed loans to the tune of several crores from Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and Deewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited, etc, using a similar modus operandi. Cops had started an investigation after receiving a complaint from DHFL about a resident of Shakti Nagar and his son having taken two loans of Rs 2.27 crore in February 2015 against a property in Punjabi Bagh. After receiving the loan amount, the accused persons paid only a few EMIs and then defaulted on the payment. When DHFL conducted an inquiry, they found another person living at the mortgaged property. It came to fore that Sharma had allegedly prepared the papers and chain of ownership and sold the property to Ravinder, his aide who then took the loan. An FIR was registered in May 2019. During investigation, documents were obtained from the authorities concerned and it was found that alleged persons had submitted a forged parallel chain for securing the loan from DHFL. Replies received from civic agencies revealed that the occupant of the house was the real owner. Ravinder and his son Saurav were earlier arrested but Sharma was absconding. Recently, cops received a tip-off on Sharma and arrested him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-availing-of-bank-loans-using-forged-papers/articleshow/88349078.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Flooding: Draft master plan moots sponge city concept||Thiruvananthapuram: The draft master plan 2040 for Trivandrum prepared by the department of town and country planning has proposed adoption of the sponge city concept in the city as part of addressing urban flooding. The proposal has been mooted under the section devoted to disaster management in the city. Sponge city concept, which uses natural ways to soak up storm water and slow down water flow, was successfully used by China in urban flood risk management. The draft plan moots retention lake, retention tank, eco-river channel, rain garden, porous pavements and green roof as major components of the sponge city. Bio-swales which are channels meant to manage stormwater runoff while filtering debris have also been proposed in the draft master plan which is set to be presented in the council soon. The city which witnesses flooding in major areas during showers is expected to gain from the implementation of the sponge city concept. The town planning wing had prepared a flood report in 2018. Spatial assessment was done to analyse, how far the factors such as proximity to water body, existing drainage pattern and topography influenced the impact of flood throughout the district. Also the sink area percentage and the land use distribution were taken into account to arrive at inferences on the reason and intensity of the flood. In the flood report, sink areas which are topographically low lying areas were derived from digital elevation model (DEM) data available for the district. The flooded area in the sink area emphasised the need for building regulation near and for conservation of such areas, the report noted. Distribution of sink areas to the total land area in each flooded local body was also taken as part of the report. In the city corporation 24% sink area of the total land area recorded flooding. Further the study showed that a considerable percentage of built up area was flooded during 2018 and this pointed out the need to implement regulations for building constructions in riverside areas. The land use distribution of flooded areas within the city in 2018 shows that 50.82 % built up area and 17.9% agricultural land were flooded. Flooded areas when compared with SMP of the city showed that the majority of the flooded areas fell within the green strip area, proposed for conservation, mostly along the water bodies like Karamana, Killi rivers and Pattom, Ulloor and Amayizhanjan Thodu. According to an article published in MDPI journal, the general objectives of the concept entail “restoring” the city’s capacity to absorb, infiltrate, store, purify, drain, and manage rainwater and “regulating” the water cycle as much as possible to mimic the natural hydrological cycle. A `sponge city` is a city that has the capacity to mainstream urban flood risk management into its urban planning policies and designs. A sponge city will not only be able to deal with `too much water`, but also reuse rain water to help to mitigate the impacts of “droughts”. Some of the anticipated benefits of a sponge city as mentioned in the article include reduction of the economic losses (due to flooding) and an enhancement of the liveability of cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/flooding-draft-master-plan-moots-sponge-city-concept/articleshow/88326597.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Lucknow||Amit Shah makes Hindutva pitch, lauds Yogi for weeding out corruption from every sphere||LUCKNOW: Union home minister Amit Shah made a shrill Hindutva pitch here on Friday, picking up from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Aurangzeb’ jibe at Kashi four days ago, saying millions of souls tormented by the Mughal tyrant finally found peace when the PM performed ‘jalabhishek’ of the jyotirlinga in Kashi Vishwanath Dham after inaugurating its first phase. “Be it Ramjanmabhoomi or Vindhyavasini premises or Kashi Vishwanath corridor, no one cared about Hindu religious centres because everyone pursued vote-bank politics,” he said after inaugurating 26 godowns of UP state warehousing corporation, 13 branches of UP Cooperative Bank and its training centre in Lucknow. The godowns with a storage capacity of 1.30 lakh metric tonnes have been constructed in 19 districts at an estimated cost of Rs 141 crore. Shah said, Hindu pilgrimage centres are being rejuvenated for the first time after Narendra Modi became PM. “Uski divyata...uski bhavyata punarsthapit hote hue dekte hain...,” he said, stressing scores of people laid down their lives safeguarding these religious centres. “There were many people who wanted to have a ‘darshan’, but could not because of the crumbling condition of temples and religious places,” he said. His assertion marked BJP’s fresh attempt to put the Hindutva narrative on the forefront even as it gears up to take on an aggressive opposition in the run-up to UP polls due in next couple of months. “Modiji has laid the foundation of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Soon, there will be a sky-kissing temple at the place,” he said. Terming it as a “new chapter” in history of independent India, Shah reiterated BJP did not believe in “politics of appeasement” and stood for “development of all”. Shah, at the same time, did not miss the chance to laud CM Yogi Adityanath as a leader who weeded out corruption from every sphere of public space. Launching a searing attack on the previous state governments, Shah said, corruption prevailed from the grassroots to those sitting in CM office. He said, even the cooperative department had fallen prey to corruption and favouritism towards a particular caste in previous SP and BSP governments. “In last five years, the cooperative sector changed dramatically because of transparency,” he said, extolling the Yogi government to utilise the sector to double farmers’ income “as envisioned by PM Modi”.  “Behenji (Mayawati) aur Babua (Akhilesh Yadav) ke raj mein jo bhrastachar ka adda bana hua tha, aaj woh seva ka madhyam ban kar UP in 22 crore logn ki sewa kar raha hai (Cooperatives were corruption dens during Mayawati and Akhilesh’s regime. And this sector has been transformed by BJP to serve UP’s 22crore population,” Shah said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shah-makes-hindutva-pitch-lauds-yogi-for-weeding-out-corruption-from-every-sphere/articleshow/88349079.cms||Pankaj Shah

After launching and supporting eight startups in the first edition of the ‘T-Block Accelerator’, the Telangana Blockchain District and crypto unicorn CoinSwitch Kuber on Friday launched the second cohort of this programme-- the India Blockchain Accelerator – which is being supported by multiple partners. This four-month programme, that is open to early-stage Web 2 and Web 3 startups, will allow blockchain entrepreneurs to secure government support, incubation space, grant and mentorship. These startups will be working on blockchain solutions solving real-world problems across areas such as fintech, entertainment, agritech, logistics and healthcare, among others. The startups also stand a chance to raise an investment of over $700,000 from investment partners Lightspeed and Woodstock Fund. Commenting on the development, Telangana IT and industries principal secretary, Jayesh Ranjan, said, “Telangana is committed to its vision to lead the blockchain innovation in India …Through the programme, we hope to provide opportunities to the participating startups to pilot their solution in Telangana so that they can enhance their solution and further contribute to the accelerating Indian technology sector.” Ashish Singhal , founder and CEO, CoinSwitch Kuber pointed out that the best global startups of tomorrow would run on web3 blockchain infrastructure, and some of these startups will come from India. In fact, in 2019, The Telangana government set up a platform, ‘Telangana Blockchain District’ that helped stakeholders to collaborate and build solutions in blockchain technology. Along with the state government, IIITH, C-DAC and Tech Mahindra were its founding members. They worked on protocol development, incubation, acceleration, skill development and in identifying various use cases and building proof-of-concepts in various areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-calls-entrepreneurs-to-pilot-blockchain-solutions-in-state/articleshow/88348334.cms||---

Suraj Hari Gurav, who has physical disabilities, said he has to travel 40km to reach his college. “As the MSRTC buses are not plying, I am facing financial, educational losses. The state government should find some solution soon.” Sanjay Patil, a parent, said that the travel by private vehicles are expensive and risky too. “Few students are covering 15 to 20km either by walking or on a bicycle. The buses should be started immediately,” he said. In the meantime, there is no end in sight to the strike yet. Uttam Patil, head of MSRTC workers union in Kolhapur, said, “Around 12,000 staff has ben suspended, while 2,000 contract employees have been terminated. Instead of finding solution, the government is trying to humiliate the staff,” he said. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was critical of the striking MSRTC workers stating that they were stretching things ‘too far.’ “The employees have been given better salaries and they should not hold common people to ransom,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/students-want-msrtc-bus-services-to-resume/articleshow/88346765.cms||---

The basic plan is to visit villages at least once a month on the first Saturday. The ministers, MLAs and MPs will be asked to resolve the grievances of the people and rope in local youths into the party by telling them the ideology and policies that the party stands for. Currently, NCP has 54 MLAs, which is 14 MLAs more than the 2014 election. The increase in the number of seats won by NCP has been largely credited to the campaign spearheaded by party chief Sharad Pawar who has energised the party cadres. The party now sees prospect of gaining grounds in the rural parts of the state. The ministers would also be asked to get the smaller communities on board, which may add a few more MLAs in its kitty. Jayant Patil, the state NCP president during his visit to Sangli, said, “We aim to solve the problems of people and tell them our stance on the development agenda. Based on the development agenda, I am hopeful that the party will be number one in the 2024 state assembly elections. Our focus is to produce ideologically strong leadership at local levels.” Patil proposed the outreach plan to Pawar and got a green signal to go ahead. Patil said that in a couple of days, the agenda and the guidelines for the outreach plan would be made available to the ministers and leaders. NCP has thus become the first party in the state to launch such an outreach plan well ahead of the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ncp-chalks-out-outreach-plan-for-2024-polls/articleshow/88346774.cms||---

A division bench of Justice A Rajasheker Reddy and Justice G Sridevi pronounced this order after hearing a habeas corpus petition filed by the NRI father who charged the mother with bringing back the child from their Illinois residence in an unauthorised manner. The court gave two months to the mother, also a doctor, to comply with the order. HC bench in its judgment said: “The child was born in the US and is a citizen of that country. The husband is a doctor practising in the US and he is ready and willing to take the best care of the child. As per the principles pertaining to child welfare and comity of courts, the child needs to be repatriated to the US. Who should possess the child is an issue to be decided by the US court.” Last year, a US court had heard the pleas of the couple and granted shared parenting. The couple practised in Illinois and their son became a US citizen as he was born there on December 15, 2019. “The action of the wife, in returning to India along with her son, is unlawful and was depriving the father of his parenting share. The child too was more accustomed to the US environment,” said Prabhjit Jauhar, the father’s counsel. Jauhar brought to the notice of the HC that four orders were given by the US court between August 2020 and June 2021 asking the mother to bring back the child to the US jurisdiction. “If the mother cannot come back to the US, then the father would come down to Hyderabad. Let her hand over the child to the father. He will take the child back to the US,” Jauhar said, adding that it was wrong on the part of mother to skip US judicial process despite being a part of it. After returning to Hyderabad, the woman had approached the Hyderabad family court and secured an order restraining her husband from taking away their son. Referring to the argument of the woman that since the marriage was performed in India, the issue should be settled by Indian courts, the HC bench said that she can also raise this argument before the US court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-gets-to-take-2-yr-old-back-to-us-in-custody-battle/articleshow/88348340.cms||---

Sreejith was arrested by Nemom police on charges of stalking and criminal trespass as he sneaked into a 13-year-old girl’s house and hid under her bed to molest her. Nemom inspector Rageesh Kumar said the alleged crime happened on the intervening night between Monday and Tuesday. The accused had proposed his love to the girl, which she had rejected. He continued to stalk her following which her parents reprimanded him several times. During the early hours of Tuesday, the girl’s mother, who slept in the same room, heard unusual sounds and caught him hiding under the bed. The family handed him over to the police.

The exam was for the recruitment of head clerks. Sanghavi said that the remaining culprits will be caught soon. “We are taking historic and exemplary action against the culprits. So in the future, nobody will dare to commit such a crime,” Sanghavi said. Gujarat Police have arrested six persons for their alleged involvement in leaking the question paper. The written exam for the recruitment of 186 head clerks was held at several centres across the state on December 12 by the GSSSB. About 88,000 aspirants took the test. “Of the 10 accused named in the FIR registered at the Prantij police station of Sabarkantha district, six have been arrested,” Sanghavi said. “We had formed 24 teams of investigators after learning about the leak,” Sanghavi said. “As a pre-planned conspiracy, the culprits leaked the paper, solved it, and then gave the answers to some candidates before the exam.” Sanghavi was speaking to reporters in Gandhinagar. Sanghavi said the decision to cancel the exam has not been taken yet by the state government. The six accused arrested by Sabarkantha district police have been identified as Dhruv Barot, Mahesh Patel, Chintan Patel, Kuldip Patel, Darshan Vyas, and Suresh Patel. They are all residents of Sabarkantha district. The accused persons had managed to acquire the question paper before the exam. They had sold it to some candidates for nearly Rs 15 lakh, the FIR said. The FIR added that the accused helped these candidates solve the paper at various locations a day before the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/exemplary-action-for-paper-leak-sanghavi/articleshow/88348341.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court steps in, gives senior living in transit camp for 45 years a SoBo flat||MUMBAI: Suryakant Raut, now 74 years old and a former resident of a Currey Road chawl, will finally move into his redeveloped home with his family after having lived in a transit camp in Vikroli’s Kannamwar Nagar for 45 long years.  Raut, who was 29 years old when he moved out of his home at theHaji Kasam Chawl on September 15, 1976, moved the Bombay high court in the matter in the year 2019. At a previous hearing, the Mharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority or Mhada had asked him for a probate. On Mhada’s asking for a probate from Raut, the high court said on Friday, “This is completely inconceivable. The reason we say this is because possession was admittedly taken from the petitioner’s father and his family in 1976... It is pointless now at the end of 2021 to ask the petitioner to obtain probate or other representation.” The Bombay high court bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar said that all these demands by the authorities count for nothing in view of their February 16, 2021 offer to Raut of an allotment by insisting on further compliance. TimesViewAgain, it is the judiciary which has come to the rescue of citizens waiting for redeveloped homes. In this case, it is not a private developer, but bureaucratic bungling and red tape which forced a family to languish in a transit camp for 45 years. While HC must be applauded for ordering possession of a new flat within 24 hours, the ordeal of living in a cramped transit tenement for over four decades can never be adequately compensated.Advocate Pradeep Havnur, for the petitioner, said that his client can provide an indemnity, and the high court accepted Raut’s affidavit as an indemnity. The HC judges also noted that a 1990 document by Raut’s father Vithal had given an indemnity to Mhada or the housing development authority, which clearly indicates that when possession was taken, Raut was a resident of this very premises along with his father in 1976. “It is irrational for the authorities to believe that parties must remain alive for four-and-a-half decades before they can get an allotment,” they added. “If you wait for 45 years, it is two generations gone by,” remarked Justice Patel. Taking note of the February 16, 2021 allotment letter, the judges directed that Suryakant Raut “is to be allotted the resident unit admeasuring 300 sq ft in the redeveloped building formerly known as Haji Kasam Chawl.” They posted the matter for compliance on Monday. During the hearing in the case, Havnur said all those who were below Raut on the master list were allotted permanent houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-slams-authorities-over-demands-in-redevpt-case/articleshow/88348345.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Covid-19: More than 1 crore Delhiites are now fully vaccinated||NEW DELHI: At a time when Delhi is witnessing a spurt in Covid-19 cases after months, the vaccination drive in the national capital has reached a new milestone. More than 1 crore of around 1.5 crore eligible beneficiaries have received both doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, making two-thirds of the city’s adult population fully vaccinated. With 95,417 vaccine doses administered in Delhi till 11pm on Friday, the total number of doses administered now stands at 2,47,09,943 and the number of beneficiaries who have received the second dose and are fully vaccinated is 1,00,83,854, as per the CoWIN dashboard of the Union health ministry. The approximate number of eligible beneficiaries in Delhi is 1.5 crore and 67.2% of this population is now fully vaccinated. Also, with 1,46,26,089 first doses being administered till date, 97.5% of the eligible population has now received at least one dose of the vaccine. According to experts, vaccination is our best bet against the Omicron variant of Covid-19 and both chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and health minister Satyendar Jain have been appealing to eligible beneficiaries to get vaccinated at the earliest. Even as two-thirds of the eligible population are now fully vaccinated, district authorities have been facing an uphill task reaching out to the unvaccinated population despite door-to-door surveys and mobile vaccination teams. Due to relentless efforts to ensure 100% vaccine coverage, the number of people without even a single dose of the vaccine is now less than 4 lakh. “We have been trying our best to reach out to the unvaccinated population through surveys and individual phone calls. However, there is a section of beneficiaries that we are facing a challenge in vaccinating,” a district official said. “Though we have made all efforts to reach out to marginalized sections like homeless, there are still people who are completely unaware about the need to get vaccinated,” he said. Interestingly, while the most populous of Delhi’s 11 districts, North West, has administered more than 29.1 lakh cumulative vaccine doses, it is behind South West district (28.8 lakh) when it comes to fully vaccinated beneficiaries. While total doses administered in North West includes nearly 17.5 lakh first doses, South West has administered around 16.5 lakh first doses. However, South West is slightly ahead in the tally of fully vaccinated population with 12,26,219 second doses administered, compared with North West district’s 11,53,498 second doses. These two districts, apart from West district (11,14,958), have administered more than 11 lakh second doses each and they account for every third fully vaccinated beneficiary in the national capital (34.6%). North East district has administered the lowest number of second doses — 6,13,415.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-than-1-cr-delhiites-are-now-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/88349113.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||PM Modi UP itinerary: 4 trips in next 10 days||LUCKNOW: Showcasing the BJP’s development push and its concern for women and farmers in the run-up to UP elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to make four more trips to the state in the next 10 days. The model code of conduct for assembly polls likely to come into force with the notification next month. Modi will be in Shahjahanpur on Saturday to lay the foundation stone of the ambitious 594-km long Ganga Expressway -- country’s longest — connecting Meerut with Prayagraj. Proposed to come up at a cost of Rs 36,230 crore, the expressway is expected to be completed by 2025. This will be followed by the PM visiting Prayagraj on December 21 to address women employees from across the state. The event is being planned at a time when discussions on raising the salary of accredited social health activists (ASHA), Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and Anganwadi workers who played a pivotal role in vaccination and Covid-19 treatment have been gaining steam. Bank Sakhis, engaged by the rural development department to provide banking services, especially in the rural areas, at the time of pandemic, are also scheduled to be invited. Sources said that the PM is likely to boost the morale of the women employees for their services, in what is being perceived as a significant and a well calibrated women outreach move to counter the Congress which has been harping on women consolidation to take on BJP in state polls. Modi will be in his constituency Varanasi on December 23 to hold a seminar with farmers and agricultural scientists on his vision for the agricultural sector. PM’s interface with the farming community and experts comes days after his government annulled the three contentious farm laws which were at the centre of a raging farmer protest. The PM will travel to Kanpur on December 28 to inaugurate the first leg of the 9-km long Kanpur Metro Rail Project and attend the annual convocation of IIT Kanpur. CM Yogi had launched the trial run of Metro train last month and the section will start commercial operations soon after the PM inaugurates it. This will be the fourth Metro project in UP after the ones in Noida, Ghaziabad and Lucknow. The PM has already visited UP six times in past month — to Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Varanasi, Mahoba, Jhansi, Noida and Balrampur— for unveiling projects. He also visited Lucknow for DGPs conference last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-up-itinerary-4-trips-in-next-10-days/articleshow/88349087.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi slams Centre over legal marriage age||HYDERABAD: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday criticised the decision of Narendra Modi government to raise the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21. He said when 18-year-old men and women can sign contracts, set up businesses, choose prime ministers and elect MPs and MLAs, why cannot they marry at that age. Owaisi in a series of tweets stated that “this is a typical paternalism that we have come to expect from the government. Both men and women should be allowed to legally marry at 18 as they are treated as adults by the law for all other purposes.” He pointed out that in many US states, the marriage age is as low as 14. In the UK and Canada, it is 16. “If Modi is sincere, he would have focused on increasing economic opportunities for women. Yet India is the only country where women’s participation in the workforce is dwindling. It fell to 16% in 2020 from 26% in 2005.” Owaisi further tweeted: “In contrast, the Modi government acts like a mohalla uncle. Deciding what we eat, who/when we marry, what God we worship, etc. Ironically, the government proposes 18 as the age of consent in the Data Bill. If 18-year olds can choose how their data is used, why can’t they choose their life partners (sic).” He said that child marriages were rampant in the country despite a law. “Every fourth woman in India was married before turning 18 but only 785 criminal cases of child marriages were recorded. If child marriages have reduced from before, it’s due to education & economic progress, not criminal law.”  “There are 12 million kids married before they even turned 10. And 84% of these are from Hindu families and only 11% are Muslim. This points to the fact that social reform and government initiatives in education and human development are critical to preventing child marriages,” Owaisi tweeted. He asked what has the government done to improve education for girls and alleged that 79% of Rs 446 crore ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ budget was spent on advertisements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/owaisi-slams-centre-over-legal-marriage-age/articleshow/88348343.cms||Roushan Ali

During his inaugural address Pinarayi Vijayan said that Yusuf Ali M A has supported Kerala in many necessary situations and that the government intends to make the industrial sector in Kerala more business friendly. The government intends to attract Rs 10,000 crore investments in the industrial sector and an amount of Rs 3,200 crore have been received recently. About 4,700 MSMEs (Micro, small and medium enterprises) have been launched recently, he said. “Yusuf Ali M A succeeded in bringing a world class experience for the people that our city truly needs. Through this mall, around 10,000 people got job opportunities. We have seen unemployed people going to the Gulf countries to find a job. It may include those who have failed in the business sector. We should support all the MSME and should open our doors to them,” said Shashi Tharoor MP. “I would like to thank Yusuf Ali for building this institution. This is a pride for the city of Thiruvananthapuram. The brand Lulu is well known in many parts of the world. Yusuf Ali is a bigger brand than that, a lot of people who do not know me know Yusuf Ali,’’ said actor Mammootty, who was also present at the inaugural ceremony.

The civic body suspended four sanitation officials who were responsible for ensuring that the contracted workers carry out their duty. “The commissioner conducted a surprise check at four areas in ward 10 and ward 11 on Friday morning. He arrived in an unmarked private car and asked contracted sanitation supervisors for the muster. The commissioner, after checking the muster, asked the supervisor to take him to the workers who were marked on duty for Friday. However, the supervisors could not do so. In all these areas, the commissioner found that as many as 80% of the contracted sanitation workers were not present on duty,” a senior GMC official said. Later, the civic body chief called two sanitary inspectors and two sub-sanitary inspectors. He asked them why the contracted sanitation workers were missing from duty.  tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gmc-suspends-four-sanitation-officials/articleshow/88348349.cms||---

For those partying at home, Chahal has said party hosts should ensure the guest occupancy is 50% of the house capacity (50% of occupants in a house) and Covid norms must be strictly followed. However, this may prove tricky for residents with large homes and small numbers and vice versa. It may lead to run-in with neighbours. “The Omicron variant is fast spreading as can be seen in the UK, Austria and Germany. Today, even the Central government has warned that Covid norms must be followed and one must stay away from large gatherings. From the past Covid waves, we have seen India lags behind Europe by two months and we could face a serious surge in February if citizens are not careful now,” he said. He has specially appealed to eminent citizens and the hotel industry to self-discipline. “The norms are clear—50% of the capacity for indoors and 25% for outdoor venues. Cooperate. We are not a police state.” Rules issued by the government on November 27 will apply; BMC won’t issue rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-chief-lists-rules-for-house-parties-too/articleshow/88348359.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Nagpur||Police arrest 2 in bogus contract scam, NMC blacklists 8 agencies||Nagpur: Apart from preparing bogus rate contracts, contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode also allegedly prepared bogus tenders and siphoned off public money from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). On Friday, the civic body blacklisted eight agencies related to Sakode under the Bogus Contracts Scam.Sadar police on Friday arrested Sakode (55) and his nephew Atul (40). PI Vinod Chaudhari told TOI, “We have been granted custody of these two persons till Monday. Investigation is underway.”A day ago, Sadar police had booked four persons under section 420 and other relevant sections of IPC. Police are yet to arrest Sakode’s wife Sushma (50) and elder brother Manohar (70).As reported by TOI earlier, Sakode prepared 131 bogus contracts in health department and drew payment of Rs2.07 crore. Sakode also allegedly prepared similar bogus contracts and drew payment of Rs90 lakh from solid waste management department, Rs74 lakh from library, and Rs60 lakh from birth and death registration department.NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “Our investigations revealed Sakode also prepared bogus quotations (tender). Five firms of Sakode and his family members were selected for rate contract. NMC places order below Rs3 lakh and gets materials from agencies selected under rate contract. There is no need for quotation. Sakode had prepared fake demand and fake contracts in majority of cases.”In some contracts, Sakode even prepared bogus quotations. He prepared fake quotations from his own three-four firms and prepared note for selection of lowest bidder, then placed fake work order with the selected firm. As usual, he prepared fake acknowledgement from NMC about receipt of materials, and submitted the file to accounts and finance department for payment.This is probably the first time in NMC’s history that a contractor prepared a fake tender.Joshi said eight firms — Sudarshan Paper Converting, Manohar Sakode and Brothers, Swastik Trade Link, Gurukripa Stationers and Printers, SK Enterprises, Laxmi Sales, Shree Ganesh Sai Services, and Bharatiya Kagad Udyog Sahakari Sanstha — all related to Sakode, have been blacklisted. “These firms will not get any new contracts. Also, existing contracts will be cancelled. Rate contract of all these firms have been also terminated,” he said.This is also the first time in the history of civic body that eight firms have been blacklisted at a time, in one case. It also raises a big question how NMC allowed eight different firms of same family, which can easily take undue advantage in quotation of works below Rs3 lakh.NMC has already recovered Rs1.69 crore from Sakode. The scam so far is pegged at Rs4.31 crore.Investigation of contracts of some major departments like public works department is yet to be completed. Till now, only preliminary investigation has been done in contracts below Rs 3 lakh allotted since April 1, 2020, till date.A six-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena held its first meeting on Friday. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had directed the committee to investigate all contracts allotted from April 1, 2020, till date.BOXRs100 cr scam: ThakreCongress city president Vikas Thakre sent a letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray and demanded a high-level inquiry, and dissolution of NMC, considering the Bogus Contracts Scam. “I think this scam is of over Rs100 crore. It is not limited to one contractor or few staffers and single department. It is very clear now that the same happened in many departments and several staffers engaged in it over a long time. It is much bigger scam than the sports materials scam which led to dissolution of NMC earlier. Neither ruling party nor civic chief has any over NMC. Public money is being looted. Therefore, NMC should be dissolved as soon as possible,” said Thakre who is also MLA from West Nagpur.NCP corporator Abha Pande submitted a letter to mayor Dayashankar Tiwari requesting a meeting of general body to discuss the scam. “Crores of public money has been looted by means of corruption. Meeting of general body is must to discuss it,” she said.-------------------------------------IANToday’s Developments* It was revealed that Contractor prepared bogus tender (quotation)c* Total scam swelled to Rs4.31 crore* Eight firms related to Sakode blacklisted and also all existing contracts cancelled* Directions given to remaining departments like PWD to submit details soon* Six-member committee held its first meeting and directed departments to investigate all contracts allotted from April 1, 2020 till date* Sadar police station arrested two of four accused and got PCR till Monday||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-arrest-2-in-bogus-contract-scam-nmc-blacklists-8-agencies/articleshow/88362692.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Goa||Laity to partake in Liberation Day celebrations||Panaji: Faithful will partake in patriotic celebrations on Liberation Day, hoisting the national flag after mass on Sunday. The tricolour will be hoisted, and a special programme held at St Anthony Church, Siolim for the very first time to mark the event. Parish priest of the Church, Fr Socorro Mendes said the parish has decided it doesn’t want to miss an opportunity to hoist the national flag. “Formerly it was only government institutions that could hoist the national flag. We did some research and found that the flag code changed some years ago, permitting even private bodies to hoist the flag provided all protocol is followed and all due respect given. We’ve got everything in place. We bought the flag, got special poles and pulleys ready and asked a PT master to train the youth to give the commands and salutation,” he told TOI. It is common for educational institutions, including those attached to churches, to observe Liberation Day, but rare for a parish. “We are citizens first and become Catholics after baptism,”Mendes said. Love for the state and country was instilled in him by his rector at Saligao seminary, Fr Cromacio Mascarenhas from Cuncolim. “He would tell us that the nation for him was the second God after God, and he took great pride in hoisting the national flag, doing it with dignity and nobility,” Mendes recalled. The parish at Siolim will not only hoist the national flag on Sunday, but two other flags as well. Former director of Xavier’s Centre for Historical Research, Dr Delio Mendonca, now a professor at the Gregorian university in Rome, will hoist the Vatican flag, while moderator of the parish pastoral committee Pancho will hoist the parish flag of St Anthony designed by the assistant parish priest Fr Francisco. “The tricolour will be hoisted by a teenager (a young girl) because we believe in the emancipation of women,” Mendes said. “We have to pray for Goa as it is a rich state which is slowly getting eroded with egotism and greed and we are falling prey to all sorts of vices and vicissitudes,” he said. The tradition of hoisting the national flag has been followed for decades at the Rachol and Saligao seminaries too. Preparations are already on for a small programme at Rachol which will include hoisting of the tricolour with singing of the national anthem, singing of patriotic songs, speeches and a cultural programme. “One group of seminarians is made in charge of the cultural programme, another the speech and ultimately the whole seminary is involved,” says rector of the patriarchal seminary of Rachol Fr Aleixo Menezes. The hoisting of the tricolour is part and parcel of one’s patriotic spirit, rector of Saligao seminary Fr Valeriano Vaz said. “We do it joyfully and with pride. This helps inculcate the spirit of patriotism in the younger generation too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/laity-to-partake-in-liberation-day-celebrations/articleshow/88364684.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Alka Lahu Chougale (45) was taken to the Radhanagari rural hospital for primary treatment, from where she was shifted to the Rajarshee Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Government Medical College and CPR Hospital in the city. She sustained injuries to her neck and spinal cord. Range forest officer S B Birajdar,reached the spot with other forest officials and was carrying out further investigation. The bison, which was spotted in the city on Thursday morning, has found the way back to its original habitat. Vijay Patil, forest ranger said, "The young bison was allowed a free passage to its habitat off the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri state highway at Ambewadi. The bison reached the spot through Shingnapur, Balinga and Padali route. The probability of the animal again coming back to the city is less unless people disturb it. Our team is keeping an eye over the location and we request everyone to let the bison go freely into its habitat. The location of the bison, which had reached the city and then went on a rampage at Bhuyewadi leading to the death of a 21-year-old villager was not yet traced. “We are expecting that the animal must have taken back the route towards its habitat in the forest areas of Panhala. The herd of the three bisons that were spotted two days ago in the Kagal MIDC area have went back to the forest area of Kapshi village,” Patil said. “Another bison, which was found in an injured condition after getting stuck in mud for three days at Harpawde village in Panhala tehsil, died due to weakness,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/woman-injured-in-bison-attack-in-kolhapur-village/articleshow/88346781.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Delhi: Detention beyond 90 days sans charge under HC lens||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday decided to examine if an accused can be detained under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) without a charge beyond the period of 90 days if the police say it was impossible to finish the probe within that period. A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani asked Delhi Police to respond to the plea that centers on proviso to Section 43D(2)(B) of UAPA relating to the extension of remand in a case where a chargesheet has not been filed even after 90 days. The court’s notice came on a plea filed by one Zeeshan Qamar to challenge a trial court order denying him bail. An essential requirement of an order extending remand under Section 43D(2) of UAPA, the plea argued, is that the court should call for a report of the public prosecutor indicating “progress of the investigation” and “specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the said period of 90 days” are made available, “with the court being satisfied with the report”. The plea contended that “after 85 days of keeping the appellant in custody, the respondent, vide application dated 08.12.2021, sought extension of custody by another 90 days. The special judge vide impugned order dated 09.12.2021 granted an extension till 11.02.2022 to the respondent,” the petition said, challenging the remand. Qamar was booked and arrested earlier this year by Delhi Police on the allegations that he had gone to Pakistan and received training in handling explosives to plan a serial blast in India. Meanwhile, another court has put UAPA under scrutiny, saying it is paramount that cases under this law are tried expeditiously and sought the administration’s stand on streamlining their quick disposal before the special designated courts. Justice Mukta Gupta said it was for the high court authorities to consider the issue of expeditious disposal of UAPA cases and make appropriate recommendations for establishing exclusive courts for their trial. The court observed that since the cases under UAPA involved serious offences and foreigners, it was not easy for those in custody to secure bail, and noted that it was evident from the high court administration’s affidavit that trials took a considerable amount of time on account of a large number of accused and witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/paramount-to-speed-up-trials-under-uapa/articleshow/88349107.cms||---

Between April and December 16, on a gross basis, collections have increased by around 48% to Rs 10.3 lakh crore. Receipts on the direct tax front have been so robust that they are already 60% higher than the level of the entire 2020-21, when the Covid-19 outbreak had forced businesses to shut down due to the country-wide lockdown and resulted in widespread job losses and salary cuts. A recovery across several sectors and people coming back to the job market have helped perk up the government's revenue collections, both on the direct as well as indirect taxes front. The latest numbers come after the government received the third installment of advance tax. In a statement, the finance ministry said that the cumulative advance tax collections for the first, second and third quarters of the current financial year were estimated at almost Rs 4.6 lakh crore (up to December 16), against Rs 3 lakh crore a year ago, showing a growth of 53.5%. With more data from banks expected in the coming days, the ministry expects the number to improve further. Within net collections, corporation tax of over Rs 5.1 lakh crore accounting for 54% share, while the remaining Rs 4.3 lakh crore was on account of personal income tax, including Security Transaction Tax (STT). Refunds amounting to Rs 1.35 lakh crore have been issued so far in the current fiscal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/direct-tax-mop-up-surges-40-in-fy22-till-mid-dec/articleshow/88349856.cms||---

This was the fifth residential apartment building that the civic body had sealed for lack of BU permission. The AMC also sealed 36 residential units located opposite Silver Flats in Fatehwadi in Sarkhej area and eight residential units on Sarkhej-Juhapura road for illegal construction. The civic body also demolished 10,200 square feet of illegal construction. Apart from these, the civic body’s town planning and estate department sealed six commercial properties located in Bodakdev, Gota, Naroda, Gomtipur, Sarkhej and Sarkhej-Sanand road. In May, the AMC initiated a sealing drive in response to the high court’s judgment, sealing 2,516 structures, mostly commercial complexes, that did not have legal BU approval. The high court had ruled on November 29 that the authorities should demolish a few structures to make an example, stating that it is preferable to evict people from their homes than to watch them burn to death. “We have so far demolished 36,345 sq feet of illegal constructions and sealed 454 units for not having a valid BU permission. We will intensify our drive against buildings operating without BU permissions and illegal constructions in the next few days,” said an AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-seals-one-more-residential-complex/articleshow/88348363.cms||---

Around the same time, Swiss too will start non-stop flights between Mumbai and Zurich. International outbound travel from India to Singapore is expected to pick up in the coming weeks. Early this month, India took Singapore off the list of ‘at-risk’ countries. With this, passengers arriving from Singapore don’t have to undergo on-arrival Covid test or week-long home quarantine. But to fly into Singapore on VTL flights, passengers have to present digital proof of double vaccination. The 471-seater superjumbo will return to India after a 20-month hiatus. “Starting January 10, the A380 will replace the Airbus A350-900 on the Singapore Airlines’ vaccinated travel lane (VTL) flights between Mumbai and Singapore. From February 14, SIA will operate the A380 in place of the Boeing 787-10 on its VTL services between Delhi and Singapore,” said Singapore Airlines on Friday. Said an airport official: “Domestic air travel has almost bounced back to pre-Covid levels, we hope international travel catches up in the first half of next year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-superjumbo-aircraft-to-return-after-20-months/articleshow/88348386.cms||---

A year after cancelling the annual large-scale Christmas event, the United Christian Celebrations Committee (UCCC) has decided to conduct the event on December 18. However, due to restrictions by cops owing to Omicron concerns, they have shifted their venue and have reduced the number of people that would be allowed for the event. “This year too, the highlight of the event would be the 200-member carol choir. Earlier, we had planned the annual gathering at Wesley College where close to 2,000 people participate every year. Following the cops advice, we have moved the event to YMCA grounds in Secunderabad and now only 500 people would be allowed to attend the gathering,” said Robert Surya Prakash, vice-president of UCCC. Carol singing programmes wherein the community visits houses have also been suspended. Some churches have put in place carol singing in their premises wherein independent families will be coming forward with performances. “All the events will be streamed online like last year so that those who are advised not to visit the church physically can view the service from their home,” said Norman Issac, treasurer of St Johns Church in Secunderabad. At many churches, arrangements are being made to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed.

---||Lucknow||‘UP people are facing qillat, diqqat & zillat’||LUCKNOW: A day before Rahul, Priyanka’s joint padyatra in Amethi, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav held public meetings in the Congress bastion of Rae Bareli on Friday, accusing the BJP government of having dispensed qillat, diqqat aur zillat (scarcity, problems and humiliation) to people of the state. Akhilesh began the seventh leg of Vijay Yatra after offering prayers at hanuman temple at Chiruwa toll as he entered Rae Bareli. Shortly thereafter he tweeted a ‘dohaa’ of Hanuman Ashtak (prayer dedicated to Lord Hanuman) stating that he was starting his campaign in Rae Bareli after seeking blessing of Lord Hanuman. He then went on to address public meetings in Bachrawan, Gurbakshganj in Harchandpur assembly constituency and Lalganj area of Sareni assembly seat. The former UP CM held the state government responsible for the shortage of oxygen during the second wave of novel coronavirus pandemic and questioned the government’s explanation tabled before the assembly in which it has been stated that no one died of oxygen shortage. “The government says no one died due to shortage of oxygen. What about those who had to run from pillar to post for oxygen and hospital beds. Will they believe the government,” he said.  He said the government has reduced a fertilizer bag by five kilograms. “Ye kisano se chori hai (This is like stealing from farmers),” he said. Further supporting his qillat, diqqat aur zillat charge, he said the government policies have led to price rise as a result of which the count of biscuits in a pack of a popular brand has been reduced. Rise in fuel prices has hit the common man and farmers and youths, who are demanding employment, are baton charged in Lucknow. “The youths are only demanding jobs that the BJP had promised in their poll manifesto,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-people-are-facing-qillat-diqqat-zillat/articleshow/88349111.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Lucknow||SP stand on women progressive: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Hours after two Samajwadi Party Members of Parliament gave bizarre statements on the government’s plan to introduce a bill increasing the minimum age limit for marriage of girls from 18 to 21, party national president Akhilesh Yadav dismissed their statements as ‘personal opinions’ and said the SP has a very progressive approach towards women and cannot support such statements. “The Samajwadi Party has a progressive approach when it comes to women and their betterment. Such statements (of the two MPs) can be their personal opinion but certainly not the party line on the issue. The SP can never back such opinions (like that of the two MPs). Our party has distributed free laptops to girls and used technology to help them through 1090 Women Powerline and a number of similar initiatives,” Akhilesh said when asked to comment on the statement of his party MPs. Expressing their reservation over Centre’s move to increase the age limit for marriage of girls, sitting SP MP from Moradabad ST Hasan had said: “Girls should be married when they attain the age of fertility. There is nothing wrong if a mature girl is married at 16. If she can vote at the age of 18, why can't she marry?” He, however added that this was his personal comment and not the party line. However, Shafeequr Rehman Barq, who is the SP MP from Sambhal, came up with a rather bizarre statement. “…. ladkiyon ko awaargi ka mauka milega (Will throw up opportunities for girls to go astray) he said. “India is a poor country and everybody wants to marry their daughters at an early age ... I will not support this bill in Parliament,” he said. He later said that he did not use the word ‘awaargi’ and that his statement was twisted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-sp-stand-on-women-progressive/articleshow/88349096.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The Congress leader will be reaching the district to participate in a ‘padyatra’ organised as part of the party’s ongoing nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’. Prior to this, the three-time MP from Amethi visited the constituency on July 10, 2019 to review the reasons for his defeat. Rumours of his visit to Amethi were heard a couple of times in between. Rahul would be joining his sister and party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi who is leading the poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh for 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections. Vice-chairman, media department, UP Congress, Pankaj Srivastava said that the Congress had launched the ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ on November 14 to expose the gross failure of the Narendra Modi led government on the economic front and make people aware of the Centre’s insensitivity in addressing issues that affect the daily life due to inflation. “Rahul Gandhi ji is returning to Amethi after a long gap has filled the cadres with new zeal. The Congress is working hard to unite the people of India against the Modi-Yogi governments which work constantly to divert public attention from real issues,” he said. Citing the example of price rise and inflation, Srivastava said: “At a rate of 14.22%, inflation is on its 12-year high and people from different walks of life especially women are suffering due to this.” UP Congress officials stated that the padyatra will begin from Jagdishpur and culminate into a public meeting in Heeramau. They also said that a day after the padyatra, Priyanka will hold a Shakti Samvad with girls from Rae Bareli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rahul-returns-to-amethi-after-2-5-yrs/articleshow/88349118.cms||Shailvee Sharda

In one of the videos that have gone viral, a resident doctor alleged that students were individually called by the HOD in his chamber where he has threatened them of failing them in exams and not approving their dissertation. “We have complained to various authorities in the last few days but no action has been initiated. Who is backing and protecting him should be found out?” the resident doctor is seen saying in the video. In an another video, a resident doctor of pulmonary medicine has claimed that Upadhyay recently summoned some doctors to his office where he asked them to sign a blank paper and withdraw their protest unconditionally. The students were threatened with dire consequences if they did not roll back their strike call immediately, he further said. When contacted, BJMC dean, Dr Jayesh Sachdeva said, “We have received students’ representation and forwarded it to the concerned government authority. We have not received any response yet. It is not in our knowledge whether any inquiry has been ordered in this regard,” he said. In the past, a special committee was set up after a student of the gynaecology department complained that he had verbally abused her. The matter was put to rest after he apologized for his behaviour, said sources in B J Medical College. “Students are forced to come forward and voice their concerns openly as the college authority and the government have failed to look into this issue,” said a member of the Junior Doctors’ Association at B J Medical College and Civil Hospital. The resident doctors have sought his immediate resignation from the post of head of the department and transfer from BJ Medical College saying that they will not be able to perform their duties properly till he remains at the post. “The college authorities have forwarded the complaints raised by JDA against Upadhyay to the state government,” sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/docs-post-videos-alleging-harassment/articleshow/88348390.cms||---

With this redevelopment, Parimal Garden will become the first garden in the city to have a constructed gymnasium. “As part of our plans to redevelop Parimal Garden, a two-storeyed gymnasium will be built within the garden premises. The gymnasium will have the latest fitness and exercise equipment,” said an AMC official. He further added that citizens come for morning walks at the garden so it was decided by the AMC’s recreational, cultural and heritage committee to construct a gymnasium so that the garden becomes a single point destination for fitness enthusiasts. “After the redevelopment, the open garden space will be a bit smaller because of the gym and also due to the adjacent road going towards Ambawadi needs to be widened for smooth traffic flow. The garden which is spread over a 36,000 sq meter area and some part of the land will be provided for road widening,” the official said. The official said that the redevelopment plan includes construction of a gazebo, an interactive display kiosk which will give information related to various species of flowers and trees in the garden and a small open theatre. There will be a dedicated area for people who come for yoga. We will install around 10 benches around the lake area,” the official said and added that the plan also includes an open gym which will have a small cycle track and some exercise equipment. “Total expenditure for redevelopment is estimated at around Rs 10 crore,” the official said and added that the civic body is likely to consider building more gymnasiums in the existing gardens under redevelopment plan and also in the the upcoming gardens being developed by the civic body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parimal-garden-to-house-two-storeyed-gymnasium/articleshow/88348400.cms||---
---||Nagpur||HC: Husband’s abuse may cease on separation, not wife’s trauma||Nagpur: In an important observation on divorced and separated women, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court said emotional distress or psychological effect caused by husband on the wife, is bound to traumatize her even after she leaves the matrimonial home and takes shelter with parents. “Even if the physical cruelty in the matrimonial house may have ceased and does not take place at parental home, there can be no doubt that the mental trauma and psychological distress caused by husband’s acts, including verbal exchanges, that compelled wife to leave the matrimonial home and take shelter with parents, would continue to persist at the parental home,” a division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and Pushpa Ganediwala said. Citing Supreme Court verdicts in similar cases, the bench added mental cruelty borne out of physical cruelty or abusive and humiliating verbal exchanges would continue in the parental home even though there may not be any such overt acts there. “Even the silence of the wife may have an underlying element of emotional distress and mental agony. Her sufferings at parental home may be directly attributable to the acts of husband’s cruelty at matrimonial home, and would undoubtedly be the consequences of his acts. Such consequences would amount to distinct offences committed at parental home or other places where she has taken shelter.” The HC’s observations came while hearing a petition by a woman through counsel Shireen Meghe challenging the decision of Ram Nagar police station in Chandrapur to transfer FIR lodged by her against Pune-based husband and in-laws to Chaturshrungi police station on the mistaken notion that they do not have jurisdiction to investigate the charges. The FIR was lodged under IPC Sections 377, 498-A, 504, and 506. The 29-year-old petitioner alleged that the husband used to thrash her regularly and even threatened to kill her. He used to return home late at night, show her pornographic videos, and used to have unnatural sex, thereby physically and mentally torturing her on regular basis. Even after she delivered a daughter, her torture continued, as the in-laws prohibited her from entering their home. Quoting apex court judgments in Sunita Kimari Kashyap and Rupali Devi cases, the HC bench disapproved Chandrapur police’s action of transferring the investigation to Pune. “The consequences of acts in Pune’s matrimonial home, which constitute an offence, have ensued or been severely felt at Chandrapur. All these are good and substantial grounds to hold that the Chandrapur police has not only the ample jurisdiction, but also the duty to investigate allegations made by the wife in her complaint,” the justices said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-husbands-abuse-may-cease-on-separation-not-wifes-trauma/articleshow/88348399.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Wave Of Complacency: Markets Let Masks Slip||New Delhi: Markets across Delhi are getting crowded, but on Friday, as on most days, the shoppers were seen either without masks or not wearing them properly and there was a complete disregard for social distancing. It was as if people hadn’t considered the risks posed by the rapidly spreading Omicron variant of the Covid coronavirus. At Sarojini Nagar market, the stores and food stalls were surrounded by jostling crowds. “Mask? I have one. No problem, I will wear it,” laughed Ashok, a vendor, taking it out from his pocket when TOI wondered why he wasn’t wearing one. Ironically, he was selling chaat just below the speakers from where continuous announcements were being blared about Covid-19 protocols, including mandatory use of masks. Ashok wasn’t the only one who was daring the coronavirus. “I am sorry, I just finished eating and forgot to put it back on,” said architect Amit Jain, who had come with a friend to shop. “We know there is a threat, we will keep that in mind.” Ashok Randhawa, president, Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, resignedly said, “The hawkers are a big problem. They don’t wear masks even when pointed out to them. We can only request them. Enforcing rules is the job of the police and Civil Defence personnel. As for shoppers, they follow the norms as per their own comfort.” A Delhi Police constable claimed that the 10 policemen deployed in Sarojini Nagar booked people for contravening the guidelines, but added that enforcing social distancing in a marketplace wasn’t easy. The Central Market at Lajpat Nagar was no different. Tushar Gupta, owner of Moonlight, a store there, hurriedly pulled on a mask and then argued, “We try our best to make the customers follow the rules, but we can’t force them. The government has also ordered physical distancing. But if there is no crowd, there is no market either. Also, it is difficult to wear a mask for 9-10 straight hours, but our employees are all fully vaccinated.” The vendors here too pay scant attention to Covid-appropriate behaviour. “I was standing in the sun, so was not wearing a mask. Anyway, see so many others are also not wearing any,” was the excuse offered by Satish, putting up socks and handkerchiefs on display. He defiantly carried on, refusing to don a mask. According to a police officer posted at the Lajpat Nagar market, the traders and vendors have all been told to be extra vigilant against the new Omicron variant. “But I think the footfall has lessened after people heard about the new threat. They are aware of the danger,” the officer said. In the more upmarket heart of the city at Connaught Place, the crowd enjoyed the festive atmosphere and the adornments signifying the approaching Christmas and New Year’s Day. There was also a sense of denial. Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association, asserted, “Connaught Place is a spacious open area and 99% of the buyers are wearing masks. The authorities should keep an eye instead on the densely populated markets.” But in the middle of the market, at the underground and enclosed Palika Bazar, numerous vendors, shop owners and shoppers went about with naked faces or with the masks dangling from their necks. Here too, there was an air of defiance. Darshan Lal Kakar, chairman, Palika Bazar Traders’ Association, unmasked, said testily, “Don’t worry, all will be fine. The media is unnecessarily creating a panic and hyping up the threat. The Omicron virus has reached almost every part of the world, so it is bound to reach India too.” In the tony Select City Walk mall in south Delhi’s Saket, staff posted at the entrances checked for masks and insisted on the use of hand sanitiser before entering the mall. Strict vigilance by the security staff at My Square cafeteria made it possible for only a limited number of people to enter the shop. “We are doing our best to limit the crowd inside and we also request everyone to don masks,” said a security officer. In east Delhi's Preet Vihar and Laxmi Nagar, TOI estimated that over 70% of the people on the streets were wearing masks. Social distancing, however, was a casualty at most places. On Vikas Marg too, people were barely keeping the required distance from each other at shops, bus stops and connected market areas. However, at most of the shops there, the security personnel were checking the people for body temperature, sanitising hands and pulling up people to tell them to wear their masks before entering the shops. “In a market area, maintaining social distances, that too on weekends when the markets are extra crowded, is difficult,” pleaded Mahesh Gupta, who has a shop at Laxmi Nagar. “We shop owners can, at best, ask the customers to maintain some space between themselves and to follow other Covid norms. But on main streets, it is the responsibility of the police and civic authorities to act against violators.” A drive through the Patparganj industrial area showed several spots at which labourers were huddled together, in close proximity to each other, and mostly without masks on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wave-of-complacency-markets-let-masks-slip/articleshow/88349123.cms||---
---||Varanasi||PM Modi cites Kashi Model, pushes for growth interwoven with city’s heritage||Varanasi: Stating that the development of Varanasi can be a roadmap for the entire country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that the development of the city has been carried out while preserving its rich heritage and introducing development in a manner that it blends with the city’s spirit. India today needs evolution and not revolution, the PM added. He was virtually addressing 120 mayors who had congregated in Kashi to take part in the All-India Mayors’ Conference through video conferencing at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre here on Friday. Modi emphasised that indulging in destruction is not the need of hour. “We should believe in evolution. India does not need revolution today. We don’t need to demolish our heritage buildings and reconstruct them, rather we need to rejuvenate them and move towards technological upgradation. I want all the Mayors to take an initiative to bring their city to the top of the cleanest city list.” The PM further suggested the mayors start competitions to promote cleanliness and beautification across the country while preserving the heritage of their cities. “While planning development, take lessons from the Kashi model, which has emerged as the roadmap for the country,” Modi said, adding, “Preserving heritage has its importance as it helps the coming generations to take lessons from the past and get inspiration for searching new ways of development. Local arts and skills should be recognised to adopt it as strength as well as promoting the brand and identity of the place.” Referring to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s initiative of ‘one district one product’, in this regard, Modi mobilised the mayors to “map their cities for identifying the special product of the place concerned for branding to make the entire country and world know about it as it will boost the local economy”. “Cities are the driving force of the economy, hence they should be developed as hubs of a vibrant economy. For it, a holistic approach should be adopted while preparing development models. If industrial areas are planned anywhere, the provision of housing of labourers and other workforce should also be made in its vicinity,” the PM said, mentioning that it will also attract investment. Asking the mayors to keep special focus on MSMEs, Modi also stressed upon the importance of extending support to street vendors through Swanidhi Yojana as, despite being the strength of a micro economy and essential part of the society’ they are still marginalised. “Their importance was realised by all during Covid-19 lockdown when no street vendor could be found visiting city localities to sell vegetable, deliver milk, provide service of cleaning cloth and other,” said the PM adding that this section wants to fight against poverty and helping them with Swanidhi will not only prove a great help for them, but their service for society would also be improved. He also threw light on increasing population load on cities and traffic problems. “Construction of flyovers in any number is not a solution against these problems. Hence, focus should be given on strengthening the public transport system. Work is being done on metro rails in many cities but other alternatives as per topography of area should also be explored,” he said. Regarding sanitation, Modi said: “Studying the Kashi model would prove to be a great help for the mayors who certainly want to do work for which they should be remembered in their cities even after decades, so plan regular sanitation works, sewage development and preserving river according to their the topography of their own cities.” “Swachchhta is for all the cities. But, in annual Swachchhta rating some cities have fixed their place on top. But, it doesn’t mean that others should quit thinking about competing against those cities. Each mayor should take a vow for bagging Swachchhta award next time,” he said. The PM also appealed to Union urban development minister Hardeep Singh Puri to make provision for recognition of those cities, which make best efforts to improve rank in Swachchhta rating. “The sanitation drives should not be considered as activity for a year or two. It should be adopted as a continuous process and each municipal body should also try to introduce competition between wards to ensure cumulative effects of this campaign and change the image of the city as well as the health status of the local population,” said Modi. He further asked the mayors to take a vow for banning single use plastic, recycling of solid waste, sewage water for agriculture and industrial use on the lines of Surat, adopt measure like LED lighting for power bill saving and celebrate the city’s birthday in grand style to stir civic sense a love for the city among people, especially the younger generation. Modi also touched upon the importance of the river Ganga in Kashi’s economy. “Most of the cities have rivers and a sensitive approach is needed towards rivers and other waterbodies. Water is emerging as a major concern globally hence giving a connection to waterbodies with society is a must, he said asking mayors to organise river festivals annually with the efforts for their maintenance as it would not only bring back life in rivers but also in the city,” he elaborated. Citing the example of Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, who started his career as the mayor of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, Modi said that today’s mayors will pursue career in active politics, hence they should utilise the current opportunity responsibly. “The country is celebrating the 75th year of independence as Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsava and each mayor should try to beautify at least one city crossing on public private partnership by inviting the social responsibility fund of any organisation,” he further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-modi-cites-kashi-model-pushes-for-growth-interwoven-with-citys-heritage/articleshow/88348396.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Delhi||IT Act does not provide for removing court orders for right to be forgotten: Centre to HC||New Delhi: The Centre has told Delhi High Court that the provisions of the Information Technology Act do not remove court orders passed against a person on account of his right to be forgotten. The Centre submitted that while the right to privacy is a fundamental right and includes the right to be forgotten, any direction for the removal of court orders must be directly passed by the high court to the intermediary and the platform on which they are uploaded. Its response came on a petition by two businessmen, seeking the removal of certain content from various online platforms concerning a criminal case against them. The Centre explained that the Information Technology (IT) Act provides for blocking the information for public access through any computer resource, but its provisions do not apply in the present case. The petitioners had sought the removal of court orders from certain online platforms on the ground that despite being discharged in a criminal case in 2016, information was available on the internet, due to which they faced social stigma. “The IT Act 2000 provides for blocking the information for public access through any computer resource only under section 69A of the IT Act 2000. The IT Act also provides for removal of certain unlawful information from an intermediary platform as per section 79.... The present case, which pertains to the erasure of content under the doctrine of 'right to be forgotten', does not fall under any of the stipulated conditions,” it said. The Centre, however, pointed out that in order to protect its citizens and their privacy, the government has brought out the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, which contains provisions related to the doctrine of the right to be forgotten. It asserted that it is for the respective platforms to consider the requests of the petitioner and remove such judgments or orders as it does not play a “significant role” in the present case. In the petition, the duo sought a direction for the protection of their right to privacy and the removal of online news articles, case details and judgment regarding a criminal case. The two men were booked in an alleged conspiracy and forgery case for using forged documents for the illegal clearance of cargo planes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/it-act-does-not-provide-for-removing-court-orders-for-right-to-be-forgotten-centre-to-hc/articleshow/88349127.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Buried for three months, the carcass had decomposed completely but the veterinary doctor managed to recover some bones, a few nails and canines. Four accused, Pandurang Gedam, Hriachand Bhoyar, Ramdas Sherki and Pochu Gedam, who were arrested on Thursday for poaching the tiger and disposing of the carcass, were remanded in four-day forest custody by the JMFC court on Friday morning. Forest officials had earlier recovered 11 whiskers from the accused. Now they are focused on ascertaining whether the accused had removed any other valuable body parts. RFO Saoli range, VB Kambli claimed that forest labourers dug the spot identified by the accused and exhumed the remains. DCF, Bramhapuri forest division, Dipesh Malhotra, ACF Chavre and in-charge of transit treatment centre Dr Kundan Podchelwar was present while exhuming the carcass. “The carcass was completely decomposed and destroyed, but still some bones and nails were recovered. We suspect it to be a male tiger. Samples have been collected for DNA analysis,” said RFO Kambli. The remains were incinerated before the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-carcass-exhumed-poachers-remanded-in-4-day-fcr/articleshow/88347477.cms||Mazhar Ali

The system was launched five years ago but eventually its popularity faded. The civic body has assigned a data entry operator who would forward the grievances to the officers concerned to resolve the complaints. Between June 1 and December 16, the helpline 83001-13000 has received a total of 498 complaints of which 249 were addressed. The civic body said that complaints on major projects that are long-term solutions cannot be addressed. “Complaints seeking new roads and underground drainage connections involves a long process such as fund allocation and floating tenders. Only complaints that can be achieved with the existing manpower and machinery were resolved,” a senior corporation official said. Around 40 complaints were out of the scope of work area of the corporation. To expedite solutions, the civic body has formed dedicated teams to look after the complaints and assign them to appropriate officials and departments based on the nature of the grievance and locality. The mechanism has two WhatsApp groups. One is the engineering department group that manages street lights, UGD and drinking water issues while the other was sanitary officials, they are responsible for garbage littering, stray dog menace and solid waste management. The civic body claimed that after the appointment of operators and streamlining of teams, the system’s efficiency has improved. “Resolved complaints will be verified with the complainants directly through phone calls,” the official added. The civic body insisted the residents seeking long-term solutions such as new roads can submit their petition separately instead of sharing in the helpline. The helpline was first introduced by the corporation in December 2016 as a part of the integrated complaint tracking system (ICTS) to resolve civic issues. However, the platform went dormant as residents stopped sharing photographs on the helpline as there complaints were not resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-revives-whatsapp-grievance-redressal-platform/articleshow/88348413.cms||Deepak Karthik

State Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday constituted a committee headed by additional chief secretary Vandana Krishna to probe the alleged corruption. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “Supe, Savarikar and Pritish Deshmukh, the IT firm director, collected a total of Rs4.2 crore (between Rs50,000 and Rs1 lakh per beneficiary) from over 700 candidates to alter the marks and declare them eligible... The volume of the fraud is quite large. We are in the process of establishing the links and there will be more arrests.”  Education diploma holders are required to be declared as eligible in the TET to secure a job in schools and institutions run by state and local self-governing bodies. The council’s chairman Dattatray Jagtap, complainant in the case, said, “At the moment, there is no plan to cancel the TET-2020 results. Once the investigation is over, we will get details about candidates involved in cheating.” He added, “This year’s TET is not under the scanner because it was not conducted by the same agency. The candidates need not worry about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-exam-council-head-held-for-tet-malpractice/articleshow/88348420.cms||Mihir Tanksale

At a cost of Rs 32 lakh, work on a new stormwater drain and culvert is in progress on Benwells road passing through Kalai Kaviri fine arts college. People approaching the college with children for extra-curricular classes stated that the slow pace of work is causing traffic bottlenecks as people are parking their vehicles over the road. The drain would collect surplus water and divert it to Uyyakondan canal. However, locals have raised concerns over sullage entering the drains while the civic body turns a blind eye to it. Besides the bad road and construction work affecting vehicular movement, overflowing sewage has also put residents under ordeal. The work which includes a footpath was supposed to be completed in early December, but the project is still progressing. “We will complete the pending work within a week. The recent rainfall made us suspend the work for a brief time. A new drain formation usually takes time, but the culvert will be commissioned shortly,” an official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/culvert-work-nears-completion-in-cantonment/articleshow/88348417.cms||---

The CM was speaking at the All-India Mayors’ Conference, inaugurated virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday. The conference was held at the Trade Facilitation Centre (TFC) in the Bada Lalpur area in the city. Giving credit to the PM’s vision and efforts, Yogi said, “Seven years ago, Kashi was much different from what it appears today. The lanes seven years ago were narrow and dirty while live electric wires hanging loose from the poles posing risk to the people’s lives in almost every locality. At that time, open defecation along railway tracks was a common sight. But, now with the building of lakhs of houses with toilets as well as community toilets, the picture of Kashi has changed. It’s a transformed city because of the PM’s efforts.” Yogi further said that sustainable urban development plays a key role in the economic development of a state, and will contribute greatly towards making India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. “Kashi has set new standards of development, and emphasized the importance of having an Integrated Control & Command Centre and Integrated Traffic Management for developing a city into a smart city,” said Yogi while mentioning the role played by ICCC during the fair at Kumbh in security management. He said that 17.5 lakh people have got houses under PM Awas Yojana while LED lights are illuminating 16 lakh localities in UP. Union minister of housing and urban development Hardeep Singh Puri also spoke on the occasion. A three-day exhibition showcasing UP’s achievements in terms of urban development is also underway at the TFC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kashi-an-example-of-blended-model-of-indias-rich-tradition-modernity-cm/articleshow/88348409.cms||Binay Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi HC upholds earlier order to reinstate Air India pilots||NEW DELHI: Coming to the aid of all Air India pilots whose services were terminated, including the contractual ones, the Delhi high court on Friday upheld its earlier decision to reinstate them. A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh also modified the earlier single judge decision by granting further relief to those pilots who, despite withdrawing their resignation, had left Air India as it refused to take them back. “Aforesaid employees would not be reinstated but would be entitled to back wages for the period spanning between the date when their resignations were accepted and the date when they found alternate employment,” the bench noted. The bench further observed that “State and its instrumentalities are obliged to act as a model employer, and, therefore, cannot be seen to deprive the pilots of the right to serve Air India, at a point in time when finding jobs in the private sector is a difficult proposition. The state and its instrumentalities are expected to look at myriad aspects and not just profits. Welfare of employees in times when jobs are difficult to come by should form a crucial ingredient of its decision making process.” The single judge had earlier directed reinstatement of several pilots and also ordered that back wages would have to be paid to the reinstated pilots. The court had also said that extension of contract, in the future, of the contractual pilots would be at the discretion of Air India in view of their satisfactory performance. In its appeal, Air India had argued that once a pilot tenders resignation, the legal relationship of an employer-employee comes to an end with it and the resignation cannot be withdrawn subsequently. However the division bench didn’t agree with this stand and underlined that resignations tendered by the pilots could be considered effective only when Air India accepted them and issued them NOC, allowing them to exit. Around 40 pilots had moved the high court after Air India refused to accept the withdrawal of their resignations. Air India has challenged the June 1 order of the single judge, which had also ordered that back wages would have to be paid to the reinstated pilots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-upholds-earlier-order-to-reinstate-air-india-pilots/articleshow/88349131.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: After pandemic blow, poll business boost for Burrabazar trade hub||KOLKATA: In the run-up to Christmas, bulk orders for party flags, masks, T-shirts and caps have boosted the business of a section of traders at Old China Bazaar in Burrabazar before the civic poll in the city on December 19. This is helping them recover from the losses incurred due to the pandemic-induced restrictions and the cracker ban during Diwali. The traders at Burrabazar said that the cracker ban had hit them badly for the last two years but the situation took a turn for the worse this time with low key festivities due to the restrictions imposed to tackle the second wave of the pandemic. The civic election has shot up the demand of the poll merchandise at a time when the Covid restrictions have been eased and the business sectors of the city are swinging back to pre-pandemic activities. “During the assembly election the second wave of the pandemic was at its peak and this also resulted in low key festivities in the city. Diwali was very bad due to the cracker ban and we could not open our shops. With the Covid situation being under control and a high-octane political campaign going on for the election, sales have hit a two-year high,” said Mahinder Kumar Gupta, one of the traders at Old China Bazaar. “The cracker industry is going through a tough phase and the pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to our business. Since we started stocking up on the poll merchandise, it has turned the tide in our favour. By selling party flags only, we are recovering from the loss that we had suffered during Diwali this year,” said Kunal Agarwal, manager of AK Paul Stores. Apart from party flags and party symbols, T-shirts, saris, masks, printed cellphone covers, bike and car sticker magnets have also jacked up the business of the traders. “The sale of poll merchandise started picking up a pace since the Bhowanipore bypoll while it has reached a new high before the civic election. With more civic elections being lined up at Bidhannagar, Howrah and other areas in the coming months, we hope for better business in this financial year,” said Prasanta Dutta, another trader at Burrabazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-pandemic-blow-poll-biz-boost-for-burrabazar-trade-hub/articleshow/88348410.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The report dated August 18, 2021, also said, “It is important to note that during this entire timespan of Pegasus attacks and infection of Mr. Wilson’s iPhone 6s, the attacker identified in Arsenal Reports I, II, and III was using the NetWire RAT (Remote Access Trojan) on Mr. Wilson’s computer for purposes of both surveillance and incriminating document delivery.” There are 16 accused in the Elgar case which is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). The chargesheet against the accused has invoked the anti-terror law, Unlawful Acivities (prevention) Act (UAPA) against them. Wilson, who after the first report had petitioned the HC to quash the prosecution against him, had cited the US forensic report to contend that he and other accused are being “framed by somebody’’ as his digital device had been compromised. The NIA in response to Wilson’s quashing petition had said that his entire petition, however, never mentioned who was trying to frame him, “if at all it has even happened,” and hence the allegation was “vague” and cannot be considered at this stage. Earlier in June, over four months after its first cyber forensic report on an alleged malware attack on Wilson’s laptop was released, the US-based consultant had said the computer of co-accused Surendra Gadling was similarly “compromised”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pegasus-on-elgar-accuseds-phone-says-forensic-lab-report/articleshow/88348442.cms||---

Assistant inspector Yogesh Gaikwad said, “One of the shops has CCTV surveillance and three men are seen moving in the area at 4.15am.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: A hotspot on development map||Once a ‘BIMARU’ state in the 1980s, Uttar Pradesh has come a long way and now boasts of some of the best infrastructure in the country, the swankiest malls, foreign investment, IT companies and a new, upcoming defence manufacturing hub. With a population of about 24 crore, had UP been a country, it would have been the fifth largest in the world. While that comes with its own logistical problems, the sheer number of people, combined with investment friendly policies, opens up not just one of the biggest markets for companies but also has a ready supply of manpower. UP has come to be recognised as an important state for investments, business and tourism, supported not just by the existing natural resources, its fertile land, local art, craft and culture, but an investment friendly environment that has seen the state pocket some of the most enviable projects in recent years. The right policies and support by the government may well see the state emerge as the next big destination for business and leisure. Successive governments have developed parts of the state with the emphasis for the longest time on western UP. The current BJP dispensation, keen to project development as a cornerstone of its regime, has focussed on construction of expressways and airports, many of which are still under construction. Several policy changes have propelled UP to the second position among states in ease of doing business rankings. With that has come investments of thousands of crores. As UP becomes a favourite spot for the film industry, a Film City has been proposed near the upcoming Noida International Airport. Samsung has opened up its biggest display unit production in Noida while several foreign companies are making a beeline for the state, attracted by the government’s promises of improved law and order, a pro-active industrial development department and better connectivity. In the coming years, UP is expecting an exponential growth in the hospitality sector, especially with the government’s focus on developing religious tourism. A look at some of the reasons that could push UP into emerging as the cultural and economic hub of the country: Ease of Doing BusinessUttar Pradesh jumped 12 positions since 2017 to settle at the second spot in ease of doing business in the country. The remarkable change has come about due to about 500 reforms over multiple sectors and departments to simplify processes, bring systems online, review laws and policies and enact labour reforms, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Among a major change implemented by the government was the introduction of a single window online clearance system, called Nivesh Mitra. It provides the facility for digital clearances to start and operate a business in the state. Currently, more than 340 services of 27 departments are being provided through its online platform. It has been developed as a complete end-to-end online system eliminating the requirement of any human interface between applicants and departments. So far, Nivesh Mitra had received 4.9 lakh applications from entrepreneurs, of which 4.7 lakh applications have been disposed. The portal has now been integrated with a similar initiative launched by the central government, MAADHYAM, a national single window for foreign investors. Under a mandate by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade and the Ministry of Finance, UP has also implemented the District Reform Action plan. “Due to this, the state has received Rs 4,851 crore as additional borrowing on completion of reforms facilitating ease of doing business and ensuring additional borrowing of 2% of GDSP to the state,” said an official. The reforms were implemented in over 25 departments including agriculture, food & civil supply, medical health & family welfare, geology & mines, and entertainment tax. A dedicated agency, ‘Invest UP’ is also in place to provide handholding to investors. Policy InterventionsIn an effort to promote certain sectors by giving concessions and subsidies, UP government has come out with 20 sector-wise policies. Formulated over the past four years, many of them underwent a change after the first wave of Covid-19 in order to suit the changing industrial environment and to attract foreign investment that was moving out of China. The first policy released was the Industrial Investment & Employment Promotion Policy (IIEPP) in 2017. Subsequently, other policies that were issued included Warehousing & Logistics Policy 2018, Aerospace & Defence Policy 2019, IT Policy, Electronics Policy 2017 etc. These policies, aimed at promoting specific sectors, offer incentives like land subsidy, capital subsidy, interest subsidies, concessions for investment in Bundelkhand and Purvanchal among others. Under the IIEPP policy, the state government received investment applications of Rs 13,918 crore. The new Electronics Policy saw investment of Rs Rs 1,200 crore, Rs 2,475 crore and Rs 10 crore under the old and new Startup Policy respectively, Rs 607 crore under the Logistics Policy and Rs 1,404.33 crore under the Defence Policy. Post Covid-19, facing a very different investment environment, the government first tweaked existing policies and then brought out some new ones. A Data Centre Policy was launched to attract investments worth Rs 20,000 crore. The Startup policy 2020 was launched to promote non-IT based start-ups. Religious TourismWith the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the government is keenly pushing religious tourism in a big way in UP. Besides drawing up plans to develop new religious sites, it is also focussed on developing existing pilgrimage sites by improving infrastructure, making available tourism amenities, focussing on sanitation at such places etc. In November, PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kushinagar airport, which will provide a significant boost to Buddhist tourism in the area. “The expected influx of tourists leads to construction of hotels, development of more tourist activities, generation of local employment and improvement in economy. There is a huge scope for investment in the hospitality sector in UP at the moment,” said a senior official of the tourism department. Work, said the official, has been taking place over the past four years to develop religious sites like Lord Ram's ‘Taposthali’ in Chitrakoot, Naimisharanya, and the Shakti Peetha at Vindhyachal. Sites associated with specific belief or religion are being developed as circuits, linked with expressways or airports, like the Ramayana circuit, Braj circuit, Mahabharat circuit, Jain circuit and Buddhist circuit. “It has become easier to market such circuits as packages relevant to these can now be drawn up,” said a tour agent. Premises of temples are being renovated and redeveloped with proper roads and parking facilities. Defence Corridor UP boasts of one of the only two defence corridor projects sanctioned in the country. The corridor will connect Bundelkhand with west UP, drawing in strength from the state’s massive micro, small and medium industries which are being sought to work as ancillary units and the existing ordnance factories. The corridor will have six nodes, based on manufacturing hotspots. These are Aligarh, Agra, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Kanpur and Lucknow. The entire land parcel in the Aligarh node has been allocated to 19 companies and work has commenced there for creation of infrastructural facilities. “UP is expecting generation of around 2.5 lakh employment opportunities and a total investment of about Rs 50,000 crore,” said Awanish Awasthi, CEO of the UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority. The corridor has been planned over 5,000 hectare, of which 1,445 hectare has been acquired. IIT- Kanpur has been appointed as the Technology Partner. Around 37 MoUs have already been inked for investment in the corridor. Where the Aligarh node will see manufacturing of small weapons, ammunition, aerospace metal components, anti-drone system and defence packaging, a Rs 300 crore investment has been proposed for Lucknow under which BrahmosNG missiles will be manufactured in this node. Another MoU has been signed with Bharat Dynamics Ltd for an investment of Rs 400 crore to establish a missile propulsion system factory at Jhansi. ConnectivityUP can currently claim to have the longest length of functional and under construction expressways in the country. The Purvanchal Expressway was recently inaugurated by PM Narendra Modi and the Bundelkhand Expressway is likely to be ready by the year-end, well in time to be inaugurated before the code of conduct comes into place. An international airport in Kushinagar was also inaugurated recently while the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Noida Airport was held on November 25. The 341-km long Purvanchal Expressway connects major eastern exporting hubs like Ghazipur, Azamgarh, Amethi, Sultanpur to Lucknow. An airstrip has been developed on the expressway in Sultanpur for emergency landing by Air Force aircraft. The 296-km long Bundelkhand Expressway will connect districts like Chitrakoot, Banda, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah to the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and provide rapid connectivity to the Bundelkhand region. The Gorakhpur Link Expressway will connect major exporting hubs in and around Gorakhpur to the Purvanchal Expressway and eventually to Lucknow. The project is slated for completion by December, 2023. The 594-km long Ganga Expressway, touted to be the longest in the country, will connect eastern UP with western UP, covering districts like Meerut, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Rae Bareli, Pratapgarh and Prayagraj. An airstrip at Shahjahanpur has been proposed for emergency landing of combat aircraft. UP also boasts of an inland waterway which will eventually connect Prayagraj with Haldia in West Bengal. The Haldia-Varanasi tract of the waterway has already been inaugurated. Meanwhile, the government is also focussing on development of airports with the aim of improving regional connectivity. At present, UP has eight operational airports, while 13 airports and 7 airstrips are being developed. The operational airports handling commercial flights are Lucknow, Varanasi, Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Agra, Kanpur, Prayagraj and Hindon. One airport is coming up in Noida and another has been planned for Ayodhya. In addition, more than 25 domestic routes are being developed under the Regional Connectivity scheme which includes cities like Agra, Kanpur, Aligarh, Bareilly, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-a-hotspot-on-development-map/articleshow/88349130.cms||---

The incident took place near Mallipattinam in Thanjavur district. Police have arrested three people including a woman and a sorcerer. According to police, the accused have been identified as A Sharmila Begum, 48, her husband Azarudeen, 50, of Mallipattinam, and Mohammed Saleem, 48, a sorcerer of Krishnajipattinam in Pudukottai district. Nazrudeen, 32, and N Shahila, 24, of Mallipattinam had 5-year-old son Raja Mohammed and a 6-month-old daughter Hajarah. On December 15, the body of Hajarah was found floating in a water tub in the backyard of their house. Without informing the police, the relatives had buried the body in a graveyard at Mallipattinam. During interrogation, it came to light that Shahila’s aunt Begum had killed the baby by drowning her in the water-filled tub, police said. Both Azarudeen and Begum had returned from abroad recently. However, since the day they returned to Mallipattinam, Azarudeen’s health condition was bad. Sharmila met Saleem, a sorcerer from Pudukottai, and sought a remedy. As per Saleem’s instruction, Begum sacrificed a goat and chickens. However, his condition did not improve. Begum took away the baby from Sahila's house and allegedly drowned in the water tub, police said quoting her. VAO Thangamuthu informed Sethubavachathiram police, who in turn informed higher officials and revenue officials. Following this, the Sethubavachathiram police registered a case and arrested Begum, Azarudeen, and Saleem. The body of the baby was exhumed and a postmortem was performed in front of Pattukottai tahsildar Ganeshwaran, DSPs Sengamalakannan and Rajkumar in Pattukottai. The three accused have been booked under IPC section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 302 (punishment for murder), inspector Annadurai (in-charge of Sethubavachathiram station) said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/baby-killed-by-kin-in-human-sacrifice/articleshow/88348426.cms||---
---||Kolkata||From ‘old Gorkha station’ to the Queen of the Hills||KOLKATA: Darjeeling had a pull factor because it allowed land losers of different tribal ethnic groups to settle down there before the East India Company took control of the area and gradually transformed it into the ‘Queen of Hill Stations’. The Company got itself involved in the economic and political affairs of eastern Himalayan region that was gradually opening up as a strategic frontier to move towards Tibet, Central Asia and probably to China with tea grown in the Hills, fuelling the move. This led to the emergence of Darjeeling, said historian Subhas Ranjan Chakraborty, who delivered a lecture on Friday. There was a time when the place was nothing more than an “old Gorkha station of Dorjeling” as was mentioned in the 1829 records of Captains Lloyd and Grant, two East India Company officers, who had been sent up there to assess the situation much after Nepal was defeated and annexed to Sikkim in 1814, the historian said. In 1865, the British defeated Bhutan and even Kalimpong and Dooars were added to Darjeeling. “Their ethnic tribal identities melted away and they became part of one large Nepali community. The literate population increased and the Nepali elite emerged, conscious and proud of their language and culture. This was when Darjeeling saw its indigenous people demand a special status for themselves, saying they were unique and different from people of the plains,” he said, while delivering the annual Sudeb Roychowdhury Memorial Lecture, instituted in memory of the late journalist. In 1835, the subdivisions of Darjeeling and Kurseong were transferred to the British by the Sikkim king and thus began the journey of shaping of Darjeeling under the British, said the hostrian. Dr Campbell, a British resident of Nepal, was transferred to Darjeeling in 1839 to start a sanatorium for injured soldiers and to attract settlers. The idea was also to get educated people from the plains and the British to go up in search of trade and commerce since setting up tea plantations became a priority. The population grew in the next 10 years from 100 to 10,000 in Darjeeling, changing into a summer house for British. “The 100 people belonged to Nepali and Bhutia origins. Once the British started developing the place, it became a Gorkha recruiting depot and the 1840s saw the start of Gorkha Regiment,” said Chakraborty, who taught in Darjeeling Government College for 10 years before joining Presidency. Even tea garden workers became aware of their rights. People, like Gandhian Dal Bahadur Giri and Helen Lepcha, gave leadership to people’s thoughts and rights. The struggle for identity is not over for the hill men, Chakraborty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-old-gorkha-station-to-the-queen-of-the-hills/articleshow/88348429.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Trichy||‘BJP is ready for urban local body poll’||Perambalur: The state president of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) K Annamalai has said that his party is prepared to face the urban local body election. Stating that civic grievances have increased due to the absence of the urban local body council for a long time, Annamalai sought for swift conduct of the pending election. Referring to the recent developments, Annamalai said, “DMK has selective amnesia, they forget the stand they took as an opposition. We want the urban local body election to be conducted as early as possible be it direct or indirect election for electing the chiefs of urban local bodies.” He added that the BJP and AIADMK coalition is strong and the two parties are on the same page in terms of the ideology. Reacting to a question on the status of reservation for vanniyars, he added his party still supports the internal reservation for vanniyars. “DMK, while starting the government, had followed duty, dignity and discipline. After seven months, it has changed to company, corruption and commission,” Annamalai added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bjp-is-ready-for-urban-local-body-poll/articleshow/88348447.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: As Covid-19 cases rise, need to crack the whip; imposition of fines below daily target||New Delhi: Despite the number of Covid-19 cases being on the rise again, enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour is below the target. Delhi reported a positivity rate of 0.15% and 85 new cases on Thursday, the highest in four months. Also, 10 new cases of Omicron were confirmed, taking the tally of the new variant to 20. These days, it’s common to find people not wearing masks in markets, malls and public places. The situation warrants immediate attention in the wake of Christmas and New Year’s celebrations when the streets would be crowded. Delhi government has deployed 149 enforcement teams across the 11 districts to keep a watch in crowded places, identify people violating the norms and fine them Rs 2,000. The teams visit markets, interstate bus terminals, mandis, malls, railway stations and other places. A report accessed by TOI mentioned that nine enforcement teams deployed in North district fined 738 people for violations on Thursday, while 45 people were fined in South district. In all, 280 cases of protocol violations were reported in Central district, 606 in East, 241 in New Delhi, 275 in North East, 250 in North West, 461 in Shahdara, 112 in South East, 504 in South West and 464 in West. Each district has a target of 1,000 fines for violations. As there are 10 or more enforcement teams, if each fines 100 people daily the target would be met easily. A visit to any mall, railway station, market or public place is enough to see Covid protocols being violated on a large scale. With more Omicron cases being reported, carelessness of people and slackness by the authorities could aggravate the spread of the virus. An official said enforcement teams were active, but they had their limitations. “The moment a team arrives at any location, people realise that challans are being issued and everyone becomes alert. People not using masks immediately put them on, while those wearing them improperly put them in place,” added the official. The teams usually have a revenue department official accompanying civil defence volunteers. A South district official said the number of teams would be increased before the festive period and vigilance would also increase. Delhi Disaster Management Authority has extended the restrictions on all social, cultural, entertainment and other gatherings till January 1. This means Christmas and New Year’s celebrations would be restricted. All district authorities concerned have been asked to ensure enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, regular hand washing and use of sanitisers. The DMs and DCPs have been asked to deploy a sufficient number of teams to keep a vigil in public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-cases-rise-need-to-crack-the-whip/articleshow/88349165.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Aurangabad||Youth held on charge of killing engineering student in Aurangabad||AURANGABAD: Within 24 hours of the murder of an engineering student, the crime branch of the Aurangabad city police has nabbed a 21-year old hotel management student. The police found the body of Krushna Jadhav (22) on Thursday afternoon in Himayat Bagh area of the city. The arrested suspect has been identified as Anand Tekale of neighbouring Jalna district. Police investigation has revealed that the suspect and the deceased were friends. Crime branch inspector Avinash Aghav told TOI, “Jadhav met Tekale on Wednesday and asked for Rs 6000, which he had given to Tekale. This resulted into an argument.” Aghav said Tekale has alleged that Jadhav was carrying a sharp-edged weapon and tried to attack him. “He claimed he snatched the weapon and attacked Krushna multiple times, before slitting his throat and disfiguring his face,” he said. Begumpura police inspector Prashant Potdar said Jadhav was carrying his elder sister’s phone with him. “When he did not return home till late, his father tried calling but found it to be switched off. Fearing worst, his father lodged a missing complaint with area police station,” Potdar said. The sister and father used a tracking application on the phone and reached Himayat Bagh and found him lying dead. Police said that Tekale has confessed to have killed his friend over the monetary dispute and also told the police that he fled the spot soon after murdering him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/youth-held-on-charge-of-killing-engg-student/articleshow/88346764.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kolkata||Kolkata MC elections: Horse carriages, dancers, palkis add innovation to last-day rallies||KOLKATA: Processions on horse carriages, palki, drummers, sound boxes and professional dancers on the road: the atmosphere in the city turned carnivalesque on Friday as candidates across party lines made every effort to drum up support before the EC-approved poll deadline for campaign set in at 5pm on Friday, two days before the KMC elections are held on Sunday. Trinamool general secretary Abhishek Banerjee held the largest rally as he, along with senior leaders and south Kolkata MLAs, travelled on a openhood caravan, campaigning from Ballygunge Phari to Kalighat, through Bhowanipore, Hazra Road, Sarat Bose Road and Harish Mukherjee Road across wards 69, 70, 72, 85, 86 and 73. Even as hundreds of party supporters walked along with them, multiple drones were deployed to share live footage on multiple social media platforms. Banerjee was also seen showering flower petals on the rallyists walking along lanes and bylanes of the six wards. “We have fulfilled every promise, we made before the election. We promise to serve you even better over the coming years,” said Banerjee from atop the caravan. Trinamool MLA Madan Mitra was innovative, to say the least, when it came to his colourful procession with footballs and palki outside the KMC headquarters in Esplanade. There, he released a theme song for the KMC elections—‘Khelar gaan’—as he pleaded citizens to cast their votes for Trinamool. Ward 88 Trinamool candidate MP Mala Roy took out a star-studded rally with actors and MLAs Soham Chakraborty, Lovely Maitra and June Malia. She travelled by an open-jeep through Pratapaditya Road and other places, with hundreds of supporters trailing her. “Didi doesn’t need a star campaigner. She is the biggest star here. We are here to merely show our support for her,” said Midnapore MLA Malia. In north Kolkata, veteran Trinamool leader and Ward 31 candidate Paresh Pal stood out among his peers as he took out a roadshow with 15 horse carriages and drummers playing dhak, dhamsa and madol on tableaux, highlighting Pal’s achievements and future plans. Popular party songs, like ‘khela hobe’ and ‘Delhi jabe hawai choti’ played out. Similar rallies were taken out by Firhad Hakim and Debasis Kumar in south Kolkata with drummers and dancers. “The campaigns are so colourful and full of pomp, I mistook it for a victory rally for a moment,” said a motorist stuck in a jam on Rasbehari Avenue as traffic crawled behind Kumar’s rally. Some BJP and Left processions were equally vibrant with state opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari leading a colourful rally in support of Ward 50 candidate Sajal Ghosh. BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar led another such procession for Ward 23 candidate and two-time councillor Bijoy Ojha. “It will be a hattrick for Ojha this time and we hope to open our account in multiple wards,” said Majumdar. CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty led a large rally from Garia to Bagha Jatin with Left candidates of wards 101, 102 and 110. “We have the best grassroot connection in this area and I am confident people will vote for us,” said Chalraborty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/horse-carriages-dancers-palkis-add-innovation-to-last-day-rallies/articleshow/88348437.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Pune||Omicron cases may surge, new wave unlikely: Experts||PUNE: The state’s Covid task force members on Friday said there was a possibility of Omicron cases increasing in the next two to three months though there might not be a wave, stressing on maintaining a close vigil on any cluster outbreaks. “The way ahead is to ensure strict Covid-appropriate behaviour and scaling up vaccination, besides proper ventilation. Avoid crowding in closed places,” said one of the task force member, adding that proper screening of international travellers should continue. On Wednesday, the public health department in its presentation had stated that there was a possibility of a surge in cases in the next two to three months. State health minister Rajesh Tope told TOI that the task force members had indicated a surge in the coming two to three months. So, there was a need to be cautious, follow the protocols and increase vaccination, he said. State task force Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “We may not see a wave as was witnessed earlier but we have to be on guard for any cluster outbreaks. The state should ensure a strict watch is kept on any spike in cases in any clusters, especially in the coming two-three months. As of now, cases are sporadic and travel-related only. There is no community transmission yet.” He said, “Due care has to be taken to follow the Covid protocols since this is the season of festivities and weddings. Moreover, the winter season is conducive to viral spread. Avoiding closed places and ensuring good ventilated space should be followed by all. Citizens must ensure proper masking and vaccination has to be scaled up. We need to vaccinate the 15% remaining population in the country and ensure those with first dose take their second dose. Senior citizens need to stay protected. People should get themselves tested in case of any symptoms,” he said. The task force members observed that the current sporadic Omicron cases did not become a cluster transmission yet in India, as had been seen in countries like the UK, Denmark, South Africa or Norway. They said it had to be watched closely if Omicron would replace Delta as the dominant strain in India. People should avoid unnecessary travel and gatherings because a clear picture of the new variant regarding its transmissibility and severity was yet to emerge and would take at least two months, they added. Dr Rahul Pandit, another state task force member, said following Covid-appropriate behaviour and ensuring good ventilation strategies, along with vaccination, would be crucial to prevent any surge in numbers. “We should be cautious and vigilant, besides being prepared with health infrastructure and scaling up vaccination,” he said. One should not ignore any symptoms and travel history should be shared correctly, said the task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/omicron-cases-may-surge-new-wave-unlikely-experts/articleshow/88348474.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Dementia-hit woman’s daughters appointed guardians||MUMBAI: Appointing the daughters of a Colaba woman with advanced dementia as her legal guardians and managers of her person and properties, the Bombay high court refused to direct them to go before statutory authorities as urged by the state. “But when her three children are agreed on a course of action, should the writ court decline the petition and refuse relief only because there exists a competent authority established by statute? We do not believe that is the state of the law,” said Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar on December 13. The mother (84) has been in a Navi Mumbai hospice from February 2019. Her daughters’ petition said in 2017, their mother, a financially independent businesswoman, found it increasingly difficult to attend to her day-to-day affairs and her condition steadily deteriorated. In 2018, her three children were advised to admit her to the facility for better treatment, care and safety. A bank, with whom she has substantial savings and term deposit accounts, initially released payments for medical expenses but later did not. TimesViewThe high court has correctly taken a humane approach by appointing the daughters of a senior citizen suffering from advanced dementia as her legal guardians. The state unnecessarily tried to create obstacles by asking her children to approach a statutory body, forcing them to move the court. Government agencies must take a compassionate view in such cases.They daughters moved HC and their brother in London also supported the petition. They sought relief to operate her bank accounts for payment of her expenses, debts and liabilities, including tax payments, medical expenses, co-operative society dues, utility bills etc. But the state opposed the petition, saying there is an alternate remedy and they must go before the authority/committee under the Mental Health Act, 2017, Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 and National Welfare Trust Act, 1999.“ We do not believe the hands of the writ court in a matter such as this are necessarily constrained by the provisions of a statute or the existence of a statutory body. That approach, commended by the state government, may have been preferable had such an application being brought by an outsider, that is to say, someone outside the immediate family, and it might have been prudent in those circumstances,” said the judges. They referred to doctrine of parens patriae that a constitutional court may invoke “in exceptional cases where the subject of the petition is not mentally or physically capable (or is of a very young age) and where there is no other parent or legal guardian.” They mentioned recent cases where the doctrine was invoked while appointing legal guardians. They noted an August 2021 report by the HC-appointed JJ panel that concluded the mother “suffers from advanced dementia, needs assistance in her day-to-day activities.” The judges then allowed the petition subject to certain safeguards. They directed appointment of daughters as legal guardians “presently and until further orders.” They directed banks and all statutory authorities “to recognise and acknowledge petitioners’ rights and authority to represent their mother.” The judges will monitor the mother’s condition and take updates. They permitted the daughters to let out their mother’s Colaba flat and garage on a leave and license basis and use the income towards meeting the mother’s expenses and outgoings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dementia-hit-womans-daughters-appointed-guardians/articleshow/88348483.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Delhi: Six months on, corporations’ broadband scheme lags||NEW DELHI: Over six months ago, the three municipal corporations had launched the Wi-Fi scheme to provide affordable internet services in every nook and corner of the city. They had also selected hotspot locations in several wards, but not even 50% of these sites are currently operational. The corporations aimed to provide broadband services through 4,620 public data offices (PDOs) and had identified 2,554 sites, but so far only 1,434 have been made operational. In south Delhi, 20 connections were planned in each ward when the scheme was launched by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) in March. “The councillors were supposed to identify the PDOs and select the aggregators registered on SDMC’s official website. We identified 998 locations, got services established at 518 and made a one-month payment to 395 PDOs till July,” said an SDMC official. SDMC was supposed to pay for the device and one month of data to the PDOs, which is why a limited number of centres were being installed. “The idea was to help PDOs, who were local shopkeepers or residents, with the initial investment so that they could continue with the business easily in future. We installed service centres in limited numbers because we wanted to see the response first. After July, stress was given on popularising these centres. Considering limitations, like a 50-metre range for each device and connection to a limited number of people at a time, the concept is yet to be used widely,” said the official. On Tuesday, the deliberative wing of SDMC raised the matter in the standing committee meeting wherein councillors complained that despite sharing details of prospective PDOs, there was no response from the department. “Most councillors have shared the list and the project has been implemented in some wards. But the officials have cited financial constraints and the aggregators responsible for providing broadband services to PDOs not doing the task diligently. We have not fixed any deadline, but are trying our level best to get it implemented soon,” said Col BK Oberoi (Retd), chairman, standing committee. Compared with other internet providers, the PDOs are extremely cost-effective as residents can get a connection at Rs 50 per month, Rs 25 per week or Rs 5 per day. “Each PDO can provide Wi-Fi to only 25-50 people at a time. Still, we are taking the help of councillors to identify more points to establish them,” said an East Delhi Municipal Corporation official. The corporation has not yet set up a single centre out of the targeted 640 after launching the scheme in May. A north corporation official said they had set up 916 centres out of the 1,900 identified since the scheme was launched. “Due to a delay in payment, the civic body could not take the project ahead. Also, some locations had to be changed, but we are working to meet the target,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6-months-on-corporations-broadband-scheme-lags/articleshow/88349186.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nagpur||AICTE panel recommends moratorium on extension on new engg colleges||Nagpur: The AICTE panel has recommended to extend the moratorium on opening of new engineering colleges for two more years with a view to improve quality of education. Already, new colleges have not been allowed to open for the last two years on account of ever-growing seat vacancies. “The panel has submitted its report and it is under consideration. Due to mushrooming of colleges in the past, engineering seats increased by leaps and bounds. All these were opened without taking into account requirement of the industry. As against the requirement of 8-10 lakh engineers, over 20 lakh seats were available. It adversely affected quality of education and the students’ employability,” AICTE chairman Anil Sahastrabudhe said. Speaking on the sidelines of AICTE stakeholders’ meeting at Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management on Friday, he pointed out that even after a two-year moratorium, seat vacancy was at 45%, which was marginally better as compared to 50% of the last academic session. “The situation is slowly stabilising. For creating employability of engineers, we have offered several new branches like artificial intelligence, internet of things, machine learning, robotics, drone technology and blockchain learning. We have also made it mandatory for all students to undergo six-month training in various companies so that they could get hands-on experience and will be job ready when they pass out,” he said. Speaking on National Education Policy (NEP), the former director of College of Engineering, Pune (COEP), said it would be implemented in phases. “There are challenges in implementing it. One of them is to increase the gross enrolment ratio (GER), which is at 27% currently, to 50%. We have come a long way from 0.7% GER since Independence to 27% in 75 years. We aim to double GER in 15 years. It would be possible only through the use of technology and opting distance and online learning modes. There is a need to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach and judicious use of blended learning,” he said. Declaring that engineering courses were launched in six regional languages, as per NEP recommendations, the former IIT-Guwahati professor said about 19 colleges India had started them from 2021-22 session. “These are offered in six languages, including Marathi and Hindi, and are spread in ten states. Existing colleges having requisite infrastructure were allowed to start them. The same faculty would teach the students. Before Independence, engineering degrees used to be offered in Urdu in some parts. Late prof VM Domkundwar, who studied in Urdu, had penned many books on engineering subjects. We are also exploring the possibility of dubbing the experts’ lectures in regional languages,” Sahastrabudhe added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/aicte-panel-recommends-moratorium-on-extension-on-new-engg-colleges/articleshow/88348500.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nashik||Ajit Pawarwants SEC to defer polls by three months||Nashik: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the MVA government was committed to completing the process of deciding the quota of reserved seats for Other Backward Classes (OBC) in the local bodies within three months and has written to the state election commission to defer the local body elections for a few months. Talking to the reporters in Jalgaon on Friday, Pawar said that the state government would work to resolve the issue of the reservation for OBC in the polls by that time. “Our government has requested the commission to hold the polls in April-May,” he said. Maintaining that the MVA government was ‘committed’ to ensure proper reservation for the OBC community, Pawar said that the OBC population in the state is around 54%. Responding to questions, the deputy CM said that the state cabinet in its recent meeting decided to carry out a census of OBC population, which will be completed within the next three months. The state commission for Backward Classes would be undertaking this exercise. “Hence the polls can be held after the survey is complete. We have conveyed our plans in writing to the commission on the issue,” he added. The Supreme Court has recently held that OBC reservation cannot be granted because the state has failed to fulfil the ‘triple test’ criteria, including collecting data on OBCs. The SC has directed the state election commission to convert the 27% reserved seats into general category ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ajit-pawarwants-sec-to-defer-polls-by-three-months/articleshow/88346854.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Kolkata||Calcutta high court again rejects central force plea, BJP rushes to Supreme Court||KOLKATA: Calcutta high court on Friday declined the BJP appeal prayer seeking central forces for the Kolkata civic polls on Sunday, a day after Justice Rajasekhar Mantha didn’t accede to the BJP petition. A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj didn’t find “sufficient material” in the BJP appeal petition “which furnishes the ground for deployment of central paramilitary forces in the forthcoming Kolkata elections.” The BJP moved the Supreme Court for urgent hearing Saturday, said BJP advocate on record Bikash Singh. The party had earlier filed a special leave petition in the apex court seeking central forces for the Kolkata civic polls. The SC had then directed the petitioner to take the plea to Calcutta HC. The HC bench, while noting that “no concrete incident of violence has been pointed out till now”, didn’t rule out the sense of fear among the appellants. It directed the State Election Commission and the state to “reconsider” the security arrangement plan and “strengthen deployment” in polling booths. The division bench passed the directive after advocate general S N Mookherji submitted that 18,000 of the total 27,000 Kolkata Police personnel and 5,000 of the 69,669 West Bengal Police personnel had already been deployed and some more could be provided on requisition. The court took note of the submission of the additional solicitor general over sending of central forces within six hours and directed the SEC to take an “appropriate decision” in consultation with the state authorities based on the ground situation. “A decision in this regard has to be taken by the state authorities concerned and the SEC keeping in view of the ground situation,” the bench observed. The court also directed the SEC to hold a meeting with the state over measures to build confidence among voters. It allowed the BJP appellant to submit suggestions over ways to hold free and fair elections. The Chief Justice held the SEC and the state accountable for holding free and fair polls and asked the authorities to file a compliance report on December 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hc-again-rejects-central-force-plea-bjp-rushes-to-sc/articleshow/88348506.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Pune||No major side-effects of 1st Indian mRNA shot at trials||PUNE: Trial investigators undertaking Phase 3 trials for HGCO19, India’s first mRNA vaccine against Covid-19, on Friday said almost 90% of volunteers have so far experienced no side-effects after receiving either one or two doses of the shot. HGCO19 is being developed by Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited. Dr Ashish Bavdekar , one of the principal investigators heading the vaccine trials at Pune’s KEM Hospital Research Center, told TOI that the Phase I data on HGCO19 immunogenicity was also very encouraging. He said, “Side-effects, which have been reported only in a minority of volunteers, were very mild and non-significant. At our site, we have not come across any post-vaccination side-effects from HGCO19 which one should be worried about. Quite a few volunteers have also reported no side-effects.” Dr Bavdekar said the minor side-effects reported among a few volunteers were mild fever or headache. After human trials for a vaccine were complete, he said, the safety and immunogenicity data were submitted to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for analysis and approval. He said, “Though the immunogenicity results are awaited, the Phase I trial data on HGCO19 immunogenicity have been encouraging. However, it is after the Phase III trials that the real picture will come out clearly, because the sample size was also much larger for this phase.” Dr Sidram K Raut, director of Noble Hospitals, Pune, one of the trial sites for HGCO19, told TOI that the Phase III trial was likely to be completed by around December 22. “We have not come across any major side-effects after HGCO19 administration. Only some cases of headache and mild fever have been reported, which do not last for more than 24-48 hours. Over 90% of volunteers have experienced no side-effects after HGCO19 administration,” he said. Dr Prakash Shende, principal investigator of the HGCO19 vaccine trial at the Dr D Y Patil Hospital, Pimpri, told TOI, “We have recruited over 40 participants for the Phase III trial. We have received enough safety data on the vaccine after the first two phases, hence almost 4,000 participants were enrolled for the Phase III trials.Many of the Phase III volunteers at our site have completed their second doses of the vaccine. The follow-up will last for a year.” He said, “As far as the Phase 1 and II trial was concerned, side effects were very minor. They included injection site pain, a couple of volunteers reporting allergy-like rash at the injection site, body ache and mild fever. These side effects were auto-recoverable in some patients while the rest could get easily treated by medication. Most participants have reported no side effects.” Dr Shende said as per the regular meetings between various trial sites, there have not been any reports of myocarditis after HGCO19 administration, as was reported after the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 mRNA vaccine recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-major-side-effects-of-1st-indian-mrna-shot-at-trials/articleshow/88348514.cms||Neha Madaan

Additional sessions judge had, on December 4, directed the Maharashtra skill development minister to appear before the court. “Only non-applicant — Nawab Malik — was not required to be noticed or heard, since at this stage the alleged accused has no right of hearing. It is not necessary to make an elaborate reference to the allegations in the application filed by Wankhede,” said Justice Rohit Deo while issuing notice to the complainant to reply by January 14. Wankhede had prayed to the sessions court to direct Washim police to probe the complaint lodged by him on November 6 against Malik alleging commission of offence punishable under Section 3(1)(q)(r) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. According to him, after the NCB zonal director initiated action against certain celebrities, Malik indulged in levelling false accusations against him, through press conferences and otherwise in public domain. The minister also alleged that Sameer Wankhede is Muslim by birth and that he procured false caste certificate to secure employment, said the complainant, adding his family was targeted by Malik, intentionally and deliberately, as Sameer Wankhede had arrested his son-in-law. Malik’s counsel JB Gandhi contended that the notice was grossly illegal and the application under CrPC’s Section 156 (3) does not make out a case for issuance of direction to investigate. Moreover, the court at Washim has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the application, said the counsel. He said since the station in-charge at Washim police station is not a party, Malik has been unnecessarily impleaded as the sole non-applicant. Gandhi said the proceedings are an abuse of the process of law and the only intent is to harass his client to get cheap publicity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-stays-washim-court-summons-to-nawab-malik/articleshow/88348512.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana granted the relief to Pawan on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with two sureties of like amount. Pawan’s counsel had argued that he was aged about 19 years and has been falsely implicated in the matter. He had further said that he was languishing in prison since July and the chargesheet has been filed and no fruitful purpose would be served by keeping him behind bars. Additional public prosecutor, appearing for police, opposed the bail application, arguing that in order to resist their arrest, the accused — along with his associate Manjeet Singh — had allegedly fired indiscriminately at the cops.

The total strength of the force is 250 personnel, and it will function round the clock, all through the year. The pink force, which will concentrate its operations along coastal areas, will initially operate at 11 police stations, and then cover all. It will be helped by local police stations, and if someone is to be arrested, the force will hand over the person to the local police. Sawant said that Goa has become the first state to introduce such a force. “The pink force will work for tourists coming to the state, its personnel have been given expert training in counselling and how to act,” he said, adding that it will work to reduce crime and increase detection. DGP I D Shukla said that if any woman calls the police control room, the pink force will reach the spot within five minutes and detain the accused. The pink force, with its 11 vehicles, will patrol the state, especially along the coastal belt. He also said that if a women complains that she is being assaulted, needs medical help or has met with an accident, the pink force will arrive at her house and admit her to hospital. “The pink force will not be involved in investigation of crime, but act for prevention,” Shukla said. “This force is not only for women but will also look into issues concerning children and juveniles in conflict with law. The reason behind introducing the pink force is because khaki cannot provide solutions to all problems. The pink force is introduced so that mothers, children and others can openly talk to this force. When you understand a problem, then only you can solve it. If they don’t ‘tell’ their problem, it cannot be solved.” The DGP said that this force will work to keep the family intact and not file cases in every house. “Prevention is always better then cure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pink-cop-force-launched-to-focus-on-coast/articleshow/88348518.cms||---

The encouraging statistics have come to fore during the ongoing special summary revisions of the electoral rolls. As many as 23,273 persons have filed various forms during the ongoing summary revision of the voters’ list seeking transfer, deletion, modification and alterations. Even the police department is seeing the enrolment as a significant dent in support base for Maoists who in the past had issued serious threats to villagers against voting. The Maoists had also threatened villagers of cutting off their fingers if found to be inked. It was during a review in the mid-December that divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma urged Gadchiroli collector Sanjay Meena and his team to step up measures to finalize the voter’s list before the deadline of January 5. In a message sent to TOI, she said such robust numbers of new voters (17,136) in a district like Gadchiroli is reflecting a change towards positivity. Lavangare-Verma, who was in Gadchiroli for the review of the electoral roll revision and budgetary allocations and expenditures of District Planning Committee (DPC), has also instructed the district administration to step up Sveep (Systematic voters’ education and electoral participation) programmes. Meena said there are 6,116 voters in the age 18-19 age bracket who would be the first-time voters in the district. “The numbers are really encouraging in Gadchiroli,” said Meena who attributed the success to the strategy of holding voters enrolment camps at every taluka offices. “We approached colleges and other educational institutions and motivated students to get enrolled,” he said. DIG, Naxal range, Sandip Patil said police department has reached out to almost one lakh population in the district through various civic programmes like ‘Dadalora khidki’ or one window scheme to offer government schemes and benefits. “The efforts went a long way in bridging the communication gap between the benefactor and beneficiaries.

---||Coimbatore||Mother’s lover held for strangling and raping 14-year-old Class X girl||Coimbatore: A day after a Class X girl’s body was recovered from a garbage dumping site at Yamunai Nagar at Saravanampatti, the city police on Friday arrested her mother’s lover for murdering and raping her. E S Uma, city deputy commissioner of police (south range), said P Muthukumar, 44, a native of Tirunelveli district, had murdered the girl for gold ornaments on last Saturday (Dec 11). He had spread rumours that the girl, who was aged 14, had eloped with someone and taken away the gold ornaments with her. The officer said Muthukumar was residing in a rental house near Saravanampatti along with his wife and two children. “He was having an affair with the girl’s mother, who had separated from her husband around eight years ago. The woman had given her old gold ornaments weighing 2.5 sovereigns and Rs50,000 to him to buy new ornaments. Muthukumar had sold the gold and spent the amount. When the woman pestered him to return the gold ornaments, he agreed to do so soon.” On December 11, the officer said, Muthukumar went to the minor girl’s house when she was alone and asked her to call up her mother to convey that she has received the gold ornaments from him. And she did so. “He asked the girl to visit his house to collect the ornaments and left. When the girl went to his house around 11.30am, Muthukumar tried to rape her. As she attempted to escape, he smothered her with a pillow and then strangulated her with her shawl. Later, he raped her.” Muthukumar, the officer said, tied a rope round the girl’s neck, thighs and legs and wrapped the body in a blanket. “He kept it in a plastic sack and dumped amidst bushes, where the local residents dump garbage. Bad smell emanated from the area on Thursday and when checked, sanitary workers came across the body.” Uma said Muthukumar had accompanied the girl’s mother to Ramanathapuram all-woman police station on Monday to lodge a missing person complaint and joined her in searching her daughter. “When we held an inquiry with him, he said he had handed over the gold to the girl, who might have eloped with someone. Later, he created another story that the girl’s grandmother was in a relationship with a man and she had murdered the girl with that person’s help. Finally, he confessed to the rape and murder.

Last week, BJP’s Panaji MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monseratte charged PWD minister Deepak Pauskar of “selling engineer posts”, and said that the recruitment scam in the department was “worth at least Rs 70 crore”. Pauskar had dismissed the allegations. “A three-member committee has been formed to inquire into the matter,” Sawant said. “The committee consists of principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel, special secretary (vigilance) Ankita Anand and the director of vigilance.” Till the report is submitted, the recruitment process would be kept on hold.” Monserrate said that it would take time to conclude the inquiry, and the recruitment will be stuck as the code of conduct is to be imposed soon. “The inquiry cannot be completed in 10 days,” he said. Sawant said that the youth should trust the chief minister’s decision to order the inquiry. Reacting to Pauskar’s claim that Monserrate may be upset because his recommended names may not have figured in the final list, Monserrate said “Everyone gives recommendations. I (too) have given recommendations. Even (the other) 39 MLAs must have given recommendations, but that does not mean I have asked him to make one from zero.” “I have proof that people have paid the minister Rs 25-30 lakh for each engineer’s post, and the minister has sold the posts to the highest bidder. It is a Rs 70 crore scam. This is my direct charge and allegation,” Monseratte had told TOI. Ports minister Michael Lobo said that they are happy with the decision of the chief minister to order the inquiry. “The new government will decide now,” he said. Lobo said that the staff selection commission is necessary to stop allegations of job scams. “If I am a minister in the next government, it would be my priority to put a staff selection commission in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cm-orders-probe-into-pwd-job-scam-says-recruitments-on-hold/articleshow/88348528.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Sand mining: NGT suggests green compensation, penalty||Hyderabad: A joint committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal southern bench has recommended Rs 2.45 crore compensation and Rs 7 lakh penalty on the sand reach contractor for damaging the environment at river Godavari mouth situated between Andhra and Puducherry. Sunkara Swamy Naidu Welfare Organization, represented by president Sunkara Karthik had filed an application at the NGT, Southern Zone, regarding the illegal mining of sand from Godavari estuary at Yanam on the AP and Puducherry border. The Godavari river enters the sea at Yanam. The river mouth area is known as Vurudha Gowthami Godavari, a highly sensitive, and ecologically fragile area. There is drifting of sand and it flows back and forth into the sea four times a day. The petitioner alleged that indiscriminate, sand mining is being carried out at Yanam and in border areas of Andhra and Puducherry, without environment or other clearances from statutory authorities. Contractors are also involved in in-stream mining using huge machinery sand boats, and large number of trucks are being used for transport of such illegally mined sand, it was alleged. In 2020 January the committee submitted the report and indicated the areas where illegal sand mining was taking place. The NGT directed the committee to assess environmental compensation and to submit further report . The latest reports say that district survey report shall be prepared and the quantity of sand reserves shall be assessed. “Scientific methodology shall be adopted to assess the quantity of sand deposited in the reaches...Adequate number of CCTV Cameras shall be installed at prominent places in the reaches to curb any illegal sand removal,” the committee said. The committee further said, “Every reach shall maintain production & dispatch registers and vehicles registers. Actual quantity of sand extracted, dispatched shall be recorded in the registers. The vehicles carrying sand are to be fitted with vehicle tracking GPS devices to monitor their movement and stop illegal hoarding of sand and prevent black marketing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sand-mining-ngt-suggests-green-compensation-penalty/articleshow/88348526.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

TOI had earlier reported on how the debt recovery tribunal has ordered for an e-auction to be held, as the school defaulted on repaying a loan. After failing to repay the loan amount of Rs 2 crore, the principal and interest now stand at Rs 8 crore. “It is a very old and reputed school of Delhi where around 1,000 students study…your government claims to be doing pioneer work in education sector, which has prompted me to write this letter to you,” Kapoor said in the communication.  Kapoor further stated that the matter should be taken up with the tribunal to settle the “loan amount at minimal and give a soft long term loan of that amount to school. Or else, Delhi government may buy the school at a settled amount and allow the management to run it with government members on its board,” the letter read.

---||Delhi||Court shows leniency to ‘remorseful’ man who harboured riot accused||New Delhi: A Delhi court has sentenced a man convicted of harbouring an absconding accused, who had pointed a gun at a policeman during the northeast Delhi riots, to the period already undergone by him in judicial custody. The court said that convict Kaleem Ahmed has shown remorse and prayed for leniency. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat also imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 on Ahmed, who harboured accused Shahrukh Pathan. Ahmed was in custody from March 17, 2020, till September 7, 2021. Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, had sought a maximum punishment of three years to Ahmed in the case. The court noted that the role of the convict Kaleem Ahmed is not that of participation in the riots, but of harbouring the accused Shahrukh Pathan, who had absconded after the incident. “The status of the convict’s family — his father suffering from paralysis and there being nine dependents on him — is not disputed by the prosecution. The convict is stated to be the only one providing financial subsistence to the family. The court, indubitably,regards the action/conduct of the convict Kaleem Ahmed as reprehensible and indictable,” it said in its order. It also noted that the investigation and evidence collected by the Crime Branch, Delhi Police, is praiseworthy so far as the convict is concerned. “That might have led to a voluntary plea of guilt by the convict. Still, the court is conscious of the fact that convict has voluntarily pleaded guilty at the time of framing of charges,” it added. “Considering his family status, his whole individual position, the factum of his voluntary plea of guilt and the fact that his apparent act of contrition deserves to be taken at face value to give another chance to him to reform himself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-shows-leniency-to-remorseful-man-who-harboured-riot-accused/articleshow/88349192.cms||Usha Das

The police recovered over 110 gram of gold from him worth Rs 4.94 lakh, which he had accumulated in the five chain robberies in the Gangapur Road area over the past six months. The suspect has been identified as Vipul Patil Gangapur police arrested Patil on Wednesday. The suspect told the police he had committed five chain robberies in the Gangapur Road area. Before becoming a trainee gram sevak, he worked as a driver, so he knew all the lanes and by-lanes of the area. Patil said he had started some business and suffered a huge loss during the Covid outbreak. To cover the losses, he turned to chain robbery for the past six months, said senior police inspector Riyaz Shaikh of the Gangapur police station. He said, “The chain robber was arrested on a tip-off from a police mitra- one of the volunteers appointed for implementation of Covid restrictions during the peak Covid time last year. Since the volunteers are closely working with the police, we had shared the footage of the suspects of chain robberies caught in CCTV with them.” “On Wednesday, one of these volunteers spotted the suspect moving around on a scooter after which he immediately informed the police. The police started interrogating the suspect,” he said. Over two years ago, he was appointed as a trainee gram Seva, on compassionate grounds after his father’s death, who worked in zilla parishad. Currently, Patil gets a stipend of Rs 7,000. Whenever he got time off his work, he would he would commit chain robberies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chain-snatcher-arrested-by-cops-turns-out-to-be-trainee-gram-sevak/articleshow/88346887.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Additional superintendent of police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said Bhupendra Pandey, who worked at a private clinic, was arrested after his wife's brother called 'Dial 112', a helpline that provides quick response. Mishra added that Pandey's health deteriorated in police custody and he was rushed to the hospital, where he died during treatment. On the cause of his sudden illness, the ASP said, the man had possibly poisoned himself, adding that his death had nothing to do with his arrest. Crying foul, Pandey's kin blocked the Moradabad-Haridwar state highway and demanded action against police officials along with Pandey’s wife and her brother. It was only after police assured the protesters that an FIR would be registered and a fair probe would be conducted that the latter lifted the blockade. Mishra told TOI, “The victim would often beat up his wife and several complaints were lodged against him. When police detained him for questioning, he said that he had consumed poison much before his arrest. We have registered an FIR under the section of murder on the complaint of victim’s father against victim’s wife and brother-in-law. Arrests will be made once the probe is completed."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/detained-for-thrashing-wife-man-dies-in-police-custody-cops-say-poison-cause-of-death/articleshow/88347814.cms||---
---||Pune||Government disburses Rs 2 crore to districts to buy S-gene test kits||PUNE: The state public health department has disbursed over Rs 2 crore to districts to buy S-gene RT-PCR test kits, capable of detecting the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2. Confirming the development, Dr Ramaswami N, Maharashtra’s National Health Mission commissioner, told TOI, “Rs2.4 crore has been disbursed to the districts to buy the S-gene kits to identify the probable Omicron cases even before genome sequencing is carried out. We have allowed districts to buy nearly one lakh kits. Depending on the size of the districts, the number of kits that a district uses may vary from 3,000 to 4,000, so on and so forth.” He said that S-gene RT-PCR test kits could be used as a prior test to detect the variant, before probable Omicron samples were sent for genome sequencing, which was a time-consuming process. “Typically, the S-gene is missing in Omicron, which is also known as S-gene dropout.  These special kits can detect the S-gene dropout and be used at the local-level. In samples where the S-gene is missing, we can have a reasonable doubt that it could be Omicron,” he said. Dr Ramaswami said the testing kits would help in tracking and isolating Omicron patients faster. The probable samples of the new variant can then be sent for genome sequencing for confirmation. Another senior state health department official said, “Districts will use the kits in sites where cluster cases are being reported, as well as in case of international travellers.” Scientists said the way forward was to detect the variants at the same time as diagnostics — be it Delta or Omicron. This would help detect in real-time in case another variant emerged, they added. Compared with the usual RT-PCR kits, the imported ones with the SGTF strategy are quite expensive. At present, only one US-based company that has such kits operates in India. The bulk purchase of a standard RT-PCR kit costs the state government Rs19, including GST, per kit. The cost for a specialized RT-PCR kit is Rs240, including GST.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/government-disburses-rs-2cr-to-districts-to-buy-s-gene-test-kits/articleshow/88348535.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Mumbai||Judicial enquiry sought to clear Stan Swamy name, Jesuit image||Mumbai: Five months after the death of Jesuit priest and Elgar Parishad case accused Father Stan Swamy in hospital while in judicial custody, Fr Frazer Mascarenhas, as his ‘next of kin’ has petitioned the Bombay high court for a judicial enquiry into the death in custody and to remove the ‘odium of guilty’ attached to the deceased tribal rights activist and the shadow it “casts” on the Jesuits in India. Fr Swamy, who founded Bagaicha, an organisation for the upliftment of the adivasis in Jharkhand, was arrested nine months before his demise in October 2020 under the anti-terror law, but not kept for even a day in NIA custody. He spent the entire period in judicial custody at Taloja central jail. Fr Mascarenhas, 68, former principal of St Xavier's College, Mumbai, was appointed by the Jamshedpur Jesuit Province as per the Society of Jesus—the organisation to which Fr Swamy, 84 belonged—as his next of kin, on July 12, 2021. His petition said, “even prior to his demise and also just after his demise (the HC) recognized the Petitioner (Mascarenhas) as his de facto guardian...’’ On November 24, the HC accepting that late Fr Stan Swamy’s kin are entitled to approach the court, asked his lawyers to file a fresh petition to raise grievances which he made before his demise against observations in a lower court order. Swamy had moved the HC against a special NIA court’s order rejecting his bail pleas. Swamy’s appeal has abated, the court noted. The division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal said instead of an interim application through Fr Mascarenhas in the pending appeal, a fresh petition may now be filed. Fr Mascarenhas thus filed the petition and raised questions including whether the HC should now direct a judicial magistrate's enquiry to ensure that guidelines of National Human Rights Commission are followed. He said the allegations have followed Fr Swamy to "his grave.'' He raised the issue of Fr Swamy’s “right to reputation under Article 21 of the Constitution.” The petition says that attaching any semblance of guilt on Fr Swamy without a trial would be a violation of his fundamental right. It said a Jesuit institute on the outskirts of Mangaluru had sought to name a park after Stan Swamy but it was opposed by various organisations on the ground that he was arrested under the anti-terror law—the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The petition, filed on Thursday, says the "odium of guilt not only besmirches the reputation of Stan Swamy and his body of work in the field of tribal rights and human rights but also casts a shadow on the Jesuits of India numbering about 4,000 who run premier educational institutes like St. Xavier's College Mumbai and Xavier Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur and thus harm caused to the reputation of Stan Swamy, S. J. by extension harms the reputation of Jesuits of India.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/judicial-enquiry-sought-to-clear-stan-swamy-name-jesuit-image/articleshow/88348545.cms||---

The Singanallur police identified the accused as L Mullaram and L Govind, both aged 28 years and natives of Rajasthan, and 65-year-old G Vasudevan and 35-year-old P Thilakraj, both residents of Ganapathy in the city. While the duo from Rajasthan were into tobacco product business in Bengaluru, Vasudevan was their local supplier. “Thilakraj was a driver,” a police officer said. The officer said the Singanallur police, who were on patrol on Ginning Factory Road at Irugur around 1am on the day, had rounded up the four-member gang based on a tip while they were shifting banned tobacco products in gunny bags to a vehicle from a pickup van. Singanallur police inspector Arun has registered a case and seized the banned tobacco products and both the vehicles. The arrested four were produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded them in judicial custody in the evening. The officer said gukta and other tobacco products were not banned in Bengaluru. “But they are banned in our state.

The five-day-long summit was organized in a hybrid mode--online and physically at the NMCG office, New Delhi and IIT Kanpur. Prof Abhay Karandikar, director, IIT Kanpur said, “IIT Kanpur has been undertaking rigorous and relentless initiatives to ensure good health of the Ganga. In line with such efforts, I believe this summit would initiate a perpetual discourse in ensuring not only the conservation and preservation of Ganga but also of all the water bodies vital to us.” After discussions on various themes and issues, key suggestions that emerged are: Rivers degrade if their resource exploitation is uncontrolled, hence river conservation must have clear goals; traditional water conservation techniques, such as those practiced in Rajasthan, should be actively propagated in India; given the inter-relatedness of rivers, ponds and other water bodies, the bottom-up approach for river conservation propounded by cGanga is strongly recommended; Israel’s water-saving irrigation methods etc. The summit witnessed the signing of an MoU between cGanga and Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO) for the development of a sludge management framework. Similarly, two MoUs have also been signed with Innovation Centre Denmark and UPS Hungary to encourage sharing of knowledge and increase participation of Hungarian industry in the Ganga basin restoration and conservation programme. An MoU between cGanga and British Water was also signed to promote development of the 21st century infrastructure in water and the environment sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/water-impact-summit-organised-by-nmgc-c-ganga-in-new-delhi/articleshow/88348580.cms||---

During scrutiny of documents, it was found that he had given fraudulent information. He had mentioned his age as an adult while his actual age was much less, he was around 17 years,” said Narvekwar. Wankhede, who heads the Narcotics Control Bureau in Mumbai, has been involved in a series of controversies after the raid on a cruise ship on October 2. TOI found that he had secured the licence when he was 17 against the required age of 21. A licence can be cancelled if it was obtained through wilful misrepresentation or fraud. A senior excise official said following reports in TOI as well as a complaint made by NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik, the department began verification of documents and found that while no age proof was submitted with the original application, supplementary documents were submitted with the age mentioned as adult. “We have asked him to submit his contention within seven days, failing which the licence will be cancelled. In addition, excise department will not hesitate to initiate criminal proceedings against him for providing wrong information while procuring the licence,’’ he said. Asked why another notice was served, the official said under the Act, the district collector is the competent authority to cancel or suspend the licence. “We are keen that our action is fool proof without any lacunae,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/now-thane-collector-notice-to-wankhede-on-bar-licence/articleshow/88348599.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The documentary was shown at the University of Massachusetts and its makers, Varun Raj and Seema Rawandale, were given a cash prize of US$ 500. Women of Manar village also expressed happiness at the win. “It is very heartening that our efforts are being recognised at international platforms. We have dedicated 17 years of our lives to change the fortune of our village,” Bhagirathi Devi, sarpanch of Manar forest panchayat, told TOI.  Till about a decade ago, the villagers used to face acute water scarcity and fodder for their livestock was also scarce. To address both these issues, village women in 2004 set upon the task of planting saplings on an 11-acre patch of barren land. The project was funded by NABARD’s climate change fund. Today, the land has turned into a forest that has helped recharge water sources and also provides fodder for animals. Dinesh Raturi, coordinator of BAIF development and research foundation, a charitable organisation that helped the forest panchayat bring about the change, said, “In 2004, we brought together 80 villagers in a group called Jai Narsingh Baba Chara Vikas Samiti, which worked in the direction of changing the village landscape and overcoming shortages.” Meanwhile, Manar villagers said that their lives have changed for the better over the last few years as they don’t have to walk great distances to fetch water, fodder or fuelwood anymore. “It is important for every community to live in harmony with nature and preserve trees,” added Devi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/docu-on-village-women-in-champawat-who-turned-barren-land-into-lush-forest-wins-us-award/articleshow/88346901.cms||Prem Punetha

Touted to be a first-of-its-kind facility in the country to ensure justice for vulnerable sections, the new modern court complex will house 10 regular courts, a Pocso court and a family court. Senior judge of Telangana high court, Justice P Naveen Rao spared no efforts in renovating old halls and building new structures. Justice Rao, who was the district’s portfolio judge, turned the once crowded, ordinary subordinate court into a modern court complex which is all to offer quick digital solutions to those who use court infrastructure.  The rich experience Justice Rao acquired as in-charge of digitisation of court records during the common high court days came in handy in converting the court into a modern complex. The family court in the complex was given more facilities to enable women and children spend their time in a better fashion. A creche was set up to take care of the infants. Breast milk feeding cabins and diaper changing stations were provided in the court complex. A landscaped greenery and play area for children was also provided. The Pocso court was made more child-friendly. Even the building housing the court was painted in multiple colours and pictures. It has a special cabin for the accused within the courtroom that has a one-way looking glass preventing child victims from facing the accused and also has a separate entrance for the accused. Purified drinking water can be had for Re 1 in the court complex. Apart from pedestrian walkways, a golf cart and wheelchair for people having difficulty in walking and ramps and elevators have been provided for the differently abled.

The study also found that in case of severe Covid infection during pregnancy, meaning the non-vaccinated woman was put on ventilator support for upto five days, it resulted in stillbirth. Senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Satish Patki, who led the research along doctors Rajendra Patil and Surhud Patki, studied the placentas of 16 non-vaccinated, Covid infected women admitted to the Patki hospital between January and May this year. The placentas of the women, who had no co-morbidity but with different levels of Covid infection during their pregnancy, were selected. The study has been published in the October issue of Acta Scientific Journal. Dr Satish Patki told TOI that they used high-end microscopes to study the placentas and found “the capillaries of placental barrier choked by the blood clots caused due to Covid infection. Due to this, the essential ingredients could not reach the fetus. None of the babies were, however, infected by Covid since the coronavirus cannot breach the placental barrier.” Gynaecologist Puja Ghorpade from Kolhapur said that they had also observed 25% drop in the weight of new born babies. In case of premature delivery of non-Covid women, the baby weighed around 1.2 kg to 1.3 kg and in premature delivery in case of Covid infected, baby weighed around 800 grams to 900 grams. “So the research by Patki has yielded perfect results,” she said. Patki has recommended that the pregnant women should get vaccinated without hesitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/low-weight-babies-likely-in-27-covid-women/articleshow/88347008.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The river navigation department (RND), the parent organisation of the CoP, has said there is a clear case of embezzlement of government funds by the cashier to the tune of Rs 3.6 lakh. Bharne has been asked to report to the department’s accounts section till the inquiry is complete. The CAG has once again red-flagged financial irregularities in the RND and TOI had carried a report about the misappropriation of funds on October 18. According to the RND, Bharne failed to maintain the cash book for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. The department said Bharne violated rules pertaining to receipt of government revenues, dues and the process of crediting them into the government account. The suspension order has been issued as per rule 10 of the Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965. “It is also reported that you are involved in embezzlement of government money,” said Captain of Ports James Braganza in the suspension order. The suspension is with immediate effect. Bharne has also been prohibited from leaving the headquarters without obtaining prior permission. In an audit observation report dated October 7, the principal accountant general has written to RND’s administrative officer and the CoP informing them that a scrutiny of the cash book for the period April 2018 to September 2021 revealed that cheques submitted by High Street Cruises and Entertainment and Ribco Constructions were not recorded in the cash book.

A principal who did not wish to be identified said schools get stuck between parents and the education department for everything. “The midday meals stock has not come since August and many parents feel the school usurped the stock.” TOI was the first to report that the midday meals scheme is not being implemented in Nagpur — fully or partially — since August due to non-appointment of a vendor. Nagpur district’s midday meals in-charge Gautam Gedam confirmed that the appointment through tender was pending. “I asked my superiors in Mumbai about this. It seems that a tender is yet to be awarded for vendors. Once the tender is awarded then regular supply of foodgrains will start. Currently the schools which are under centralized kitchen scheme are getting rice but not lentils, and the ones which have in-house kitchens are getting neither,” Gedam said. Principals say it’s high time that the government takes some steps regarding this. The principal of a city aided school said, “What shocks me is the administration’s lethargy. If it knows that a tender is getting expired then the process of floating a new one must start months in advance. It is highly irresponsible on the government’s part to keep this pending for months on end.” Teachers are worried that if foodgrains are not given in a retrospective way, it will create problems for them. A senior teacher said, “We are the ones who implement the scheme on the ground level. If anything goes wrong, the administration as well as parents haul us up without trying to figure out whose fault it actually is.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/academics-seek-retrospective-resumption-of-midday-meals/articleshow/88348554.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||India||CAG slams 'irregularities' in Noida land allotments||NEW DELHI: A report by the national auditor (CAG) on Thursday revealed massive irregularities in land acquisition, allotment and approvals in Noida due to connivance between builders and officials, resulting in deep distress to homebuyers and massive losses for the authority. The exchequer lost out on Rs 52,000 crore as officials in the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) adopted dubious practices, turning Delhi's satellite town into a haven for real estate developers with just around 18% used for industrial development. As anguished homebuyers await possession of flats due to the stressed finances of the builders, the report said 44% (57,000) of the proposed 1.3 lakh group housing flats don't have occupancy certificates. Audit found significant lapses in the policies adopted by Noida in the area of planning, acquisition of land, pricing of properties and allotment of properties under various categories. Failures were observed at the level of Noida Board, its management and officials," the CAG said in its first-ever performance audit of the township during 2005-06 to 2017-18. A similar report for Greater Noida is expected to be tabled in the UP assembly shortly. The report, which covers the period prior to the Yogi government, is expected to raise the political pitch ahead of the assembly elections early next year. While the Authority invoked the "urgency clause" to acquire 80% of the land, citing industrial development as the reason, with delay ranging from 11 months to almost four years in submitting the final proposal. When it came to allotment of land, the federal auditor has estimated a revenue loss of at least Rs 14,000 crore. The report showed how authorities in Noida seemed to have diluted and tweaked rules to suit builders, while the interest of homebuyers, many of whom have invested their entire savings, and the Authority were ignored. For instance, the Authority's finances have taken a toll as dues from builders have spiralled to Rs 18,633 crore against an allotment value of Rs 14,000 crore, with no action taken against defaulters. "The recovery of dues has now become more challenging due to the legal hurdles on account of third party rights being created," it said amid several builders facing bankruptcy action. The report pointed to two plots of Logix, where the builder did not meet the eligibility norms. Similarly, there are at least 10 cases - from Unitech to Amrapali, Prateek Buildtech, Supertech and Gaursons, among others - where the Authority allowed the developers to use their net worth up to 2.29 times, causing distress to over 22,000 homebuyers. Besides, there are charges of bid rigging and of officials allowing related entities to participate in a bid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-slams-irregularities-in-noida-land-allotments/articleshow/88349890.cms||---

I will await instructions for further assignment,” Wankhede told TOI. The 2008 batch IRS officer had been on deputation to the NCB since September 2020. He was earlier posted with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). His brief tenure was marked by a series of controversies, including a bruising, public spat with NCP leader Nawab Malik, who questioned his caste and the bar licence in his name, followed by a legal battle. As zonal director of NCB, Wankhede was involved in action against the drug syndicates allegedly involving Bollywood celebrities in the aftermath of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide. In October this year, a team led by Wankhede allegedly recovered drugs during a raid on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast, and arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan, along with others. But subsequently, questions were raised about the credentials of independent witnesses used by the NCB during the raid, and it was also alleged that there was an attempt to extort money from Shah Rukh Khan by NCB officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-will-term-as-ncb-zonal-director-end-on-dec-31/articleshow/88348622.cms||---

The posters are also displayed at all the 15 police stations in the city. “If anyone furnishes information about any of them, the National Investigation Agency will reward Rs 5 lakh to that person. Details about the informer will be kept confidential,” a city police officer, who didn’t want to be named, said. The officer said Ramalingam had opposed the Dawah work done by the Popular Front of India members in Thanjavur district. After he was murdered at Thirubhuvanam, the Thiruvidaimaruthur police had registered a case, which was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. While the investigation agency had named 18 people as accused, only 13 of them have been arrested so far.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 11-year-old helped nab fake mother; four traffickers get 7 years||MUMBAI: The deposition of a plucky Andheri-based 11-year-old girl who vividly recalled and confided in her best friend that as a 4-year-old she was kidnapped from her hometown in Madhya Pradesh by a neighbouring couple and subsequently handed over to a woman in the city, has ensured that the four perpetrators were convicted and sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment for kidnapping and trafficking for exploitation. As the best friend informed her mother who in turn informed the cops, the child was finally reunited with her biological parents in 2016, six years after she had gone missing. Additional Sessions Judge L S Chavan on Thursday also fined the accused Kamla Sisodiya (55), Maya Patel (56), Shivshankar Sisodiya (43) and Ganga Sisodiya (40) Rs 10,000 each. Public prosecutor Geeta Malankar urged the court not to show the accused leniency. The child’s biological parents, who were witnesses in the case, denied the fake mother, Kamala’s claims that they had handed her over voluntarily as they could not afford to take care of her. They had lodged an FIR in 2010 and continued to make frantic efforts to trace the child. Among other witnesses were the child’s best friend, her mother, a teacher, the chairman of the building where the girl resided and cops. The child, the star witness, told the court in May 2016, she told her best friend her “real mother” used to sell bangles and cutlery at a bus depot. She said when she was playing near her mother’s shop, at that time, one uncle and aunty who sold toys and lived close to her mother’s shop came there with a chocolate. They then took her away in an SUV. The child said when she started crying, the man threatened her and took her to the accused Maya’s house. The child stayed there for a few days and was beaten repeatedly. Maya then took her to co-accused Ganga and Shivshankar who handed her over to “Kamla Aunty” who lived in Andheri with the child’s fake sister, a bar dancer. The child said she was made to work in the house, beaten, threatened and made to serve alcohol to those who visited her “didi” at night. The child said Kamala wanted her to join dance classes. She then confided in her best friend, whose mother complained to MIDC police station with the help of a social worker. The child said her “didi” was also brought to the police station and then sent to her parents. Cops managed to locate the child’s parents with the help of MP police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-year-old-helped-nab-fake-mother-4-traffickers-get-7-yrs/articleshow/88348629.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) officials stated that three vaccination sites had been merged with the existing inoculation centres. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials confirmed shifting of a total of 22 sites and a few more were in the pipeline. According to the PMC officials, the civic areas had 68 vaccination centres in civic schools. Of them, a total of 22 have been shifted. The civic body is finding it difficult to shift 14 centres because of lack of space. The PMC will continue vaccination at 32 schools because adequate and separate space is available for them, while 36 sites would be shifted. “The civic body is searching for locations to shift these centres. Till then, they would remain closed. As soon as the new space is available, these centres would be restarted,” said Suryakant Devkar, the head of the immunization department. The PCMC’s additional commissioner, Vikas Dhakane, told TOI, “We have shifted three centres to the existing ones to make sure that there is no inconvenience to the school students or the staff members. It will not affect our routine vaccination drive in any way.” The district recorded vaccination of 47,456 beneficiaries across 618 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm on Friday.

---||Dehradun||Did 13 of the 22 labs at Kumbh dump bio-medical waste in open?||HARIDWAR: An ongoing investigation into the Kumbh scam, where over 1 lakh fake Covid tests were allegedly conducted to meet the daily target directed by the Uttarakhand high court, revealed that only nine of the 22 labs that conducted the tests during the month-long mela signed a contract with a biomedical waste disposal agency. The remaining 13 labs, including the two named in the FIR – Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs – disposed of the waste in the open or mixed them with domestic waste. Syringes and other waste from testing were discarded near the testing sites, which included several Ganga ghats, police said. The Kumbh mela administration and the district health department had empanelled 22 private labs to conduct tests during the Kumbh Mela, which took place in Haridwar from April 1 to 30 this year. Technicians set up testing centres on Ganga ghats, including Har-ki Pauri, district borders, parking spaces and several other public places. Investigating officer Rakendra Singh Kathith told TOI, “As the case (on Kumbh scam) was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, we had contacted Medical Pollution Control Committee (MPCC), which is the only agency in Haridwar equipped to collect and dispose of biomedical waste.  The agency got back to us, saying only nine labs had entered into an agreement with them to collect the waste generated from Covid testing. It turned out most of the labs had not bothered to properly dispose of highly-hazardous biomedical waste during the peak of the pandemic.” “It is possible that the labs mixed the waste with domestic waste or simply dumped it in the open, which is a serious offence,” Kathith added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-scam-13-of-22-labs-dumped-biomedical-waste-from-tests-done-during-mega-festival-in-open-finds-report/articleshow/88346977.cms||MS Nawaz

The BMC will next week table a Rs 700-crore proposal for the construction of two bridges meant to connect Western Express Highway with Eastern Express Highway. As per the proposal for the two bridges, one will be built from ahead of Oberoi Mall towards Film City while another would be built at Khindipada (Bhandup) connecting the tunnel to the Eastern Express Highway. TOI had first reported about it last month. Works on the challenging part – the tunnel to go below the National Park – will be taken up later, said officials. The total end-to-end length of the road starting from Western Express Highway in Goregaon up to Eastern Express Highway in Mulund is proposed to be over 12 km. The road will have two tunnels and the SGNP tunnel is expected to be 4.7 km in length. A box tunnel through Film City in Goregaon has also been proposed, which would be 1.6km long. BMC officials said that the tunnelling for the project will be done using the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) technology. The initial estimated cost of the GMLR project, which is proposed to ensure east-west connectivity, was pegged at Rs 4,700 crore, which now has increased to over Rs 6,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-to-table-rs-700cr-plan-for-gmlr-bridges-next-week/articleshow/88348658.cms||Richa Pinto

The division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice NS Dhanik stated that retired employees should not be forced to buy a health insurance plan against their will. The case concerns a PIL filed by Dehradun-resident Ganpat Singh Bisht, who is a retired Uttarakhand government employee. In his petition, he said that the Uttarakhand government deducts money from the pension of every retired state employee in the name of health insurance. He added that the purchase of a health insurance plan should be kept optional for state employees and premiums should not be mandatorily deducted from their pensions. In its ruling, the HC observed that the mandatory deduction of premium from pensions of state government employees is a violation of section 300 (a) of the Pension Act. Earlier, on December 21, 2020, the Uttrakhand government had issued a notice making health insurance premium a mandatory deduction from pensions of state employees from January 1, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-stops-mandatory-deduction-of-health-insurance-premium-from-pension/articleshow/88347023.cms||---

Two major groups — backed by Manohar family and Shreerang Bhandarkar — would battle it out for top posts, including that of president, vice-presidents and secretary. According to senior lawyers, the new body should fight against alleged discrimination meted out to their fraternity in the Nagpur bench. They want the new office-bearers to fight for the elevation of deserving lawyers as senior counsels and judges from the region. Some women lawyers claimed only those from the principal seat get preference over Vidarbha and the bench here is being meted out step-motherly treatment. They also demanded that sensitive cases pertaining to the region — like Melghat malnutrition and that of purported Naxalite sympathizer GN Saibaba — should not be transferred to the Mumbai bench and HCBA should raise voice against such moves. Some young lawyers insisted that the new body should work for increasing the sitting arrangements with a view to accommodate all lawyers and also reduce the fees charged for the same. They also demanded streamlining the parking arrangements so that vehicles of lawyers visiting the HC premises would get space. “The elected body should redress the grievances of all members and provide all amenities to them,” said one of the lawyers. Other new lawyers said the elected members should also guide juniors in the association and, if possible, provide a stipend to them. “The study circles for the new lawyers should be restarted. It was a good initiative started when Justice Anil Kilor was holding the president’s post. If there are any issues that lawyers are facing, the HCBA should be assertive enough to bring it to the notice of the Chief Justice of India. Also, the association website should also be maintained and updated properly, it’s in very bad shape currently,” they said.

Government is also chalking out an alternative plan to provide subsidised tickets to students. “The chief secretary had asked us to chalk out a plan in a recently-held meeting. Students could either get a free ride on roadways buses or subsidised tickets, or both. There are a few areas in the state where roadways buses don’t ply and for such places, we may need an alternative option,” said an official. It is learnt that commute is difficult for students in hill districts. Also, according to experts, it will be a challenge for government to get the plan executed and maintain roadways buses as there are barely any service stations. They said private buses will be needed to cater to all the students. The scheme will benefit more than 63,000 students studying in government-run degree colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/higher-education-dept-mulls-free-bus-ride-for-college-students/articleshow/88347026.cms||Mohammad Anab

Now, we are getting enough doses from the district administration, which is why we were able to reopen the vaccination centres,” Kumar said. Cantonment officials said they had vaccinated 67,661 people, which included 27,983 first-dose vaccinations, so far. Dr Nikhil Yadav, in-charge of the vaccination in the Cantonment, said that there was a lukewarm response for the inoculation in the last month. “In the last two weeks, we have received a positive response for the vaccination. People from the PMC limits are also coming in a large number.

Hit hard by Covid-19, the hospitality sector seems to be on a path to recovery as most hotels are reporting an occupancy of 60 to 80%. Hoteliers say bookings are expected to pick up in the next few days. Speaking to TOI, Sandeep Sahni, president, Uttarakhand hotels association, said despite Omicron scare, bookings have picked up ahead of Christmas. “During the first week of December, there were hardly any bookings,” Sahni said. Similar sentiments were echoed by Sanjay Aggarwal, secretary, Mussoorie hotels association, who said hotels in Mussoorie were reporting up to 80% bookings, while some had even been sold out for Christmas. Hoteliers said state government was also organising the Winterline carnival from December 25 onwards for three to four days. “The event is expected to attract more tourists to the hill town,” Aggarwal said.  However, bookings for New Year are yet to pick up, hoteliers said. “The occupancy is 50% for New Year as of now. We are hopeful of doing a brisk business by next week,” Sahni said. In Nainital, hoteliers have kept their fingers crossed. Ved Sah, secretary, hotel association, Nainital told TOI that they hoped there was no Covid surge around this time. Currently, hotels' occupancy rate is 80%. All Covid protocols are being followed.

---||Delhi||Stay on notice to firm for indirect tobacco ad||New Delhi: A Delhi court has put an interim stay on a notice sent to a pan masala company by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) for allegedly indulging in an indirect advertisement of tobacco products in violation of the law. Additional Sessions Judge Rajinder Singh said even though the Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products Act prohibits display, advertisement, and sale of tobacco products, there was no specific prohibition regarding surrogate advertising. The court, however, said, “It can be summarised that the product in question is not alleged to be containing any tobacco or other banned substance. The sale of gutka is banned throughout the country. There is no reason or occasion for the plaintiff to advertise its tobacco products through ‘indirect advertisement’.” The DGHS stated the company had put up a hoarding containing the indirect advertisement of “Dilbagh Pan Masala”, as brand promotion of tobacco products, in violation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. The health department said that “Dilbagh” is a registered trademark for various tobacco products. The company claimed that their pan masala is 100% tobacco-free, which is not covered by the Act. The court said if the advertisement for the product in question was stopped during the pendency of the main suit, it would cause a loss of revenue and goodwill, which will be irreparable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stay-on-notice-to-firm-for-indirect-tobacco-ad/articleshow/88349220.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Sequencing rules out local transmission of fresh strain||Pune: Genome sequencing of 1,655 Covid positive samples across the state has ruled out the local transmission of Omicron variant of Covid-19 virus in Pune and 20 other districts. The genome sequencing carried out on the samples drawn from the community of infected patients without a travel history found Delta and its sub-lineage behind the infection. A state health official said around 919 samples alone were sequenced from Pune and Ahmednagar districts, while around 746 samples were tested from 19 other districts. The sequencing is under way since November and majorly Delta variant has been found across these samples. There is need to send more samples to get the indication of local transmission early on, experts said. The official said the district officials have been entrusted with the responsibility of sending adequate number of positive Covid samples from their jurisdiction for sequencing to the designated research laboratories. However, a sharp decline in positive cases in the past few weeks is resulting in many of the districts struggling to send the required number of Covid samples, the official added. The state genome sequencing coordinator and HoD of the microbiology department at BJ Government Medical College, Rajesh Karyakarte, said apart from the positive samples of infected travellers and their close contacts, five research laboratories in Pune have sequenced positive samples from the daily Covid cases as well to track any new variants of the contagion in the community. The state-run BJ Government Medical College in the Sassoon General Hospital has the central coordinating laboratory. It collates positive samples from private and government laboratories and distributes them for whole-genome sequencing. The remaining four research-cum-laboratories are the National Institute of Virology (NIV), the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), the National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), and the National Institute of Cell Science (NICS).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sequencing-rules-out-local-transmission-of-fresh-strain/articleshow/88348671.cms||---

Police said the lawyer, identified as Gautam Dutt, suffered serious gunshot wounds and was rushed to Lala Lajpat Rai (LLR) Hospital where he died during treatment. During preliminary investigation it came to fore that soon after the election was cancelled following chaos and skirmishes, two groups of advocates indulged in indiscriminate firing outside Shatabdi Gate of the court campus. “Advocate Gautam was shot in the firing. He was admitted to LLR hospital, where he died during treatment,” said a police officer. Meanwhile, soon after the news of the death of the advocate spread, lawyers created a ruckus and demanded immediate arrest of the culprits involved in the firing. A heavy police force and senior officials rushed to the LLR hospital to maintain law and order. “Lawyer Gautam Dutt, who was shot at, succumbed to wounds at the LLR hospital. As of now we are in the process of registering FIR. No one is above law. The culprits will be brought to book," said Commissioner of police Asim Kumar Arun while talking to reporters. “However, it is yet to be ascertained whether the firing incident was related to cancellation of election or was it a separate issue. Investigations are underway in this regard,” said police further. Earlier, following utter chaos during voting, the Elders’ Committee on Friday cancelled the election of KBA. Shankar Dutt Tripathi, a member of the committee, announced on Friday evening that the committee had decided to cancel the election due to gross violation of rules and regulations by the contesting candidates and their supporters at the booths. The fresh date for the election has not been decided yet, he added. Voting began around two and a half hours late and was closed at 4 pm after reports of chaos in the booths situated in the district court building were received by the committee. The committee somehow managed to collect the ballot boxes from the booths and brought them to its room. The candidates and their supporters too reached there and amidst heated arguments, the committee announced to cancel the elections, leading to firing by some persons. The voting, which was scheduled on Friday, could not be started in time due to disturbances created by some people, including the candidates, who alleged that the voting process was not properly managed and CCTV cameras were not installed at proper and vulnerable places. When voting began around 12 noon, a crowd of advocate-members forcibly entered inside some booths. Chaos began in a few booths, especially in booth no. 12 alleging fake voting. The candidates and their supporters not only blocked the lane leading to the booths but also forced their entry inside them. When the assistant returning officers tried to oust them, they started misbehaving. The situation worsened in the evening at the booths in the court building after which the committee stopped voting and brought back the ballot boxes in their room. Some candidates and their supporters threw dust inside the elders committee’s room and blamed the assistant returning officers and the committee members for the mess. After cancellation of the election was announced, two groups of advocates clashed inside the court compound and one group opened fire against another. According to sources, Gautam suffered gunshot injuries and was rushed to the LLR hospital. The members of the committee termed the incident as unfortunate and said that such incidents degrade the image of advocates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/free-for-all-at-kba-election-lawyer-shot-on-court-campus/articleshow/88348667.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

He also hoisted the flag of BKU (Charuni) at his village along with his supporters. Charuni is scheduled to announce a new political party at a press conference at Chandigarh Press Club on Saturday. Under his Mission Punjab 2022, he is keen that farmers, labourers, traders and the general public contest the upcoming elections collectively to sideline the traditional political parties and their leaders. Talking to TOI on Friday, Charuni said, “I will not contest the elections from Punjab but will field candidates for these polls from our party. We are going to launch our political party in Chandigarh on Saturday.” “Earlier some farm leaders were opposing my decision to enter politics, but now nobody is (opposing me). Punjab farm unions are holding secret meetings. They held a meeting yesterday (Thursday), today and one is scheduled for tomorrow also. Some unions of Punjab are happy in staying neutral while some are interested in elections but they are still planning on how and from where to contest. As of now, we are going ahead by ourselves and not in talks with anyone,” he said. Charuni played an important role during the year-long farmers’ protest against the three farm laws by mobilising the Haryana farmers to the Delhi border and clearing the passage for Punjab farmers following Delhi Chalo call on November 25, 2020. He was also part of the nine-member committee of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), that spreadheaded the protest and forced the Centre to repeal the controversial agri-marketing laws. On December 15, Charuni, BKU Krantikari leader Surjit Singh Phul, farmers of Punjab and Haryana, Deep Sidhu, Lakha Sidhana, Dal Khalsa leader Kanwar Pal Singh Bittu, Sikh historian Dr Sukhpreet Singh Udoke, Sikh scholar Mandhir Singh, Nihang jathebandis (organisations) reached Amritsar. They was part of a Fateh March (victory march), led by a specially decorated vehicle carrying Sri Guru Granth Sahib in the form of nagar kirtan (religious procession), from Singhu border to Sri Harmandar Sahib. In Amritsar, as they gathered in front of the Akal Takht Sahib, Charuni thanked all the Punjab farmers, unions and nihangs for supporting the farmers’ protest. “We are very thankful to all on behalf of Haryana and it has been a blessing of the malik (God). We said it earlier too that it (farmers’ protest) is dharam yudh (struggle for righteouness). (PM Narendra) Modi Ji wanted to hand over the food of entire nation to Ambani,Adani, but we succeeded in stopping him,” he said. “The Akal Takht Sahib, where we are sitting, is a common place of Miri and Piri (Sikh doctrine of close relationship between faith and politics)... There are two Nishan Sahibs, one of Miri and one of Piri... our politicians are looting us... by forming laws. We are not being looted by angrej (British)... It was easy to deal with them (British) but hard to do the same with those who are our own... there is a need to cleanse politics. We should keep in mind this sangam (of Miri-Piri) and remember the God as well as the worldly duty too,” he had told the gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/charuni-to-launch-political-party-today-to-field-candidates-in-punjab-polls/articleshow/88348663.cms||JK Singh

Taking cognizance of the matter, the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) has decided to launch a campaign in the state to encourage people HIV-positive people to get vaccinated by holding camps or by assisting them to reach the vaccination centres. The RSACS has also stepped up measures to get people vaccinated against Covid-19 as 17 cases of the highly infectious Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported in the state. "He was on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment. When he was brought to AIIMS-Jodhpur on December 6, doctors came to know that was HIV positive and he developed Covid-19 pneumonia with oropharyngeal candidiasis, a fungal infection caused by a yeast (a type of fungus) called Candida," said a senior health department official. Despite his comorbidities, he did not get vaccinated. According to doctors, HIV/AIDS weakens people’s defense against many infections as it affects the functioning of immune cells leaving the person immunodeficient. Health authorities claimed that they have issued directions for encouraging HIV positive people for Covid-19 vaccination. "The HIV positive people should get vaccinated against Covid-19 as they are always at high risk of getting infected and their condition may deteriorate," said Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, RSACS director. Currently, a total of 46,855 people in the state are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), which means they are HIV positive and are getting treated. "We are taking the details of how many of them are fully vaccinated and how many are still left out. We have chalked out a strategy to encourage them to get vaccinated against Covid-19," said RSACS officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/unvaxxed-hiv-ve-barmer-man-dies-of-covid-in-jodhpur/articleshow/88348674.cms||---

Sisodia said, “In the last two decades, the BJP and Congress governments came into power, but no one fulfilled their promises. Education in the state is at its worst. The government knows that if the children here are educated, they will question them. The state also lacks good health facilities and the roads are in bad shape.” “The new CM made 1,300 announcements in a short time. But, till now, not a single order has been received by the concerned departments,” the deputy CM added. Citing Delhi’s model of development, Sisodia said, “Every second person of Uttarakhand lives in Delhi. The development that was lacking in six decades, the Kejriwal government achieved it within five years. All the government schools and hospitals were renovated, we gave employment to people and we’ll do the same for the hilly state.” The deputy CM asked for a chance and promised one lakh government jobs in the state. He added that they will pay Rs 5,000 allowance till the time they get a job. He also blamed the BJP government of looting taxpayer’s money. Sisodia was accompanied by AAP’s Uttarakhand in-charge Dinesh Mohaniya and other party members, including Amit Joshi, Basant Kumar and Akhilesh Tamta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-now-has-choice-in-form-of-aap-says-sisodia/articleshow/88347044.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Actor thrashed for riding auto driver’s role||Ahmedabad: Rakesh Pandey, a Gujarati actor renowned for his signature role of Govind Rickshawalo (Govind, the autorickshaw driver), has been beaten up by a colleague for riding on that on-screen persona. According to the complaint, Satyendra Yadav launched an assault because he felt Pandey had owned that role for too long. Pandey filed a complaint with Infocity police of Gandhinagar on Thursday against Yadav. Pandey, a relative of a former Gujarat-cadre IPS officer, said in his FIR that he was attacked at the Infocity Mall where he has an office. Pandey said that around 11.30am on Thursday, Yadav confronted him and abused him for always playing the role of Govind in Gujarati films. Pandey said when he objected to the abuses, Yadav began thrashing him mercilessly. “He held my left hand and beat me and as a result my wristwatch broke, injuring me,” Pandey said in the FIR. “Yadav eventually told me that he was sparing me. But he said he will kill me if I ever starred as Govind again.” Pandey said that Yadav left after people began gathering around them. Later, Pandey approached police and filed a complaint. Police have invoked sections relating to causing hurt, criminal intimidation, and uttering abusive words. Inspector T P Vaghela of Infocity police said that Yadav and Pandey had been locked in a brawl over the same role earlier too. “Yadav might have wanted to play that role or he might have been angered by Pandey’s boasts about it,” a police officer said. “Further investigation is on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/actor-thrashed-for-riding-auto-drivers-role/articleshow/88348712.cms||---

This was among more than 2,000 forwarded messages ranging from “Diesel & petrol rates slashed to Rs 75 and Rs 85 respectively on 30th Nov” to “Scotland Yard to transfer their inspectors to Mumbai Police for 5 years” that TOI busted as fake recently through its campaign ‘Times Verified’. Launched in West and South India on November 21, the initiative—which was born in Mumbai on April 17 this year—aims to break the chain of viral misinformation and disinformation that has been infecting social media groups as rampantly as the virus is mutating in the real world. Under this campaign, readers send unverified or suspicious messages doing the rounds on social media on the WhatsApp number 9819888887 and our expert panel—made up of reporters, editors and representatives from the BMC and the government—tap into their sources to verify its credibility. Over the last few weeks, TOI received over 8,000 messages of which 40% have been verified as fake. “This message is fake,” cried the bold red stamp sent by our panel in response to fake forwards, including the one: “Polio drops can cure COVID in infants. As per IMA, if the drops are giv-en before 2 years of age, child will never contract Covid.” US-based physician Dr Seema Yasmin—whose book speaks about how misinformation spreads faster than microbes in times of crisis—recently told TOI: “In the last year we’ve seen people write Facebook posts from their hospital beds saying they didn’t believe the pandemic was real because of what they’d read on social media and now they were infected.” In this scenario, the job of our “chain-breakers”—read-ers who have been regularly forwarding dubious messages to help TOI identify red flags and vaccinate you with the truth—becomes significant. Among these vigilant chain breakers are Goa’s Thomas Mani, Maharashtra’s Tao Alphonso Margaret and Rajendra Jadhav, and Karnataka’s Sudha Rao and Magesh Subramanian. To join this brigade in the fight against false news, all you have to do is send dubious, anxiety-causing news circulated on social media to our expert panel and let the green tick in the Times Verified logo counter the tyranny of the grey curved arrow of forwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/the-buck-stops-with-you-help-break-the-chain-of-fake-news-with-times-verified/articleshow/88348676.cms||---

However, in October the additional chief metropolitan magistrate at Esplanade court dismissed her plea. Ranaut’s revision application submitted before the Dindoshi sessions court said that the Esplanade court had failed to appreciate that the magistrate hearing the defamation case had grossly misused his power to cause intentional injury to her. “That the magistrate (Andheri court) was intentionally causing prejudice to the rights and liberties of the applicant (Ranaut) with a biased mind, by inter alia indulging in the acts of threatening to issue an ‘arrest warrant’ against the her to secure her presence before him for a ‘bailable’ and ‘non-cognizable offence’,” the plea said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/javed-akhtar-case-transfer-kangana-moves-sessions-court/articleshow/88348691.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Raised child marriage age for woman ineffective in its prevention, say experts||Jaipur: The Union cabinet raised the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 year to essentially curtail child marriages and prevent abuse of minors. However, experts working in this field claimed that the change, which has brought the age of marriage for both men and women on a par, will have negligible effect on prevention of child marriages. The raised age is only a step forward in addressing gender discrimination and curbing early pregnancies. Sharing her views on the bill, Dr Kriti Bharti, managing trustee, Saarthi Trust, who has been instrumental in annulment of child marriages, said, “The good part is that the bill addresses gender disparity. However, the change in legal marriage age for women will have no effect in curbing child marriages. People who get their underage children married off do not follow any laid down legal ages, especially in rural areas. In fact, we can also expect to see an increase in POCSO cases as various laws like Juvenile Justice Act and others could clash with each other. Just changing the age is irrelevant.” Specialists in child welfare believe increasing women’s age of marriage is like treating symptoms instead of the cause. They are of the opinion that though the people in cities will adhere to this legal change, it would be futile in rural regions where age limit is no criteria for child marriages. Few also questioned the logic of deciding 21 years as the appropriate age to get married as it has no scientific reasoning. They claimed that this change will trigger a rise in child marriages and elopement cases. Though the change might ensure physical maturity of women and achieve gender parity, experts opine there needs to be more clarity on the deciding factors to choose the legal ages for both men and women. To prevent child marriages, the government needs to bring in more strong measures and changes. “Increasing the legal age will mean a large number of married persons will be deemed underage, thereby putting a question mark around the legality of their marriages. Despite laws mandating minimum age and criminalizing sexual intercourse with a minor, child marriages are very prevalent in the country. According to the 5th National Family Health Survey (2019-21), almost one-fourth married women between 20-24 years of age accepted getting married before the legal age of 18. In most cases, girls who get married early do not have the support to move the Court and ask for the marriage to be annulled despite ill-treatment. Increasing the legal marriage age would perhaps accomplish little more than pushing more marriages underground, as has been the practice in the past”, added Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of Population Foundation of India. Several others working for child welfare stated that a holistic approach to end child marriage would require several measures including stringent punishment for those attempting to get children married off, appropriate and effective education and awareness programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raised-child-marriage-age-for-woman-ineffective-in-its-prevention-say-experts/articleshow/88348706.cms||---

The minister pointed out that the spread of omicron variant was a major concern. “Since vaccines cut down the severity of the infection, the officials need to take up door-to-door campaign to ensure all people are vaccinated,” he said. He added that the officials need to strengthen the infrastructure for health care even in the rural areas. “The focus should be on ensuring supply and storage of medical oxygen in the rural area so that it is available for the people suffering from infection in the rural areas,” he said. Pawar also stressed on regular fire, electric and structural audits of the hospitals and check of the fire fighting equipment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ajit-pawar-calls-for-focus-on-vaccination/articleshow/88347075.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Punjab farm group, SKM part Jamhuri Kisan Sabha to enter politics||AMRITSAR: With Punjab assembly elections approaching and having tasted success in getting the three contentious farm laws repealed, the farm unions are contemplating making a formal announcement of their political parties. BKU (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni is likely to announce his political party on Saturday while another farm group, led by BKU (Rajewal) Balbir Singh Rajewal, could make a similar announcement in the near future. State vice-president of Jamhuri Kisan Sabha, one among the 32 constituents of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), Rattan Singh Ajnala said, “We held a meeting in Samrala yesterday, in which 22 farm union leaders participated and discussed the formation of a political party. There is a likelihood of a formal announcement of a political outfit in near future.” While stressing on parliamentary and non-parliamentary ways of achieving farmers’ goals, he said their year-long struggle had made common people aware of their ideologies, which could benefit them even in the absence of political cadre. Sources said traditional political parties were already sending out feelers to persuage farm union leaders to join hands with them ahead of the elections. “We know the time is short but we need to apprise voters about our ideology, agenda and message. Only then can we expect them to support and vote for us,” said a senior farm union leader who is likely to announce the launch of a farmers political party soon. Admitting that funding was going to be a major issue, he said it could be resolved only if they shake hands with some influential political party. “Farm union leaders wouldn’t spend whatever little donation they received during their struggle on election expenditure. Instead, they are banking upon their mass base, especially in Malwa region, from where hoards of farmers and their family members had joined the struggle at multiple protest sites on the Delhi borders,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/pb-farm-group-skm-part-jamhuri-kisan-sabha-to-enter-politics/articleshow/88348685.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Central Vista: Plan to widen key roads gets UTTIPEC nod||New Delhi: The Unified Traffic & Transportation Infrastructure Centre (UTTIPEC) governing body on Friday approved the “transit and transportation plan” for the redevelopment of the Central Vista project. The governing body also approved the traffic circulation and transport infrastructure plan for the redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station under the transit-oriented development (TOD) policy in the meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. The LG tweeted: “Chaired 64th governing body meeting of UTTIPEC with VC, DDA and other experts.” He further tweeted that the transport plan for redevelopment of New Delhi Railway Station was approved and the “transportation plan for development/ redevelopment of Parliament House, Common Central Secretariat and Central Vista Avenue” was also authorised. An official said the Central Vista project’s approval would result in redesigning and upgrading of roads in central Delhi that would witness increased traffic flow once the project was completed by 2024. A traffic assessment report prepared by Tata Consulting Engineers stated that the project would add a significant amount of traffic to Dr Rajendra Prasad Road, Maulana Azad Road, Ashoka Road and Shershah Road. While there might not be much possibility of widening these roads, upgrading would take care of parking issues and add more infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. “The redevelopment proposal of New Delhi Railway Station will be implemented under the TOD policy. Once it comes up, the station complex will not only provide a much-needed boost to seamless transport infrastructure, but also open huge residential and commercial spaces in a sustainable manner, apart from positively altering the skyline of the capital,” said the official. The railway station redevelopment also includes a plan for traffic infrastructure upgradation, like widening of roads, elevated corridors, road redesigning, traffic circulation plans, etc. The station witnesses a footfall of around five lakh passengers every day and the Rs 6,500-crore project would see integration of pedestrian pathways, cycle tracks and lanes for non-motorised vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/central-vista-plan-to-widen-key-roads-gets-uttipec-nod/articleshow/88349237.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Local polls for de-reserved OBC seats on Jan 18||MUMBAI: Following the Supreme Court’s verdict converting the 27% quota seats for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) into the general category for the upcoming local body polls, the Maharashtra State Election Commission (SEC) on Friday said that the election to the seats initially meant for the OBC category will now be held on January 18. Elections for 106 nagar panchayats, the zilla parishads of Bhandara and Gondia, and panchayat samitis under their jurisdiction are scheduled on December 21. And after the SC order, 413 seats, excluding the gram panchayat polls, which were reserved for OBCs will now be converted into general category. Counting of all seats will be done on January 19. Elections for the other seats will be held as per schedule. A senior official from the SEC said, “The seats meant for OBCs will now be treated as general category. Of these, 50% will have to be given to women. We have already issued directions to various collectors to ensure that reservation is kept for women on seats in the general category.” This is not the first time that local body polls in the state will be conducted without the OBC quota, which came into existence in 1994. The October bypolls for Akola, Washim, Dhule, Nandurbar, and Nagpur and Palghar zilla parishads were held without this quota. The state cabinet on Wednesday had resolved to write to the SEC to postpone the elections to allow for empirical data to be collected to restore the OBC quota. Officials said that since the SC had confirmed the election on December 21, the SEC did not have the power to postpone the elections. On December 6, the SC had stayed till further orders the local body elections in Maharashtra on seats reserved for OBCs and had made it clear that the poll process for the other seats would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/local-polls-for-de-reserved-obc-seats-on-jan-18-sec/articleshow/88348709.cms||---

Suchana Evam Rogjar Adhikar Abhiyan announced the second accountability yatra which will begin at Shahid Smarak in Jaipur under the leadership of social activist Aruna Roy. The yatra will cover all 33 districts of the state over 45 days and will culminate in Jaipur on February 2. The yatra will be carried out in a big bus and a van, RTI on wheels, and will involve local organisations and people in each district. While the Congress government is celebrating its third anniversary, the social organisations are upset over the non-fulfillment of its promise of a public accountability law. The Suchana Evam Rogjar Adhikar Abhiyan had launched a campaign for such a law from 2016-18 during the BJP government and the Congress party had included this demand as part of its manifesto. After the Congress government came to power in the state, it has constituted a state-level committee to make a draft of the law under retired IAS Ram Lubhaya, but so far it has not been passed. The yatra is being organised to remind the elected government of its promise, said a statement from the organisation. At a time, at least 50 activists will be present during the yatra. A similar yatra was organised in 2016 stretching to 100 days covering all 33 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/activists-to-launch-drive-seeking-accountability-law/articleshow/88348715.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Budget and aided schools struggle with sanitization costs||Nagpur: As the initial euphoria over school reopening settles down, the financial reality of following all sanitization SOPs is hitting certain schools hard. Fully-aided schools and those termed as ‘budget’ schools now find themselves struggling to shell out money for sanitizing premises as per the guidelines given.A school trustee, who manages a Marathi medium school, said, “We receive salary grants from the state government, which means fees can’t be charged from students. There is no extra grant coming in for Covid-related work. So, how shall we fund this.” The trustee did not wish to be identified, lest he face flak from education officials. “In 2020, when we all reopened for the first time, many schools got sanitizer cans of five litres free of cost. In rural areas it came from the zilla parishad fund and in city, it was probably routed through some NGOs. But that’s what always happens, we start with all the facilities but with time everything is forgotten,” said the trustee.Schools are required to sanitize entire premises daily, which include the bench and chairs being utilized by students. Washrooms have to be sanitized and not just cleaned, as per previous practice.The reality is that the majority of rural schools that survive on government grants or fall under the budget category are cutting corners. A school principal said, “In 2020, when Tukaram Munde was the Nagpur Municipal Commissioner, we had a webinar in which various issues were discussed. In that, a principal asked him if school sanitization costs would be covered by the government or not, and Munde did not commit to any funding. In fact, as I recall it he clearly said that sanitization cost is not high so it can be easily managed by schools.”That ‘managing’ is the problem, say schools. “We cannot charge fees. So, how will we fund the daily sanitization cost?” said a principal of a Hindi medium school in North Nagpur. “My teacher salaries are paid by the government but there is nothing coming for sanitization. We pool the money ourselves and do sanitization, but then it is only done in the classrooms and not entire premises,” the principal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/budget-and-aided-schools-struggle-with-sanitization-costs/articleshow/88347931.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Mhaisalkar, VSS president, on Friday was presented Pracharya Ram Shewalkar Literary Activist Award by Pandit Hrudaynath Mangeshkar at a ceremony in Ameya Dalan of the Sangh. In the last five years, Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Mahamandal has presented awards in honour of Shewalkar, who was a Marathi orator, writer and literary critic, to creative writers, language scholars, scholarly speakers, scholars and researchers of Sant Sahitya and literary activists. “The Ram Shewalkar Literary Activist Award for 2021-22 is being given to Mhaisalkar who has been working in VSS since 1982,” said Prakash Edlabadkar in his introductory speech. Vanrai’s Girish Gandhi said Mhaisalkar’s contribution has been significant in successful management of VSS. “Gems of the literary world like him are becoming rare and we must treasure them,” he said. Playwright Mahesh Elkunchwar and Gandhi were present as chief guests. Kautikrao Thale-Patil presided over the programme. Mhaisalkar in his address said that he started his journey by taking responsibility of Ranjan Kala Mandir. “I was never much of a writer or a poet back then. It was my seniors who encouraged me to dabble into the world of literature,” he said. Speaking about the future of VSS, the 87-year-old said, “It is time for seniors like me to step down and let the younger generation take the charge. Our youth are capable of taking the literary legacy forward.” ‘With education accessible in rural parts of Maharashtra, young minds who are excellent writers and poets are emerging. Their novel ideas and thought-process can bring radical change in the literary world,” said Elkunchwar. Gandhi delivered the presidential speech. Vice-president Kapur Vasnik, secretarial assistant Dada Gore and treasurer Ramchandra Kalunkhe were also present.

---||Meerut||Khaps of west UP oppose raising legal age of marriage for women, say it will increase crime||Meerut: Several khaps in western Uttar Pradesh have strongly opposed the Centre’s recent decision to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21, claiming it will "increase crimes against women” and that "the government should not interfere in personal lives of people". “Parents should have the sole right to decide on when to marry off their daughters,” said Naresh Tikait, BKU leader and head of Baliyan khap (having over a lakh followers in 78 villages of west UP), adding that a ‘mahapanchayat’ of all khaps will soon be held to discuss the matter. “Jab ladki 18 ki umar me balig ho jave hai, to shadi me kya dikkat hai? (when a girl turns adult at 18, what is harm in her marriage at this age),” asked Tikait. Echoing similar concerns, Thamba khap leader Chaudhary Brijpal said, “It will increase crime in society. Girls should be married off at the age of 16.” The khap has over 50,000 members in Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli and Kairana. The Union Cabinet recently took the decision to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. The legal age of marriage for men is 21 years. The government, with this decision, will be bringing the age of marriage for both men and women at par. The khaps, however, feel that rather than tabling the ‘population control act', the government is getting into "totally unnecessary" issues. Saranvir Deshwal of Deshwal khap with a large following in the region came up with a bizarre argument. “Raising the marriage age will give girls more time to roam around freely in cities, clad in jeans, and will ruin Indian culture,” he said. Deshwal added the government has only created more trouble for parents. “Why don’t they offer proper government jobs to women?” he questioned.

The minister’s applications were opposed by the petitioners through counsel Satish Uke.“These pleadings are based on the information received by the petitioners as per averments and the affidavits. However, the source of information from whom they got such knowledge has not been disclosed, thus resulting in lack of material and complete facts therein,” said Justice Atul Chandurkar.The judge, however, clarified that the election petitions would proceed based on the pleadings that remain after striking off the paragraphs.The HC was hearing petitions by losing candidates, including Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi’s Sagar Dabarase and Nafiz Khan, besides Patole, who claimed that Gadkari, who contested on BJP ticket, had violated the provisions of the Representation of People’s Act, 1951.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hcs-partial-relief-for-gadkari/articleshow/88347972.cms||---

---||Mumbai||BMC: No road contractor, so haven’t taken Amitabh Bachchan’s land||MUMBAI: The BMC has said it hasn’t taken over a portion of land from actor Amitabh Bachchan’s Pratiksha bungalow plot as it does not have a contractor in place for the road-widening project. In a report submitted to Lokayukta Justice V M Kanade, the BMC has said it does not have a road contractor for widening the Juhu road and so it will take over a portion of the bungalow land and demolish the compound wall in the next financial year when a road contractor is appointed for the purpose. Congress corporator Tulip Miranda had complained to Maharashtra Lokayukta that the BMC had failed to take over the land from Bachchan for road widening since 2017. A hearing on the complaint was held on Friday. “A notice was given for the bungalow plot in 2017 under Section 299 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act. There was some issue about the exact demarcation of the road line, so a fresh survey was conducted by land record officials in 2019. The final demarcation was received in July 2021. Amitabh Bachchan will have to give up 230 square metres of land and the compound wall will have to be moved by 2 to 3 metres. The open space of the bungalow and security cabin will be affected in this acquisition,” said Prithviraj Chavan, assistant municipal commissioner, K-West Ward, in his report to the Lokayukta. “We had asked the roads department if they have a contractor in place for road widening. They said they don’t have one now and they will take up road widening in the next financial year. Since there is no road contractor available, we will take further action after one is appointed,” Chavan said in the report. Miranda said, “In 2019, the BMC demolished the boundary wall of a building’s premises adjoining Bachchan’s bungalow, taking over a part of the land for road widening. However, the compound of the Pratiksha bungalow was left untouched. Waiting for a contractor before land acquisition for road widening is unheard of. The Lokayukta has not accepted the BMC’s report and has asked for a response from the additional municipal commissioner at the next hearing in January.” Bachchan did not respond to a query from TOI. In 2017, the actor’s family was asked to surrender a portion of the land from Pratiksha, off Linking Road, Juhu, along with owners of neighbouring plots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-no-road-contractor-so-havent-taken-bachchan-land/articleshow/88348737.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Netas: New Rs 1,800cr road work bids still below cost estimate||Mumbai: After much back and forth, the BMC on Friday circulated among corporators Rs 18,000 crore road repair work proposals that are to come up for sanction before the civic standing committee meeting scheduled next week. Corporators alleged that nothing major has changed despite the re-tendering as most of the road repair work bids are still 13-23% below estimates. Opposition party leader in the BMC Ravi Raja of Congress said, “This is not a good sign as there remains a question mark on the quality of work. A third-party audit would be required with civic engineers being unlikely to supervise such large volume of works.” Bandra corporator and standing committee member Asif Zakaria said that considering the huge quantum of works, it is unlikely to start before mid-January as even after the standing committee gives it nod, the traffic department NOCs will have to be obtained. “It is also likely that only one or two road repair works would begin in each ward mid-January and a major chunk of the works will start after monsoon. This delay tactic has helped no one,” said Zakaria. Every year, new cement concrete and asphalt road repair works begin post-monsoon; in October, however, this year, the work was delayed as the contractors had quoted up to 30% below estimates. In the first week of October, the BMC then re-tendered the road repair works. The same will now come before the standing committee for approval. Samajwadi Party corporator and MLA Rais Shaikh pointed out that in some wards, like M-East which covers Deonar, Anushakti Nagar, Govandi and Mankhurd, the BMC had canceled a tender stating that it was 21% below the estimated cost, and now the same contractor has bid for the road work 17% below estimates. “This is just one example; there are many instances. There is no valid justification that the BMC can give after delaying works for the whole year,” Shaikh said. Civic officials, while justifying the proposals, said that earlier when some of the bids were up to 30% below estimates, it was obvious that no quality work could have been done. This time, they said, they have worked out the current estimates and found that satisfactory work could be done at the current rates quoted. “Once the committee gives its approval, we can start work,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/netas-new-rs-1800cr-road-work-bids-still-below-cost-estimate/articleshow/88348748.cms||Richa Pinto

If this trend continues, which is expected, the trade in Jaipur will get a new fillip in coming year.” Many buyers will switch to India from China but the industry needs to increase capacity to cater to the high-volume buyers, some jewellers said. “Now, we have so much orders that we are running short of workers. Most people who had gone back during the peak of the Covid have come back. But the demand has increased and we need larger workforce to cater to the increased demand,” said Kamal Kothari, a jeweller. The organisers said the five-day show starting from December 24 will exhibit diamonds, colour stones, precious metals like silver, gold, base metals-carving and beads. “The exhibition will be participated by jewellers and gemstone dealers, jewellery institutes, and publications among others. There will be separate sections for jewellery and gemstones. This categorization will make it convenient for the customers to search out the product of their choice,” added Kala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jjs-is-back-on-calendar-with-equal-force-to-have-800-booths/articleshow/88348752.cms||---

Despite his frail health, septuagenarian Shibu will be at the helm of affairs of the party while the outfit’s day-to-day affairs being managed by his chief minister son Hemant, who is likely to be re-elected to a second term as the party’s working president. Hemant was first made the working president in 2015 after the party’s drubbing in the 2014 assembly polls. He was re-elected at the party’s 11th general convention, which was held in Dhanbad in 2018. However, Shibu and Hemant’s re-election will be at the hands of the new 65-member executive committee, which will be constituted at the convention. The executive committee, which will consist of party office-bearers, will be elected by a new 350- member-strong central committee, which will also be elected on Saturday by the party’s delegates from Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Bihar and Assam. “Keeping in mind the fear of another wave of Covid-19, the delegation size, which will be attending the convention, has been pruned. Normally, around 3,500 delegates attend the convention but this year, there will be 670 delegates,” JMM general secretary-cum-spokesperson Vinod Kumar Pandey told TOI. Hemant on Friday afternoon drove down to Sohrai Bhawan in Harmu, which is the venue of the convention, and took stock of the arrangements, along with senior party office-bearers. Saturday’s convention will be significant as the party will adopt several resolutions over its future political course and the contemporary socio-political issues. JMM insiders hinted that the party will bring resolutions on Sarna religious code, migration and eradicating unemployment among the youth. Its ongoing alliance with the Congress and RJD will also be discussed. However, it is yet to be seen whether the new thinktank debates on the recent infighting within the ranks, which have been led by central committee member Sita Soren in recent months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/guruji-likely-to-be-re-elected-as-chief-at-jmm-convention/articleshow/88347478.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Winter session: BJP demands cancellation of JPSC prelims||Ranchi: The second day of the ongoing winter session of Jharkhand assembly remained chaotic as BJP MLAs raised slogans demanding the cancellation of prelims exam of combined civil services examination conducted by Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) and removal of the chairman. The House session was conducted for about an hour amid the uproar and was finally adjourned for the day during the Zero Hour. Outside the House, the opposition legislators demonstrated with banners, posters and placards to demonstrate. When members assembled inside at 11 am, the opposition MLAs gathered in the well demanding the adjournment of business and a statement by the government over the steps it was contemplating in the wake of a series of allegations levelled against the JPSC for its irregularities. Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto remained unfazed by the ruckus and tried conducting the Question Hour amid the commotion, which further agitated the protestors who tried disturbing the reporters’ desk. After around 20 mins of the commotion, the speaker issued a directive to the marshal to ask BJP MLA Jaiprakash Bhai Patel to leave. The strictness did not work and the pandemonium continued, forcing the first adjournment at 11:50 am. BJP’s Amar Bauri, Bhanu Pratap Shahi and Manish Jaiswal led the sloganeering, demanding a statement from the government and cancelation of the prelims. The speaker called out the names of those BJP MLAs whose questions were listed. Calling Amit Kumar Mandal to ask his supplementary question, the speaker said, “It seems that you are not interested in raising issues of public concern so despite attending the House and when the turn came for your question, you are not ready to ask any supplementary question.” Once the house re-assembled at 12:15 pm, the speaker allowed the members moving business adjournment motion to read out their notices and collectively rejected them, saying that all the matters could be discussed in the House during a debate on the supplementary budget. Amid the chaos and sloganeering, state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon tabled a supplementary demand of grants worth Rs 2,936.12 crore and the house was adjourned till Monday. Later addressing the media, BJP’s Babulal Marandi charged the treasury benches of avoiding issues that are of greater public interest. “What can be more important than the future of youngsters who are making efforts to become civil servants,” Marandi asked accusing the government of turning a blind eye to the protest going on in the streets and inside the house. “We have demanded a CBI investigation into the JPSC irregularities, cancellation of the PT (preliminary test) for 7th to 10th JPSC and removal of the chairman, Amitabh Choudhary. If the government is at all serious about correcting its mistakes, it would have agreed for a debate,” he said. Flanked by other BJP MLAs, Marandi pointed to JPSC’s decision to cancel the selection process of assistant public prosecutors conducted in 2018, even though no objections were raised for that exam. “We are surprised why the government is willing to cancel an examination that had no issues but is not ready to cancel the combined civil services PT exam when JPSC has admitted that were errors in it,” Marandi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/winter-session-bjp-demands-cancellation-of-jpsc-prelims/articleshow/88347528.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

BGH, owned and operated by the Bokaro Steel Limited (BSL), was the mainstay in the district’s battle against the pandemic since March last year. However, the BSL management has failed to keep the hospital’s critical care unit (CCU) in working order. The 18-bed CCU unit has a dearth of bedside monitors and other medical equipment while nine out of its 13 ventilators are out of order. The BGH received all its ventilators earlier this year under the PM-Cares Fund. Out of the 13 bedside monitors, only three are functional while the CCU does not have adequate doctors or medical staff. Neither does it have high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and ABG machines while there are eight syringe pumps against the requirement of 25. BSL chief spokesperson Manikant Dhan said, “We are procuring 10 new ventilators from Rourkela within 10 days while orders have been placed for bedside monitors, beds and some other important equipment. They will be available within a month.” Bokaro MLA Biranchi Narayan claimed that BGH has a dearth of good doctors and medical staff. “The hospital is pivotal to healthcare in the region and the BSL management must strengthen it at the earliest,” Narayan said. Though its doctors and medical staff were at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19, BGH lacks specialist doctors in 13 departments. Due to the shortage, BGH has been referring its patients to other hospitals. However, the Bokaro Steel Officers’ Association has rallied behind the BGH. “BGH has ventilators in departments such as MICU and NICU, which can be moved to the CCU for treatment of patients. Procurement is underway and the loopholes will be plugged soon,” AK Singh, the association’s president, claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bgh-short-of-ventilators-bedside-monitors-amid-third-wave-threat/articleshow/88347685.cms||---

Bhagat’s wife Niru Shanti Bhagat was also found in an unconscious state and taken to a private hospital in Ranchi for treatment. Bhagat (55), was found unconscious in his bed around 9:30 am by his nephew, Ajit Tana Bhagat, and niece. The couple did not have any child and they were staying with their nephew and niece. Police said they have not found any injury marks on Bhagat’s body. Later, an autopsy was conducted by a medical team of three doctors at the Lohardaga sadar hospital. Dr Shambhu Choudhary, one of the three doctors who conducted the autopsy, said Bhagat’s viscera was sent to the forensic science laboratory in Ranchi for analysis. The officer-in-charge of Lohardaga police station, Mantu Kumar, said, “Bhagat’s family members said the couple usually woke up by 8 am. On Friday, their bedroom was locked till 9:30 am. The couple’s nephew broke in and found Bhagat lying motionless on his bed while his wife was found unconscious. She was moved to Medanta Hospital at Irba in Ranchi.” Citing family sources, Kumar said Bhagat was suffering from diabetes and was not well for some time. Bhagat’s aide, Suraj Agarwal, said the former MLA was under treatment at Ranchi’s Apollo Hospital for diabetes. “We have demanded a probe into his death as we suspect foul play,” Agarwal said. Lohardaga SDPO VN Singh said Bhagat’s house will be investigated by a police team to check for foul play and the statement of his wife will be taken once she was medically stable. Born in Jingi village in Lohardaga’s Kuru block, Bhagat was at the forefront of the separate statehood movement and was with the Ajsu Party since its inception in 1986. He was elected from Lohardaga in 2009 and was re-elected in 2014. He was disqualified as MLA after being convicted in a criminal case in June 2015 and was barred from contesting elections for seven years. In the re-polling that ensued, Congress candidate Sukhdeo Bhagat won the seat. In a social media post, Sukhdeo condoled Bhagat’s death. “I lost a younger brother. The entire district is shocked to learn of his passing. I wish his wife a speedy recovery,” he wrote. Ajsu Party chief Sudesh Mahto also paid tribute to Bhagat. “Bablu Da’s untimely demise has shattered me. This is an irreparable loss for the party,” Mahto said in a tweet. Chief minister Hemant Soren, finance minister and incumbent Lohardaga MLA Rameshwar Oraon and health minister Banna Gupta also condoled Bhagat’s death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/former-lohardaga-mla-kk-bhagat-found-dead/articleshow/88347737.cms||K A Gupta

---||Ranchi||State to review terms of agreement with NTPC on Patratu power plant||Ranchi: The Jharkhand government has agreed to review the terms and conditions of the joint venture — (JV) Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL) — taken up with the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) after a Congress MLA charged the central PSU with violating the terms of the agreement. The PVUNL was formed through a memorandum of agreement (MoA) between the Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL) and NTPC in 2015. During the question hour of the ongoing winter session of the assembly, Congress MLA from Godda, Pradeep Yadav, highlighted the violation of the terms of the agreement. He said, “The JV neither fulfilled its commitment to provide power to the state nor adhered to the timeline of commissioning of the first phase of the 2400MW power production by 2019.” The JV, signed during the BJP government, was supposed to provide 500 MW of power to the state. Yadav then asked the government if it was willing to revise the terms of the agreement or continue to purchase power at a higher rate from other sources. He also asked the government to explain any measures taken up to mitigate the power crisis in the state. In response, the minister in charge of power, Banna Gupta announced on the floor of the House that the terms and conditions of the JV would be reviewed. While answering Yadav’s question, Banna admitted that the project has been delayed and is expected to roll out its first phase by 2023-24. “There are some issues with the acquisition of 730-acre land and we are expediting the matter. As far as revising the terms of agreement with NTPC is concerned, the state is ready to ensure that the customers get adequate power supply,” he said. In a written reply, the government also clarified that in the wake of the delay in commissioning of the PVUNL plant, NTPC is providing 100MWs power to the state — 50 MWs each from its Farakka III and Korwa units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-to-review-terms-of-agreement-with-ntpc-on-patratu-power-plant/articleshow/88347515.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Bais has directed all the private universities to fulfill the criteria set by the UGC and the government at the earliest. He said education should not be taken as a business. “It is a matter of surprise and sorrow that the private universities established in our state are not fulfilling the criteria set by the UGC and the government,” he said. The governor was reviewing the academic and administrative activities of various private universities on Friday at Raj Bhavan. He pointed out that since the practice of granting recognition for opening private universities started, several varsities have mushroomed. Most of these universities operate without following the UGC and government norms. Referring to Chattisgarh, he stated how such universities (about 125), operating without norms were shut down and within two months only six universities were left. Bais urged the private universities to focus on quality education to ensure employment of the students. He stressed on improving the teacher-student ratio in the varsities. The governor said it is ironic to see many private universities neither have their own building not sufficient land even after getting recognition long ago. Bais also directed the universities to make arrangements for separate toilets for girls and the specially abled. Having attended the meet, additional chief secretary, higher and technical education, KK Khandelwal, said, “The governor is concerned about the status of higher education in the state. He has underlined the need that private varsities should have a land of at least 25 acres.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bais-slams-pvt-varsities-for-flouting-norms/articleshow/88347465.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the department, 42,631 vendors across 50 ULBs have been identified for the two-day training on food safety, cleanliness, hygiene and waste disposal. The training is part of Support to Urban Street Vendors programme under National Urban Livelihood Mission. Talking to TOI, director of municipal administration, Jharkhand, Vijaya Jadhav Rao, said: “The objective is to educate the street vendors on rules and regulations governing food safety as well as to inculcate best hygiene practices in them. The two-day training is being provided by experts of FSSAI. We are also compensating the vendors with Rs 500 to each of them per day for the training programme.” Adding further, Rao said that keeping the pandemic scare in mind, the vendors are also taught how to maintain Covid appropriate behaviour at their kiosks and they have also been trained on maintaining social distancing as well as installing sanitizers at their shops. After successful completion of the training, a certificate is being issued which the vendors can display at their stalls. The training module includes safe and hygenic procurement of farm products like vegetables and fruits and their management till it is sold to customers and tips on cooking. After completion of the first phase of training, the state urban development department has planned to organise a behavioural training programme for non-food street vendors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/street-food-vendors-get-training-on-hygiene-social-distancing/articleshow/88347705.cms||---

The remaining 13 labs, including the two named in the FIR - Nalwa Laboratories and Dr Lalchandani Labs - disposed of the waste in the open or mixed them with domestic waste, reports M S Nawaz. Syringes and other waste from testing were discarded near the testing sites, which included several Ganga ghats, police said. Investigating officer Rakendra Singh Kathith told TOI, "As the case (on Kumbh scam) was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, we had contacted Medical Pollution Control Committee (MPCC), which is the only agency in Haridwar equipped to collect and dispose of biomedical waste. The agency said only nine labs had entered into an agreement with them to collect the waste generated from Covid testing. It turned out most of the labs had not bothered to properly dispose of highly-hazardous waste. It is possible that the labs mixed the waste with domestic waste or dumped it in the open," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/did-13-of-the-22-labs-at-kumbh-dump-bio-med-waste-in-open/articleshow/88350009.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Schools & colleges to reopen, juniors to resume on December 27||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management on Friday allowed reopening of schools, colleges and other educational institutions in the city with immediate effect. Schools can resume Classes 6 to 12 for now while the junior students can return from December 27. Most schools said they will be reopening on Monday. This respite has, however, come at a time when Covid cases are again rising with Omicron infections being detected every day. Principals TOI spoke to said parents could now be reluctant to send their children to school. Covid spurt may hit attendance, feel schools The commission said that since it has received a large number of representations with "compelling necessity" to open educational institutions, permission has been granted with the AQI improving from "severe" to "very poor. The order pointed out that the arguments were on the following lines: "Children are out of school for about two years, leading to frustration among them with a serious adverse effect on their studies. A large number of students are not able to get the facility of online education because of connectivity issues. As per the academic programme, schools are required to impart education to children for about 220 days annually. Not opening schools is hampering physical and mental health as well as emotional growth of children." School education in the capital has been badly disrupted by closures because of air pollution and Covid. Senior students (9 to 12) had returned to school, albeit for practicals and clearing of doubts, in September. The junior kids returned on November 1. However, the deteriorating air quality forced the closure of schools once again on November 13 followed by reopening on November 29. That respite didn't last long and the schools were once again closed on December 3. Immediately after the commission issued its order, the DoE also issued instructions to the schools, asking them to inform the parents about the decision. Welcoming the reopening, the Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, an umbrella body, said, "As always, the school fraternity looks forward to welcoming our kids back to school. Schools can think of adjusting hours to make it comfortable for kids to reach schools in winter. I am certain that schools will ensure safe and smooth running of physical schooling." Some principals, however, are apprehensive that the spurt in the number of Covid cases may have an impact on attendance. "We will be starting school for Classes 6 to 12 from Monday. Now that the board exams are almost over, we can easily call 50% of the students. However, with Omicron cases rising in Delhi, I am not sure how the parents are going to react," said Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School. Some parents feel that the government will once again close down schools due to rising Covid cases. Tanya Aggarwal, parent of a Class 1 child, said: "A good move but too little, too late. There was no logic to delaying school opening for so long - first for Covid-19 and then for pollution - while everything else was open. We have lost a lot of time for no reason. This opening is meaningless as it coincides with the winter break, and if Omicron intensifies, children and their education are likely to be the first and easiest target of restrictions once again while election campaigns and other activities will continue unrestricted."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-schools-colleges-to-reopen-juniors-to-resume-on-december-27/articleshow/88350011.cms||---

HGCO19 is being developed by Pune-based Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited. Dr Ashish Bavdekar, one of the principal investigators heading the vaccine trials at Pune's KEM Hospital Research Center, said the Phase-1 data on HGCO19 immunogenicity was also very encouraging. "Side-effects, which have been reported only in a minority of volunteers, were very mild and non-significant. Quite a few volunteers have also reported no side-effects," he said. Dr Bavdekar said the minor side-effects reported were mild fever or headache. He said, " However, it is after the Phase 3 trials that the real picture will come out clearly, because the sample size was also much larger for this phase." Dr Sidram K Raut, director of Noble Hospitals, Pune, one of the trial sites for HGCO19, told TOI that the Phase III trial was likely to be completed by around December 22. Dr Prakash Shende, principal investigator of the HGCO19 vaccine trial at the Dr D Y Patil Hospital, Pimpri, said, "We have recruited over 40 participants for the Phase III trial. We have received enough safety data on the vaccine after the first two phases, hence almost 4,000 participants were enrolled for the Phase III trials. The follow up will last for a year." He said, "As far as the Phase 1-2 trials were concerned, side effects included injection site pain, a couple of volunteers reporting allergy-like rash at the injection site, body ache and mild fever. These side effects were auto-recoverable in some patients while the rest could get easily treated by medication."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-major-side-effect-seen-in-indias-first-mrna-vax-experts/articleshow/88350030.cms||Neha Madaan

This comes at a time when Bhutan is struggling to deal with growing Chinese pressure on their border as well as trying to work out a border deal with Beijing, which some reports had suggested did not suit India. The award is seen as a political gesture to India, underlining the importance of the relationship. Bhutan PM Lotay Tshering tweeted: "His Majesty pronounce Your Excellency Modiji's (Narendra Modi) name for the highest civilian decoration, Order of the Druk Gyalpo".

Tshering also said: "HM (His Majesty) highlighted all the unconditional friendship and support Modiji extended over the years." That Bhutan and India enjoy the closest relationship is well known.

At the annual defence dialogue (ADD) with France, defence minister Rajnath Singh conveyed India’s firm stance, backed by “appropriate deterrence on the ground”, against China’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo in eastern Ladakh in violation of all bilateral agreements, said sources.

With India and France acknowledging “their convergence” on a number of strategic and defence issues as well as the need to coordinate closely on counter-terrorism, the ADD discussed measures to strengthen cooperation across all domains, including maritime security, information-sharing, aerospace and defence-industrial collaboration. “The India-France strategic partnership is more relevant today than ever before. A wide range of bilateral, regional and defence-industrial cooperation issues were discussed in the ADD,” Singh said. Speaking at an event earlier in the day, Parly said cooperation in several areas including fighting climate change is required with a major country like China. “China is also a partner for trade and commerce. But we see as well that China is getting more and more aggressive in the region, and it is even more specific when it comes to the (South) China Sea,” she said.

French defence minister Florence Parly tells Rajat Pandit her country is committed to offering its best defence technology to India and collaborate in areas like AI,The French minister, who also met PM Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval, said India and France shared the view that the Indo-Pacific should remain an open, free and inclusive region, with freedom of navigation and trade for all without any “coercion”. With 33 of the 36 Rafale jets already inducted by the IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore deal inked in September 2016, Parly also said France could supply additional fighters – including the aircraft carrier-borne variant – if India wanted them. "Using the same aircraft is a real asset and strength. I am sure that there is room for new developments. We are ready to answer any additional needs or requests that could be made by India," she said. Identifying terrorism as a major challenge facing both France and India, she also expressed concern over the situation in Afghanistan. "Terror has struck France and Europe repeatedly over the last few years and has not spared the Indo Pacific, including India. This fight is not over and will continue for many years to come… this threat needs to be addressed in a comprehensive manner, from the Levant to Africa,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-political-will-ability-to-ward-off-china-india/articleshow/88350144.cms||Rajat Pandit

Kumar was presented with the award by Data Security Council of India in Delhi on Thursday. He was among 55 nominees from different parts of the country in the race. Kumar bagged the honour for his cyber skills during investigation and filing a chargesheet with scientific and circumstantial evidence, police sources said. While Kumar was not available for comment, CID officials said it was a case in 2020, wherein a 24-year-old student from Mangaluru was arrested by Kumar under Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000. “The ministry of home affairs had sent to the CID cyber cell details of a few suspects indulging in child pornography. This particular case was more serious in nature since the suspect was downloading stuff from different websites and selling it to persons outside the country. Being an IT student himself, the accused knew how to erase his trail. Kumar used digital forensic tools and techniques, carried out a flawless investigation and succeeded in arresting the accused in less than a month,” officials said. Kumar recovered around 70 clips of child pornography from the accused, which were stored in laptop and mobile phones. Investigation revealed the accused had sold more than 50 child pornography clips to 30 persons, all foreign nationals, in a span of sixeight months. This is the second time CID Karnataka is bagging the award. In 2015, MD Sharath, SP, cybercrime division, was honoured with India Cyber Cop of the Year award for solving an online job fraud case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-dsp-bags-national-award-for-child-porn-probe/articleshow/88350195.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Day after results, two students end their lives, one goes missing||HYDERABAD/WARANGAL: A day after the Telangana Intermediate Board declared the first year results, two students committed suicide in the state on Friday, while another went missing. Only 49% students of Intermediate first year from the 2020-21 batch cleared the exams. The first year exam results were released on Thursday leading to widespread outrage among parents who said the exams should not have been conducted in a pandemic year. Students too said they couldn't understand the lessons taught online during the year. In the first case, a 17-year-old student, who lived barely a kilometre away from Nalgonda railway station, left her house in the wee hours and jumped in front of a train at around 4 am. "The student failed to clear maths-1 paper by a few marks. The parents told us that she was upset with the failure. They told her to reappear for the examination and had also filed for re-evaluation," said S Koteswara Rao, station house officer, railway police, Nalgonda. The railway ground staff found the body on the tracks and immediately informed the station master. 'Guiding students to not give up'Her body was handed over to her parents after due procedure. We have registered a case under CrPC section of death under suspicious circumstances," said Koteswara Rao. The student has a younger brother who is studying in Intermediate first year. In the second incident, an Intermediate student hanged himself at his residence in Challagarige village under Chityal mandal of Jayashankar Bhupalpally district. SI G Krishna Prasad said the deceased was pursuing his Intermediate at Government Junior College in Hanamkonda. The 19-year-old failed in all the subjects and killed himself. Both his parents, working in Hyderabad as daily wagers, rushed to the village. In a separate case in Hyderabad, an Intermediate student, who failed in the first year exams went missing after leaving his uncle's house at Kushaiguda on Thursday night. His uncle, a private employee, lodged a complaint on Friday saying that his 17-year-old nephew was missing. "I admonished him for not studying properly and at 5.23 pm he left the house, and has not returned," the official added. Police registered a missing case and alerted the cops of all nearby police stations. Psychologists say they have been guiding students to take academic setbacks in their stride and not give up as every failure can be turned into a success story with little hardwork.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-day-after-results-2-inter-students-end-their-lives-one-goes-missing/articleshow/88350197.cms||---
---||Lucknow||PM to launch construction of 594-km Ganga e-way today||LUCKNOW: After inaugurating the Purvanchal expressway and laying the foundation stone of Jewar airport, PM Modi will be rolling out the construction of ambitious Ganga e-way project from Shahjahanpur on Saturday. The move could lend fresh traction to BJP's developmental narrative ahead of UP assembly polls, expected in the next couple of months. The 594-km expressway, inarguably country's longest, will start from village Bijauli village along NH-334 in Meerut and end at Judapur Dandu village near bypass of NH-2 in Prayagraj. It will traverse through 10 districts including Hapur, Bulandshahar, Amroha, Sambhal, Badaun, Shahjahanpur, Hardoi, Unnao, Raebareli and Pratapgarh. Airstrip in Shahjahanpur for fighter planesIt is at Shahjahanpur where a 3.5-km long airstrip is proposed to be built for emergency landing and take-off of fighter aircraft. Sources said Yogi Adityanath government seeks to highlight the expressway as one of the biggest infrastructure projects claiming basic spade work was done at the peak of the pandemic. Official sources in the UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) maintained that 94% of the land has been acquired for the project from around 83,000 farmers in the past one year when the second wave of Corona had brought the economic and other developmental activity to a grinding halt. The project covers a major part of the west UP region which had been hit by the farmers' unrest against the three farm laws. Projected as a "milestone" in the infrastructure development of the state, the Ganga Expressway will provide a direct road connectivity to the National Capital Region from the east UP region. "It will boost the income of agriculture, commerce, tourism and industries and will also serve as an industrial corridor," the spokesperson said. The project could potentially arm the BJP to escalate its developmental pitch even as the opposition flexes its political muscles to arrest the saffron juggernaut in the run up state polls, expectedly scheduled in the next couple of months, say political observers. A government spokesperson said that the state government had approved the Ganga Expressway project on November 26 last year at a cost of Rs 36,230 crore. UPEIDA sources said that around 18,55,000 saplings will be planted along the expressway for environmental protection, besides operating the project through usage of solar power. The six-lane expressway, expandable up to eight lanes will have 120 metres wide right of way, the total land area acquired for the construction of the roadway. It is also proposed to have a 3.75 metre wide service road at one side so that residents of nearby villages of the project area may get a smooth transportation facility. Along with this, nine public convenience centres, seven railway overbridges, 14 major bridges, 126 minor bridges and 381 underpasses will be built for the convenience of the people. Interchange facilities will also be provided at 17 places for entry and exit on the expressway. A service road will also be built for the residents of the villages around the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-to-launch-construction-of-594-km-ganga-e-way-today/articleshow/88350228.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Kolkata||Kolkata home bakers beat commercial bakeries with their innovative, bespoke goodies||The season for parties, decorations and playing secret Santas is finally here. But what makes Christmas more special are the cakes and cookies that add extra sweetness to everyone’s lives. Though traditional fruit cakes are the most popular ones, times and tastes of people have changed. Home bakers have been baking up a storm in their kitchens for quite some time now, and patrons are spoilt for choice when it comes to flavours, ingredients. CT spoke to a few home bakers to find out about the growing demand for their innovative cakes… Better scope to customise than commercial bakersHome baker Shirina Mukherjee feels that they get better scope to customise and innovate than commercial cake brands. “We can experiment on newer and upcoming trends and provide the same to customers,” she explained. According to food blogger and home baker Sayantani Mahapatra, the best part about ordering from a home bakery is the way they can accommodate the customer’s preferences. Whether it is vegan, eggless, gluten-free or sugar-free cakes on demand. While Shirina tweaks and decorates the cakes based on the client’s preferences, Sayantani is often requested by customers to bring in unusual flavours to the table. “Apart from traditional bakes, I love to make a lot of iced-sugar cookies for Christmas. I also try to introduce a couple of lesser-known Christmas favourites from different parts of the world,” said Sayantani. Secret recipes, signature stylesNot everyone would like to pander to the customer's preferences. Chef Rahul Arora believes in making traditional Christmas cakes during this time of the year. “My Christmas cakes are made with 43 ingredients according to an age-old Goan recipe. I will not change that for anyone. I cut all the fruits myself and the cake is made with pure butter and premium ingredients. I focus more on the taste of the cake than its look,” said Rahul. Srimoi Bhattacharyya, a home baker, feels everyone has a specific style. “We bake everything from scratch and come up with innovative ideas in terms of flavours and designs. And the best part is that everything’s made to order, which means if a customer has a certain idea of a cake, we do our best to turn that into an edible reality,” said Srimoi. Quality and Hygiene factors get prioritySince the fear of COVID is still looming large, customers are looking for hygienic stuff. According to Sayantani, most home bakers are now doing good business as they prefer to bake in smaller batches to maintain the hygiene and quality of the cakes. Since they operate from their homes, cleanliness comes naturally. And clients feel safer that way. “We might charge more than the popular bakeries but will always serve the premium quality nuts, butter and use real chocolate or real vanilla to bake a cake. Since we bake on order and deliver immediately, our cakes are always fresh,” said Sayantani. Upasana Biswas, also a home baker, agreed with Sayantani, saying, “Baking in smaller batches and working directly with our customers means we are more focussed on our quality and hygiene. Which gives us an advantage over commercial bakeries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-home-bakers-beat-commercial-bakeries-with-their-innovative-bespoke-goodies/articleshow/88347631.cms||Ruman Ganguly
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Ex-speaker KR Ramesh Kumar apologises for his ‘off the cuff’ rape remark||BELAGAVI: Former speaker and senior Congress MLA KR Ramesh Kumar, who had said ‘enjoy rape when it is inevitable’ in the assembly on Thursday, apologised on Friday for his ‘off the cuff remark’. “If it hurts the sentiments of women, I’ve no problem apologising. I apologise from the bottom of my heart,” Kumar told the assembly. He made the remark during the discussion on rain and flood damage when speaker Visveshwara Hegde Kageri found himself in a fix to wind up the debate and MLAs insisted on extending the debate. Though women legislators cutting across party lines planned a protest in the well of the House, Kageri did not give them permission. “He has apologised, let’s not drag it further,” he said urging male members of the House to uphold the dignity of women. After outrage over his remark, Kumar tweeted: “I would like to express my sincere apologies to everyone for the indifferent and negligent comment... My intention was not to trivialise or make light of the heinous crime, but an off the cuff remark!” National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma slammed the statement in her tweet: “It is extremely sad and unfortunate that we still have public representatives who are misogynists and have a horrible mindset towards women.” Delhi-based NGO Society for Securing Justice filed a complaint against Kumar with the governor to take legal action and disqualify him for his remark. The issue was also raised by Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani in Parliament. “If you truly believe in the cause of women, first stand here and denounce your legislator's words. Those men who stand in the well today, go back to your political organisation and first bring to justice such a man, then we will see who speaks for women and children in this country,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-ex-speaker-kr-ramesh-kumar-apologises-for-his-off-the-cuff-rape-remark/articleshow/88350256.cms||---

A detailed reply in this regard was submitted by SSP-rank officer MS Bhullar, who is a member of the SIT, before the HC in response to a petition filed by Dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh against Punjab Police's move to interrogate him in connection with the sacrilege cases. "The contents of the confessional statements of the accused in these cases would clearly indicate that the conspiracy for these scurrilous acts was hatched at a common place, which is the administrative block of Dera Sacha Sauda, Sirsa.

---||Hyderabad||Paddy row: TRS to hold protests across Telangana||HYDERABAD: The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has decided to intensify its fight against the Centre on the paddy procurement issue. As part of it, the ruling party will organise protests against the Centre's 'anti-farmer' policies in every village in all the 119 constituencies on December 20. In another important decision, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said the Rythu Bandhu scheme will be extended to farmers even if they continue to cultivate paddy. KCR, who held an emergeny meeting with party MLAs, MPs, MLCs, members of Rythu Bandhu Samithis and DCCB presidents on Friday, is believed to have pulled up the MLAs. Mincing no words, he advised the legislators to go to people immediately and explain to them on various welfare schemes and programmes. "Also, explain to the farmers by holding meetings at Rythu Vedikas as to why we are advising them to go for alternate crops. It is my responsibility to see that you are re-elected to the state assembly. But, if you do not maintain good relations with people, no one can save you," he warned. Demonstrations and dharnas and burning effigies of the Centre will be part of the protest programme on Monday. He is believed to have pulled up MLAs and MPs for failing to rebut state BJP and Congress leaders on their criticism of the government on the paddy procurement issue. "Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay and Union minister G Kishan Reddy attacked the state government on the paddy issue. They are spreading lies on paddy issue and Dalit Bandhu scheme and created a ruckus at procurement centres. Except some ministers and MLAs, many others have not reacted. This sends a wrong message," KCR said. Allaying fears of farmers, he said government would continue to provide Rythu Bandhu benefit even if they go for paddy. "CM rejected proposals of senior officials to stop giving Rythu Bandhu benefit for those who continue to grow paddy without paying heed to the requests of the government," Niranjan Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/paddy-row-trs-to-hold-protests-across-telangana/articleshow/88350272.cms||---

He was 97. His son and former MLA J Narasimhaswamy said Jalappa was hospitalised on December 10 as he was suffering kidney and lung ailments. He had suffered a paralytic stroke in February. Known as a loyalist of late CM D Devaraj Urs, Jalappa began his career in the 1970s and followed Urs when he quit Congress to form Indian National Congress (U). After the death of Urs in 1982, he joined hands with S Bangarappa and was instrumental in launching regional party Kranti Ranga. He played a vital role in establishing the first non-Congress political entity in 1983 when Janata Party, in alliance with Kranti Ranga and BJP, formed the coalition government and Ramakrishna Hegde became chief minister. Hailing from Idiga community, Jalappa was identified as a crusader of backward communities. He got the government’s permission to established Devaraj Urs Medical College for the benefit of such communities. Jalappa was in the eye of the storm when he was named in the infamous 1988 murder case of lawyer Abdul Rashid . He was acquitted in the matter while two police officers were convicted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-backward-classes-icon-ex-minister-rl-jalappa-dies-at-97/articleshow/88350285.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

"There are prima facie materials against the accused. So far 23 job aspirants had given statements of being cheated by the accused in this case. This court consistently, in the cases of job racketing, is finding innocents being cheated and lured, leaving their future questionable...job aspirants not only lose their money, they also lose their future," said Justice M Nirmal Kumar. Dismissing the two bail applications moved by the former AIADMK minister, the judge said it was pertinent for the probe to be concluded first. Justice Nirmal Kumar also refused to suspend the operation of the order for 15 days, as sought by senior advocate Ajmal Khan, representing the ex-minister, to enable them to move an appeal. Pointing out that job scam cases were always dealt with firmness, the judge said: "This case is one of job racketing. Hence, this court is not inclined to show any leniency on the petitioner." On November 19, the court granted interim relief to the petitioner by orally directing the police not to arrest him till further orders. According to the prosecution, FIRs have been registered against Bhalaji based on complaints that he had swindled 30 lakh from various people promising jobs in Aavin, a co-operative milk producing company owned by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/job-racket-cases-madras-hc-refuses-bail-to-rajhenthra-bhalaji/articleshow/88350346.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Lucknow||UP: At Nishads' rally, Amit Shah tries to consolidate non-Yadav OBCs||LUCKNOW: In a bid to consolidate its non-Yadav OBC vote bank with grand Hindu Samaj push, Union home minister Amit Shah said here on Friday that the previous SP and BSP governments in Uttar Pradesh functioned only for a few castes while PM Modi worked for the poor and all backwards. Shah was addressing a rally hosted by BJP's alliance partner NISHAD Party. 'SP, BSP never cared for giving recognition to backward panel'Shah said that SP and BSP claimed to be parties of the backwards but 'none of them worked to give constitutional recognition to the Backward Classes Commission'. "Did they (SP and BSP) work for the Nishad community or for any other caste under the OBCs?" he asked, adding "this work was done by PM Modi," Shah said at the "Sarkar Banao, Adhikar Pao" rally. He said for years, the Nishad community kept demanding a separate ministry for fisheries, which was fulfilled by only PM Modi. "During the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sanjay Nishad and Sadhvi Niranjan met Modiji and demanded a separate ministry, and Modiji fulfilled it. Today there is a separate ministry," Shah said. Nishads are a riverine community which make their living through riverine resources. Although there are claims and counter-claims about their actual number in UP, there is no denying that their votes play a significant role in swinging results on a large number of seats in eastern UP. Shah while recounting the schemes and measures taken by the BJP governments at the Centre and in UP for uplift of the community also recalled its glorious past and how Lord Ram was given shelter and home to stay during his days of exile by Nishad Raj at Shringverpur. His recounting of how Nishadraj had tears welling in his eyes when he saw Lord Ram and Sita sleeping on the ground while in exile, was received with a roaring applause by the crowd. "We have also been in pain all these years to see our Ramlala sheltered in a temple made of tarpaulin in Ayodhya. Who had stopped the work on Ram temple for all these years? It is because of the guidance and motivation by PM Modi that Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya and efforts to restore the grandeur of Kashi Vishwanath Dham are underway," he said. "I wanted to remind Nishads of Ramcharitmanas that talks of friendship between Lord Ram and Nishadraj," he added, in a bid to touch an emotion chord with the community which takes pride in the fact that their kings and ancestors were friends with Lord Ram and had helped him in the times of crisis. "The crowd that I see here shows there will be a government of BJP and Nishad party in the state. This time there will be more than 300 seats for us," he said, promising that all the promises made to the Nishad community would be fulfilled once BJP comes back to power in the state. Recounting the work done by the NDA government for the community, he said: "Projects worth more than Rs 20,000cr have been implemented through the fisheries ministry at the Centre. In UP, CM Yogi Adityanath has constituted a separate ministry for the fish-related trade and business. More than 5,900 fishermen have got credit cards. The system has also been put in place to allot the ponds on lease."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-at-nishads-rally-amit-shah-tries-to-consolidate-non-yadav-obcs/articleshow/88350352.cms||Neha Shukla

The incident took place around 11am during recess when several students rushed to the toilet of the 143-year-old Schaffter Higher Secondary School on S N High Road. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the wall, which did not have a foundation, could have been weakened by the recent rain. Even as students and teachers tried to save those caught under the debris, K Anbalagan (Class IX) of Narasinganallur, T Viswaranjan (Class VIII) of Thatchanallur, and R Sudeesh (Class VI) of Pazhavoor died on the spot. The bodies were later handed over to their families after autopsy. The injured students S Sanjay of Thatchanallur, M Isakki Prakash of Tirunelveli Town, Siekh Aboobakar Kithani of Vagaikulam and Abdullah of Kondanagaram are undergoing treatment at the Tirunelveli medical college and hospital (TVMCH). On Friday evening, school correspondent R P J Selvakumar, headmistress B V Persis Gnanaselvi and contractor John Kennedy, who built the wall, were arrested by the Tirunelveli junction police under Section 304(ii) of the IPC. 'Some victims could've been saved if rushed to hospital' Chief minister M K Stalin announced a solatium of 10 lakh each to the families of the deceased and 3 lakh each to the injured. Hospital dean M Ravichandran said the condition of the injured was stable. Some students said the victims could have been saved if they were rushed to the hospital without waiting for an ambulance. Students also alleged that a few teachers had cars but refused to use them to save the injured boys. Earlier in the day, some students went on a rampage damaging flowerpots, glass windows and other properties in the school. Traffic was diverted after some students resorted to a road blockade. The school will remain closed till December 26. District collector V Vishnu visited the injured students and inquired about their health. Tirunelveli MLA Nainar Nagendran (BJP) consoled the kin of the deceased. "Preliminary assessment of the collapsed structure is being carried out by the public works department. There is prima facie evidence that one of the four walls did not have a basement. Action will be taken after technical assessment. The district administration has formed a special team to assess the condition of all the schools in the district within 48 hours and submit a report," the collector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/3-die-as-wall-crashes-on-boys-in-tamil-nadu-school/articleshow/88350375.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Full school fees after March 15, pay to join class, says Calcutta high court||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court ruled on Friday that the 20% Covid discount on school fees would end on March 15, 2022, and students can attend classes from the new session only if the new fees are paid. The high court, on October 13, 2020, had asked schools to charge 80% of their usual fees, as online classes didn’t require students to physically attend school. “With the Covid-19 pandemic showing signs of abatement, and with the resumption of substantial normal activities in the new-normal period, the time has come to assess how our order dated 13th October 2020, as modified from time to time, should be further adapted to suit the changed conditions,” the division bench of justices I P Mukherji and Moushumi Bhattacharya remarked. The court also remarked that before re-admitting students in mid-March, the schools should inform parents and guardians of an estimate of fees and additional charges for compulsory facilities by February 15, 2022. The details of optional school facilities and their charges must also be provided by the schools, which would admit students only if the fees are cleared. “The schools shall specifically indicate the mode of instruction, whether online or offline, for which those fees and charges are being demanded,” the court specified, given the new-normal hybrid mode of education. The bench said fees must be paid a month in advance, considering the stand-off between parents and schools over non-payment. Considering the controversy created regarding non-payment of fees, from now on, fees and charges shall be paid in advance for each month,” the order said. The order also specifies that board examinees would have to clear board registration fees by the deadline fixed by schools, failing which the schools were free not to send candidates’ names for the board exam. The next date of hearing has been fixed for January 14. “The court has recognised that concession in school fees cannot be continued, and everybody has to adapt to the post-Covid scenario. After the cut-off date of March 15, schools will charge normal fees following the court’s directions. Schools will send the estimates of fees and other charges by February 15 so that parents have enough time to decide if their wards wish to continue with the same school or to admit them in another school,” said Sourav Bhagat, advocate for schools like Shri Shikshayatan School and South Point School. Schools have already submitted lists of defaulters to the court, along with the outstanding amounts against each name. Parents have been fighting the schools on the ground that while the court had earlier specified that only essential fees were to be charged, many have clubbed these with non-essential services, and hence the calculations that the schools had provided were differing from that of the parents. The court had later asked the schools to open an account where parents could deposit the “disputed” amounts. The HC on Friday said all other issues would be dealt with at the next date of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/full-school-fees-after-march-15-pay-to-join-class-says-calcutta-high-court/articleshow/88350385.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The government issued an order making it compulsory for everyone to stand while the song is sung during government events. However, people with disabilities have been exempted from standing while the song is being sung. The move comes a week after the Madras high court observed that 'Tamil Thai Vazhthu' is a prayer song and not an anthem. The Madras court said there was no statutory or executive order requiring the attendees to stand up when the song was played. The court was justifying Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam pontiff Vijayendra Saraswathi sitting when the song was played at a function organised in Chennai in 2018. In a statement, the CM said the Tamil language remains the way of life of Tamils. It is a reflection of their sentiments. Tamils are admiring the language as mother. Representatives of Tamil sangams, scholars and intellectuals had been appealing to the government to announce a song to hail such a language with rich literature, he stated. Since the private firms and education institutions can play an important role in popularising the Tamil language and take it forward to the younger generation, they should be encouraged to sing the song at the beginning of the event organised by them, the CM added. Meanwhile, TN BJP president K Annamalaihas asked the government to use the song fully, including the lines on belief in god, instead of using the abridged version.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stand-up-tamil-thai-vazhthu-now-state-song/articleshow/88350425.cms||---

After the seventh day, the state wants to make RT-PCR tests mandatory for these passengers so that only those who test negative can move around within the state. At present, only those arriving from 12 high-risk countries are subjected to RT-PCR tests and advised home isolation. Only 2% of the other passengers from abroad are randomly selected for RT-PCR tests at airports. State health minister Ma Subramanian said, "Now that passengers from non-risk countries such as Nigeria and Congo are also testing positive, we want to make home isolation mandatory for all international passengers." They will be subjected to RT-PCR tests after seven days and only if they test negative, will they be allowed to leave their homes. The state will be writing to the Union government seeking permission to implement the suggested changes, he said. According to official data presented by him, more than 14,800 international passengers (12,767 from high-risk countries and 2,101 from other countries) underwent RT-PCR tests in the last two weeks and 70 among them tested positive. The state laboratories have detected 'S-gene drop', a sign of the Omicron variant, in 28 of these patients. All the 70 samples were sent to the Centre for genome sequencing. The results of 10 samples were communicated to the state. Eight were found to be infected with the delta variant, one tested positive for Omicron and one was categorised as not-in-sequence, the minister said. The local body had started tracking the places visited by the first Omicron patient in Chennai in the recent past. A total of 11 people, who were in contact with him, have tested positive. On Friday, samples of another 259 people from Ramapuram and 59 in Saligramam, both in Chennai, were collected and sent for lab analysis. Test results are awaited, said J Radhakrishnan, state health secretary. The minister on Friday launched a government scheme -- SMS reminders on vaccination for pregnant women and children -- announced during the recent budget session. Every year, nearly 20 lakh pregnant women and children receive vaccination against 12 diseases under the universal vaccination programme (UIP). Earlier, seven different text messages were sent to these women mentioning the deadline for vaccine dates. Now, 25 messages will be sent regarding the inoculation dates, government registrations and financial aid during prenatal and antenatal period, said an official release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-asks-centre-to-allow-7-day-home-isolation-for-international-passengers/articleshow/88350430.cms||---

The state has achieved an overall score of 58.9, much above the national average of 48.3. Kerala has bagged the top spot among 11 smaller states while Lakshadweep has scored the highest among Union Territories and Mizoram among the states in the north-east. The report — commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) and prepared by the Institute for Competitiveness — was released on Thursday by EAC-PM chairman Bibek Debroy. Taking to Twitter, CM Mamata Banerjee said, “Great news for West Bengal! We have secured the top rank among larger states on the ‘Foundational Literacy & Numeracy Index’. I congratulate all teachers, guardians and members of our education department for this outstanding achievement!” The report indicates Bengal has scored heavily in providing educational infrastructure — “overperforming” in parameters like having more schools with proper drinking water, toilets and hand-wash facilities — and performrd “within expected range” in taking primary schools to a kilometre of households and providing electricity connection to primary schools. Percentage of teachers at primary level was goodWhere Bengal has lagged in educational infrastructure is in bridging the pandemic-induced digital divide, with fewer schools having internet and computers. The state has also done exceedingly well in the percentage of teachers at the primary level but has fallen behind the national average in arresting primary drop-outs, ensuring gross enrolment ratio and primary pupil teacher ratio. Bengal has also achieved a score of 100 in the adjusted Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) at the primary level for girls. In fact, the state has witnessed 82.7% enrolment among boys at the primary level against a 73.3% among girls, the difference of 9.4% making it the best performer among all large states. The all-India average is 83.2% for males, 67.1% for females. Two other categories in which Bengal has scored a 100 are arresting infant mortality rate and the state’s expenditure on mid-day meal. Only 17 states and four Union territories have scored above the national average of 48.3. While Kerala has topped the list of small states with a score of 67.9, Lakshadweep is the top-scoring UT with 52.69 and Mizoram the best northeastern state with a score of 51.64. Bihar and Jharkhand are the worst performers among the larger and smaller states respectively. State sources said the Centre has also appreciated the presentation by its experts on the bridge courses being prepared to plug the pandemic-induced academic gaps in school education, including at the primary level. The state has formed a three-member panel to collate data on this . The states were judged on five pillars comprising 41 indicators — educational infrastructure, access to education, basic health, learning outcomes and governance. The EAC-PM statement said out of five pillars, it was observed that states have performed particularly worse in governance.“More than 50% of the states scored below the national average, i.e. 28.05, lowest across all pillars,” it said. According to the statement, during the panel discussion organised on the occasion, Bibek Debroy said, “Education leads to positive externalities and the quality of education imparted is important especially during the formative years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-tops-among-large-states-in-foundational-literacy-index/articleshow/88350427.cms||---

---||Chennai||Display complaint numbers: Madras HC to eateries||CHENNAI: Restaurants should henceforth display complaint numbers and e-mail addresses of food safety officials facilitating consumers to register their grievances, Madras high court has ruled. Justice S M Subramaniam, ruling that an adulterated food adversely affects the fundamental right to healthy life, directed the commissioner of food safety to issue appropriate orders and ensure that Whatsapp and telephone numbers, besides e-mail addresses are boldly displayed in all commercial places and restaurants in a visible manner. "Health being fundamental right of every citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution, the offence of selling adulterated food must be seriously viewed, as it infringes on the fundamental right of the citizens... Food safety department and its duties and responsibilities are constitutionally important, and more specifically with reference to the fundamental rights," said Justice Subramaniam. The judge was passing the order while rejecting a plea moved by a grocery shop owner against penal action for selling adulterated masala products. Flagging corruption among field-level officials incharge of monitoring quality of food products, Justice Subramaniam said: "In the event of free hand being given to field-level officers, no doubt, there is a possibility of active or passive collusion with the traders and the commercial establishments, as we commonly know there are largescale corrupt activities amongst the field-level officers. One cannot brush aside that they are always yielding for the freebies provided by the traders and commercial establishments." He then said that if failure, lapses, dereliction of duty and negligence are noticed on the part of the officials of the food safety department, prosecutions are to be initiated, including disciplinary proceedings under service rules. The court further directed the commissioner to create awareness through visual and print media, so as to solicit the public attention and explain the ill-consequences in the event of consuming the adulterated food products. The rights of the consumers to register complaints are also to be published, the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/display-complaint-numbers-madras-hc-to-eateries/articleshow/88350441.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath woos Nishads with Ramayana recall||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath attributed the decimation of the “buababua” (SP & BSP) alliance in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to a “strategic partnership hammered out between Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Nishad Party president Sanjay Nishad”. He also recalled the tacit support of Nishads to BJP in the 2014 parliamentary polls, while addressing a joint rally — ‘Sarkar Banao, Adhikaar Pao’ — of BJP and Nishad Party in Lucknow’s Ramabai rally ground on Friday. Invoking the age-old ties between Nishads and Lord Ram since treta yuga, Yogi said, “Nishadraj had supported Lord Ram during his exile. He had told the Lord if you are not the King of Ayodhya, you are the king of Shringverpur.” Reiterating the affinity of Nishads to the saffron party, he asked, “Which follower of Nishadraj would not worship Lord Ram”. He said, Nishads celebrated the foundation of Ram temple in Ayodhya even as SP, BSP and Congress conspired to dispute Ram’s janmabhoomi. “We won the battle after struggle and a grand Ram temple is being built there. Now, a grand memorial of Nishadraj and Lord Ram will be built in Shringverpur,”he said. The CM revealed that in 2015-2016, SP government had plotted to kill Nishad Party chief Dr Sanjay Nishad. “Our timely intervention saved his life and got him justice,” he said while promising his unflinching support to the community. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-woos-nishads-with-ramayana-recall/articleshow/88350458.cms||Neha Shukla

Last week, BJP's Panaji MLA Atanasio 'Babush' Monseratte charged PWD minister Deepak Pauskar of "selling engineer posts", and said that the recruitment scam in the department was "worth at least Rs 70 crore". Pauskar had dismissed the allegations. "A three-member committee has been formed to inquire into the matter," Sawant said. "The committee consists of principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel, special secretary (vigilance) Ankita Anand and the director of vigilance." Till the report is submitted, the recruitment process would be kept on hold." Monserrate said that it would take time to conclude the inquiry, and the recruitment will be stuck as the code of conduct is to be imposed soon. "The inquiry cannot be completed in just 10 days," the Panaji MLA said. Sawant said that the youth should trust the chief minister's decision to order the inquiry. Reacting to Pauskar's claim that Monserrate may be upset because his recommended names may not have figured in the final list, Monserrate said "Everyone gives recommendations. I (too) have given recommendations. Even (the other) 39 MLAs must have given recommendations, but that does not mean I have asked him to make one from zero." "I have proof that people have paid the minister Rs 25-30 lakh for each engineer's post, and the minister has sold the posts to the highest bidder. It is a Rs 70 crore scam. This is my direct charge and allegation," Monseratte had told TOI. Ports minister Michael Lobo said that they are happy with the decision of the chief minister to order the inquiry. "The new government will decide now," he said. Lobo said that the staff selection commission is necessary to stop allegations of job scams. "If I am a minister in the next government, it would be my priority to put a staff selection commission in place."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-cm-pramod-sawant-orders-probe-into-pwd-job-scam-says-recruitments-on-hold/articleshow/88350484.cms||---

Sawant said that Goa has become the first state to introduce such a force. The pink force will work for tourists coming to the state, its personnel have been given expert training in counselling and how to act," he said, adding that it will work to reduce crime and increase detection. DGP I D Shukla said that if any woman calls the police control room, the pink force will reach the spot within five minutes and detain the accused. The pink force, with its 11 vehicles, will patrol the state, especially along the coastal belt. He also said that if a women complains that she is being assaulted, needs medical help or has met with an accident, the pink force will arrive at her house and admit her to hospital. "The pink force will not be involved in investigation of crime, but act for prevention," Shukla said. "This force is not only for women but will also look into issues concerning children and juveniles in conflict with law. The reason behind introducing the pink force is because khaki cannot provide solutions to all problems. The pink force is introduced so that mothers, children and others can openly talk to this force. When you understand a problem, then only you can solve it. If they don't 'tell' their problem, it cannot be solved." The DGP said that this force will work to keep the family intact and not file cases in every house. "Prevention is always better then cure," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-pink-cop-force-launched-to-focus-on-coast/articleshow/88350487.cms||---

Khaunte, who had launched a vitriolic diatribe against Sawant calling him 'Pappu' and even comparing him with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for Covid mismanagement that led to thousands of deaths in the tiniest state, was at pains to justify his move to join BJP. "Forget what I have said earlier. We should move ahead. We have to forget these minor differences and look at the future of Goa," he said. Khaunte, who had even said BJP was filled with "tainted members" and should get a "washing machine to clean them" after he was unceremoniously dropped by Sawant from his cabinet, said: "Today, we have to work together." He said by joining BJP, his "ideas and ideology" has not changed, but he joined to "take my ideas forward". "Political and ideological differences make for vibrant legislation. When we do legislation, there is no personal enmity. It is only about the issue. When we are in opposition and criticise the government, we try to put forth the issues before the government," Khaunte said. The former Porvorim MLA, who has been critical about the three linear projects that cut across the green lung of Goa-Mollem biodiversity hotspot-said his stand has not changed and he would continue to oppose them. "Earlier, we were in the opposition and were trying to put across our point. Today, we have a chance to sit together and resolve the issues in the interest of the state," he said. Khaunte joined BJP in the presence of Sawant, BJP's Goa election in charge Devendra Fadnavis, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and other functionaries. Sawant, while welcoming Khaunte into their fold, tried to downplay the personal attacks against him. "Constructive opposition is required in the assembly and in democracy. Till it is not there, the state cannot function properly. Whenever he has played the opposition's role, we have taken it positively and when required, he has supported the government," Sawant said. "Khaunte has not joined BJP for his gain, but to help the people of the state for the next 20 years. I assure you (Khaunte) that BJP is a parivar and you will get a lot of love. We will work together to expand the parivar," Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-rohan-khaunte-who-critiqued-bjp-and-cm-joins-party-to-move-ahead/articleshow/88350507.cms||Murari Shetye
