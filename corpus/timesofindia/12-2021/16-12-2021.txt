---||Goa||Amid sex abuse allegations, Goa minister Milind Naik resigns||PANAJI: In a big jolt to the BJP government in Goa ahead of the assembly elections scheduled early next year, urban development and social welfare minister Milind Naik resigned from chief minister Pramod Sawant’s cabinet late on Wednesday night after Congress named him in an alleged sex scandal. Naik said he was resigning from his post as a minister to “ensure free and fair probe into the case”. “I have accepted his resignation and sent it to governor P S Sreedharan Pillai,” Sawant told TOI. It was on November 30 that Congress state president Girish Chodankar had first alleged, without naming Naik, that a minister was involved in a “sex scandal” and gave Sawant-led BJP government an ultimatum of 15 days to act against the minister. Last week, Sawant had said he would act if the survivor in the alleged scandal files a complaint or if Congress names the minister involved. BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade had also challenged Chodankar to name the minister and had said if Congress names him, then BJP would immediately act. On Wednesday, after the 15-day deadline given by Congress passed, Chodankar publicly named Milind Naik and alleged that a Bihar-based woman was sexually exploited by the minister. He said the BJP minister, who is the Mormugao MLA, has misused his office, and that he has evidence to back his allegations against Naik. The CM said the government would conduct a proper investigation into the allegations. “We will look into all the evidence that has been provided by Congress and take appropriate action,” he said. Sawant also said Naik has told him that he will fight the case. “Whatever allegations have been made against him are at a personnel level,” Sawant told TOI, adding they do not plan to induct any minister in place of Naik. Two days earlier, Chodankar had met the governor and revealed the name of Naik to him and demanded that he be dropped from the cabinet. ‘Such a minister is a disgrace to all Goans’A minister is misusing his position and sexually exploiting a woman. Such a minister is a disgrace to Goa and all Goans. He should immediately be sacked and this government needs to show the people of Goa that ministers like Milind Naik, who exploit women, will not be spared,” Chodankar said earlier on Wednesday. Chodankar had claimed that an acquaintance of his has video, audio recordings to back the allegation of sexual exploitation. Congress also released some of the evidence, including photographs. Earlier in the day, Mormugao police registered a FIR against Congress vice-president Sankalp Amonkar and others based on a complaint supposedly filed by a woman in Bihar on charges of extortion, stalking, criminal conspiracy and various sections of the Information Technology Act. The woman had filed a complaint at a police station at Bihar on December10 alleging that Congress is coercing her and trying to defame her. But soon after Chodankar’s announcement, Amonkar filed a complaint against Naik with the women’s police station accusing the minister of sexually abusing and raping a woman, forcing her to undergo an abortion and threatening her with dire consequences. He met PI Sudiksha Naik of the women’s police station and submitted evidence in support of his complaint. He said this included the victim’s mobile phone containing audio and video messages, discussions and WhatsApp chats between Naik and the woman. “I am ready to face all allegations,” Amonkar told reporters. “I am ready to face arrest. I won’t apply for anticipatory bail. What crime have I committed?” Mahila Congress president Beena Naik had also issued a two-day ultimatum to Sawant to sack Naik from his cabinet. “Else, we will take stern action. All women of Goa will take a morcha to the minister’s residence and pull him out of his house,” Naik had threatened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-social-welfare-minister-milind-naik-resigns-after-congress-names-him-in-sex-scandal/articleshow/88306503.cms||Murari Shetye

---||World||US virus toll nears 800k; 75% of deaths among 65+||WASHINGTON: As the coronavirus pandemic approaches the end of a second year, the US stands on the cusp of surpassing 8,00,000 deaths from the virus, and no group has suffered more than older Americans. All along, older people have been known to be more vulnerable, but the scale of loss is only now coming into full view. Seventy-five percent of people who have died of the virus in the US — or about 600,000 of the nearly 800,000 who have perished so far — have been 65 or older. One in 100 older Americans has died from the virus. For people younger than 65, that ratio is closer to 1 in 1,400. The heightened risk for older people has dominated life for many, partly as friends and family try to protect them. “You get kind of forgotten,” said Pat Hayashi, 65, of San Francisco. “In the pandemic, the isolation and the loneliness got worse. We lost our freedom and we lost our services.” Since vaccines first became available a year ago, older Americans have been vaccinated at a much higher rate than younger age groups and yet the brutal toll on them has persisted. The share of younger people among all virus deaths in the US increased this year, but, in the past two months, the portion of older people has risen once again, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 1,200 people in the US are dying from Covid-19 each day, most of them 65 or older. In both sharp and subtle ways, the pandemic has amplified an existing divide between older and younger Americans. In interviews across the country, older Americans say they have continued to endure the isolation and fear associated with the pandemic long after tens of millions of younger and middle-aged people have gone back to work and school and largely resumed normal lives. Older people are still falling seriously ill in great numbers, particularly if they are unvaccinated, and hospitals in the Midwest, New England and the Southwest have been strained with an influx of patients this month. Worried about their risks, and the ongoing warnings from health officials about the added dangers for older people, many of them are still curtailing travel, and are dining out less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-virus-toll-nears-800k-75-of-deaths-among-65/articleshow/88306679.cms||---
---||World||Omicron’s rapid spread could soon lead to wave, warns CDC||WASHINGTON: The new omicron coronavirus mutant speeding around the world may bring another wave of chaos, threatening to further stretch hospital workers already struggling with a surge of delta cases and upend holiday plans for the second year in a row. The White House on Wednesday insisted there is no need for a lockdown because vaccines are widely available and appear to offer protection against the worst consequences of the virus.  But even if omicron proves milder on the whole than delta, it may disarm some of the life-saving tools available and put immune-compromised and elderly people at particular risk as it begins a rapid assault on the United States.  "Our delta surge is ongoing and, in fact, accelerating. And on top of that, we're going to add an omicron surge," said Dr Jacob Lemieux, who monitors variants for a research collaboration led by Harvard Medical School.  "That's alarming, because our hospitals are already filling up. Staff are fatigued," leaving limited capacity for a potential crush of Covid-19 cases "from an omicron wave superimposed on a delta surge."  Most likely, he and other experts said at a press briefing Tuesday, an omicron surge is already under way in the United States, with the latest mutant coronavirus outpacing the nation's ability to track it.  Based on specimens collected last week, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said omicron accounted for about 3% of genetically-sequenced coronaviruses nationally. Percentages vary by region, with the highest - 13% - in the New York/New Jersey area.  But Harvard experts said these are likely underestimates because omicron is moving so fast that surveillance attempts can't keep up.  Globally, more than 75 countries have reported confirmed cases of omicron. In the United States, 36 states have detected the variant.  Meanwhile, delta is surging in many places, with hot spots in New England and the upper Midwest. The five states with the highest two-week rolling average of cases per 100,000 people are New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Michigan, Minnesota and Vermont.  Universities are abruptly closing classrooms during finals week with infections multiplying at a fast rate. The NBA is postponing games and the NFL had its worst two-day outbreak since the start of the pandemic, with dozens of players infected.  Outside the US, the president of the European Union said omicron will become the dominant variant in a month and declared that "once again, this Christmas will be overshadowed by the pandemic".  Scientists around the world are racing to understand omicron, which has a large number of worrisome mutations in important regions of its genetic structure that could affect how well it spreads from person to person. How quickly the number of cases doubles, known as "doubling time", can give a preview of what the disease burden could be in a few weeks.  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday that early data suggests omicron is more transmissible than delta, with a doubling time of about two days.  In Britain, where omicron cases are doubling every two to three days, the variant is expected to soon replace delta as the dominant strain in the country.  "The data out of the UK are quite alarming at this point," and foreshadow what's to come in the United States, said Bronwyn MacInnis, director of pathogen genomic surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. For example, she said, by Tuesday afternoon, omicron was already the most common variant in London.  In many ways, omicron remains a mystery. Hints are emerging from South Africa, where it was first reported, indicating it may cause less severe disease than delta but be better at evading vaccines.  But, MacInnis warned: "There's much more that we don't know about this variant than we do, including the severity."  At the same time, Lemieux said, there seem to be fewer tools to fight it. Some monoclonal antibody treatments don't work as well against omicron in lab tests, Lemieux said. Vaccines appear to offer less protection, although CDC officials said booster shots strengthen that protection.  Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Wednesday there is no need, for now, for an omicron-specific booster shot. The two-dose mRNA vaccines, the Pfizer and Moderna shots, still appear to offer considerable protection against hospitalization from omicron, Fauci said.  "If we didn't have these tools, I would be telling you to be really, really worried," Fauci said.  Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the US has the tools to fight the virus, including omicron, and "there is no need to lock down".  With vaccines available now for 95% of Americans, "we know how to keep our kids in schools and our businesses open. And we're not going to shut down."  Health officials called on Americans to get vaccinated, get their booster shots, wear masks indoors and get tested before travelling and before holiday gatherings.  "Hospital capacity is already at a breaking point in many states because of severe cases of Covid-19," Michael Fraser, CEO of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said in a statement.  Given the high level of transmission, MacInnis said there will undoubtedly be severe cases.  "No matter how severely it affects healthy, fully-vaccinated and boosted populations, it will hit the most vulnerable among us the hardest still," she said. "So the elderly, the immunocompromised, other vulnerable populations will still be at greatest risk and still bear the brunt of this."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-faces-a-double-coronavirus-surge-as-omicron-advances/articleshow/88306815.cms||---

The donation from Serum Life Sciences, wholly owned by the Poonawalla family, is Oxford university’s largest ever gift for vaccines research. It will be used to create a new facility to house more than 300 research scientists in the Old Road Campus. Named the Poonawalla Vaccines Research Building, it will house the headquarters and main laboratory space of the Jenner Institute where the Oxford University/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine was developed, as well as other leading Oxford teams such as those developing a malaria vaccine. It will be built on the same site as the recently announced Oxford University Pandemic Sciences Centre and the two buildings will share infrastructure and support facilities for scientific research and academic teaching and together will form a unique hub that will contribute to global pandemic preparedness. Professor Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of Oxford University, said: "The university has longstanding ties with the Poonawalla family and we were delighted to confer an honorary degree on Cyrus Poonawalla in the summer of 2019 in recognition of his extraordinary work manufacturing inexpensive vaccines for the developing world. I am delighted that through this generous gift we will be able to further our work on vaccines which have proven so critical to global health." Future Serum Institute-Jenner Institute collaborations include an agreement for Serum Institute to manufacture and develop, with large-scale supply, the Jenner Institute’s promising malaria vaccine, currently in Phase III trials, prioritising countries with high malaria burdens. Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute, said the success of collaboration between the university and Serum Institute on the malaria and Covid-19 vaccines highlighted the potential of partnerships between universities and manufacturers to develop and supply vaccines cost-effectively at scale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/poonawalla-family-donates-rs-500-crore-to-oxford-university-to-build-new-vaccine-research-centre/articleshow/88306828.cms||NAOMI CANTON

A memo circulated by Google's leadership said employees had until Dec. 3 to declare their vaccination status and upload documentation showing proof, or to apply for a medical or religious exemption, according to the report.  After that date, Google said it would start contacting employees who had not uploaded their status or were unvaccinated and those whose exemption requests were not approved, CNBC reported.  Employees who have not complied with the vaccination rules by Jan. 18 will be placed on "paid administrative leave" for 30 days, CNBC reported, followed by "unpaid personal leave" for up to six months and termination.  When contacted by Reuters, Google did not directly comment on the CNBC report, but said, "we're committed to doing everything possible to help our employees who can get vaccinated do so, and firmly stand behind our vaccination policy."  Earlier this month, Google delayed its return-to-office plan indefinitely amid Omicron variant fears and some resistance from its employees to company-mandated vaccinations. It earlier expected staff to return to office for about three days a week from Jan. 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/google-says-employees-flouting-vaccination-rules-will-eventually-be-fired/articleshow/88306855.cms||---

At the outset of the hearing, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati raised the issue of alleged media mis-reporting, but a bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna asked the Centre not to pay much attention to media reports and focus on ensuring that the Rs 50,000 ex-gratia is disbursed to all those who lost their loved ones to Covid. “There may or may not be under-reporting of deaths. We are not here to say that. But 10,000 deaths, but a much larger number of applications submitted, so a common man may think so... But our anxiety is that people should get relief and government should work in that direction,” the bench said. The court said that as a welfare state it would be better if more and more people approached the government to claim the relief. The court directed all states to give wide publicity through print and electronic media, particularly in vernacular newspapers, to make people aware on how and where to approach to make a Covid ex-gratia claim. It expressed satisfaction at the Gujarat government’s decision to publish advertisements in newspaper and said that other states also should also use same format. The Gujarat government in its fresh affidavit told the court that it has received a total of 40,467 applications so far, of which 26,836 applications have been approved and 23,848 families have been paid compensation. The court, however, pulled up Maharashtra government for not being prompt in disbursing the amount after the court was informed that only 1,000-odd families had been granted relief when the number of claim applications so far filed was over 85,000. It granted 10 days to disburse the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pay-rs-50000-ex-gratia-to-all-those-who-lost-loved-ones-in-covid-sc-to-centre/articleshow/88307078.cms||---

You are one among the over 7 lakh buyers who are fighting a frustrating waiting period running into months, and sometimes almost a year. The shortage of semiconductors and the sudden surge in demand post opening of the economy, as well as launch of new models — some of which have become blockbusters — has meant a long queue for deliveries as buyers scramble to purchase the vehicles. Sadly, for many, the delay in delivery means that they will need to pay more for their vehicle as prices applicable at the time of delivery need to be paid. Inputs costs have been going up for car companies, and on an average have increased by around 6% since the beginning of this year. There are waiting periods running into several months, and even a year for some, and the top models include Mahindra XUV7OO SUV, Maruti’s CNG variants, and SUVs such as Hyundai’s Creta, Kia’s Seltos, MG’s Astor, Tata’s Punch, Mercedes’s GLS, and Audi’s eTron electric. So, how long is the waiting list that customers are enduring across individual brands? Maruti, the country’s biggest car maker with some of the most popular models, has a customer backlog of as many as over 2.5 lakh cars. Company MD & CEO Kenichi Ayukawa has often apologised to buyers for the delays, and top officials say that the situation is unprecedented. "I have never seen this kind of a situation ever in my long career," Maruti director (sales & marketing) Shashank Srivastava says. "The waiting period is across models, for almost all the manufacturers." Hyundai, the second biggest maker, has an equally big problem to tackle with over one lakh undelivered vehicles. Company MD S S Kim says that customers are always kept in the loop about delivery positions to ensure transparency. The global shortage of semiconductors has emerged as a big impediment to any chances of an early ramp-up in production, and companies say that it will take time for the situation to normalise. The current assessment is that the problem will persist at least until the first half of 2022. Tata Motors, which is riding high on the success of new models, is also estimated to have a waiting backlog of over one lakh cars. "Waiting period for various models varies between one and six months. Overall, our pending bookings are more than 3.5 times of our monthly sales," Shailesh Chandra, president of Tata Motors’ passenger vehicles business, says. The chip shortage, in fact, is having a very negative impact on the nascent electric vehicles business. The green vehicles pack in a lot of technology and require numerous chips as part of their architecture. Chandra agrees, "For electrics, the waiting period is the highest, and we are fast ramping up our supplies." Then there are other companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra, which have seen superlative demand for new launches such as the Thar and the XUV7OO SUVs. Company director (auto sector) Rajesh Jejurikar has often said that the order-book has even surpassed their internal expectations by a wide margin, with delivery schedules spread across months. According to dealer estimates, the delivery schedules for certain variants of the Thar are as long as one year, and the XUV7OO has seen an even faster ramp-up with the initial 50,000 bookings made in just two days. "Cumulatively, 50K XUV700s are spoken for, signifying a value of near Rs 10,000 crore. The customer enthusiasm is staggering… we respect the responsibility it puts on us," Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra had said in a tweet after the units were sold in just a three-hour booking window. Santosh Iyer, the VP for sales and marketing at Mercedes Benz, says that companies have to go the extra mile to compensate buyers whose deliveries spill out beyond the promised timelines due to parts shortages. "Customers who couldn’t get the promised delivery during Diwali were offered holiday vouchers. We are constantly communicating with them, and also write letters to them explaining the situation. The idea is to assure them that we have not forgotten them after taking their money," Iyer says. MG Motors’ new SUV, the Astor, also saw 5,000 units being booked in just 20 minutes. The company has a cumulative booking book of 46,000 units. Companies have been trying to ramp up production and procure chip supplies to cut down on the customer queue. Many expect that with the festive season behind us, there could be some let-up in the rush at dealerships, till at least the new year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-7-lakh-car-buyers-in-queue-to-take-delivery/articleshow/88307135.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Business||Government unveils 76,000 crore plan to boost semiconductor manufacturing||NEW DELHI: India finally took a giant leap towards getting semiconductor and display fab manufacturing into the country through a Rs 76,000-crore incentive package, the move coming at a time when shortages in the supply of the critical component have hit industrial production across automobiles, electronics and other technology-led sectors. Previous efforts at getting companies to invest in India had not yielded much results, but the government feels that the presence of a strong domestic market as well as suitable incentives and enablers will get the companies in this time. Communications and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the decision after the Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cleared the proposal, which seeks to put India in the global league of top electronics manufacturing nations such as China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. TOI was the first to report on the incentive package for semiconductors in its edition dated November 1. With no local manufacturing, India meets its semiconductors needs through imports, which is estimated to reach around $100 billion by 2025 from the about $24 billion now. Foreign exchange outflows have been assuming alarming proportions with rapid growth in the adoption of digital products such as smartphones, laptops, electronic gadgets and IoT devices as well as new-age cars and vehicles. The biggest pinch from the absence of local manufacturing was felt at the time of the Covid-19 lockdown when a global surge in the demand for electronics saw a worldwide shortage of chips, hitting countries like India the most. This prompted the government to quickly stitch up a comprehensive incentive package, which worked towards building up an ecosystem, and the entire process was overseen by the Prime Minister’s Office. The government is in talks with top global companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, Intel, AMD, United Microelectronics Corp, and Fujitsu, among others. In India, Tata Group and Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta have also spoken about their interest in semiconductors. Vaishnaw said that incentives have been lined up for companies engaged in silicon semiconductor fabs, display fabs, compound semiconductors, silicon photonics, sensor fabs, semiconductor packaging and semiconductor design. "Today's historic decision will boost development of the complete semiconductor ecosystem, ranging from design, fabrication, packaging, and testing," Vaishnaw said. The government expects that around 1.35 lakh jobs will be generated through the measure over the next four years. Vaishnaw said that while electronics manufacturing in the country currently stands at around $75 billion, it is expected to grow to as much as $250 billion over the next five years. "Imagine, how much we will benefit if this surge is met by local manufacturing of chips. The industry tells me that with local sourcing, we can even touch $300 billion dollars in electronics manufacturing."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-unveils-76000-crore-plan-to-boost-semiconductor-manufacturing/articleshow/88307207.cms||Pankaj Doval

In new economic projections released following the end of a two-day policy meeting, officials forecast that inflation would run at 2.6% next year, compared to the 2.2% projected as of September, and the unemployment rate would fall to 3.5% - near if not exceeding full employment. As a result, officials at the median projected the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate would need to rise from its current near-zero level to 0.90% by the end of 2022. That would kick off a hiking cycle that would see the Fed's policy rate climb to 1.6% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 - nearing but never exceeding levels it would consider restrictive of economic activity. It is, in outline, the "soft landing" that Fed officials hope will transpire, with inflation gradually easing in coming years while unemployment remains low in a growing economy. The timing of the first hike this year, the central bank said, would now hinge solely on the path of a job market that is expected to continue improving in coming months. Dropped from the policy statement was any reference to inflation as "transitory," with the Fed instead acknowledging that price increases had exceeded its 2% target "for some time." Annual inflation has been running at more than double the Fed's target in recent months. To open the door to rate hikes, the Fed announced it was doubling the pace of its bond-buying "taper," putting it on track to end the program, initially begun at $120 billion per month, by March. US stocks added to modest gains after the release of the statement and projections while yields on Treasury securities rose. The dollar strengthened against a basket of major trading partners' currencies. Traders in interest rate futures were pricing a first hike in May, and two more by the end of 2022. Though the Fed made any rate hikes contingent on some further improvement in the job market, the new policy projections left little doubt that borrowing costs will rise next year, absent a major economic shock. All 18 policymakers indicated at least a single rate increase would be appropriate before the end of 2022. All told, the new projections and policy statement began to pin down the central bank's plan to "normalize" monetary policy following nearly two years of extraordinary efforts to nurse the economy through the fallout of the pandemic. That is still underway, the Fed acknowledged, with the new Omicron coronavirus variant adding to uncertainty about the course of the economy. But the Fed, at this point, said economic growth is still expected to be 4.0% next year, an increase over the 3.8% projected in September and more than double the economy's underlying trend. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2.30 pm EST (1930 GMT) to elaborate on the new policy statement and answer questions about the central bank's economic outlook.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/fed-sees-three-rate-hikes-in-2022-as-inflation-battle-begins/articleshow/88307277.cms||---

The commission was part of a $768 billion annual defense package passed by the Senate 89-10 after similarly overwhelming approval last week by the House of Representatives.  President Joe Biden, who controversially pulled out US troops in August to end America's longest war, is expected to sign the National Defense Authorization Act.  The Commission on Afghanistan will include 16 members appointed by the two major parties and was given a deadline to issue an initial report within a year of its first meeting, and a final report within three years.  "The Commission shall conduct a comprehensive assessment of the war in Afghanistan and make recommendations to inform future operations with tactical and strategic lessons learned, including the impact of troop increases and decreases and date-certain deadlines," the legislation said.  President Barack Obama poured tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan after taking office in 2009 but later withdrew most of them.  The administration of his successor Donald Trump negotiated a deal with the Taliban that set a May 2021 timeline for US troops to leave.  The commission will also look at George W. Bush's launch of the war as well as US policy on Afghanistan before 2001, when the September 11 attacks triggered the US invasion that overthrew the Taliban's draconian earlier regime.  The National Defense Authorization Act also renewed strong congressional support for Taiwan amid rising tensions with China, which claims the self-governing democracy as part of its territory awaiting reunification.  The act calls on the United States to develop Taiwan's asymmetric defense capabilities and to invite the island to take part in 2022 in the Rim of the Pacific exercise, major US-led drills that are held every two years around Hawaii.  The bill boosts US defense spending from last year by $28 billion, most of the increase not requested by the Biden administration.  It includes a 2.7 percent pay raise for both military servicemembers and civilian workers at the Defense Department.  Amid intense polarization in Washington, the bill sidestepped several controversial issues including calls to impose sanctions over the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany and to repeal the 2002 authorization of the invasion of Iraq.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-sets-up-commission-on-afghanistan-failures/articleshow/88307416.cms||---

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said that the prosecution failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt against the accused and remarked that it is “shocked” and “amazed” by the manner in which the trail court and the Allahabad HC dealt with the case to prove guilt of the accused in the case. It said that some of the findings of the HC are “foreign” to criminal jurisprudence and the HC order also fell in the ambit of conjectures and surmises. “We are amazed by the manner in which the high court has dealt with the present matter,” the bench said while allowing the appeal filed by the accused Momin Khan, Jaikam Khan and Sajid. “We, therefore, find that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction and death sentence imposed on the accused is totally unsustainable in law,” the bench said. Momin was accused of murdering his parents, brother and other relatives following a property dispute, with the help of Jaikam and Sajid. Momin’s wife was also sentenced to death by the trial court but the HC set aside her conviction. According to the prosecution, on January 23, 2014 all the four accused killed Momin’s father, mother, brother Shaukeen Khan, sister-in-law Shanno, nephew and his brother’s niece in Bulandshahr. After analysing all evidence, the apex court said that the trial court and HC had erred in convicting them when the evidence was not convincing enough to prove the guilt. “It is really surprising, as to how the additional sessions judge could have dealt with the present case in such a casual manner when he was considering the question of life and death of four accused,” it said The bench said that the findings of the trial court and the HC was not only contrary to the well settled law of the Evidence Act but attempts were made to put a burden on the accused, which does not shift unless prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. “The high court further goes on to have an academic discussion with regard to the possibility, preponderance of probability, a scientist conducting his experiments with great care, choosing between two or more possibilities, and preponderates of one over the other, etc. The law, however, that is fully settled, is that, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-acquits-three-on-death-row-for-murder-of-six-in-up/articleshow/88307570.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Several political leaders have also given similar controversial statements in connection with the disputed site in Mathura, where a 17th-century mosque is situated. The controversy over the Krishna temple was triggered last year after a Lucknow-based lawyer and five others had filed an appeal in a Mathura district court, claiming that the mosque site is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. A local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking “removal” of the 17th-century mosque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sole-survivor-of-helicopter-crash-group-captain-varun-singh-succumbs-to-injuries/articleshow/88307584.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||World||US releases new batch of documents about JFK assassination||WASHINGTON: The National Archives on Wednesday made public nearly 1,500 documents related to the U.S. government's investigation into the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  The disclosure of secret cables, internal memos and other documents satisfies a deadline set in October by President Joe Biden and is in keeping with a federal statute that calls for the release of records in the government's possession. Additional documents are expected to be made public next year.  There was no immediate indication that the records contained new revelations that could radically reshape the public's understanding of the events surrounding the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination of Kennedy in Dallas at the hands of gunman Lee Harvey Oswald.  But the latest tranche of documents was nonetheless eagerly anticipated by historians and others who, decades after the Kennedy killing, remain skeptical that, at the height of the Cold War, a troubled young man with a mail-order rifle was solely responsible for an assassination that changed the course of American history.  The documents include CIA cables and memos discussing Oswald's previously disclosed but never fully explained visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies in Mexico City as well as discussion, in the days after the assassination, of the potential for Cuban involvement in the killing of Kennedy.  One CIA cable describes how Oswald phoned the Soviet embassy while in Mexico City to ask for a visa to visit the Soviet Union. He also visited the Cuban embassy, apparently interested in a travel visa that would permit him to visit Cuba and wait there for a Soviet visa. On Oct. 3, more than one month before the assassination, he drove back into the United States through a crossing at the Texas border.  Another memo, dated the day after Kennedy's assassination, says that according to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Oswald communicated with an identified KGB officer while at the Soviet embassy that September.  After Kennedy was killed, Mexican authorities arrested a Mexican employee of the Cuban embassy with whom Oswald had communicated, and she said Oswald had "professed to be a Communist and an admirer of Castro," according to the cable.  One CIA document marked "Secret Eyes Only" traces U.S. government plots to assassinate the Cuban leader at the time, Fidel Castro, including a 1960 plot "that involved the use of the criminal underworld with contacts inside Cuba."  Another document weighs whether Oswald, while living in New Orleans, may have been affected in any way by the publication in the local newspaper of an interview an Associated Press correspondent conducted with Castro in which Castro warned of retribution if the U.S. were to take out Cuban leaders.  The new files include several FBI reports on the bureau's efforts to investigate and surveil major mafia figures like Santo Trafficante Jr. and Sam Giancana, who are often mentioned in conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's assassination.  Apart from the Kennedy investigation, some of the material would be of interest to scholars or anyone interested in the minutiae of 1960s counterespionage, with pages and pages of arcane details on such things as the methods, equipment and personnel used to surveil the Cuban and Soviet embassies in Mexico City.  In blocking the release of hundreds of records in 2017 because of concerns from the FBI and the CIA, President Donald Trump cited "potentially irreversible harm." Even so, about 2,800 others were released at that time.  The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations have persisted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-releases-new-batch-of-documents-about-jfk-assassination/articleshow/88307762.cms||---

The discussion will include booster or third dose for high-risk people as well as vaccination for children, a senior official source said. “We will review the programme in December end. The picture will be clearer then in terms of Omicron. At present our priority is to maximise coverage of second dose among adults, which includes people who are at risk also,” the official said. Till Wednesday, over 135 crore doses were administered across the country. While 87.5% of the adult population have received at least first dose, around 56% are fully covered with two doses. The deliberation in the month end will also include evaluation of data of Omicron cases detected through genome sequencing, breakthrough infection and hospitalisation. “Once majority of the adult population are protected with two dose against severe disease and mortality, we can evaluate whether there is a need to give booster to those who are at high risk or high exposure. Any such decision has to be based on scientific evidence and not just because there is a new variant,” the official said. The scientific advisory groups of the government including the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the Indian Council of Medical Research are actively considering evidence to start booster or third dose for high-risk people including those who are immunocompromised, elderly and healthcare workers. Officials say vaccinations for children may have to wait given that there is limited availability of vaccines and if it is a choice to be made between booster and child immunisation, third dose for those who are at high risk is likely to be given a priority. Also, at present, booster shots are being considered only for select population and not all adults. Why students and doctors in Mumbai can't wait to get their Covid vaccine shotsThe World Health Organisation in its recent technical update on Omicron said there is some preliminary evidence that the incidence of reinfection has increased in South Africa, which may be associated with humoral (antibody-mediated) immune evasion. However, there is still uncertainty. Besides, evidence suggests unvaccinated people have at least 10 times higher risk of death from Covid-19 than someone who has been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-to-review-allowing-booster-doses-vaccination-for-children-by-end-of-month/articleshow/88307532.cms||Sushmi Dey

In a video, the minister, who was attending a government function to inaugurate an oxygen plant, can be seen purportedly abusing a journalist of a TV news channel, and then grabbing his collar, lunging towards him and snatching his mobile phone which was recording the interview. "Don't ask questions like a fool. Have you lost your mental balance? I will beat you here," he is heard saying in Hindi. "What do you want to know? You turned an innocent person into an accused. Aren't you ashamed?" The TV news channel journalist later told TOI, "We were just doing our job. I'm yet to get my phone back."

The Mi-17V5 helicopter crash had claimed 13 of the 14 people on the same day. On December 9, Group Captain Singh was shifted from Wellington's Military Hospital to Command Hospital here. The officer, who was travelling with General Rawat as his liaison officer for a visit to the Wellington-based Defence Services Staff College, is survived by an 11-year-old son, an eight-year-old daughter, and his wife. His father, Colonel K P Singh (retd) served in the Army Air Defence (AAD). Until Tuesday, the hospital had maintained that his condition was "critical but stable." The nature of injuries and severity of the burns proved costly for the decorated IAF officer. On Wednesday, the IAF said in a tweet: "IAF is deeply saddened to inform the passing away of braveheart Group Captain Varun Singh, who succumbed this morning to the injuries sustained in the helicopter accident on 08 Dec 21. IAF offers sincere condolences and stands firmly with the bereaved family." In a first, the IAF Command Hospital had requested and received a cadaver from Victoria Hospital skin bank. While there was no official confirmation, sources said that since the request came close on the heels of Group Captain Varun Singh being admitted here, it increased the likelihood of 1,000 sq cm fully processed skin being used for him. Group Capt Varun Singh's mortal remains will be be airlifted to Bhopal on Thursday with the funeral planned for Friday, said sources in the IAF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/grp-capt-varun-survivorof-iaf-copter-crash-dies/articleshow/88307978.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||‘We can now recreate Indian electronics with Indian brands’||Bengaluru: There was a time when computers meant HCL, Wipro, Zenith. TVs meant BPL, Onida, Weston, Dyanora, Beltek. In mobile phones, while Indian brands like Micromax, Karbonn and Lava were not dominant, they had a substantial presence.Many of these brands no longer exist. If they do, few buy them. “We are a colony of China,” says Ajai Chowdhry, co-founder & former chairman of HCL, a man who some call the father of Indian hardware. China’s phenomenal advances in electronics manufacturing, and that of Taiwan and South Korea in semiconductors, and the absence of any serious effort by India to match it, led to Indian brands being destroyed by those from these countries.The massive Rs 76,000-crore incentive scheme for semiconductors the government announced on Wednesday – on top of the previously announced production-linked incentives for electronics – has raised the hopes of almost everyone in the Indian electronics and semiconductor space. “This is what I have been waiting for since 2009. We can now recreate Indian electronics with Indian brands,” says Chowdhry.IT industry body Nasscom said that over the next six years, “this programme will form the foundation of a new era in electronics manufacturing and will form a vital pillar of the government’s AatmaNirbhar Bharat (self-reliant) vision.”Rajen Vagadia, president for India at US semiconductor major Qualcomm, said the programme “has a holistic long-term vision and includes several critical aspects aside from manufacturing, like growing the pool of skilled engineering talent in India via the Chips to Startups (C2S) scheme and support to design firms and start-ups, through the Design Linked Incentive (DLI) scheme, which will further propel local innovation and IPR within the India ecosystem.” He said it closely aligns with many of the design and innovation initiatives for India that Qualcomm has invested in over the years. Parag Naik, co-founder of Saankhya Labs, one of India largest ventures in semiconductors, said prima facie, the scheme looks like just what the doctor ordered. “It will kickstart the fledgling semiconductor ecosystem in India and can be a game changer,” he said.Semiconductors are at the core of electronics products. Global device makers in the US, China, South Korea normally source semiconductor chips designed in their own countries. Even when they manufacture their final products in India, the chips are imported. Domestic industry believes it is vital to design chips and manufacture them locally in order to create a vibrant local domestic electronics industry. It’s also the area where the highest value-addition happens. “The most important part of the policy is the incentives for design. We have world-class designers. HCL alone has 5,000-10,000 (chip design) engineers, but they are all now designing for the world,” Chowdhry says. The world’s biggest semiconductor companies also have vast numbers of engineers in India, but all of them design for their own companies. The design-led incentive scheme is potentially a big encouragement for these engineers to come out of these companies to establish local ventures. Satya Gupta, the immediate past chairman of the India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA) and CEO of Seedeyas Innovations, says the government must use part of the funds to create two big semiconductor parks in two different parts of the country. These parks, he says, must be planned in a way that each has a fab, ATMP (assembly, testing, marking, and packaging) facilities, equipment suppliers, and design companies. And they must ensure clean water, uninterrupted power, facilities to produce the chemicals and gases required for fabs, and effluent treatment plants. “That’s the best way to ensure they all benefit from each other. And foreign companies will be delighted that they are getting everything in one place,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/we-can-now-recreate-indian-electronics-with-indian-brands/articleshow/88307993.cms||Sujit John
---||Bengaluru||General Bipin Rawat chopper crash: Ace test pilot Varun Singh had applied to be an astronaut||BENGALURU: Group Captain Varun Singh, the lone survivor of the IAF chopper crash who breathed his last on Wednesday was among the IAF test pilots who had applied to be part of the Gaganyaan programme as astronauts. However, Group Captain Singh, who was recently conferred with the Shaurya Chakra for his act of gallantry, had not made the final cut. A senior IAF officer, who was in the thick of things when the astronaut selection at Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) was underway, said: “He had cleared some of the initial tests, but is not among the four who were finally selected for the programme.” Group Captain Singh too has acknowledged this in a letter he wrote to his school a few months earlier. After graduating from the National Defence Academy in 2003, he was commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2004 and mainly flew Jaguars and Tejas during his flying career. He was among IAF’s best pilots, having cleared the experimental test pilots course and was conferred with the Shaurya Chakra on August 15, 2021. According to the IAF, the Shaurya Chakra — India’s third-highest gallantry medal — was conferred on him on Independence Day this year for his quick-thinking and actions during an emergency when he was a Wing Commander with the Tejas fighter squadron of the IAF. According to IAF, he was on a sortie on the Tejas jet on October 20 last year to “test the aircraft’s flight control system and pressurisation system”, and while at a high altitude, the fighter’s pressurisation system failed. The pilot managed to identify the problem and initiated descent to a lower altitude for landing. Further, the flight control system failed during descent leading to a total loss of control of the aircraft, which rapidly began losing altitude rapidly. Amid all the challenges, Group Captain Singh chose not to eject, but managed to bring the aircraft under control and land it safely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ace-test-pilot-singh-had-applied-to-be-an-astronaut/articleshow/88307994.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Why power cuts in power-surplus state, Bengaluru citizens ask Bescom||BENGALURU: From disruptions in online classes and work presentations to electrical appliances getting damaged — frequent power cuts and fluctuations have become pain points for Bengalureans. Manoj Joshi, a resident of Shantinagar, south Bengaluru, says attending online classes under flickering lights or in complete darkness has become routine for his eight-year-old son. “Just a drizzle is enough to disconnect power for an entire day. These days even if it is slightly cloudy, I get worried,” he adds. Like Joshi, many parents are hassled by frequent power snags. With many schools yet to resume offline classes, they are forced to juggle work-from-home meetings, domestic duties and interruptions in children’s online classes. S Varun, a resident of Srirampuram in central Bengaluru, who is enrolled in a university abroad, has to not only adjust with the time difference, but also power supply issues. “I have come down for holidays. But power outages are so frequent in this area that I’m finding it difficult to meet assignment deadlines. We really don’t know who to contact as the problem seems to be somewhere else. Clearly, no work has been taken up in our lane.” Amina Begum, a teacher, says power cuts are a nightmare for them. “It affects WiFi connectivity as well. When this happens frequently, students don’t take our classes seriously,” the Jayanagar resident adds. Nidhi S, an IT professional residing in Nagashettihalli, north Bengaluru, says UPS backup too only lasts to a certain extent. “In apartment complexes, we rely mostly on common back-up, which powers the entire complex. Sometimes, when we are busy, we don’t remember to charge phones or laptops and in case of a power snap, it becomes very problematic as we have meetings till late evenings. Power cuts have increased over the past months...” Appliances, gadgets at riskSatyen Kamat from Sahakarnagar, says advance notification could make life easier. “While we subscribe to an English newspaper, Bescome’s says it announces power outage notifications through a regional paper. If informed in advance, we can plan our day accordingly,” adds Kamat. Another constant worry, say Bengalureans, is appliances and gadgets getting damaged. Prashanth Gowda, a training manager in an MNC, says fluctuations in power supply has cost him two adapters. “It also cost me at least 10 working days,” adds the Magadi Road (west Bengaluru) resident. Another resident of Sanjaynagar adds: “In the last six months, we spent over Rs 5,000 on getting the fridge fixed every now and then, thanks to sudden voltage fluctuations. Eventually, we had to invest in a new one.” Umesh Kumar, a techie and resident of KR Puram, says power cuts have forced him to shift his workplace to coffee shops and shopping malls in the neighbourhood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/why-power-cuts-in-power-surplus-state-citizens-ask-bescom/articleshow/88308004.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

But more than the low salary what’s worrying him the most is the uncertainty pertaining to regularisation of his services. “We have been hoping that the government will absorb us as full-time employees. But the government is thinking of going in for fresh recruitment, ” he said. There are 14,500 other guest lecturers like him who are teaching at 430 government colleges across the state, and who face the same predicament. Scores of guest lecturers staged a demonstration at Maharani’s Science College in Bengaluru on Wednesday demanding the government halt the lecturer recruitment process and regularise their services. Lokesh KB, a guest lecturer who has been in the service for eight years, told TOI that according to Karnataka Civil Service Rules, if any department wishes to recruit new employees, it must first absorb those who are already serving on a part-time basis. “We have examples of this in the recruitment of doctors and teachers in Morarji schools across the state. Most of my colleagues are highly qualified and have been working for over 10-15 years as guest lecturers. Instead of absorbing them, the government is recruiting new lecturers, which is against the rules,” he said. Narendra Kumar, a guest lecturer for 13 years, said while government-appointed lecturers and principals are paid above Rs 70,000 and in lakhs, respectively, their salary remained Rs 11,000 per month (at eight hours per week). “Even that amount is not given regularly. We are paid whenever they get funds,” he said, adding that West Bengal pays Rs 36,000 to their guest lecturers. “Around 160 guest lecturers succumbed to Covid but not a single family has received any monetary support from the government,” he added. On Monday, the government announced forming a committee to look into their demands, but protesters say they don’t trust it unless a concrete order is passed. “When Siddaramaiah was the CM, a committee headed by writer Baraguru Ramachandrappa was formed, but there were no results after that,” Kumar said, adding that as soon as they announced their protest, two months’ salary was released to push them into submission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/regularise-our-service-guest-lecturers-tell-govt/articleshow/88308005.cms||Farheen Hussain

The event is scheduled to be held from December 16-19 at Golden Amoon Resort, Hoskote, Bengaluru Rural district.A division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi gave this direction after hearing a PIL filed by a city-based doctor.The bench also wanted to know if any measures have been taken by the state government to ensure adherence to standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid-19 during the event.The petitioner claimed around 3,000 delegates from across the nation are expected to attend the event and given the current situation over the Omicron variant, this conference may become a super-spreader.Advocate Shridhar Prabhu submitted that the petitioner filed the PIL as a whistle-blower.About the conference, he argued that in case any attending doctor is found Covid-positive, the entire gathering will have to be quarantined, which will also include government paediatricians.“Even if one doctor is infected, all 3,000 attendees will have to be quarantined. It would be akin to quarantining the army when we are in the midst of a war,” he added.Prabhu further submitted that such an eventuality would adversely affect existing medical facilities at hospitals in the state and these doctors wouldn’t be available to attend to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/healthcare-conference-hc-seeks-status-on-permission-covid-sop/articleshow/88308007.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||HC extends stay on demolition of Janatha Bazaar||Bengaluru: Pulling up the government as well as BBMP for their failure to submit responses after nearly two years, the high court on Wednesday further extended the stay order against demolition of Janatha Bazaar building on Kempegowda Road.On January 17, 2020, the court had granted one month’s time to the government and civic agency as their final opportunity to file responses. However, till date no response has been filed by either, as also BDA. Further, the government advocate said he has no instructions to give on the issue.Terming it a sorry state of affairs, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said the manner in which the government authorities are treating the court orders cannot be appreciated.The bench noted that cases cannot be heard in the absence of proper assistance from the state’s side and they are unnecessarily kept pending. It directed that a copy of this order be placed with the chief secretary for issuing instructions to the authorities concerned, including local bodies, to ensure proper assistance to the court.“If we are compelled to pass strict orders against the authorities for their non-cooperation in disposal of cases, then we will not hesitate to do so in future,” the bench warned before adjourning the hearing.In its PIL filed in 2018, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) sought protection and conservation of the Janatha Bazaar building since it is an ‘Asiatic heritage building’. According to the petitioner, ‘Asiatic Building’ was inaugurated on September 11, 1935 by the erstwhile yuvaraja of the state of Mysore, Sri Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar, to house the Asiatic Company, a life insurance pioneer set up in June 1913. The building was one of Bengaluru’s earliest multi-storey commercial complexes. Acting on the PIL, the HC passed an interim stay order vis-a-vis the demolition in March 2019, and the same was extended time and again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-extends-stay-on-demolition-of-janatha-bazaar/articleshow/88308013.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Struggling BFC hope to arrest the slide vs ATKMB||Bengaluru: Bengaluru FC coach Marco Pezzaiuoli may disagree but for the Blues faithful, the struggles of the team in this season's India Super League reminds them of last year's disappointment when the team finished seventh.A panicking defence and the strikers’ inability to convert the chances, except for Brazilian Cleiton Silva, are two of the major concerns for the think-tank as they continue the search for a win against ATK Mohun Bagan in Bambolim, Goa on Thursday."We had one of the best training sessions today. (Looking back) we deserved more points. Especially, when you see how many chances we had. We need to step up, step by step. It's not easy against an opponent like ATK but we need to take the three points. The luck will come back but you need to keep working,” Pezzaiuoli told reporters in a virtual interaction.Comparing the team's performance with what he saw last year, the coach said: "It's not the same. It’s a totally different style now. When I saw the team last winter, the opponents were having 8-10 chances every game and now we are talking about 1 or 1 ½ chance. But I was disappointed after the match against Goa and we need to improve."With central defender Yrondu Musavu-King ruled out till January, the coach is expecting the seniors to guide the youngsters. "The experienced players need to guide the youngsters. Irrespective of who’s injured, the players who take to the field must look to bring the best out of each other,” Pezzaiuoli said.“ATK Mohun Bagan are a quality team with players like Roy Krishna, Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco. They play well on the counter, and we need to make sure that we are well organized and prepared for any attack,” Pezzaiuoli added.BFC are yet to taste a win in five games, as their fortunes crashed after a fine opener against NorthEast United. Bagan, meanwhile, are also winless in three previous encounters. Result: Mumbai City 1 (Rahul 86) bt Chennaiyin FC 0.

In 2019, there were 1,235 cases under trial in different courts of the state. The number rose to 2,844 in 2020 and touched 2,575 by October this year. Also, cases booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are also on the rise, show state police records. In 2019, police had booked 1,658 cases and it reached 4,052 in 2020. This year, till October, 4,565 cases were booked against drug peddlers. While 378 accused were convicted on drug-peddling charges in 2019, it was 817 in 2020 and 471 till October this year. Special public prosecutor P Prasanna Kumar said more courts handling NDPS cases should be set up in the state. “We have only one court for such cases in Bengaluru and there are over 1,000 chargesheets filed by cops and are pending trial. Also, the same court is designated to handle civil issues, making it difficult to dedicate time for NDPS cases. It is high time that more courts, dedicated to deal with NDPS cases, were set up. There is also a delay in getting reports from Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) on the drugs seized,” he said. Advocate Srinivasa Rao said the Supreme Court is contemplating whether police investigation is complete without the FSL report or not and will soon pronounce its verdict. “In most cases awaiting the scientific analysis report, the chargesheets are placed before trial courts for statistical purpose. As the courts can only proceed on the basis of substantiate material, which includes FSL reports, the matters are put to rest without any progress,” he said and recalled how the high court recently observed that there was an immediate need for a dedicated government laboratory to test drugs. “However, the special public prosecutor shall try to persuade the home department to provide field test kits to all police stations in Karnataka, if not already provided. He shall also convince the government on the need to establish a separate forensic science laboratory for conducting tests for articles seized under the NDPS Act. The registry is directed to send a copy of this order to the chief secretary and additional chief secretary, the home department, Vidhana Soudha,” the high court observed in a case wherein Rao is appearing on behalf of the accused. A senior IPS officer said earlier it took one year for FSL staff to examine and submit reports on samples sent to them in drug cases such as narcotic substances and biological samples like urine and blood. However, with the increase in number of staff and setting up of dedicated narcotic sections in the five regional forensic science laboratories, pendency time has come down to five months. Six FSL unitsKarnataka has six FSL units with the main unit in the city and regional ones in Mysuru, Mangaluru, Davanagere, Belagavi and Kalaburagi. Around 220 staff work in these units and Bengaluru has around 120 staff. “On an average, between 100 and 120 samples of drugs are tested per month in all the six units. The narcotic department in each unit has specialised staff to examine the drugs and submit the report,” he said  According to him, majority of the samples sent to FSL are of ganja. “Other narcotic substances like synthetic drugs form a small portion and are examined in Bengaluru FSL,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/not-enough-courts-drug-cases-under-trial-see-spike/articleshow/88308721.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

While the seven-member inter-ministerial team visited flood-affected Tamil Nadu in November, Union home ministry sources told TOI that the team was yet to submit its report and it may take a month to compile assessment reports. A team led by Union home ministry joint secretary and financial advisor, NATGRID, Rajiv Sharma visited the state on November 22 for an on-spot assessment of damage with a mandate to recommend whether the disaster can be considered to be of ‘severe nature’. “The state government has so far spent 8,998 crore out of State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF), but the Centre has not released funds (National Disaster Relief Fund) so far. There is a negative grant of 7,900 crore. The state has intimated the Centre about natural calamities, in spite of it we have not received the funds. They are keeping us in the dark,” DMK Parliamentary party leader T R Baalu told Lok Sabha on Tuesday. State governments undertake relief measures from the state disaster relief fund, comprising contributions from both the Centre (75%) and states (25%) as per the recommendation of the finance commission. To supplement the efforts of states, additional financial assistance is extended from the NDRF in case of disasters of severe nature. Central Chennai MP Dayanidhi Maran said TN reported record rainfall for the third time in the last two centuries. “I want to remind our BJP friends and the Prime Minister that when a similar incident took place in 2017 in Gujarat, 500 crore was released to Gujarat within three days. Tamil Nadu is also a part of India. I appreciate the way Gujarat got the funds, we should also get similar funds,” the DMK MP said. VCK MP D Ravikumar reminded that the chief minister wrote to the Centre seeking adequate funds immediately, while Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi hit out at the Centre for allocating little funds in the past.In his reply to DMK MP P Wilson, Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai on Wednesday said “on receipt of the ministerial team’s report, additional financial assistance is considered, as per the established procedure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mps-in-parl-demand-central-aid-for-floods/articleshow/88308021.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Chennai||First Omicron case confirmed in Tamil Nadu, results of 7 contacts awaited||CHENNAI: At least one person in Tamil Nadu is infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-Cov2, health minister Ma Subramanian said on Wednesday. The genome sequencing of the sample drawn from the 47-year-old man who travelled to Chennai from Nigeria via Doha on December 10 showed that he carried the variant. The test was conducted by the ICMR’s National Institute of Virology in Pune. At least seven of his contacts, including six relatives, have tested positive for Covid-19 so far. One of the co-passengers on flight, a resident of Valasaravakkam in Chennai, tested positive on Wednesday. “Scientists say they saw S-gene drop in all these patients during the RT-PCR test. This is a strong indicator that they could also be carrying the same variant,” Subramanian told reporters. All the eight patients are showing mild symptoms, said doctors at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine. All the patients, except a 16-year-old boy, have taken two doses of the vaccine. Health workers are now tracking down close contacts and relatives of the co-passenger who tested positive. International studies are now showing that Omicron infects and multiplies nearly 70 times faster than the Delta variant and the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 in the human bronchus. "We strongly recommend two doses of the vaccine. Nearly 85 lakh people are due for the second dose. No one is safe until everyone gets the vaccine," said health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Over the past 10 days, 42 people who have come from other countries have tested positive for Covid-19. All of them are isolated in hospitals. Of these, three people have been discharged after they tested negative and all others are exhibiting mild symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/first-omicron-case-confirmed-in-tn-results-of-7-contacts-awaited/articleshow/88308022.cms||Pushpa Narayan

The arts and culture department has initiated a move by asking the government agencies concerned to facilitate this by issuing the necessary directions. The move is expected to benefit about 10,000 folk artists engaged in different types of traditional art forms across the state. In a communique, the arts and culture department cited a Government Order issued in 2010 which emphasised that folk arts should be conducted in the festivals and cultural events organised by private firms including IT companies and factories. The commissionerate of industries and commerce and ELCOT must take steps to ensure that the traditional arts are conducted in such festivals and issue necessary orders, it said.  Commissioner of Culture Sandeep Nanduri said that his department had written to the commissionerate of industries and commerce and ELCOT in this connection about a month ago. The move is expected to benefit the various folk artists in the state, he added. V C Srisailam, president of The Event Managers Association, said that festivals conducted by IT companies already have a confluence of folk arts such as Parai Attam, Thappattam, Mayilattam and Karakattam. “Employees of several IT companies have their roots in the rural pockets of Tamil Nadu and they want our traditional folk art forms to be showcased in cultural events. The fresh move will ensure 10,000 folk artists benefit,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/folk-art-to-be-part-of-fests-in-it-cos/articleshow/88308023.cms||---

Justice S M Subramaniam, directing police to take immediate steps to seal the premises of Pals Restaurant on Anna Salai, said police should conduct frequent inspections and identify the clubs, restaurants, associations across the state and initiate action in the event of illegalities. The court passed the order while disposing of a six-year-old case, originally filed by A Jayaprakash in 2015, seeking action against the restaurant for organising obscene dance shows and serving liquor without license. The PIL-petitioner said that he visited Pals Restaurant to watch ‘cultural dance’ he was charged an entry fee of Rs 400. He was also shocked to notice that obscene dance shows were being organised at the restaurant in the guise of cultural shows. “Young girls aged between 16 to 35 were made to dance in the shows,” he alleged. Responding to the plea, the government advocate submitted that an inspection by the jurisdictional police revealed that the owners of the restaurant had been misusing the licence obtained to organise cultural dance shows and were conducting obscene dances. Recording the submissions, the court said, “the allegations are undoubtedly seriously affecting the public order and it causes greater nuisance to the public at large.” When such illegalities are allowed to continue for a continuous period, no doubt the same would cause greater infringement of rights to the citizens. Noise pollution is also created. While performing the obscene dances, loud speakers are used in violation of noise pollution rules and it creates issues in that locality, the court added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/seal-restaurant-hosting-obscene-dance-hc-to-cops/articleshow/88308025.cms||---

Factors such as IT employees exploring large houses due to work from home, online classes and wafer-thin profit margins for affordable housing developers have pushed the demand for mid-level and premium flats. The trend is likely to continue for the next five years, a developers’ body has said.The FICCI-ANAROCK report found a 16% jump in the number of launches in the mid and premium segments during 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its height and from January-September 2021 compared with the combined launches in 2018 and 2019. The mid and premium segments fell under the price bracket of 40 lakh to 1.5 crore. Of the approximately 19,900 units launched in 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, at least 64% were in these segments. In the pre-pandemic period of 2018 and 2019, the two segments had a share of 48% of the 28,700 units launched. At the same time, supply in the affordable segment, at less than 40 lakh per unit, dropped to 28% post-pandemic from 45% in 2018 and 2019, the report added. Moreover, 2021 recorded the second highest number of launches between January and September since 2018.The report further said the city’s southern parts continued to lead in launches and sales during the past three years accounted for about 62% and 66% of supply and absorption. With several buyers seeking affordable housing deferring their purchase decisions due to the pandemic and subsequent increase in demand for mid and premium segments, developers are preferring such units over affordable housing due to wafer-thin profit margins.Suresh Krishn, president of CREDAI (Tamil Nadu chapter), said that while retrenchment and salary cuts became common in non-IT sectors, employment in the IT industry continued to thrive during the pandemic. “It created need for more space to work from home without disturbance and children attending e-schooling,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/city-buyers-prefer-middle-premium-apartments/articleshow/88308026.cms||---

Neither this is subject to modification nor correction by the general council. Even coordinator and joint coordinator cannot amend it as per the new bylaw. The Madras high court on Tuesday dismissed as not maintainable a public interest litigation challenging election of Panneerselvam and Palaniswami as coordinator and joint coordinator on December 6. In a statement, Sasikala said the cadres should stay united and succeed in their foremost responsibility of protecting the bylaws from going to ruins. “Let us all work relentlessly until we succeed,” the close-aide of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa said.Her petition challenging the conduct of general council and its resolutions passed in 2017 ousting her from the post of general secretary and creating new posts of coordinator and joint coordinator is pending in the city civil court.Continuing to introduce herself as “general secretary” of the AIADMK, Sasikala said that she had dedicated her life for the well-being of cadres and the people of Tamil Nadu. “Cadres, don’t worry.

In a statement, the senior minister said the permits to quarry operators were granted only after the latter presented a detailed mining plan on the production of blue metal for a year. The operators could avail permits based on monthly payment for the units. “Permit was given to quarry operators on fortnightly or monthly basis during the previous AIADMK regime. But there were chances of the same permit being used for all 15 days,” the minister said. He was responding to former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, who had on Tuesday alleged irregularities in the new permit system.

With the expansion to e-mobility, the TVS-BMW Motorrad partnership has gone from a production cooperation to a platform design and development cooperation. “TVS is an important partner to strengthen the e-mobility part of BMW Motorrad,” said Markus Schramm, head of BMW Motorrad. The enhanced cooperation will help launch the “This is a global scale platform for urban mobility in electric with a cool, next-generation tech-enabled focus,” added Sudarshan Venu. Although investment details were not announced, “numbers will be big given that it is a new platform” said Schramm. TVS’ own aggressive investments in electric mobility so far “will help in this new platform as well though each platform will have its own focus,” added Venu. The partnership’s expansio into EV with the new platform is in addition to the existing ICE platform for global and domestic markets which too will see “more product extensions in the next 24 months including a successor of the 310 model range,” said Schramm. As for TVS, the company will launch a “range of electric vehicles in the next 24 months including the new urban mobility product being jointly designed and developed with BMW Motorrad,” said Venu.

Experts opined that increasing the visibility of charging infrastructure will boost EV sales in the state. Tamil Nadu at present has 45,300 battery-operated vehicles — seventh highest in the country, according to transport department data. Despite a steady growth in EV sales, inadequate charging infrastructure still acts as a deterrent. So far, not a single public charging station was set up using government funds under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) scheme in Tamil Nadu. Only now the Union heavy industries ministry has sanctioned 651 charging stations for Tamil Nadu under phase II of the FAME scheme. Abhinav Soman, Programme Associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a policy-research institute, said that at this initial phase, private players might not see an opportunity for setting up charging infrastructure and it is a great sign that the government is willing to kickstart the process. "Once the business viability picks up, the EV charging network will develop organically. But it is harder to answer if it is enough. In the larger context, maybe there are not enough EVs to have a much denser charging network," Soman said. Mansoor Ali Khan, a Chennai-based EV maker said that the government initiative will definitely reduce the EV-related range anxiety, but it will boost sales only when they come up with a universal charging model, just like how motorists can refill fuel tanks of conventional diesel or petrol vehicles. "Right now, every manufacturer, be it Ola, Ather or Bounce, have adopted different technologies and there is no clarity whether all EVs can be charged at public charging stations," Khan added. Another problem could be the charging time. On an average, it could take four to eight hours to fully charge an electric car. But manufacturers are optimistic that with better battery technology and fast charging options, this could come down to 20 minutes in the coming months. A senior official from the state steering committee for EV said typically drivers use public charging stations to top up the batteries against full charging. Even with limited infra, people are taking up long-distance trips using EVs now. But it requires additional planning, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/650-ev-charging-stations-to-come-up-in-tn-along-chennai-highways/articleshow/88308035.cms||Ram Sundaram

Of the six units, two will be set up only with native breeds of Tamil Nadu like Chippiparai or Kombai.Though some of the forest divisions are already equipped with sniffer dogs, the government has now ensured that such squads are available for forest officers across the state.The government will purchase puppies, construct kennels, groom and vaccinate them. They will be trained by experts to sniff animal bones, skins, ivory and red sanders at critical forest areas in Chennai region, western and southern Tamil Nadu. Besides this, it will build a customised vehicle, so that the squads can be mobilised soon to the crime scenes. A senior official from the forest department said that the chances of tracking down the suspects is higher if sniffer dogs can reach the crime scene within 24 hours."As forest officials, we have certain limitations while interrogating suspects and gathering evidence. Sniffer dogs will come in handy in such situations as they can easily detect hidden animal meat, skin or any such articles related to wildlife crimes or illegal trade," the official added. Tamil Nadu has a wildlife conviction rate of less than 3% because of lack of supporting evidence. This move is aimed at tightening the conviction nose.Welcoming this, C K Sreedharan, former principal chief conservator of forests said that well-trained sniffer squads are an effective option to detect wildlife crimes, but they should be used with a lot of discretion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/forest-dept-to-establish-six-sniffer-dog-units-to-prevent-wildlife-crimes/articleshow/88308036.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Chennai||Why Chennai needs to boost Covid-19 vaccine second dose coverage||CHENNAI: The city lags behind other southern capitals in Covid-19 second dose vaccination coverage, and with Omicron threat looming large, experts feel it must fast-track its vaccination coverage. Greater Chennai Corporation data shows 63 % of the city’s eligible population received 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine by December 15. In contrast, Thiruvananthapuram covered 77% of its population, Bengaluru 71% and Hyderabad 77% until December 15. Chennai’s active cases have risen from 1,180 on December 1 to 1,343 on December 15. Health secretary Dr J Radhakrishnan on Wednesday wrote to district collectors and Chennai corporation commissioner, asking them to increase the pace for those unvaccinated and those due for a second dose. Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Subramanian Swaminathan said a sense of urgency was needed. “With Omicron threat being there, hospitalization is increasing globally. So, we are running out of time and what we know clearly is, one dose of Covid-19 vaccine is not enough,” he said. As per global studies, Pfizer’s protection against Omicron reduced to 33% from 80% for Delta, and protection against hospitalization reduced from 93% to 70%. “We may not have data for vaccines given here but two doses are a bare minimum.” The World Health Organisation on Tuesday warned that transmissibility of Omicron was very high. “Vaccination must be tied up with PDS and MGNREGA to boost coverage,” Dr. Swaminathan said. Virologist Dr Jacob John said with Omicron signalling caution, there’s a possibility of a third wave and precautions such as vaccination are a must.  “Having a sizeable population still not vaccinated for the second dose may lead to a surge in infections by January, February and March, overwhelming hospitals,” he said, adding that the threat must be taken seriously. “Increase surveillance, testing, contact tracing of those with positive index cases and those in touch with them. Saturation test in cluster areas too must be carried out without fail,” Dr. Radhakrishnan’s letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/why-chennai-needs-to-boost-covid-vax-2nd-dose-coverage/articleshow/88308038.cms||Omjasvin M D

Naik said he was resigning from his post as a minister to "ensure free and fair probe into the case". "I have accepted his resignation and sent it to governor P S Sreedharan Pillai," Sawant told TOI. It was on November 30 that Congress state president Girish Chodankar had first alleged, without naming Naik, that a minister was involved in a "sex scandal" and gave Sawant-led BJP government an ultimatum of 15 days to act against the minister. Last week, Sawant had said he would act if the survivor in the alleged scandal files a complaint or if Congress names the minister involved. BJP state chief Sadanand Shet Tanavade had also challenged Chodankar to name the minister and had said if Congress names him, BJP would immediately take action. On Wednesday, after the 15-day deadline given by Congress passed, Chodankar publicly named Milind Naik and alleged that a Bihar-based woman was sexually exploited by the minister. He said the BJP minister has misused his office, and that he has evidence to back his allegations against Naik. The chief minister said the government would conduct a proper investigation into the allegations. "We will look into all the evidence that has been provided and take appropriate action," he said. Sawant also said Naik has told him that he will fight the case. "Whatever allegations have been made against him are at a personnel level," Sawant said, adding they do not plan to induct any minister in place of Naik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-sex-abuse-allegations-goa-minister-resigns/articleshow/88308043.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Banana merchant from Bengaluru poses as DPAR staffer, lands in soup||BENGALURU: A 34-year-old banana merchant was arrested on Tuesday on charges of duping people by posing as a government official. The accused is Uday Prabhu, resident of Mylasandra, Kengeri. Cops seized his Toyota Innova on which he had illegally fixed ‘Government of Karnataka’ logo. An ID card seized from him says his name and designation are ‘Uday Prabhu, special officer, department of personnel and administrative reforms’. “The ID card matches with that of DPAR staffers, with dates of issuance and expiry. The back portion carries similar instructions like the original card. It means the accused had access to a genuine ID card,” an investigating officer said. Police said they received concrete information about the accused, who owns a mandi in Cottonpet. “On Tuesday, we visited his house and asked him to explain why he had government logos on his car’s licence plate. Prabhu said he was a special officer, DPAR, and produced the ID card in a jiffy. On persistent questioning, he stumbled and finally confessed. We seized three iPhones, a laptop and Rs 1.2 lakh from him. His MUV, registered in the name of his wife Mamata Prabhu, costs around Rs 20 lakh,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/banana-merchant-poses-as-dpar-staffer-lands-in-soup/articleshow/88308069.cms||---

According to the complaint filed by N Galappa, 50, from Siresandra village, the duo approached them while they were waiting for a bus in Majestic on November 29. They claimed to be daily-wage workers who found 4kg of gold coins while digging the earth. They showed them two gold coins and offered to sell 1kg for Rs 11 lakh, which was less compared to the market price. “We went to a nearby shop where the goldsmiths confirmed the two coins were of genuine gold. We returned to the bus terminal and agreed to the deal. We arranged Rs 7 lakh by pledging gold of our family members. Rajanna had Rs 4 lakh with him which was meant for agriculture-related works. With Rs 11 lakh cash, we met them outside the bus terminal on December 1. Another person joined us and we went to Tulasi park and there, they gave me a cloth bundle saying there’s 1kg of coins in it. We gave them the cash and they went away. After a few days, we took the coins to a goldsmith who said they were fake,” he stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2-farmers-pay-11l-for-1kg-fake-gold-coins/articleshow/88308070.cms||---

Allowing the applications moved by AIADMK and former law minister C Ve Shanmugam on Wednesday, a division bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay and Justice Sathi Kumar Sukumara Kurup held that AIADMK could be considered as a ‘person aggrieved’ though it was not a party to the original litigation challenging the acquisition. “While allowing these petitions, it also needs to be noted that the petitioners cannot be heard to say that they were not aware of the proceedings before a single judge. The circumstances for not approaching this court at the relevant time, and approaching this court now, both are also the factors which may also be gone into, if required, while hearing the appeals,” the bench said. The court then posted the appeals for hearing on December 20. On November 24, a single judge of the court passed an order allowing the pleas moved by Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs J Deepa and J Deepak and set aside the acquisition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-gets-nod-to-challenge-order-against-acquisition-of-jaya-house/articleshow/88308074.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Muttukadu encroached by pvt entities||CHENNAI: Private entities have encroached around 183 acres of government land near Muttukadu backwaters in Chennai, an inspection report submitted before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has revealed. The report further confirmed that untreated sewage released from these encroachments, private tankers and other residents or establishments had polluted the waterbody. NGT Southern Zone, which took suo moto cognizance of encroachments and pollution near Muttukadu last year, constituted a joint-committee to study the problem and recommend relief measures. The committee that visited the five sites -- Navalur, Padur, Kazhipattur, Egattur and Muttukadu Boat House -- confirmed encroachments in three locations. At Egattur, Hiranandani Realtors Private Limited encroached on a piece of Public Works Department (PWD) land by laying a nine-metre wide bituminous road with streetlights, the committee said in its report. Chettinad Morimura Semiconductor Material Private Limited and a prawn hatchery have encroached on poramboke land in Kazhipattur and Padur villages. In August, the committee informed the tribunal that the PWD and revenue officials were taking steps to initiate action against the violators. But there was no update during the recent hearing on November 26, when the water quality test reports were submitted. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), which analysed water samples collected from the five locations, told the tribunal that the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels ranged from 11 to 17 mg per litre. This confirmed the release of sewage into the waterbody from nearby areas. What makes things worse is that the state government has no plan to revive the waterbody under its flagship Chennai River Restoration Programme (CRRP). It is up to the local bodies or revenue officials to protect the environment here. They claim to have seized some trucks, which illegally dumped sewage into Buckingham Canal and have installed CCTV cameras, gates and height barriers to prevent such incidents or further encroachments in the future. TNPCB, however, has directed village panchayats of Muttukadu, Navalur and Padur to pay 16 lakh each as compensation for not following Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and causing damage to the environment. The case will be heard again on December 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/muttukadu-encroached-by-pvt-entities/articleshow/88308078.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Supreme court asks Kerala, Tamil Nadu to behave like ‘normal litigants’||CHENNAI/NEW DELHI: Giving them a rap on the knuckles, the Supreme Court has counselled the governments of Kerala and Tamil Nadu to keep aside their political compulsions, and behave like ‘normal litigants’ in cases related to the Mullaperiyar dam. Hearing an application by the Kerala government to direct Tamil Nadu not to release a huge quantity of water from the dam in the wee hours as it endangered the lives of thousands of people downstream, a bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice C T Ravikumar said it was a matter to be decided by the supervisory committee. “This infighting should stop. Before the court, both of you should behave like any normal litigant and not take this extreme position,” the bench said. Pointing out that matters related to day-to-day management of the dam should not be brought before the Supreme Court, the bench said the neighbouring governments should resolve the issues by consensus before the committee. “The committee is the best judge … it will take into account the request for release of water and also on whether there is a need for that.” When senior counsel for Kerala said Tamil Nadu must be directed to give 24-hour advance notice before releasing water from the dam, the judge said: “Instead of examining the grievances made in this application, which may involve debatable issues and contentious positions, we deem it appropriate that the parties, for such request, must first approach the supervisory committee before taking any steps for release or management of the water level in the dam,” the bench said. “That would assuage the apprehensions of both sides,” it said. The Mullaperiyar dam case, involving several related issues, is slated for hearing on January 11. In its present petition, the Kerala government sought a direction to Tamil Nadu to control the water level by releasing water throughout the day instead of releasing a huge quantity during the wee hours without giving sufficient warning time. It suggested setting up of a joint technical onsite committee for spillway release, comprising two members each from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, to decide on the quantity and time of surplus discharge through spillway shutters to Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/top-court-asks-kerala-tn-to-behave-like-normal-litigants/articleshow/88308080.cms||---

Unable to make ends meet, they resorted to the extreme step. In a suicide note, they have held no one responsible for their death and cited poverty as the reason. The note is believed to have been written by the sole breadwinner of the family, Sivaji,43, a tailor. While Sivaji was found hanging in the house, his wife Vanitha, 34, and son Vetrivel, 10, a Class V student, were found lying dead on the bed. Sivaji's mother-in-law Vatsala who lives nearby on Venkatesan Alit Street peeped into their house since they did not step out for a long time. On information, New Washermenpet police reached the spot and sent the bodies for postmortem. Police said that it is not clear if Sivaji's wife and son consumed poison or if they were killed by Sivaji before the latter died by suicide. A case has been registered and further investigation is on. Preliminary inquiries revealed that Sivaji had borrowed money during lockdown to run his family and struggled to settle the debts. Police are investigating if Sivaji was being being harassed by money lenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/couple-kill-son-10-end-their-lives-say-poverty-drove-them/articleshow/88308083.cms||Ram Sundaram

A foundation was also laid for a grade separator between Vandalur and Walajbad Road. Both the projects, aimed at reducing congestion on ever-busy GST Road, will be constructed over the next two years. According to a state highways department official, motorists use a level crossing gate at Guduvancherry to travel from GST road to reach Singaperumal Koil village on the western side. Whenever the level crossing gate is closed, traffic piles up on the GST Road. Similarly, due to the absence of a connecting road or a flyover, vehicles coming from south heading to Oragadam are forced to take a detour. To avoid the traffic pile up and to help vehicles reach Oragadam directly from GST road, the ROB and the grade separator are being built at a cost of 90.74 crore and 26.24 crore. The length of the ROB is 740 metres with a width of 7.5 metres. The length of the grade separator is 690.95 metres and its width is 17.20 metres, which will be a four lane road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rob-and-grade-separator-to-ease-traffic-on-gst-road/articleshow/88308085.cms||P Oppili

The police had announced a Rs 5 lakh reward for information leading to their capture. Notably, one of the SPOs, Saqib Ahmad Tantry, was deputed as the personal security officer (PSO) of BJP leader Abdul Rashid Zargar, housed in a PWD guesthouse for security reasons. However, Tantry fled with his service rifle and picked up his colleague, PSO Arif Mir, from Mir’s home in Bonipora in Kupwara where he had gone on leave. Both are residents of the same village. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar confirmed that both SPOs had been arrested. Saqib’s colleague Arif had deserted the police force at the same time, the IGP said. The J&K police, meanwhile, arrested on Wednesday a mother and her daughter on charges of inciting violence after Monday’s encounter at Wanbal, in Srinagar’s Rangreth area. Official sources said Afrooza and her daughter Aisha were arrested on charges of raising anti-national slogans and inciting violence in the aftermath of the Rangreth shootout and that miscreants thereafter hurled stones and blocked the road. They said the two women were arrested and later shifted to the women’s police station at Rambagh after the completion of legal formalities. A police officer confirmed that a case under FIR No. 209/2021 was registered against the miscreants for creating a law and order situation after the Rangreth shootout in which two Lashkar terrorists, one of them a Pakistani, were killed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/two-spos-who-deserted-arrested-in-kupwara-service-rifles-recovered-igp-kashmir/articleshow/88308115.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||Hubballi||KPSC asks job aspirants to visit centre a day prior to exam||Hubballi: A release issued by Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) after the assistant engineer aspirants missed their exam following train delay has caused a massive uproar. “Candidates were instructed to visit their centres a day prior to the scheduled date,” states the release. Mahendra JO, a youth from Kadur in Chikkamagaluru district, who alerted Railway authorities on twitter over train delay on Tuesday, said: “KPSC did not consider the distance between our place of residence and exam centre. Many Belagavi candidates were forced to attend exam in Mysuru while Tumakuru candidates were in Kalaburagi. Believing KSPC’s direction, if we had been to Kalaburagi the previous day, it was difficult to get a room as all hotels were booked by candidates well in advance. As train was supposed to reach Kalaburagi by 6am and our exams were scheduled from 10am, we preferred travelling on the day of exam.” Manjula K, Niranjan CP, Basavaraju and other candidates said one one understands the unemployment rate is increasing after Covid-19 crisis across world. “We, poor and middle class people are struggling to meet our daily needs. We are struggling to pay the exam fees for government jobs. During this hour of crisis, how can we go and stay in the city where exam centres are located one day in advance? How to bear the cost of accommodation and food for two days shunning our daily wages or part-time jobs?” they asked. Siddeshwar Sonar, a rights activist in Mahalingapur, termed it as a big concern. “KPSC must hold exams at all district headquarters to avoid travel to distant cities. “As poor candidates can’t bear the cost, government itself should support unemployed youths by reserving a special budget. While it provides all facilities to the MLAs, why not for youths, who are the future of the nation?” he asked. He noted that cities like Kalaburagi and Dharwad cannot accommodate about 10,000 candidates at a time. “Even if candidates are ready to pay, they can’t get accommodation. This inordinate demand is turning into an occasion for lodge owners to hike the rent exorbitantly,” he alleged. MLC S V Sankanur, who is representing Karnataka West Graduates’ Constituency, commented that KPSC might have done it to ensure timely arrival of candidates to the exam centres and to avoid possibilities of conducting re-exam like it happened in Kalaburagi. “It’s also true that it causes economic burden and it’s an impractical instruction. There is a need for an amicable solution,” he opined. ‘Dedicated candidates will go anywhere’ Such steps were taken to curb all type of modern malpractices and to suppress networks of leaking question papers. Centres are allotted by randomisation with the help of computers. Talented and dedicated candidates, wishing to join government services, will go anywhere to write exams. Nowadays NEET and UPSC aspirants are going to other states to write exams. If we look at the concerns of candidates, it will be difficult to hold fair exams — G Sathyavathi, secretary, KPSC, Bengaluru||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kpsc-asks-job-aspirants-to-visit-centre-a-day-prior-to-exam/articleshow/88305747.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Patna||EOU finds DA worth Rs85.77L amassed by suspended SDPO||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police on Wednesday unearthed immovable and movable assets worth at least Rs85.77 lakh crore disproportionate to the known sources of income of suspended Aurangabad Sadar SDPO Anup Kumar. This is 55% more than his known sources of income. The EOU conducted raids at three locations of Anup in Patna, Ranchi and Gaya and found properties worth approximately Rs1.53 crore. Anup, along with the then Aurangabad and Bhojpur SPs, Sudhir Kumar Porika and Rakesh Kumar Dubey, was suspended for their alleged connivance with sand smugglers earlier this year. This is the tenth disproportionate assets case in the sand smuggling inquiry conducted by the EOU. The Wednesday raids were conducted at Anup’s flat in Shambhavi enclave near Bootnath Road in Patna, his ancestral house at Nutan Nagar in Gaya and another flat at Luvkush Apartment on Ratu Road in Ranchi, Jharkhand. Sources said the EOU has come to know about his two bank accounts. EOU sources said the DSP purchased the flat of 1250 square feet at Bhoothnath Road, an agricultural land of 6.25 decimal in Ismailpur at Phulwarisharif and a residential plot at Nandlal Chapra in Patna and the flat in Ranchi for Rs75.68 lakh, as per the deeds. “However, the documents show Rs56 lakh were paid for the residential plot,” a source said. EOU sources said the raiding team at Gaya came to know that massive expansion work was being carried out at his ancestral property. Sources said Anup joined the service as a sub-inspector of police in 1989 and his total known earning has been calculated around Rs 1.56 crore while his total expenditure is approximately Rs89.31 lakh. “Instead, he has been found possessing Rs1.53 crore worth properties,” a source said. EOU sources said the suspended DSP might be quizzed very soon in the DA case registered against him on Monday after which search warrants were procured from the court to conduct the raids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-finds-da-worth-rs85-77l-amassed-by-suspended-sdpo/articleshow/88306003.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Experts said more has to be done to reach at least the national average. The state government on Wednesday released a state report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) having the data of the state on different parameters. In majority of the districts, stunting was more than 40%. Sheikhpura and Sitamarhi have more than 50% of the children below five years of age as stunted. A member of International Institute of Population Sciences, SK Singh, said it was appreciable that stunting in children in Bihar has reduced, but more is needed to be done. As per the NFHS-3, stunting in Bihar was 56%, which went down to 48% in NFHS-4 and further down to 43% in NFHS-5. Apart from stunting, even the percentage of underweight children has come down to 41% in the NFHS-5, from 44% in NFHS-4. However, in this category also, Jehanabad and Arwal have more than 50% of their children underweight. However, the state has witnessed sharp increase in institutional deliveries in the span of 15 years. While this was 20% during NFHS-3, carried out in 2005-06, it increased to 64% in NFHS-4 (2015-16) and further to 76% in NFHS-5 in 2019-20. Officials said the increase in the institutional deliveries has led to decrease in the infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as maternal mortality rate (MMR) in the state. However, there is a gap in institutional births between the rural and urban areas of the state. As per the data, institutional delivery is 84% in urban areas of Bihar, compared to 75% in the rural areas. Improvement has also been seen in the care received by women during pregnancy as well as delivery and after that. For instance, 53% of the women received at least one antenatal check-up during their pregnancy, which was 35% in NFHS-4. Even the percentage of women receiving post-natal care within two days of deliveries has increased from 46% in NFHS-4 to 64% in NFHS-5. Talking about the development in several spheres, state health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said the pace may be slow, but it is sustainable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cases-of-stunted-kids-down-but-still-above-national-avg/articleshow/88306040.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Substantial hike in bus fare across Bihar||PATNA: Travelling by city and intercity buses is to cost more as the state transport department has hiked fares of all buses from Patna to other parts of the state from Wednesday. The increase is around 23-47% for the ordinary buses, 7-17% for deluxe buses and 14-20% for airconditioned buses, depending on the distance covered. As per the new rates, the bus operators have to charge Rs1.50/km for general buses, Rs1.70/km for deluxe buses, Rs2/km for deluxe airconditioned buses and Rs2.50/km for Volvo, Mercedes and its equivalent buses and Rs6.4 for first 4 kms and Rs3 for next two kms for city buses. It is implemented for all Bihar-bound buses in view of the rising fuel prices. The private bus operators welcomed the new fare chart for 14 different routes. However, the hike is likely to put additional burden on the daily commuters, especially the middle-class passengers, workers, teachers and students, who largely depend on buses for travelling. Kaushik Ranjan, who commutes in buses on regular basis, complained that it is always common people who have to bear the brunt of price rise. “First the lockdown, then rise in prices of petroleum products influences the rates of other commodities. The household budget is already off the track. Now, this rise in bus fare will pinch our pockets further. Travelling by autorickshaws is also expensive,” he said. “Every weekend, I visit my parents in Bettiah. Earlier, I had to shell out Rs257 for the journey. Now, I have to pay Rs301 for one-side journey. It means I have to spent extra Rs350 every month on my travel expenses,” said Binay Kumar Singh, a resident of Bakarganj. A government schoolteacher, Savita Jha, said, “Bus service is a major and reliable transport facility to travel from one city to another, especially for a teacher like me. The authorities must consider the impact of the fare hike on passengers carefully before taking any decision. Now I have to pay Rs116 for a single trip to Chhapra,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/substantial-hike-in-bus-fare-across-bihar/articleshow/88305677.cms||Faryal Rumi

A monthlong cleanliness drive was also launched on the occasion. “As part of the cleanliness drive, all the ward councillors will ensure that the roads are swept regularly, the door-to-door trash collection facility is available and the wet, dry and other harmful wastes that include sanitary napkins and diapers are segregated properly. They will create awareness among the masses and organise painting, jingle writing, short film and street play competitions to ensure public participation,” Sahu said, adding that the drive would become a regular feature soon. The mayor continued, “The councillors will adopt a zero waste approach and the three R’s (reduce, reuse and recycle) in their respective wards. The top three wards where the residents get better amenities and their complaints are disposed of quickly will win cash prizes and awards. On the other hand, the executive officers of the Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankerbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City circles will conduct surprise inspection of the wards from time to time.” The ward councillors were also asked to enforce a ban on the use of plastic and promote wet waste composting. “A 50% rebate on garbage tax will be given to those who segregate and process wet waste on their premises. Besides, the people, who help the civic body keep the city clean, will be honoured,” Sahu said. PMC commissioner Animesh Kumar Parashar, deputy mayor Rajni Devi, other senior officials and ward councillors were present in the workshop.

An announcement in this regard was made by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday. According to sources, on average, nearly 3,500 patients visit the AIIMS-P from different parts of the state every day. Welcoming the CM’s announcement, AIIMS-P’s medical superintendent, Dr C M Singh, said, “The number of patients visiting the hospital for treatment has increased tremendously in recent years. There have been multiple occasions when all the available beds are full and the attendants are forced to stay somewhere else.” Dr Singh also thanked the CM for promising that extra land would be provided for expansion of the AIIMS-P. “We will now be able to expand many departments,” he said. Dr Anil Kumar, the head of the trauma and emergency department, also welcomed the government’s decision. He pointed out, “The sight of the patients’ attendants relaxing on the stairs or in the open grounds on the premises of the hospital created a poor impression.” A dedicated Covid hospital, the AIIMS-P has been witnessing a huge footfall of patients since 2020. “Although we had introduced a telephonic facility to help the kin of Covid patients know their health status, many of them would not leave the hospital and increase the risk of transmission of the infection. It was then that we realized the need of a shelter house for the attendants,” said Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid at the AIIMS-P.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/aiims-patna-doctors-hail-decision-to-build-shelter-house-for-patients-attendants/articleshow/88305639.cms||VK Tripathi

According to ICRA, the financial cost of this loss of production for companies is around Rs 1800-2000 crore. “The chip shortage peaked in September due to regional supply crunch in places like Malaysia and ICRA has lowered its estimate downwards for domestic wholesale dispatches for passenger vehicles in FY22 from 14-17% earlier to 8-11% on account of the ongoing semiconductor shortage,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP and sector head, ICRA. “While the supply situation is expected to improve, a normalization is only expected towards end of calendar year 2022,” he added. The good news is the supplies from Malaysia are on the rise. “Discussions with ancillaries indicate improvement in the same,” said Gupta. In the absence of the chip crisis, the industry volumes, at 3.5 million units, would have exceeded all-time peak annual volumes. Passenger vehicle wholesale volumes were 3.4 million units in FY19, 2.8 million units in FY20 and 2.7 million units in FY21. The chip shortage hit festival sales this year and popular new launches now have a waiting period of 6-8 months. According to ICRA, sequentially, over the past three months, production volumes have been under pressure due to semi-conductor shortage and the low wholesales have also hit showroom retails. Dealership stocks are now down 10-15 days from the usual 30-35 days. Wholesale dispatches lagged last financial year for three consecutive months – 186,000 units in September 2021 compared to 294,000 units in the year-ago month, 259,000 units in October 2021 compared to 334,000 units in September 2020 and 246,000 units in November 2021 compared to 287,000 units last November. “Channel check indicates that customers are being forced to postpone purchases, or in some cases, opting to buy used cars, given the long waiting periods associated with some popular models,” said Gupta. Globally, auto makers will cumulatively take a hit of 7.7 million cars and a sales hit of over $200 billion due to the chip crisis in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chip-crisis-to-cost-car-cos-5-lakh-units-rs-1800-2000-crore-in-sales-icra/articleshow/88306533.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

This is in addition to loss of employment for many. Members of the AICA said the cost of aluminium has increased 154% in the past 18 months. While the price of copper increased 118%, the mild steel plate price saw 82% hike during the same period. The MSME associations have called for a one-day closure of all industries across India and one-hour peaceful demonstration in front of the respective Collectorate and District Magistrate Office to stress for the intervention of the central government to reduce raw material prices. A member of AICA and Coimbatore-based R Ramamurthy said “It must be noted that the steep hike in price of raw materials across all sectors, despite low consumption of raw materials and subsequent drop in the production (Quantity) by MSMEs – directly leading to loss of employment, and depreciating value of rupee - due to Raw Material price increase.” MSMEs are faced with huge challenges from no price escalation clause for public sector projects, erosion of working capital, non-availability of basic raw material, blocking and hoarding of raw material in the entire supply chain, a press statement said. He added “The open market players are not accepting the full effect of raw material price increase, while there is no price escalation clause for public sector projects.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/one-day-strike-to-lead-to-rs-25000-crore-production-loss-msme-association/articleshow/88306531.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Ahmedabad||Easing traffic: AMC cites ashram plan delay||Ahmedabad: For easing traffic flow, the AMC has received various proposals from the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) through the city traffic police. The proposals entail the construction of overbridges, underpasses, and traffic islands at 29 different places. But many of these plans have not been accepted because they have been deemed not feasible. The AMC placed an affidavit in the Gujarat high court on Wednesday in this regard in response to a query from the court. The HC was inquiring about an application alleging that the civic body has not carried out the directions issued by it in 2018 for the proper upkeep of roads and reducing traffic snarls. The civic body cleared its stand over the comprehensive mobility plan crafted by the CRRI. One of the proposals moots the construction of an overbridge from Bhimjipura to Chandlodia to ease traffic movement at Vadaj Circle. The AMC has projected the central government’s plan to redevelop Gandhi Ashram as a delaying factor in reducing traffic problems in Vadaj. The AMC said that a survey has been conducted of traffic movement at Vadaj Circle, but the Centre’s ashram redevelopment plan has not been finalized. The AMC said that once the Centre’s plan is sealed, the alignment of the proposed overbridge can be settled. It said that after the ashram is redeveloped, options for AMTS and ST bus stands can be devised. The AMC has rejected the proposal for the construction of underpasses in most cases. It has cited various reasons including the existence of water lines beneath the roads. The corporation has said that it plans to build a split flyover at Ghodasar Circle and a flyover connecting three junctions in Naroda. The AMC named all 1,104 roads on which 523km stretches were either resurfaced or repaired over the past three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/easing-traffic-amc-cites-ashram-plan-delay/articleshow/88306392.cms||---

---||Delhi||HC slams petitioners for plea to remove NCERT content on Mughal rulers||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday tossed out a plea seeking its direction to NCERT to remove content from a history textbook that says grants were issued during the reign of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb for repairing temples destroyed during wars. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh warned that it will impose costs if the petitioners, who claimed to be “hardworking and sincere students”, persisted in pushing their plea. Sensing the mood of the bench, the PIL was quickly dismissed as withdrawn by the petitioners. “You are saying that Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb had no such policy for giving the grants for temple repair, etc? …You want us to now examine the policies of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb? The high court will decide?” the bench questioned. It highlighted how courts are grappling with present day policies and termed the PIL a “frivolous” one and a waste of judicial time. The petitioners Sanjeev Vikal and Dapinder Singh Virk claimed that NCERT has no record or information regarding the content being taught to students and wrongly projected the acts of the Mughals. “Para 2 to page 234 of the ‘Themes in Indian History Part 2’ textbook was published without any valid source of information and was inserted just to glorify the reign of Mughal emperors Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb,” the petition stated. “It is well-known fact that most of the Mughal emperors levied heavy taxes upon the performance of the religious ceremony and pilgrim tours from the people who belong to Hindu religion. It is not a new fact that the Mughal emperors also compelled the non-Muslim people to get converted to Islamic religion,” it added.  The petitioners claimed that they even filed an RTI application before the public information officer of NCERT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-slams-petitioners-for-plea-to-remove-ncert-content-on-mughal-rulers/articleshow/88307023.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The high court observed that holding a public meeting is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and none of the reasons by police for denying permission are tenable. Farmers of the capital region moved the high court after their request to hold a public meeting was turned down by police. The high court also allowed Rayalaseema Medhavula Forum to hold a public meeting in support of the three capitals’ proposal on December 18. Arguing on behalf of the farmers, Posani Venkateswarlu said the farmers held the ‘padayatra’ peacefully. Upon completion of the ‘padayatra’, the farmers wanted to conduct a public meeting, which is their right guaranteed by the Constitution, but the police denied permission, he said. The meeting is not being conducted at Tirupati, but on private land six kilometres away from Tirupati, he said, adding it is the responsibility of the police to ensure no law and problem arises at the meeting. Arguing on behalf of the state government, additional advocate general Ponnavolu Sudhakar Reddy said many violent incidents were reported enroute the ‘padayatra’. In view of the increasing number of Covid-19 cases following the emergence of the new variant, it is not advisable to allow a public meeting, he said. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy said the Rayalaseema region is within the territory of Andhra Pradesh. He observed it is the duty of the police to see no law and order problem arises at the public meeting by imposing reasonable restrictions but the police cannot deny permission. Justice Manavendranath Roy directed the DGP to instruct the Tirupati SP to give permission for the meeting. The high court also allowed the other petition filed seeking permission to hold a public meeting in support of three capitals, but not on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-nod-to-farmers-public-meet-in-tirupati/articleshow/88306253.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The adverse weather systems damaged about 7,700 houses and resulted in the death of 5,660 livestock, as per the data submitted to Parliament on Wednesday. Crops on about 5.2 lakh hectares were also damaged due to nature's fury. Several cyclones have crossed the coast of or affected Andhra Pradesh this year - from cyclones Gulab to Jawad. Having a coastline of about 970 kilometres, Andhra Pradesh is prone to cyclonic storms compared to other natural disasters. Generally, the coastal districts bear the brunt of these weather systems. But the story is different this year. Rayalaseema is the worst-affected region with the heavy rain-induced flash floods wreaking havoc for several days in a row in November. The depression formed in the Bay of Bengal triggered the unprecedented rainfall in the third week of November in Rayalaseema and Nellore. Rayalaseema districts received 11.1 cm rainfall against normal rainfall of 3.2 cm with a 250% deviation between November 13 and 20. Peddamandyam mandal in Chittoor district received a record rainfall of 20 cm on November 19, followed by Galiveedu in Kadapa (19.3 cm) and Nallacheruvu in Anantapur (17.8 cm). The heavy rains inundated the low-lying areas in Tirupati, Nellore, Madanapalli, Rajampet, etc. The inundation in the affected districts was so much that 17 national/state disaster response force teams and two helicopters had to be deployed for undertaking search and rescue operations. Despite these efforts, about 40 people lost their lives in the floods. The torrential rains left a trail of destruction in Rayalaseema by damaging thousands of kilometres of roads and pounding power distribution mechanism in hundreds of villages. Following the damages by incessant rains in Rayalaseema, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the latter to come to the rescue of Andhra Pradesh and for an interim relief grant of 1,000 crore. The chief minister also urged the Prime Minister to depute an inter-ministerial central team to assess the damages caused by the heavy rains. Subsequently, an inter-ministerial central team, constituted by the Union government, visited the flood affected areas from November 26 to 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/rseema-bears-brunt-of-rains-floods-in-21/articleshow/88306220.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

A lunch motion petition was moved requesting to hear the matter urgently. The high court agreed to hear the petition after completion of listed matters. However, as the order copy was not available till evening, the hearing on the appeal petition did not take place. The high court is likely to hear the petition on Thursday. On Tuesday, the high court after hearing the petition moved by the management of a movie theatre, passed interim orders suspending operation of GO 35 and allowing fixing ticket prices following the process that was in force prior to issuance of the GO. The theatre managements argued the GO issued by the government is in violation of two judgements of the high court and the procedure to fix ticket prices was not followed as contemplated by the high court. The government on the other hand argued that the GO was issued in view of larger public interest. Ticket prices cannot be increased as managements want, citing budget of movies and expenses. The prices of tickets have been fixed after taking all aspects into consideration and in accordance with law, argued the state government. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court observed that prima facie the GO is not in conformity with high court judgements and granted interim relief to theatre managements by suspending the GO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-appeals-against-suspension-of-go-35/articleshow/88306241.cms||Srikanth Aluri

After some distance she turned back and headed again towards the Vaccine Institute Compound Road. But somewhere in between, when she was on the lane next to the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) office, the girl suddenly disappeared,” a crime branch official told TOI. “There is a dark spot on that stretch but the footage shows a continuous flow of vehicles there. So, the possibility of someone pushing her down and kidnapping her seems improbable. Again, none of the security guards posted in the area or any of the evening walkers, who passed from the stretch at that time, spotted anything suspicious,” the official said. A couple of hours later, the girl is seen emerging from the compound when a bus driver spotted her. “Her cycle was found some distance away from the spot from where she had disappeared. The footage didn’t show any suspicious vehicle or auto rickshaw movement on that stretch when she was allegedly kidnapped,” the official added. The note in the diary of the girl, who used to study at OASIS Institute, states that two men pushed her on the road opposite the compound and after she fell down, they blindfolded her immediately. She further wrote that she became unconscious due to injury on her head and hence she didn’t know the place where they took her. ‘When I regained consciousness, I began screaming for help but the duo used my dupatta to strangulate me. I couldn’t scream for help. Then they removed the bandage on my leg and tied my hands,’ the diary said. The girl also mentioned that one of them held her legs and the other did something bad painful in her private parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girls-disappearance-from-road-baffles-investigators/articleshow/88306186.cms||Tushar Tere

Hence, when there is a wider trade deficit and capital flows are weak, resulting in some outflow of dollars, the rupee should weaken,” said CareEdge chief economist Madan Sabnavis. The immediate impact of the fall in the rupee would be on small importers who usually do not hedge their dollar requirements. Among individuals, students aspiring to study abroad have become the biggest category of forex buyers with leisure & business travel taking a back seat. “What we have seen after the pandemic is that the seasonal trend in overseas education is fading away and there is foreign currency demand from students round the year. We are already receiving queries for remittance for September 2022,” Ebixcash head (treasury) M Hariprasad said. “We are also seeing a good revival in corporate travel, particularly from IT companies,” he said. According to Hariprasad, what is worrying about the recent movement of the rupee is that the domestic currency has been closing at the day’s low. “This leads to an expectation that it will weaken further and there is fresh demand while sellers wait in the sidelines.” He said that there are a host of factors for the weakening rupee, including the strengthening of the US dollar amid fears of a slowdown in China. “We are in the last working week of the year, when normally all hedge funds and foreign institutional investors move their money out — that could be another reason,” said Hariprasad. Foreign institutional investors remained net sellers in the capital markets, pulling out Rs 763 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional data. Some dealers attributed the weakness in the rupee to the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/re-breaks-76-level-hits-20-month-low/articleshow/88306601.cms||---
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Something big’ needs to be done on Krishna Janmabhoomi, says Union minister Sanjeev Balyan||AGRA: Union minister of state for agriculture and food processing, Sanjeev Balyan, said on Wednesday that though a grand temple is being constructed at Ram Janmabhoomi, "something big and grand" must also be constructed at Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura. “Ram ki bhoomi me to bhavya mandir ban gaya par Krishna ki bhoomi me kuch bada hone ki avashyakta hai (a grand temple has been built on Lord Ram's land but something big must also happen on Lord Krishna's land)," he said. "We got our share in the east, but we're late to get our share in the west," he added. Several political leaders have also given similar controversial statements in connection with the disputed site in Mathura, where a 17th-century mosque is situated. UP cabinet minister Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan Singh had earlier said a Krishna temple must be built on the site. BJP member of parliament from Ballia, Ravindra Kushwaha, had also echoed the same views. "When Modi government can repeal farm laws, it can also withdraw the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 to pave way for construction of a grand temple at Krishna Janambhoomi in Mathura." UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya had tweeted: "Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura.” The controversy over the Krishna temple was triggered last year after a Lucknow-based lawyer and five others had filed an appeal in a Mathura district court, claiming that the mosque site is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. A local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking “removal” of the 17th-century mosque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/something-big-needs-to-be-done-on-krishna-janmabhoomi-union-minister-balyan/articleshow/88305526.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Patna||Allow consumption of liquor in limited quantity in Bihar: Jitan Ram Manjhi||PATNA: Former CM and ruling NDA’s ally HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Wednesday iterated his demand for relaxation in liquor prohibition laws in Bihar. Pitching for his demand, Manjhi said “there is no harm in limited consumption of liquor." Addressing a public meeting at Bagaha on the eve of HAM (S) national council meeting scheduled to be held at Valmikinagar in West Champaran on Thursday, Manjhi said: “Even if someone takes spirit, he is sent to jail. Then, how will homeopathic medicines be made. The court and medical science also say there is no harm in consumption of liquor in limited quantities.” He added: “Even if we are with the government, we request the chief minister to amend the liquor prohibition laws to the extent I am saying. The government should carry on with liquor prohibition in this manner and we also support it,” Manjhi said. Manjhi went on to claim that 70% of around 3 lakh people languishing in jail due to prohibition offences are poor people. “Many such people are caught with a meagre half bottle of liquor and they are behind bars...People offer liquor in certain rituals as well, like while making sacrifices of animals by a few tribes. Thus, there should be relaxation for use of liquor in customary practices and manufacturing homeopathic medicines.” The former Bihar CM said norms were already in place to regulate liquor consumption. “There was already a law of 1991 barring people from entering educational institutions, religious places, public places and even on roads after consuming alcohol. When such a law is already in place, then it should be implemented,” he said. Manjhi has been vocal against prohibition in the past as well. He had requested CM Nitish to reconsider liquor prohibition laws last week as well. Meanwhile, speaking at Bagaha, Manjhi said the SC/ST and other traditional dwellers in the forest areas are being harassed and their rights are being denied by the state government. “SC/ST people are also being harassed by implicating in cases of liquor law violation. Our party will fight for their rights,” he said.

He added, “The Patna Junction alone witnesses a huge footfall every day as a large number of passenger trains either originate from or pass through the station. Even those who are not travelling to other cities or states visit the station to drop or receive their friends or relatives. The railways has, therefore, implemented a mask-checking drive.” Ojha continued, “Since long-distance mail and express trains as well as the local ones have started running again, RPF personnel are also checking people’s masks at the Ara, Buxar, Mokama, Kiul and Jhajha stations.” According to a railway official, RPF men are keeping tabs on the behaviour of the passengers through closed-circuit television cameras at Patna and imposing a fine of up to Rs 500 for not wearing masks. During the last fortnight, more than 100 such passengers have been penalised at different places in the division. “A dedicated woman squad of the RPF has also been deployed at the Patna Junction on the Mahavir Temple and Karbigahiya sides to ensure that female passengers wear masks and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour,” the official said. Meanwhile, the railways has instructed the officials concerned to create awareness among the masses and make sure that everyone follows the Covid safety norms strictly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mask-checking-drive-begins-at-major-railway-stations/articleshow/88305608.cms||Kumod Verma

---||Patna||Experts caution against ‘misuse’ of antibiotics||PATNA: In the wake of Omicron threat, health experts are worried over the increasing and indiscriminate misuse of antibiotics, which has not only been weakening gut immunity but also making people incapable of fighting against viral infection. Expressing his grave concern over the growing misuse of antibiotics, especially during the current Covid pandemic, Dr Satish Kumar of NMCH medicine department pointed out that antibiotics are not effective against viruses and, overall, they are widely overprescribed. Even people having viral fever are unnecessarily given antibiotics. Even in cases of common bacterial infections, people are using high doses of antibiotics which make bacteria drug-resistant in the long run. No new antibiotics have appeared during the last one decade and the older ones are gradually becoming ineffective for the drug resistant bacteria, he said. Dr Kumar further pointed out that many people are also allergic to different groups of antibiotics and, hence, these should not be prescribed without ascertaining the case history of patients properly. In general, more than 90% of illnesses manifested by fever are viral infections and need no antibiotics, he added. Joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology (IGIC), Dr A K Ashu, said unwarranted use of antibiotics has been endangering the survival of human beings as bacteria are fast becoming drug-resistant. Prolonged consumption of antibiotics has been weakening people’s immunity and children are becoming the greatest victim of overuse of drugs. People with weak immunity are more likely to catch all types of infection, both bacterial and viral. A time will come soon when there would be no drug available in the world to treat the bacterial infections, he warned. Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said more than 7 lakh people die of bacterial infections in the world every year as most bacteria have become drug-resistant. This is simply due to the excessive use of antibiotics even in minor ailments. Antibiotics are not required in 80 to 90% of the diseases, but even then people are consuming them on the advice of some quacks or medicine sellers. There were no antibiotics 80 years ago and even then people were cured of their various diseases. The discovery of antibiotics had certainly come as a boon for the ailing humanity but, over the years, its excessive use has endangered our lives. The ever-increasing drug resistance has already triggered a panic throughout the world and crores of people with compromised immunity would lose their lives if they are infected, he warned. Aryabhatta Knowledge University medicine faculty dean Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad pointed out that during the second wave of Coronavirus, many people died after getting infected with black fungus. This was mainly due to the overuse of antibiotics and steroids by people infected with Coronavirus. The medical fraternity must be cautious of the overprescription of antibiotics to the people in the wake of the Omicron threat, he added. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Uday Krishna Jha observed that unnecessary use of antibiotics, as well as over-the-counter drugs, may disrupt gut health. They can prove effective only when they are used in the right context and in proper doses. Antibiotics should not usually be taken in case of viral infections, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-caution-against-misuse-of-antibiotics/articleshow/88305509.cms||B K Mishra

The enforcement team conducted raids on Fraser Road, Exhibition Road and Station Road and seized 18-20kg of polythene and plastic materials from shops and collected a fine of Rs11,000 from them. Arvind Kumar, city manager of the municipal body, said only one team from the headquarter was assigned for the enforcement of plastic ban due to other engagements. “The team raided the shops in areas like Exhibition Road, Dak Bungalow, Exhibition Road and Station Road. From Thursday, each team will carry out the drive in Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City circles. Fine will be imposed as per the number of thermocol-made products and polythene seized from the shops,” he told this newspaper on Wednesday. He added: “We had earlier conducted awareness drive, so that the shops get enough time to clear their stock. A separate team has been formed in every circle for anti-polythene drive.” The senior officials of state forest, environment and climate change department had already asked the manufacturers, dealers and traders to clear their stocks comprising plastic materials before the December 15 deadline. The ban also covers disposable plastic cups, throwaway cutleries and covers of packed foodstuff. Kanchan Kumari, city manager (Patliputra circle), said the drive for plastic ban will be carried out from Thursday onwards at Ashiana Colony, Digha, Rajeev Nagar and Patliputra (New and Old). “A team of five officials will lead this drive effectively. We have earlier conducted the drive against single-use plastic. This time, we are focusing on thermocol products, especially shops selling decorative items and cutleries for events,” she said. Meanwhile, members of the Confederation of Indian Traders (CAIT) and Bihar Plastic Industries Association (BPIA) have expressed their concern over the ban on plastic and thermocol products. Kamal Nopany, state chairman of CAIT, said the Centre has decided to eliminate single-use plastic from July 1, 2022 while the state implemented this from December 15. “The state should have given more time to exhaust the remaining stock before imposing the ban. Besides, we need time to make alternate arrangement for plastic and thermocol. Several industries indulged in this business will face huge losses,” he told this newspaper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pmc-launches-drive-to-enforce-ban-on-single-use-plastic-thermocol-products/articleshow/88305544.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||‘Best to separate companies from banking’||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday indicated that it is not in favour of industrialists getting bank licences. This is the first time after the RBI’s norms on bank ownership that a central banker has voiced criticism of corporate ownership of banks after it announced its new norms on shareholding. “Given that banking is a highly leveraged business dealing with public money, it makes sense to keep industry/business and banking separate,” said RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao in his speech at the Mint Annual Conclave at Mumbai. Last year, an internal working group (IWG) had recommended that the RBI consider corporates and corporate group-promoted non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) for bank licences, subject to certain conditions including legal amendments. Based on the report, the RBI last month released the modified rules for bank ownership and said that it had accepted 21 of the 33 recommendations made by the IWG, but remained silent on bank licences to corporate houses. In his speech, Rao said that this separation (between banks and industries) is expected to avoid spill-over risks — where trouble anywhere in the group entity may result in transferring risks on to the depositors, leading in turn to claims on deposit insurance with subsequent ripple effects cascading across the largely interconnected financial systems, creating concerns around financial stability. “These issues have been flagged by the IWG also and, therefore, it is necessary that we closely examine the related matters before thinking of permitting large industrial houses or NBFCs owned by such houses to set up any new bank. To conclude, let me just say that the jury is still out on the issue,” said Rao. Rao said that in the past too suggestions were made on corporates being given bank licences and how they would bring capital, management expertise and strategic direction given their pool of entrepreneurial and managerial talent. “There is also the issue of finding fit and able promoters with deep pockets to set up a large technologically equipped universal bank,” said Rao. He also raised the issue of connected lending and complex web of group structures in large corporates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/best-to-separate-cos-from-banking/articleshow/88306829.cms||---

The country’s largest lender said that the executive committee of the bank’s board on Wednesday approved selling 6% stake in its mutual fund arm through an IPO. The France-based Amundi said that it will sell 4% out of the 37% stake that it holds in the asset management company. SBI owns the remaining 63%. While Amundi said that the IPO would take place in 2022, SBI did not give any time frame for the issue. However, sources said that the process was unlikely to be concluded in the current financial year. Among other listed mutual funds, HDFC Asset Management has a market capitalisation of Rs 52,420, which makes it the most valuable fund manager. Nippon Life Asset Management has a valuation of Rs 22,087 crore and UTI AMC is worth Rs 13,311 crore. Going by the market capitalisation of HDFC Mutual Fund, market players estimate that a 10% stake in SBI Funds Management could be worth around Rs 7,000 crore considering that it is the largest mutual fund house by asset size in India. It manages over Rs 6 lakh crore of assets and generates the highest profits among SBI’s subsidiaries. Amundi AMC was created following the merger of the asset management business of two French institutions — Credit Agricole and Societe Generale. SBI had earlier plans of listing its general insurance subsidiary. However, the management took the view that given the ambitious growth plans, it would be better to go for a listing with a substantially larger book. Meanwhile, the SBI Funds management has seen its assets under management (AUM) double in less than two years due to the stock market rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-seeks-to-sell-6-stake-in-mf-arm-via-ipo-route/articleshow/88306835.cms||---

US private equity giant Blackstone is the anchor investor, while Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and some other large global investors are set to pick up the stake through block deals on Thursday, sources said. According to the deal’s term sheet, Gehlaut, along with the promoter family’s investment company Inuus Infrastructure, have mandated Jefferies India to sell 5.5 crore shares of Indiabulls Housing Finance (IBHFL) at a price band of Rs 262.4 to Rs 267.6 per share. This would translate to an aggregate deal value of Rs 1,472 crore at the upper end of the price band. On Wednesday, IBHFL scrip on the BSE closed at Rs 265, marginally up from Tuesday. The deal is part of IBHFL promoters’ plan to exit the company completely. According to the housing finance company’s shareholding pattern disclosed on the BSE, as of September-end, the promoters led by Gehlaut had 17.2% in the company (on a fully diluted basis). As part of the deal with the incoming owners, after the stake sale, Gehlaut will cease to be the promoter of Indiabulls Housing and in 6-9 months, the company will change its name, sources said. In early November, Gehlaut had also announced that as part of his disengagement from Indiabulls Real Estate, another group company, he will step down as its chairman. K G Krishnamurthy, formerly with HDFC Group and a veteran of the realty sector, will take his place, effective February 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gehlaut-to-offload-12-in-indiabulls-hfc/articleshow/88306817.cms||---

The online pages of banks and mobile application will not open due to low server. ATM kiosks will also remain shut and cash will not be loaded in the machines. The regional banks will also join the protest,” he said. “Under the banner of UFBU, the bank associations will lead the protest march from Gandhi Maidan, near SBI, to Dak Bunglow crossing via Exhibition Road, Jamal Road and Fraser Road,” he said. Sanjay Kumar Singh, state convenor of UFBU and state general secretary of the SBI Officers Association, said the protest was to oppose the privatization of public sector banks and to make the general public aware of the compulsion of bank workers to go on strike because of the ill-effects of banks privatization. “Public money is for public welfare and it should not be moved to private hands. We are against the privatization of nationalized banks. All the bank employees associations in the state have agreed to join the protest. The government should pay heed to our demand and roll back its decision of privatization,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50000-bank-employees-in-bihar-to-join-two-day-strike-from-today/articleshow/88305700.cms||Faryal Rumi

The alleged abusive contents were posted on various social media platforms by an advocate, Dinesh, of the Patna high court. The court has ordered to implead social media giants like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp and Meta as respondents in the case. The court also directed to implead the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police as respondent in the case. The EOU is the nodal agency to handle cybercrime cases in the state. The court also directed the EOU to register an FIR, constitute an expert team and investigate into various objectionable materials and offences committed by the advocate and take suitable action under law against him. “This action should be taken forthwith as the judiciary cannot be threatened by a single misdirected individual. The EOU will also investigate the involvement of other persons in this illegal activity,” the court observed. A bench of Justice Sandeep Kumar, while conducting a hearing over an anticipatory bail petition which it had rejected on October 21, observed that though under the law, the abuse is required to be reported to the police, the social media platforms have failed in their duty. Therefore, this court is taking up the matter, it observed. The court also pulled up the EOU for its failure to take any action against the person making objectionable comments and posts on social media against the then CJI, Patna high court judges and the then Union law minister even though it had issued a memo on January 21 this year to take action against persons making objectionable comments by using foul language against ministers, MPs, MLAs and government officers. The high court also directed that an action taken report (ATR) should be filed before it by the EOU ADG on Friday and asked him to remain present physically that day. Besides, the bench also directed the EOU to take up investigation of another cybercrime case lodged by advocate Pratap Sharma with Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna, but the police were unable to investigate it. The court gave one month’s time to file a report on it. On Wednesday, the court took up the matter of Dinesh terming it as ‘very disturbing’ while dealing with cybercrimes and appointed Manu Tripurari as amicus curiae in the case. The original matter was in the nature of a criminal miscellaneous case where an accused, Shiv Kumar, had prayed for anticipatory bail in a cyber fraud case with Warisaliganj police station in Nawada. The bench had rejected his plea on October 21 this year and increased the ambit of the case by first seeking details of cybercrimes taking place in Nawada from its SP and then from ADG (modernisation) about government steps to control cybercrime and steps taken by state police headquarters. The court has already impleaded Centre’s Financial Intelligence Unit and Reserve Bank of India as parties in bail matter during the last hearing on November 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-raps-social-media-giants-over-contents-abusing-judges/articleshow/88306053.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The same court of special judge Shashikant Ray had earlier set a record of convicting a rape accused in single day proceedings on October 4. The Pocso court also directed the Araria District Legal Service Authority (DLSA) to pay Rs10 lakh to the minor victim’s parents for her education and rehabilitation from the Victim Compensation Fund payable under the Pocso Act and rules. Special Pocso prosecutor, Shyamlal Yadav, told this newspaper that the court has beaten its own record of imparting justice to a rape victim child by concluding the proceedings in a single day. “The entire trial proceedings -- right from taking cognizance of the offence, framing of charges, examination and cross-examinations of all the prosecution witnesses, recording statement of the accused, hearing arguments from both sides to passing of judgement in the open court — were video recorded in the presence of the accused, Raju Yadav, and his lawyer Bina Kumari,” Yadav said. Police sources said the rape case was registered by Araria Mahila Thana under the Pocso Act on September 22 this year. Police completed the investigation and submitted chargesheet in the Pocso court on December 14. On Wednesday, the defence lawyer pleaded for a lenient view while awarding punishment, but the special Pocso prosecutor prayed for inflicting exemplary punishment on the accused as he had raped an eight-year-old girl. Investigating officer of the case, Anima Kumari, told this newspaper: “Being a woman police officer, I accorded top priority to the case and submitted the chargesheet within the stipulated period as provided in the Pocso Act.” The court was jampacked to watch the proceedings, which concluded in a single day for the second time in Araria district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/araria-pocso-court-awards-life-to-rape-accused-in-one-day/articleshow/88306140.cms||L P Nayak

BJP state general secretary P Sudheer said the case against Surendran indicated that the chief minster was sharing the same mental condition of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who justified the miscreants who killed a Sri Lankan citizen in broad day light, alleging blasphemy. “A case was registered against Surendran for declaring solidarity with those who oppose the religious fundamentalists. The police acted yielding to the pressure of the fundamentalist forces. BJP would like to know whether the police case against Surendran was one of the conditions that Pinarayi promised to those who held talks with him on Waqf issue,” he said. The BJP leader asked why the police were reluctant in registering a case against the Muslim League leader who made derogatory remarks about Pinarayi’s daughter and son-in-law.

Meanwhile, Welfare Party leaders are of the view that the charges against Surendran were not strong enough as it were bailable. The delay in registering case against Surendran and slapping only 153 A and 295 A against him was reflective of the nexus between Kerala police and Sangh Parivar, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/case-against-surendran-bjp-slams-pinarayi/articleshow/88310303.cms||---

BJP state general secretary P Sudheer said the case against Surendran indicated that the chief minster was sharing the same mental condition of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who justified the miscreants who killed a Sri Lankan citizen in broad day light, alleging blasphemy. “A case was registered against Surendran for declaring solidarity with those who oppose the religious fundamentalists. The police acted yielding to the pressure of the fundamentalist forces. BJP would like to know whether the police case against Surendran was one of the conditions that Pinarayi promised to those who held talks with him on Waqf issue,” he said. The BJP leader asked why the police were reluctant in registering a case against the Muslim League leader who made derogatory remarks about Pinarayi’s daughter and son-in-law.

Yadav, along with ASI Rajesh Kumar (47) posted in Pandarak police station and one Lalbabu Das (50), was shot dead near a marriage hall at Bajitpur village under Barh police station area in rural Patna late Saturday night. They were attending the wedding of a trader’s daughter from Mamrakhabad in Pandarak. A senior police officer privy to the investigation said Yadav was killed to eliminate the possibility of rivalry for tenders to be floated for construction of a cement factory on 130 acres of land in Pandarak. The estimated cost of the factory would be more than Rs1000 crore. He said the notorious Bhola Singh gang was involved in the killings. Bhola was once a close associate of MLA Anant Singh, but became his rival a decade back over tender disputes. Police sources said Yadav had a dispute with Bhola sometime back over uprooting pillars on a plot of land in Pandarak. “The stakes were high. The mukhiya’s killing was to be ensured no matter what. Thus, the shooters didn’t hesitate to kill the two others, too,” the officer said. He said altogether nine persons, including Bhola, his brother and Paschimi Pandarak mukhiya Mukesh Singh, Bhola’s shooter Sooraj, Uday Narayan Sharma alias Uday Pahalwan and his three sons are named accused in the FIR lodged by Yadav’s brother Dharmraj Kumar. “However, Dharmraj has not mentioned anything about the tender rivalry in the FIR. Police arrested Uday’s son Rakesh Singh alias Dablu (42) in the murder case. He was sent to jail on Tuesday. The others are evading arrest,” he said. The officer said the killings seem to be a fallout of panchayat election rivalry as Yadav defeated Rajesh’s wife to become the mukhiya. “But the case is not so,” he said. He said Yadav was close to Ram Janam Yadav, who was shot dead in a general coach of Patliputra-Hatia Express near Athmalgola station in Barh in February 2018. “Ram was also killed to eliminate rivalry over tender. But MLA Anant was a named accused in that case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandarak-mukhiya-shot-over-tender-war-police/articleshow/88306077.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Around 250 persons visit Candolim PHC for their vaccinations everyday, and a majority of them comprise outstation staff of tourism-related businesses in the Calangute-Candolim tourism hub, said health officer Dr Roshan Nazareth. “The number of locals is practically zero because almost all of them have taken their second dose,” Nazareth said. Earlier, till the end of October, around 100-150 people would turn up for vaccinations after the initial rush during the second wave. With a large number of hotels, resorts, shacks, restaurants and other tourism-related businesses opening up again following a decline in Covid cases, staff and job seekers from other states have started coming in large numbers, stakeholders said. Vaccinations are now being conducted everyday, except Sundays and holidays, at Candolim PHC. “We had to put up a special pandal to accommodate the crowd,” Nazareth said. Saligao PHC, which falls under Candolim PHC, is also undertaking vaccinations, only once a week. “We have told the eight panchayats which come under Candolim PHC to inform us if they want to have one-day vaccination camps whenever required. The Calangute panchayat is planning to have one soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-tourism-kickstarts-candolim-health-centre-sees-high-turnout-for-vaccinations/articleshow/88307030.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The reason for this is unknown. Recently, some female candidates took up this issue with the chief minister’s office, demanding immediate action,” said sources close to the development. The announcement for recruitment to the post of assistant professors in various government colleges was made in 2018. “Three years later, interviews were conducted after written examinations were held. Now, the government has stopped the process without giving any sort of explanation,” said sources. In the case of MS University of Baroda, the announcement for recruitment of 600 assistant professors for various subjects was made in 2019. Candidates were screened in 2020. However, there is no clarity about interviews for final job placement, said sources. Similarly, for Shri Govind Guru University in Godhra, a newspaper advertisement invited candidates for interviews but it was cancelled a day before the interview was scheduled. The university again invited applications for the posts but there is no clarity on the exact date of the interviews. Recently, the government announced recruitment for 900 vacant posts for grant-in aid colleges of the state but there is little progress in this direction so far, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/faculty-recruitment-hits-roadblock-in-gujarat/articleshow/88306410.cms||---
---||Delhi||DJB plans to encourage use of treated water for horticulture||NEW DELHI: To reduce the groundwater extraction at large private properties, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) will reach out to the owners of farmhouses and encourage them to use treated water for horticulture purposes. DJB on Wednesday issued a notice on the policy of supplying treated water from all waste water treatment plants to farmhouses for horticulture and other such uses. The move comes after a recent meeting of water minister Satyendar Jain with DJB officials, where it was decided to supply treated water to farmhouses in the areas like Satbari, Sultanpur and Jaunpur, which are currently extracting groundwater for horticultural need. According to DJB, more than 15 million gallons per day (MGD) of water will be supplied to farmhouses so that tubewells can be closed and no groundwater is extracted. Under the scheme, DJB will bear the cost of laying pipelines to provide the treated water at the lawns. There will also be no restriction on the quantity of treated water supplied. An applicant will pay a monthly fixed tariff of Rs 5,000 per acre, apart from a one-time infrastructure cost of Rs 10,000 per acre. An application can be submitted at the DJB headquarters. The Delhi government is trying to motivate people to use treated waste water for non-potable purposes like gardening, washing floors and flushing. DJB is currently supplying 940MGD of water as against the demand of 1,140MGD in the national capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/djb-plans-to-encourage-use-of-treated-water-for-horticulture/articleshow/88307039.cms||---
---||Varanasi||After Kashi Vishwanath Dam launch, phase-II work starts with full vigour||VARANASI: Within days of the grand opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dam by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, the agency involved for executing this mega project has re-intensified the work proposed in the phase-II with full vigour. TOI took stock of the KVD on Wednesday and found that the labourers were in action mode once again, especially at Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats, where the entry route of KVD from river bank is being constructed. Now, the construction material, especially stone plates could be seen being brought through the river route instead of the Godowlia-Maidagin route, which was used for transportation of construction materials for the initial phase. “The work of the phase-II of the project has restarted as we have to finish it by February-end,” said PWDs executive engineer Sanjay Gore. Regarding the change in mode of transportation of construction material he said, “Stone plates have been fixed before the KVD opening on the route used for bringing the material inside the project area by road from Godowlia or Maidagin sides. Therefore, bringing heavy vehicles through this route is not possible now.” “Thus, further transportation of construction material has been started through the river route,” he said, adding, “Mainly, stone plates and structures are being transported by boats and dumped at the three ghats where basic structure for constructing steps has already been done.” “Apart from ghat steps, Ganga Gallery with cafeteria with a gate at Jalasen Ghat, a building with viewing gallery where physically challenges pilgrims will reach through ramp, a boundary wall and block of four buildings have to be constructed as remaining work of phase-II, for which the state government has already sanctioned Rs 55-crore and a revised estimate has been sent for increasing it to Rs 65-crore,” said Gore. These officials and the construction company are facing challenges in executing the work at the river bank as the level of the Ganga is still high. Gore said, “As level of water in the Ganga is maintained above normal level in November and December, half of the 55-meter-long jetty is still inundated. So, we have started work at higher points.” For the second phase of the Rs 900-Cr KVD project, construction material has started reaching the project site through the river route. The second phase, which is targeted to be completed by February end, will open the Ganga route for entering KVD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/after-opening-of-kvd-phase-ii-of-project-launched-with-full-vigour/articleshow/88306407.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Goa||Goa industries plan December 20 shutdown to protest price rise||PANAJI: Upset with the steep rise in raw material prices, Goa State Industries Association (GSIA) has asked the over 2,500 small and micro industries in the state to participate in the nationwide one-day closure planned for December 20. GSIA has supported the All India Council of Association of MSMEs (AICA), which has also asked entrepreneurs to hold a one-hour peaceful demonstration on that day to seek a reduction in raw material prices. If the 10 lakh MSMEs across India go ahead with the day long closure, it will result in a production loss of Rs 25,000 crore. “The prices of raw materials continue to rise and this is not a normal increase. Most of the MSMEs have rate contracts and are suppliers for larger companies. They cannot increase the prices even though raw material costs have gone up,” said GSIA president Damodar Kochkar. Various MSME bodies and AICA have submitted numerous memorandums to the Centre about the “alarming” increase in prices and the need to control raw material prices. Entrepreneurs want the Centre to either procure raw material such as steel, aluminium and iron in bulk on behalf of the industries, or permit renegotiation of the supply contracts to allow upward revision. Currently, there is no price escalation clause for public sector projects. The huge rise in prices of raw materials like steel, iron ore, aluminium, copper, plastics, PVC, paper and chemicals has led to the erosion of working capital, said AICA in a release. “Public sector enterprises must be instructed to accept cancellation of orders from MSMEs with no penalty or blacklisting, as steel price increase is a force majeure event, outside the control of the MSMEs,” said Kochkar. AICA has also recommended that the Centre allow import of all steel materials based on cost and quality requirements with no anti-dumping charges, and also ban export of iron ore and steel products. “It may be noted that better GDP growth can be realised if value-added products are exported rather than raw materials. This will generate employment too,” said AICA. Kochkar said that the state and Centre have always advocated development and entrepreneurship, but the surge in raw material prices will only cripple MSMEs and discourage entrepreneurship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-industries-plan-dec-20-shutdown-to-protest-price-rise/articleshow/88307015.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Rs 17cr accident insurance claims paid in Guj since pandemic||Ahmedabad: With increased number of medical emergencies since Covid pandemic, claims for government-backed emergency accident insurance policy also went up dramatically in Gujarat. To be precise, claims worth Rs 17 crore have been paid between June 2020 to November 2021 under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), according to the data tabled in the parliament. Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana is a government-backed accident insurance scheme in India. As part of the scheme, for an annual premium of Rs 12, the policy holder is eligible for Rs 1 lakh of cover in case of partial disability due to accident and Rs 2 lakh for the nominee in case of unexpected death or full disability of the policy holder. From June 2020 till May 2021, fresh claims worth Rs 7.04 crore were paid to policy holders or their nominees in Gujarat. However, within six months of the current policy year i.e. from June to November this year, fresh claims worth a whopping Rs 10.46 crore — up 48% — were paid off . Sources indicate that more claims not just indicate rising incidents of accidental deaths or disabilities but also more awareness. “More people are becoming aware of having an accident insurance policy. This has not just led to the increase in number of policy holders but also the number of claims. On one hand, fresh enrolments have increased and on the other, the process for claiming money has become much simpler and even the turnaround time has reduced. Due to this, the number of beneficiaries under the scheme have increased,” said a source. Insurance industry players suggest that the number of policy holders have also increased under PMSBY since the pandemic. In the year 2020-21 alone i.e. some 19.65 lakh fresh policy holders came under the ambit of PMSBY, according to the report issued by State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) - Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rs-17cr-accident-insurance-claims-paid-in-guj-since-pandemic/articleshow/88306475.cms||Niyati Parikh

The ‘One Goa One Card’ with automated fare collection system is scheduled to be launched on December 21, and will be introduced by the Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTC) by linking it with the payment gateway, PayTM. The launch will pave a way for the usage of a cashless card system in buses run in the state by KTC. Android ticketing machines will also be handed to all KTC conductors to carry out the ticketing process. Aimed at letting passengers pay across different public transport platforms using one card, the technology is likely to be adopted by other transport service providers in the state as well. “Digital transactions will be made easy with the help of this system with or without internet connectivity. While we will be using it for bus ticketing services, as soon as it becomes popular, users will be able to use the card for other services such as pay parking, purchase of groceries, etc,” KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate said. “We intend to have 100% digital revenue collection and this will ensure efficient fare collection in the transport system. This one-of-a-kind technology can also be adopted by rickshaws, pilots and other public transport service providers in Goa,” he added. Launched by the central government a year ago, the service enables passengers from any part of the country to use their NCMC-compliant RuPay debit card for seamless travel. The same card can also be used for shopping and banking transactions across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-to-get-one-goa-one-card-for-fare-collection/articleshow/88307043.cms||---

Continuing his Vijay Yatra for the second consecutive day in Jaunpur on Wednesday, Akhilesh cited the SIT report in the Kheri case to attack the Bharatiya Janata Party. "Truth is out in the open. Now, it is clear that as part of a conspiracy, the people associated with the BJP had killed farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri by crushing them. If BJP has morality, it should immediately sack the MoS for home affairs," Akhilesh said. He said the BJP's desperation was increasing as the assembly polls were inching closer. "Fear of defeat is compelling the BJP to bring the leaders from other states to UP. The huge turnout of people in Vijay Yatra is increasing the worries of BJP as it has become clear that bicycle is going to oust the bull and bulldozer from the state," Akhilesh said. On inflation and unemployment, Akhilesh said that profit of petroleum oil companies had increased to over 600% in the last three months but instead of giving any relief to the poor the government was busy giving more benefits to wealthy people. "The promise to double the income of farmers proved to be a lie while inflation has doubled in the BJP rule. Unemployment is on the rise. The increasing resentment due to the death of over 700 farmers during the agitation forced the BJP to withdraw three farm laws," he added. "SP is raising people's issues. By extending their support to the Vijay Yatra, people have made it clear that they want a change in UP," he said, claiming that BJP will suffer a historic defeat in the 2022 election. Akhilesh promised justice to all, more job opportunities and action against law-breakers without discrimination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/akhilesh-demands-sacking-of-mos-after-sit-exposes-his-sons-involvement-in-kheri-case/articleshow/88306413.cms||---

In the first phase, 19 out of 82 Code C stands have been constructed. The new stands have become operational after statutory approval from Directorate General of Civil Aviation,” Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) said on Wednesday. Code C aircraft are bigger planes like A320 and B737 that have a wingspan measuring between 24 metres and 36 metres. “The completion of the first phase of work for the expansion of T1’s new smart apron is another step towards enhancing the infrastructure and passenger experience at the Delhi airport to make it future-ready,” said Prabhakar Rao, deputy managing director of GMR Group that runs DIAL. The total number of parking stands at T1 will increase from 55 to 82, including 22 contact and 8 MARS stands, DIAL stated. A contact stand is suitable for walking passengers to and from an aircraft from an allocated gate, while a MARS stand can cater to both codes C and E aircraft. The move will not only improve operational efficiency and safety on the airside, but also contribute towards reducing harmful CO2 emissions, underlining DIAL’s commitment to environment-friendly initiatives, he added. After Phase 3A, IGIA will be able to handle 140 million passengers per annum, Rao said. “The new apron would help reduce air traffic congestion on the airside... The creation of new contact stands would lead to reduction in the number of ground support equipment,” DIAL said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/19-new-aircraft-stands-at-delhi-airport-t1/articleshow/88307046.cms||Zumbish

This was in response to a PIL that has challenged the legal provisions and demanded that sexual offences committed by a man against the wife should be made a punishable offence. Saying that the PIL has raised an important issue, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta informed the petitioner’s advocate that it intends to pass an order on how the court proposes to deal with this subject. The judges also reminded the government about its order passed in 2018 wherein it called for a need to criminalize marital rape and asked the government about the steps undertaken in that regard. One Jaideep Verma from Vadodara has demanded that marital rape should be made a punishable offence, which is at present not a punishable offence by virtue of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which also provides an exception that if a man commits rape on his wife, who is above 15 years of age, is not punishable. The petitioner has challenged the constitutional validity of the exception given in the definition of rape in section 375 of IPC which gives immunity to the man from punishment provided under section 376 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/criminalize-marital-rape-seeks-pil-in-gujarat-hc/articleshow/88303207.cms||---

The villagers dispersed from the place only after panchayat secretary Ameya Miringkar said he would visit the site on Thursday. The villagers were led by Agostine Antao, chairperson of Guirdolim Biodiversity Management Committee, who said that the panchayat secretary’s site inspection report was essential for them to move the National Green Tribunal (NGT). “The panchayat has failed to issue a stop work order to the Railways and is yet to conduct a site inspection,”Antao said. Earlier in the day, villagers called on minister for water resources department (WRD) Filipe Neri Rodrigues and brought to his notice the damage caused to the lake. Rodrigues spoke to the executive engineer, water resources department (WRD), and directed him to conduct a site inspection immediately. Accordingly, a team of WRD officials visited the site and confirmed that the work was being carried out without their authorisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chandor-locals-want-nagozon-lake-inspection/articleshow/88307055.cms||---

The police have questioned hundreds of auto drivers to track down the one who had allegedly raped the girl but investigations so far have revealed that the crime may not have been committed by an auto driver. “There is no evidence to show that the girl was kidnapped and raped by an auto driver. Bus driver Kanji Khaant, who had first spotted the girl near the compound, said that she told him that an auto driver had rammed his vehicle into her cycle. We scanned the CCTV footage of the spot where the girl was last seen with her cycle,” said a crime branch official. “We couldn’t find any auto-rickshaw on the stretch where the girl was riding her cycle near the compound before she suddenly disappeared. The girl has also written in her diary that she was pushed by someone when she was passing from the road opposite the Vaccine Institute Compound,” the official told TOI. “But she didn’t mention that an auto-rickshaw had rammed into her cycle. The theory of an auto driver and his aide raping the girl is based only on Kanji’s statement,” he added. Interestingly, the girl has given a detailed description of the accused duo in her diary. She has written ‘They were not mawali type of!! He fragrance well! Not more than 20-21 of age as per body.’ She has also mentioned that one of the accused even called her by her name. “The girl wrote that from their talks it seemed that the accused may have been following her for many days,” the police said. “This points to the fact that the accused knew the girl. So, the chances of some auto driver being involved in the incident are very negligible. We are working on the theory of some men known to the girl assaulting her,” a police official said. The girl, a resident of Navsari, had committed suicide in a train on November 4. Her diary noting revealed that she was allegedly raped on October 29 in Vadodara city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girls-rapists-may-not-be-auto-drivers-cops/articleshow/88306269.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to write to SEC to defer local body polls, panel says not possible||MUMBAI: Stung by the SC verdict converting the 27% quota seats for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) into the general category for the upcoming local body polls, the state cabinet on Wednesday resolved to write to the state election commission to postpone the election. This, to allow for empirical data to be collected in order to restore the OBC quota. The cabinet also agreed to appoint an IAS officer as a point-person to ensure the data collection on OBC representation takes place. And to approve funds required for the exercise in the upcoming state assembly session. However, the state election commission has said it will not be possible to postpone the local body scheduled for December 21st since the Supreme Court had confirmed the dates. “The state will have to approach the SC for any changes,” said an SEC official. The SEC also pointed out that since the OBC quota seats have been converted to the general category, elections for these seats cannot be held with the rest of the local body elections on December 21st. “We will have to call for nominations afresh from general category candidates. The entire process could take a month,” said an official. The SEC has declared elections for 106 nagar panchayats, the zilla parishads of Bhandara and Gondia, and 15 panchayat samitis on that date. The quota issue is important because the Maratha community and the OBCs, which are more numerous, are jostling for political dominance. Political parties do not want to risk alienating either group. The verdict escalated the blame-game between the MVA government and the Opposition BJP especially since the SC has dismissed the state’s plea seeking data gathered through the Centre’s Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. The SC asked for empirical data on contemporary political representation of OBCs in local bodies to be collated by a dedicated commission. “Now they say the OBC data is not there and there are errors in the SECC. If it was absent, then why did former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis write multiple letters to the Centre asking for OBC data from the SECC?” asked food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal from the NCP. He said the SC verdict would impact the OBC quota in political representation in other states as well. “This will have a national impact and OBCs will rise against it,” said Bhujbal. “It is obvious to OBCs that the BJP is anti-reservation,” said PWD Minister Ashok Chavan. The Opposition BJP said the OBC quota had been lost solely because of the MVA’s negligence. “The Supreme Court had first asked for empirical data on the electoral backwardness of OBCs in 2019. What was the state government doing for the last two years?” asked BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. He said the state should collect the data in the next three months and seek to postpone the polls until the OBC quota is restored. “The BJP is clear that the polls should not be held without the OBC quota,” said Fadnavis. BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule who belongs to the OBC community also said the state had not provided the State Backward Class Commission with funds to collect data. State Congress chief Nana Patole urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to provide all facilities to the Commission so that data collection can begin as early as possible and OBC reservation is sustained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-to-write-to-sec-to-defer-local-body-polls-panel-says-not-possible/articleshow/88307833.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Kozhikode||Some see red: Kerala school adopts gender-neutral uniform||KOZHIKODE: The Balussery Government Girls Higher Secondary School scripted history on Wednesday by becoming the first government school in the state to adopt gender neutral uniform for higher secondary students. State higher education and social justice minister R Bindu made the declaration by attending the event online as both boys and girls of Plus One classes turned up for the function wearing the common uniform comprising shirts and trousers. The school, which follows co-education in the HSS section, has 200 girls and 60 boys in Plus One. The girl students were upbeat about the new uniform saying that they felt more confident in the new dress. However, activists of several Muslim religious organizations, including Sunni Students Federation (SSF), Jamaat e Islami and youth and student organizations of IUML took out a march under the aegis of coordination committee to the school in protest against the decision saying that it amounted to negating individual freedom of girl students to choose their dress. They also said that the decision was taken in a unilateral matter and amounted to imposing the dress of male students on girl students. The protesters were blocked by the police outside the school compound. Making the declaration, minister Bindu termed the gender neutral uniform as a “model step” and said that by implementing gender neutral uniforms the discrimination in dressing should come to an end. She said that students should learn and grow in an atmosphere of freedom and equality without any concerns and added that the gender neutral uniforms would help increase the self-confidence of girl students. “When students wear a dress which boosts their self-confidence and one which does not create barriers to their thoughts and actions it will have a positive impact on their entire academic activities,” Bindu said. “Whenever there is a change, extreme orthodox people and those with archaic mindset have always resisted it. We need not fear it,” she said. She said that the most important thing to consider with regard to dressing is whether it is convenient. “Our girls are being forced to grow up facing many nays. While boys and men are allowed to choose their dress based on convenience, girls and women are encouraged to dress up for others to see in an aesthetic manner. That is clearly discrimination,” the minister said. Speaking at the event, NA Vinaya, inspector of police at women’s cell in Thrissur, recounted the battles she had to wage to have a gender inclusive dress code in the police force. She said that having pants and shirts as uniform was convenient for girl students during their travel in public transport. Sivananda U R, a Plus One student of the school, said that she liked the new uniform as it was more comfortable and it enabled them to do all things properly with ease. “When compared to churidhar, I feel that the new uniform is more flexible,” she said. PTA president K Shaiju presided over the function. Panchayat president Roopalekha Kombilad, distict panchayat member P P Prema, school principal R Indu among others spoke.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/balussery-govt-hss-introduces-unisex-uniform/articleshow/88306461.cms||---

According to police, complainant Mayur Gohel, who works with a private company, had ordered an earphone set from an e-commerce portal last month. But as the piece was defective he contacted the portal and placed a request to return it. On November 29, Gohel got a call from a person claiming to be an executive of the e-commerce company. The executive told Gohel that he would needed to pay a nominal charge of Rs 3 to return the defective earphones. After Gohel agreed to pay the amount, the caller sent him a link in form of SMS and asked him to fill in the details. Gohel did as instructed and also activated similar links from two numbers. As soon Gohel completed the activation process, Rs 99,999 was debited from his bank account in two parts. This is when Gohel realised that he has been duped, and approached the cybercrime cell of police. Porbandar cybercrime sub-inspector Subhash Odedara said, “As soon as the complainant approached us, we traced the link and cancelled the transactions. The complainant got back his money. Now we are tracing the accused using the phone numbers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/porbandar-man-gets-back-rs-1l-lost-in-cyber-fraud/articleshow/88305626.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Posta third phase work from Dec 20||Kolkata: The legal hurdle behind dismantling Vivekananda Road flyover, also known as Posta flyover in its second phase of work has been cleared as the Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is gearing up to initiate the third phase work of dismantling the flyover on a 160 meter stretch from Ganesh Talkies towards Central Avenue on KK Tagore Street from December 20 onwards and also to complete the remaining dismantling work on the stretch from Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park. KMDA officials said that there are three more piers which are to be pulled down in the second phase of work that was on the 250-meter-long stretch from Girish Park to Ganesh Talkies which would had taken about another fortnight to be completed but work got stuck mid-way after one resident of the area filed a court case, stating that the balcony of his building should not be affected or damaged during pulling down the flyover structure. “ For dismantling these piers, the complainant’s balcony portion of the building could not be avoided and will be affected when the flyover is pulled down at that portion. It was assured that KMDA will take up the required compensatory work to repair any damage that may occur and will pay compensation for the damage that will be incurred.. The matter is now resolved as the offer has been accepted and the complainant will receive the compensation money from KMDA within the next couple of days after which we will be able to take up work to complete the second stage of work of dismantling the flyover,” said a KMDA official. The police had earlier pleaded with KMDA to ensure that a portion of the Girish Park-Ganesh Talkies stretch is reopened before beginning the third phase. After remaining shut since August this year, one flank of the stretch between Ganesh Talkies to Girish Park is to reopen for traffic movement in a few days. “We expect vehicles to resume movement on this stretch from December 16,” said a traffic department officer at Lalbazar. KMDA engineers and the Jorabagan traffic guard officers conducted an inspection last week on the progress of work of dismantling the flyover. KMDA officials said that initially they had planned to take up third phase of work from Posta side, but later decided to take up from Ganesh Talkies end after joint inspection with the police. We will be seeking a closure of traffic from December 20 onwards for taking up the third phase of work of dismantling the flyover,” said a KMDA official. KMDA had earlier taken up the second phase dismantling work from September onwards after completing the first phase of work from Ganesh Talkies to Posta Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/posta-third-phase-work-from-dec-20/articleshow/88285627.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Allahabad||Persistent soil erosion, marsh land a major challenge for Magh Mela authorities||Prayagraj: This year, persistent soil erosion on the banks of Ganga and marshland (Daldali Bhoomi) are posing a major challenge for the Magh Mela authorities. While mela authorities admitted that the water current of river Ganga is fast this year but corrective measures have been initiated to deal with the soil erosion problem. Teams of labourers have also been engaged to make the marshland suitable for living. District Magistrate (Magh Mela) Shesh Mani Pandey said, "Although the water current of river Ganga is fast, we are making sincere and appropriate arrangements to deal with the situation." He further added, "We would also make arrangements to settle down all the religious, spiritual and social organisations arriving for the Magh Mela in alternative places and there would be 'Divya' and 'Bhavya' Magh mela in 2022." The DM, however, maintained that the entire mela campus has been divided into five sectors and the work of land allotments among various departments, and organizations would be taken from December 22. The DM also assured that the Mela area would be spread in 640-hectare land as it was in the previous year and all sorts of facilities would be offered to visitors, seers, saints and organisations. The DM, meanwhile, made it clear that the Covid-19 protocol would be strictly followed and advised visitors to carry fully immunized certificates along with them. He also said that monitoring of Mela work has been done on daily basis and our priority was to complete all the projects on or before the scheduled time. As per information, land allotment work for different organisations would be taken up as follow - Dandi Swami Nagar, Dandi Bada (December 22 and 23), Khak Chowk ( December 24 and 25), and Acharya Swami Nagar (January 26 and 27). Moreover, land at Sangam lower marg, Sangam Upper marg, Saraswati marg and Mahavir Ji marg would be allotted on December 31. Similarly, the land would be allotted on Annapurna marg on January 1 and Tulsi marg and GT road on January 2. Moreover, land at Triveni and Kali marg would be allotted on January 3 and 4 respectively. Land allotment at sectors 1, 2, parade, Shastri Gata and Kabir Nagar would be done on January 5 while land at Samudrakoop marg and interlocking marg (sector 3) and Ramanuj marg and Arial would also be allotted on the same day. This year, there would be no entry of new organisations and only old organisations – holding camps on mela campus for years- would be allotted land at the suitable land and sectors. Officials, however, claimed that hectic preparations are underway to construct the pontoon bridges and levelling work was almost done. With barely a month left for the beginning of 47 days grand religious and spiritual fair, all the departments have come up with their blueprints to organize mela. Magh Mela, beginning from January 14, would be culminating on March 1, 2022. Mela administration has also put their focus towards Kalpwasi area where thousands of Kalpwasis from different parts of the country would be spending a month-long time on the banks of Ganga and covering a spiritual journey to seek salvation. A senior mela official pointed out that apart from soil erosion, agencies working on land levelling work had faced marshy land posing another difficulty to deal with. He added that even machines like tractors and JCBs were struck in marshy land and agencies had to make extra efforts to deal with the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/persistent-soil-erosion-marsh-land-a-major-challenge-for-magh-mela-authorities/articleshow/88306463.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Salt Lake molestation survivor records statement||By: Mayukh Sengupta KOLKATA: The 25-year-old woman from Asansol who was allegedly molested by two Salt Lake police personnel last week, recorded her statement before a judicial magistrate at a Salt Lake court on Wednesday. She had reportedly identified her tormentors in a test-identification (TI) parade conducted at Dum Dum Central Jail on Tuesday. Following the TI parade and statement registration before the magistrate, investigating cops appealed before the magistrate on Wednesday with a prayer to grill the two accused cops at the jail. On Monday, a Salt Lake court rejecting the bail plea of the duo, civic volunteer Abhisek Malakar and assistant sub inspector Sandip Pal, had remanded them in 14 days judicial custody. It also reminded them that it’s a cop’s duty to help people in distress and that by not doing so they have not preserved the moral duty of the police department. “A woman sought help from police. Your work is to perform the duty staying within the ambit of the law. It is your responsibility which you didn’t do and thus didn’t preserve the moral duty of the department. Bidhannagar police is a very citizen friendly force. Being members of such a prestigious force you were wrong in making a woman sit between two of you on a bike,” the additional chief judicial magistrate, Santanu Ganguly, had said during the proceeding. The duo’s counsels said now that the TI parade and statement recording is done, they would make a fresh bail appeal before the court this week.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt plea to shift Anil Deshmukh case to SIT junked||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday dismissed the Maharashtra government’s petition to hand over the CBI probe against its former home minister Anil Deshmukh to a Special investigation team (SIT), saying the state’s contention lacked bona fides and was only an attempt to take away the probe from the Central agency. The state, which emerged successful before HC in the Rashmi Shukla quashing petition, got no relief in its petition against the CBI. A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal found no merit in the state’s contention that CBI is disentitled to carry out investigation in the matter. It said the state made out no case for withdrawal by CBI from the investigation and for setting up an SIT. The state government is run by the Shiv Sena-led MVA. The CBI is a Central agency. The HC held, “There is no substance in the contention of (Maharashtra government) that because (Subodh Jaiswal) is now the director of CBI, respondent CBI is not competent to carry on with the investigation.” The HC also said it appeared the state’s plea is “only an attempt…to take the investigation somehow away from the CBI so that it does not proceed.” “Apart from being without merit, this challenge based on the role of Jaiswal lacks bonafides,” said the HC. The state had sought a court-monitored SIT to replace the agency which is probing an FIR it had registered on April 21 against Deshmukh and “unknown others” for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act based on former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s letter to CM Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 where he alleged ‘corrupt malpractices’ by the home minister alleging attempts by him to collect Rs 100 crore from Mumbai’s restaurants and bars. The state’s submission was that Jaiswal, its former DGP, had played lead roles on state’s two police establishment boards (PEBs), which recommend and decide postings of police officers, and could be summoned during investigation for decisions taken when Deshmukh was minister. Deshmukh had resigned after HC on April 5 directed a preliminary enquiry into a complaint based on Singh’s allegations. The state’s submission, through its special senior counsel Darius Khambata, was that it was only seeking a fair and unbiased probe and it said it did not expect CBI to put up any opposition to its petition, expressing high esteem for Jaiswal. The CBI’s submission was that the state wanted to “scuttle the investigation against its ex-home minister conducted by CBI.” The state noted CBI had summoned its DGP Sanjay Pandey and former additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte, which was nothing but “harassment.” The state also said the CBI probe was demoralising to its 1,900 members on its police force. The HC’s 74-page judgment authored by Justice Jamdar said both Pandey and Kunte are also government officers and expected to cooperate with the probe by CBI pursuant to orders of this court. “We fail to understand how requesting to participate in the investigation would amount to harassment of these two officers.” The HC accepted CBI counsel, additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi’s submission that it would be harassment if CBI had insisted on their presence in its Delhi office at an inconvenient time, which was not the case as they were called to the Mumbai office. Commenting on the state’s “conduct,” the HC said it could see the “approach” of the government and then DGP Jaiswal and Kunte, then ACS (home), pertaining to a report submitted by state’s ex-intel chief Rashmi Shukla. A report had been sent to Jaiswal last year “stating that network of brokers with ingrained political connections (was) engaged in arranging desired postings in exchange for monetary compensation.” “A detailed and factual report with surveillance and transfer involved was given to the Director- General,” the HC noted and added that a response by Kunte “downplays gravity of the report submitted by the Commissioner, SID.” The HC said, “This response of the home secretary of the petitioner is part of the overall conduct of the petitioner, which we have taken cognizance of.” The HC said the state’s first reaction was not for a probe by SIT but it had opposed probe in both the letter by Singh and report of Shukla and Kunte. The “first response” was “to trivialize the need for investigation,” HC said. "The Court will have to take note of this conduct of the State of Maharashtra to bring challenges one after another in context of the argument of the respondent -- CBI -- that sole intention of the Petitioner is to create hurdles in the investigation,” the HC added. The HC clarified its findings against the state on its conduct are not to be considered as its indictment in general “but they are in context as a party in this litigation and as an adjudication of issue raised in petition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-plea-to-shift-deshmukh-case-to-sit-junked/articleshow/88307853.cms||Swati Deshpande

The minister said that the education department would continue to support the efforts in this direction. “The general education department has already welcomed the decision taken by the Valayan Chirangara Government LP School in Ernakulam regarding the introduction of gender-neutral uniforms. The department welcomes a similar decision taken by Balussery Girls HSS too,” said Sivankutty. The spirit of the changing world should reflect in the education system as well, the minister said. It was already stated that textbooks would be subjected to gender auditing when it comes to syllabus revision. “The education process could move forward only by imbibing progressive changes in the society. It doesn’t mean that anything would be thrust upon unilaterally. Nobody would be forced to make any moves against their willingness. Let society discuss it all. Only progressive thoughts and creative discussions would take the society forward,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sivankutty-reiterates-support-to-gender-neutral-uniforms/articleshow/88306477.cms||---

Representatives of Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association will hold a protest rally from JP Chowk in Khanpur to Vallabh Sadan on Ashram Road at 10am on Thursday. As many as 70,000 bank employees are expected to go on strike across Gujarat. They will join the nationwide strike by public sector banks, seeking to withdraw the Banking Laws (Amendments) Bill, which proposes privatisation of public sector banks. Some 4,800 bank branches will remain shut across the state for two days, impacting transactions worth Rs 20,000 crore, suggested MGBEA estimates. “The employees are against the banking regulation act which proposes to privatize national banks. The efforts of government should be towards strengthening the public sector banks and not shut them out, because these banks implement financial inclusion programme and other government schemes effectively,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/psu-bankers-to-hold-protest-rally-today/articleshow/88306496.cms||---

Her family members alleged that after the surgery at a private hospital in Etah district on November 26, pus started coming out from the stitches and an artery linked to the patient's liver was damaged. They further alleged that one of the members of the surgery team doesn't even hold an MBBS degree. The woman's husband has now filed a complaint with the health department and police. Dr Umesh Tripathi, chief medical officer of Etah district, said, “A complaint of medical negligence causing danger to life of a patient has been received against the multi-specialty hospital. The complainant has also alleged that an unqualified person has operated upon the patient. The matter will be investigated in detail.” A resident of Mathura district, Hari Mohan works as a small-time farmer in Sonai. “After my wife's surgery, she started having severe pain in her stomach. I took her again to the hospital on December 4. The doctors told me that there is another stone in the common bile duct. They took my wife to a different private hospital and conducted a second surgery on December 5. The doctors there then informed me that a third surgery may be required after 6 to 8 weeks," said the husband who has two young children. “I later found out that an artery connected to her liver was damaged during the surgery. I have already spent around Rs 1.5 lakh on my wife's treatment and don't have any savings left. Her life is in danger. I filed a complaint on Monday. I want justice,” he added. The Etah police are yet to register an FIR, though. “We have received a complaint regarding a botched surgery of a woman at a private hospital. It is an alleged case of medical negligence. Appropriate steps will be taken on the basis of the health department’s probe findings. So far, there is no update from that department,” said Kotwali Dehat SHO Jagdish Chandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/woman-critical-after-botched-surgery-at-private-hosp-in-etah/articleshow/88303305.cms||Deepak Lavania

Jewellery stores across the city were deserted for most of the day, as the demand went down by 50% according to the estimates of Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). With the wedding-jewellery purchases dwindling, the overall sales have come down. Jigar Soni, the president of JAA, said: “The kamurta period is considered inauspicious for purchases and for weddings and other happy events.” He added: “The onset of the period has dampened the demand for gold and diamond jewellery. Sales of wedding jewellery are almost nil and as a result the overall volumes have gone down by 50%.” In November, about 5.44 metric tonnes of gold was imported to Gujarat. Estimates of jewellers indicate that this is expected to decline in December in the wake of the muted demand. The gold price stood at Rs 49,600 per 10 gram in Ahmedabad on Wednesday. “The gold demand in November was good because the festival season that month was followed by the wedding season,” said Soni. “However, now we only get customers who want lightweight jewellery for functional purposes.” In fact, even customers who tend to invest in gold by purchasing coins or bars are moving away from gold. “Investors are veering towards the stock market expecting better returns,” said a city-based bullion trader. “Moreover, with the yellow metal prices fluctuating slightly, investors are keeping an eye on the price movements and identifying an appropriate time to buy.” Industry estimates suggest that the demand for jewellery has gone down in rural areas as well. “With the recent spell of unseasonal rainfall and piling of debt triggered by crop failure, people are not readily investing in gold,” said a jeweller based in Manek Chowk area of Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kamurta-crushes-gold-demand/articleshow/88306505.cms||---

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar asked the state to conduct its own exercise to collect such data and raised objections over the state insisting on getting "flawed" data which could not serve any purpose as contended by the Centre. The court also pulled up the state and the Centre for not assisting the court in giving a clear picture on how the data was collected and whether there was a force of law behind the decision taken by the executive to carry out the exercise after solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed the bench that collection of OBC data was not part of the 2011 census and was done separately. The bench said it cannot proceed in the case on the basis of "ifs and buts" and dismissed the petition. It allowed the state to pursue its case for getting data before an appropriate forum and indicated that it can file an application under the Right to Information Act. Senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, appearing for the state government, informed the bench that the Centre had told Parliament that the data were 98.87% accurate and the state has a right to know about the data. But the solicitor general said many states have conducted the exercise to collect the data pertaining to OBC and Maharashtra should also do so and not insist on "unreliable" data. “Due to the mistakes committed by enumerators, inherent flaws in the manner of conducting the Census and several such factors, there is no reliable or dependable caste-based Census data available which can be the basis of any constitutional or statutory exercises like reservations in admission, promotion or local body elections,” the Centre had said in its reply while opposing Maharashtra’s plea for data frtom the SECC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-rejects-maha-plea-for-flawed-obc-census-data/articleshow/88307870.cms||---

According to the police, Rehmat Khan Munir Khan Makarani of Aravalli’s Bhaloda village had sold off his vehicles to one Munna Mir, whom he knew through brokers, some five months ago after he was incurring losses in business owing to the pandemic. Mir has a long history of criminal records, said cops, who had arrested the accused based on Khan’s complaint. “However the vehicles could be recovered only on Tuesday from a ceramic factory in Morbi,” DSP Bharat Basiya told TOI. Brokers Farooqmia Kazi and Imran M Cheepa had introduced Mir to Rehmat Khan who sold two JCBs, two tractors and a dumper to the buyer. But after Mir did not pay Khan the money, he inquired and realized that he has been duped by the notorious cheater who has a gang of his own and many cases registered against him as well. The brokers too have been named in the complaint for facilitating the crime. Basiya further said that Mir was also had serious offences registered against him including kidnap, murder, cheating and also under Arms Act. The case that was pending for five months was finally assigned to Basiya who, along with his team, reached the criminal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/police-recover-bizmans-vehicles/articleshow/88305882.cms||---

Cops pressed charges on the institute for attempting to convert girls staying there and hurting religious sentiments. “We have begun questioning the employees who work at the institute about the work they do and the curriculum they teach. Dozens of children stay in the institute and we have been talking with them too. The children are being asked about their academics and the prayers they do,” said a police official. He added that they will also go through the institute’s documents and its activities. The police are also trying to locate the 28-year-old woman who was allegedly converted at the institute. “It is alleged that the woman was married as per Christian rituals and was converted without the mandatory permission of the district collector. She has probably left the city out of fear. We will track her down to take her statement,” the official added. Cops said that the investigations are being done by an ACP-level officer under the direct supervision of city police commissioner Shamsher Singh. The institute was booked three days ago under Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act 2003 and hurting religious sentiments. The move came after the chairman of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) chairman visited the children’s home in August this year. He found some anomalies at the institute and wrote a letter to the district collector asking to file a complaint against the institute. So, a committee was formed to investigate the case and it gave a report to the collector. The social security officer then filed a complaint. According to the FIR, many copies of the Bible were found in the library of the institute. The NCPCR chairman has said that his investigations led him to believe that the institute was resorting to conversion of some young girls who were being given Bible copies and asked to wear the cross.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-quiz-staff-inmates-at-childrens-home-for-girls/articleshow/88306284.cms||---
---||Madurai||Women cops most vulnerable to workplace harassment: HC||Madurai: Observing that women police personnel are among the most vulnerable to workplace harassment, the Madras high court has dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of a suspended male inspector of police from Dindigul district in a case registered against him for harassing a woman police constable by sending inappropriate messages to her.Justice K Murali Shankar observed that a safe workplace is a woman’s legal right. Sexual harassment constitutes a gross violation of women’s right to equality and dignity. Since the increase in sexual harassment at workplace is construed as a violation of women’s right and a form of violence against women, Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act was enacted, to ensure safe working places for women.The judge observed that no doubt, cases of sexual harassment at workplace have become rampant in India. Recently, this court was constrained to take suo motu action against one of the top police officers of the state for allegedly causing sexual harassment to an IPS police officer.In the case on hand, the woman in the lower cadre of police hierarchy has preferred a complaint against the superior officer of that particular police station, where she is working. The judge observed that it is very unfortunate that we are still carrying the legacy where women are treated as secondary to men. Sexual harassment has an adverse effect on the organization or the working place as the working enthusiasm of the sexually harassed female employee goes down. She would not be able to work in the same way as she was before being harassed.The judge said that sending inappropriate messages to a subordinate staff would definitely constitute sexual harassment in the workplace. The copies of screenshots of the messages allegedly sent by the petitioner to the victim through WhatsApp were considered by the Vishaka committee in the complaint preferred by the victim, after which the case was registered against the petitioner.Taking into account that prosecution has established that a prima facie case has been made out against the petitioner, the judge observed that such misconduct on the part of the superior police officer cannot be viewed lightly.Considering the seriousness and gravity of the alleged offence and the facts that the forensic report is yet to be received and that the investigation is pending, the judge said that this court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner at this point of time and hence dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/women-cops-most-vulnerable-to-workplace-harassment-hc/articleshow/88306512.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Hyderabad||Row over ombudsman: SC to reconstitute panel for HCA||New Delhi: The Supreme Court said on Wednesday that it would reconstitute the committee to oversee the functioning of the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) and sought names of former players, judges for this purposes, saying the team will win if the panel “focuses on players” and does not indulge in politics. HCA president and former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin and the secretary of the cricket body, R Vijayanand, and the factions led by them are opposed to each other over the appointment of former apex court judge Justice Deepak Verma as the ombudsman. “If the committee focuses on players, it (team) will win and if you engage in politics then it will not. Now, the court has started interfering so you are focussing on the game” said the bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana. “Give names of some people who are familiar with the game. Alright you give names of players and others who have nothing to do with politics... we will appoint the committee,” the bench, also comprising justices A S Bopanna and Hima Kohli, said. Senior advocate Rakesh Khanna, appearing for one of the parties, said that the staffers of the HCA are not getting salary as the secretary has not been signing the cheques as asked by the top court in its last order on October 27. “That is why, we asked you to give the names,” the bench said. Top court, on October 27, asked HCA president Azharuddin and secretary to “jointly” sign cheques to ensure day-to-day functioning of HCA is not hampered. It had also issued notices on appeals filed by the Hyderabad Cricket Association and its member ‘Budding Star Cricket Club' against an order of the Telangana HC. The top court had passed a consent order to ensure smooth functioning of the HCA and had said, “Till these matters are finally heard by this Court, and with the consent of the parties, we deem it appropriate to direct both the president and secretary of Hyderabad Cricket Association to jointly sign the cheques so that the day-to-day functioning of the Association is not hampered for the time being.” Prior to this, the top court had expressed strong displeasure over functioning of faction-ridden HCA and the row over ombudsman and had said that it will order an inquiry by a former apex court or high court judge. “Cricket has gone somewhere else and politics has taken precedence,” the bench had said, adding “We will appoint some good people, some retired judges of the Supreme Court or the HC to conduct an inquiry. Let both groups (of HCA) go...They will have to go out of the management. This needs a CBI inquiry. They want to drag even the judiciary.” It asked ombudsman Justice Verma not to pass any order since his tenure has already come to an end.

On Monday, the AMC carried out demolition of three properties and the sealing of nine buildings that did not have BU permission. . Following the high court’s order, the AMC began a sealing drive in May and sealed 2,516 buildings,which were mainly commercial complexes, that did not have valid BU permission. Thirty apartments in Classic Lakeview were sealed on Wednesday as the tower did not have BU permission. On November 29, the high court said the authorities should demolish a couple of buildings to set an example, as it is better to put people out of their houses rather than watch them be charred to death. The judges said prevention is better than cure and the court does not want to cause inconvenience to residents, but “any tears shed subsequent to untoward incident occurring would be of no avail as much as precious life cannot be brought back”. Apart from the apartment building in Kankaria, the AMC also sealed 34 flats in Shahpur and Dhalgarwad and demolished two illegal properties in Fatewadi. Citing a series of fires that took place since October last year, the Gujarat high court had ordered the state and civic authorities to take immediate and strict action against high-rises which lack either valid building-use permission or proper fire safety equipment. “The next HC hearing is on December 23 and there are still buildings in Ahmedabad that have not applied for BU permission or to be regularized. Unless the true number of such buildings is not placed before the court, the government cannot suggest a policy to address this issue,” said a senior AMC town planning official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-begins-sealing-residential-buildings/articleshow/88306539.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court rejects ex-intel chief Rashmi Shukla’s plea to quash FIR over leak of report||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday rejected a petition filed by the state’s ex-intel chief Rashmi Shukla for quashing of an FIR registered by Mumbai cyber cell against unknown persons over “leak” of her confidential phone tap report into allegations of corruption in police transfers. It also rejected her plea to transfer probe to CBI but directed she should be given 7 days’ prior notice before taking any coercive steps against her. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal said, “FIR prima facie discloses cognisable offences” and hence police is duty-bound to investigate. The HC said Shukla made out no grounds to quash the FIR or prevent further investigation. The HC also said that from contents of FIR, it is clear what was shown and referred to by leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis “is confidential and top-secret information. These documents attract provisions of Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act” and hence at this stage it cannot be said that the Act is not attracted. But the HC said it is not shown whether LOP can be termed an authority within the meaning of Section 5 of the Act (which deals with ‘wrongful communication’ of secret information). “The prayer for transfer of investigation to CBI on the ground that CBI is investigating postings of police officers is without merit as both investigations are different. Even if contents of the petitioner’s report are found correct, the alleged illegal leakage of official documents will nevertheless constitute an offence, and this will not depend on the result of the investigation conducted by the CBI,” said the HC. The HC said, “Giving a free charter to leak confidential material at will is not envisaged under Section 8(2) of the RTI Act.” The section says a public authority may allow access to information if public interest in disclosure outweighs the harm to the protected interests. Shukla was unceremoniously transferred in September to CRPF, said senior counsel Mahesh Jethmalani with advocate Gunjan Mangala, and the FIR was registered a day after the March 25, 2021 report by former state additional chief secretary (home) Sitaram Kunte, who he said had termed the report “innocuous”. He added, “But the state’s reaction is out of proportion to its innocuousness.” “We find no merit in this submission.... FIR and the present investigation is not about contents of the report but upon the action of releasing an official document unauthorizedly,” HC said. Shukla’s case was there can be no offence when issue is of public interest. But Khambata had said “assumption of petitioner that handing over letter and pen drive would be in the public interest is a fallacy. It is contended that the petitioner's communication and the report involving transcript of information, at the stage at which report was leaked, would alert those involved and will cause a stigma on all transfers.” The HC said, “The FIR was lodged on 25 March 2021. As of today, the petitioner (Shukla) is not named in the FIR. We are informed that the petitioner is currently serving in the State of Telangana and…is holding an important post...We are of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to the protection of advance notice of seven working days in case the respondent state intends to take any coercive steps against the petitioner.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-rejects-ex-intel-chiefs-plea-to-quash-fir-over-leak-of-report/articleshow/88307881.cms||Swati Deshpande

Going down the memory lane while commemorating the 50 years of the war, the retired colonel said a bombing, aimed at creating local fires, was launched over the hilly terrain of the Balurghat area near India-Bangladesh border. “During the 1971 war, the Indian troops were facing repeated setbacks in the Balurghat area, which was sort of hilly. The intelligence reports later revealed that the enemy troops had laid down used rail tracks to protect their bunkers. As a part of the war strategy, incendiary bombing was carried out to heat the railings and in turn, increase the temperature inside the bunkers so that enemy soldiers would be forced to come out of their hides,” said the 83-year-old. Waghmare, who fought the 1971 war as the battery commander of the artillery unit of the Indian Army, said, the option of incendiary bombing served the purpose and the Indian troops could march ahead. “While the war broke out on December 4, we made advances up to Dhaka till December 14, when the enemy troops announced the surrender. I was witness to the surrender of around 30 officers from the 16 Pak Division. The enemy troops dropped their weapons, wrist belts and caps and were accorded with the prisoners of war status,” he said. Waghmare also recalled an incident when two top officials from India and Pakistan realized that they were childhood friends. “While the top-ranking officials from both sides were shaking hands with each other after the surrender ceremony, two of them kept staring at each other. Basic questioning revealed that both were childhood friends and studied at the same school in Lahore before the partition,” he said. Stating that different inspiring memories of the 1971 war are still fresh in his heart, Waghmare said it was heartening to see that the centre has planned ‘Swarnim Vijay Varsh’ celebrations to commemorate 50 years of India’s victory in the 1971 war.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/army-veteran-recalls-incendiary-bombing-during-the-1971-war/articleshow/88304923.cms||Prasad Joshi

The construction of the controversial bungalow permitted close to the heritage site was stopped after protests by citizens, and subsequently technical clearance granted to the project was revoked by the government. However, authorities are yet to demolish the illegal structure. Suresh Palkar, who was part of the Gakuved representation that met the protesters, said that the illegal structures must be demolished. Rupesh Velip, general secretary, Gakuved said they will garner support from every village where it has its presence to demand demolition of the structure. “It is not politicians alone, but various departmental authorities that gave permissions to the project are also equally responsible. Since the town and country planning has revoked technical clearance to the project, it is now the duty of the Old Goa panchayat to issue demolition orders at the earliest,” said Velip.

Currently, six buses under ‘Matri Bus Sewa' operate between Mahendra Nagar (in Nepal) and Delhi. Himanshu Kafaltiya, SDM Tanakpur, told TOI, “On Tuesday (December 14), 18 passengers coming from Nepal tested Covid-19 positive. They were sent back from the border check post. However, the other five ‘Maitri Bus’ services were allowed to leave for Delhi.” Earlier in the day, 11 other people entering India from Nepal through the Banbasa check post were also found infected with the virus. This prompted district authorities to test all those coming from Nepal rather than opting for the usual random sampling. Dr Danish Kausar, a medical practitioner deployed at the Banbasa check post, told TOI, “On an average, about 5,000 people use Banbasa check post to cross the border every day. So, it is not very feasible for us to test every person entering India. However, we have now intensified the testing. Nearly 400 RT-PCR and 100 rapid antigen tests are being conducted every day now.” When asked about the infected passengers, Dr Danish said, “A majority of them have received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine and are asymptomatic.” Notably, Banbasa is the only immigration point in Uttarakhand and movement at the border started last month after a gap of 18 months. The border between India and Nepal was closed in March 2020 after the outbreak of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/india-nepal-bus-sent-back-from-banbasa-after-18-passengers-test-covid-ve/articleshow/88305703.cms||---

It deliberately did not create a mechanism to collect actual death figures and ensure that all beneficiaries get compensation. The government fears the information will expose its intention and its failure to handle the Covid crisis,” Congress state chief Jagdish Thakor said. “The state government is shying away from collecting the actual Covid death figures because this will expose the ‘Gujarat model’,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-fudged-death-figures-jagdish-thakor/articleshow/88306543.cms||---

The party always wanted Muslims to remain uneducated to get their votes. But our party has worked for their development,” said the minister, adding that the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation provides loans to the needy people irrespective of their caste, creed or colour. He accused the SP of being busy doing communal politics and blaming the BJP. The minister thanked Mulayam for taking the Covid-19 vaccine and proving that his son, who had been “spreading rumours about the vaccine”, was wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/akhilesh-became-cm-because-of-his-father-not-due-to-his-arduous-work-up-minister/articleshow/88304207.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the MP has alleged that farmers from his constituency have received only Rs 407 crore towards the agricultural damage under the crop insurance scheme against the expected amount of Rs 807 crore. He said that farmers were entitled to get compensation in the range of Rs 27,000 to Rs 33,000 per hectare agricultural damage, but only received returns in the range of Rs 13,000 to Rs 17,000. “The insurance firms have been referring to notification issued by the centre on August 17 last year while justifying their decision. It is a clear case of deceiving poor farmers as the firms are misinterpreting the notification in their own interest,” he told TOI. The concerned notification reads, “The losses due to occurrence of localised perils within 15-days of normal harvest will be assessed based on combination of sample survey and crop-cutting experiments with 50-50 weightage.” Nimbalkar said the insurance firms are twisting the provision of ‘crop-cutting experiments’ to serve their own interest. “The data of pre-harvest and post-harvest ‘crop-cutting experiments’ is conveniently manipulated by insurance firms to exploit farmers. These firms should release remaining Rs 400 crore to the farmers at the earliest, failing which we would take legal action,” he said. Several parts of Marathwada, including Osmanabad, reported heavy agricultural losses due to rain fury during the recent monsoon season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/insurance-firms-paying-less-to-rain-hit-farmers-nimbalkar/articleshow/88304966.cms||Prasad Joshi

Six years ago, a similar incident had occurred in the US, when a ramp worker involuntarily ended up flying from Seattle to Los Angeles in the cargo compartment of an Alaska Airlines aircraft. For the Mumbai airport too, a human travelling in a cargo compartment wasn’t a first. In mid-1960s, Australian former athlete Reg Spiers “posted” himself and flew in a cargo box from England to Australia inside an Air India aircraft as he didn’t have money to buy an air ticket. Read AlsoIndiGo loader fell asleep in cargo hold of plane, found safe on arrival in Abu DhabiAn IndiGo loader fell asleep in the cargo hold of an aircraft at Mumbai airport on December 12 that was being prepared for a flight to Abu Dhabi. The aircraft took off with the loader in the pressurised cargo hold and the person was found safe on arrival in the UAE.“The A320 aircraft cargo hold is pressurised and temperature-controlled. Had the cargo hold not been unpressurised, the temperature inside would have touched minus 45-50 degree Celsius during cruise,” said a senior pilot. IndiGo flight 6E-1835 had departed around 3am, and the loader is said to have fallen asleep in baggage compartment one. But the most bizarre journey in cargo hold was the one voluntarily undertaken by Spiers. The cash-strapped athlete had taken up a job in the airport export cargo section where he saw livestock being transported in the cargo hold and the use of shipping fee payment-on-delivery system. He had a cargo box built to airline specifications which allowed him to lay on his back with knees bent. He packed tinned food, a torch, a blanket and a bottle of water and another one to pee, according to a BBC report. He endured a 24-hour delay in London due to fog, but let himself out after the aircraft took-off. After Paris, the next stop was ‘Bombay’ where the baggage handlers put the box upside down and left it in the sun for four hours. He sweated through it, but stayed put. Eventually he was put into another aircraft bound for Perth. His journey made headlines. But the sweet ending was by Air India. The airline did not charge him the shipping fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/loader-who-fell-asleep-in-mumbai-abu-dhabi-flight-cargo-not-first-to-fly-with-bags/articleshow/88307903.cms||Manju V

A police officer said the slain terrorist was identified as Feroz Ahmad Dar. Feroz was a Hizb district commander who had joined the outfit in 2017 and was the lone surviving terrorist in Shopian's Zainapora hamlet, known as a hotbed of militancy. Late Tuesday night an official had said a joint team comprising personnel from the police and the Army had launched a cordon-and-search operation on specific information about the presence of militants in the area. He said the security forces were fired upon as they approached the site where they suspected the terrorists were hiding, setting off an encounter. A police spokesman said the police and security forces neutralised an "A+" category Hizb terrorist involved in several crimes, including a 2018 attack at Zainapora, Shopian, in which four police personnel were killed. "...he was given repeated opportunities to surrender; however, he fired indiscriminately," he said. "Incriminating materials, arms and ammunition, including one AK rifle and three magazines, were recovered," the spokesman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/top-hizb-commander-killed-in-overnight-pulwama-encounter/articleshow/88308173.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The area residents say that the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) has not cleared the waste pile at the transformer shed near Devki Complex in months. “Two years back, a fire broke out in the area. Ever since, the shed is being used as a garbage dumping site by several locals. Despite multiple complaints, no action has been taken to either clear the site or prevent people from dumping trash,” said Sanjeev, a resident of the area. Locals point out that the dump has become a health hazard as the area is a marketplace and frequented by several people every day. The market has several furniture and wholesale chemist shops. Another area resident, who did not want to be identified, said most of the garbage is dumped by furniture shop owners. “This is a congested area and is frequented by hundreds of people every day. Besides, a transformer shed is no place for dumping garbage and yet everything from plastic waste to scrapes can be found at the spot. If the waste pile catches fire someday, it could cause huge damage. The carelessness on part of both residents and authorities is putting all of our lives at risk,” the resident said. An employee at one of the furniture stores in the market, requesting anonymity, said that when they are short on time, the owner sometimes asks them to drop the waste at the spot. “Everyone’s doing it as the dumpster is a little far,” the store employee said. Meanwhile, DMC officials said they are not aware of the issue. “We will look into the problem and take prompt action,” said Kailash Joshi, chief health officer, DMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/transformer-shed-turns-into-waste-dump-creates-hazard/articleshow/88305731.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Weather analysts say this may lead to clouding and increase the minimum temperature but may decrease the daytime mercury on Friday. According to the India Meteorological Department, Delhi on Wednesday recorded a maximum and minimum temperature of 22.5 and 7.8 degrees Celsius — both one degree Celsius below the season’s average — against 22.4 and 7.5 degrees Celsius, respectively. The maximum and minimum temperature on Thursday is expected to hover around 22 and 7 degrees Celsius. “There are chances of very light rainfall or drizzling on Thursday evening. This will also lead to cloudiness due to a feeble western disturbance in the region. The wind speed will increase from December 17. Colder winds are expected between 17 and 21, which may bring the minimum temperatures to around 5 or 6 degrees Celsius. The region will see mostly shallow fog towards the morning hours,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientists (IMD). Jenamani added that another western disturbance between 21 and 22 may decide how the weather around Christmas would be. “There is a cyclonic circulation over Haryana, which may pass over the northern part of the capital and lead to some light rainfall in Delhi-NCR over Thursday night or evening,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-likely-to-dip-to-5c-by-weekend/articleshow/88307144.cms||---

A bench of justices N Kotiswar Singh and Malasri Nandi issued the direction while recently hearing the petition filed by Saidur Rahman and others. The court also observed that the petitioners have been "languishing in jail" for the last seven years since the authorities concerned have not been able to arrive at a decision in this regard. The court stated: "The plea of the petitioners is that either they be allowed to remain in India by granting refugee status or be deported to their country of origin, i.e. Myanmar. However, the authorities are not taking any decision in this regard and the petitioners are languishing in jail." The petitioners had been convicted for entering India without proper documentation and had subsequently served their sentences. They had approached the HC in 2017, seeking either refugee status or deportation to Myanmar. The court has listed the matter for further hearing on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/decide-fate-of-10-rohingya-hc-tells-assam-govt/articleshow/88308175.cms||Mukut Das

In 2019-20, Dehradun (62) topped the list, while US Nagar (56) stood second. The total cases reported in 2020-21 were 103, indicating a significant drop from the previous two years when 140 (2019-20) and 160 (2018-19) cases were registered in the tribal commission. The report further reveals that from 2016-17 to 2020-21, a total of 509 cases were reported to the commission. Of these, 250 cases are pending. District-wise from 2016-17 to 2020-21, a total of 212 cases were reported from US Nagar, followed by Dehradun (150), Pithoragarh (69), Haridwar (21) and Pauri (17). Incidentally, not a single case was registered from Rudraprayag from 2016-17 to 2020-21, while Bageshwar and Almora registered one each, and Tehri, Uttarkashi and Champawat registered two each. In 2020-21, 5 districts -- Rudraprayag, Almora, Champawat, Bageshwar and Pauri -- registered nil cases against the tribal community. Murat Ram Sharma, chairman, Uttarakhand ST Commission, told TOI that maximum number of complaints received by them were related to land. “There is an issue of tribal land being bought by non-tribals at throwaway prices. This is a wrong practice. Neither the tribals nor the non-tribals are allowed to buy land designated for the ST community. The problem is common in US Nagar. Though there is a vast expanse of land in Jaunsar Bawar region of Dehradun, such cases are not reported from there as the area has a huge population of Scheduled Tribes unlike Udham Singh Nagar. Complaints coming to us are mostly related to compensation. Tribals rue non-payment of dues by government for building highways on their land. Then there are those who are unable to repay loans and complain of banks auctioning their land.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/us-nagar-tops-list-for-most-tribal-related-complaints-reveals-commission-report/articleshow/88305751.cms||Mohammad Anab

Presently, milling copra is priced at Rs 103.35 per kg and ball copra at Rs 106 per kg, compared to Rs 99.60 and Rs 103, respectively, last year. The MP has requested the Centre to increase the MSP for milling copra to Rs 160 per kg and ball copra to Rs 180 per kg. Speaking in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Shanmuga Sundaram said the country was leading the world in copra production. “Coconut growing is the main occupation of agriculturists in Pollachi parliamentary constituency. Tamil Nadu produces approximately 5,365 million coconuts in a year from 4,50,00 hectares.” According to him, Tirupur district alone accounts for production of 1.63 lakh metric tonne milling copra and 15,00,000 litres coconut oil. There are 250 oil mills in Tirupur, where coconut is cultivated on 65,000 hectares. On the other hand, Coimbatore cultivates coconut on 87,000 hectares and produces 90,000 metric tonne milling copra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mp-increase-msp-for-milling-ball-copra/articleshow/88306557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A cancer centre affiliated to Vijayawada GGH was established a decade ago at Chinakakani in Guntur district. The centre is receiving poor response from the patients as it is far away from the city and reels from poor infrastructure.  Dr.Y Kiran Kumar, superintendent of GGH, said: “Cancer treatment is very costly. Many patients are facing difficulty in affording the treatment costs. We have decided to take up the responsibility of providing quality cancer treatment for the poor.

---||Aurangabad||SC showcause notice to Ahmednagar collector||AHMEDNAGAR: The Supreme Court has directed a showcause notice to Ahmednagar district collector Rajendra Bhosale for initiating on November 22 the election process to fill the OBC seat for the chairperson of Shrirampur panchayat in contravention of an SC ruling of March 4 this year. Through the ruling, the Apex court had held that the OBC quota should not exceed an aggregate 50% of seats reserved for SCs/STs/OBCs. “This is clearly in the teeth of the said pronouncement,” the SC bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice C T Ravikumar said on December 13. The notice to Bhosale is returnable by January 5 when the matter is likely to be taken up for next hearing. “I have not yet received the SC order copy. I will be able to comment only after receiving and going through the court order,” Bhosale told TOI on Wednesday. The bench was hearing a petition by Deepak Pathare, a member of the Shrirampur panchayat samiti, who has contended that reserving five out of total 14 panchayat samiti chairperson posts in Ahmednagar district for OBC candidates was in excess of the 27% OBC quota norm. Initially, only four panchayat samitis were to have an OBC chairperson, but through a lottery system the Jamkhed panchayat samiti chairperson post (initially reserved for an ST candidate) was allotted to an OBC candidate as no ST candidate could be found to fill that post. The process to elect a new chairperson of the Shrirampur panchayat samiti arose after the Congress’s incumbent chairperson Sangita Shinde was disqualified as she switched over to the BJP. Pathare then took an exception to the fresh election, claiming the same was in excess of the 27% OBC norm and even approached the Bombay high court at Aurangabad for relief. “The HC on December 4 did accept that the fresh appointment of an OBC candidate as chairperson would exceed the quota cap, but dismissed the petition only on the ground that the remaining term for chairperson is a very short period. The term is set to end by February 2022,” Pathare’s lawyer Siddheshwar Thombre told TOI. “Hence, we moved the SC for relief,” he added. The Apex court observed, “Despite the unambiguous and peremptory decision of the three-judge bench of this court in Vikas Kishanrao Gawali vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors. decided on 4.3.2021, .............. , following the dictum of the Constitution Bench of this Court, the Collector, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, after passing an order of disqualification, initiated the election process on November 22, 2021 to fill in the vacancy for OBC seat for the post of Chairperson of the Shrirampur Panchayat Samiti. This is clearly in the teeth of the said pronouncement.” The SC also said, “In the meantime, the incumbent chairperson, elected as OBC candidate, shall not participate in taking any policy decision in connection with the panchayat samiti.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sc-showcause-notice-to-ahmednagar-collector/articleshow/88304979.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The cabinet cleared the proposal to elevate the 1997 batch and 2008 batch of IPS officers to the rank of ADGPs and DIGs, respectively. There are three officers in the 1997 batch, including IG and commissioner (Thiruvananthapuram) Balram Kumar Upadhyay, Mahipal Yadav who is presently on central deputation and G Lakshman, who is presently under suspension. Since Lakshman is under suspension, he has not been considered for the promotion, it is learnt. The 2008 batch of officers include R Nishanthini, Rahul R Nair, Satheesh Bino, Ajeetha Begum and Putta Vimaladitya. However, out of five officers in the 2008 batch only two officers — SP (Pathanamthitta) R Nishanthini and SP (crimes, Kozhikode) Rahul R Nair are serving in the state. The 2004-batch officers are also due for their promotions as IGs from January 1 next year. This would mean that there would be a major reshuffle in the police force at various ranks. It is reliably learnt that the city police commissioners of Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode, additional city police commissioner Kochi, DIG (Kannur range), district police chiefs in Pathanamthitta, Thiruvnanthapuram rural, Thrissur rural, SP (railways), SP (special operations group) Kerala Anti-Terrorist Squad are among those who will be replaced with new faces. In addition, the KAP-4 battalion in Kannur and Malabar Special Police in Malappuram which are part of the armed police battalion do not have full-time heads and the SP (Kannur rural) and SP (Malappuram) are holding the charges of these battalions, respectively. These units are also likely to get new heads. It is learnt that the commissioners of Thrissur and Kollam are also likely to be shifted. Sources said that an assessment of the dealings by various district police chiefs in their respective jurisdictions about the way they have handled law and order issues are being evaluated, and it will be factored in for the reshuffle. Many of the district police chiefs have already completed more than a year in the districts. As many as eight officers from the state service have been conferred with IPS recently and who are presently posted in various special units. Sources added that some of them are likely to be appointed as district police chiefs in the upcoming shuffle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/major-reshuffle-of-ips-officers-likely-in-state-by-month-end/articleshow/88306574.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Coimbatore||Drop plans to hike GST on garment products, Tirupur assn tells Centre||Coimbatore: Tirupur Exporters and Manufacturers Association (Teama) has urged the Union government to drop the plans to hike Goods and Services Tax (GST) on garment products. While attending a GST meeting headed by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in New Delhi on Tuesday evening, Teama president M P Muthurathinam said the Centre’s move to increase the GST to 12% from 5% on textile apparels from January would have adverse impact on the industry, which is already reeling under input price rise. Stating that Tirupur was home to more than 12,500 knitwear, garment and allied units, which employ more than 10 lakh people, he said the pandemic and the lockdown had affected them, especially the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. He said the units in Tirupur accounted for exports to the tune of $4 billion . In the domestic market, he said, they do business worth about $2.80 billion. “The cost of raw materials for apparel manufacturing have increased over the past year. The price of raw cotton alone has shot up by Rs 130 per kg, compared to last year. Labour and container shortage add to their woes.” He said the textile units were facing extreme competition from countries such as China, Bangladesh and Vietnam in the export business front. “Amid these challenges, the entire textile industry is dependent on the domestic market for sustaining the business. If the GST were to be increased to 12%, it will add to the burden of the textile units, many of which may be forced to shut down.” While Sitharaman has promised to look into the issue, Teama members are planning to meet the state finance minister, P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan, and chief minister M K Stalin to put forth a request in this regard at the GST council meeting. They also sought ban or regulation on the export of raw cotton and yarn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/drop-plans-to-hike-gst-on-garment-products-tirupur-assn-tells-centre/articleshow/88306560.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Change in Covid portal and birth proof identity would be mandatory for getting a jab. The officials said birth certificate will be replacing the mobile number for getting the jab. The change is being made nationwide at the portal because many people are giving wrong mobile numbers during registration. Birth certificates will also make it possible to slot those vaccinated under different age groups easily. Dr Meenu Sassan, district immunisation officer said, “Till now, we have covered 106.4% vaccination of the first dose and 80.65% of the second dose. The residents of Panchkula are requested to come for their second doses to the nearby health centre.” The administration is also carrying out late evening sessions to make sure all people get the jab. “Our motive is to cover the remaining persons as soon as possible,” DIO Sassan said. The health department has also traced 1,066 out of the total 1,077 who have arrived in Panchkula from foreign countries in the last 20 days. Special teams are working to trace and test the foreign returnees, said the chief medical officer. The health department is also sending 5% of the total Covid-19 sampling to the Delhi for checking for Omicron variant. So far, no Omicron case from Panchkula has been detected. Meanwhile, the police commissioner has also given strict instructions to all the police officials to issue challan against people found not wearing mask and not maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-organises-vaccination-camps-late-into-evenings-to-cover-more-people/articleshow/88307587.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Two of the new cases are from Osmanabad and one each from Mumbai and Buldhana. The silver lining is that 25 of the 32 have been discharged after they tested negative on RTPCR tests. Vyas made the troubling forecast during a discussion about the developing Omicron situation in the state and other countries. The cabinet raised concerns that the cases were not limited to big cities but were spreading to smaller districts. Of the 32 cases in Maharashtra, 13 have been reported from Mumbai, 10 from Pimpri Chinchwad, two each from Pune and Osmanabad, and one each from Kalyan Dombivli, Nagpur, Latur, Vasai Virar and Buldhana. All the state cases so far are liked to a foreign travel history. Mumbai and Pimpri Chindwad are the only two to have reported big clusters, the former from a workplace and the latter in a family. Health minister Rajesh Tope reiterated that there could be large-scale transmission of the Omicron variant by January-February. “This is a projection made by the state task force. We have to stop the spread of the variant and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour during the Christmas and year-end festivities,” said Tope. Districts have been asked to ensure that the festivities are toned down and crowding is avoided at all cost. “No major events are likely to be allowed. Final guidelines will be issued soon,” said an official. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directed the health department to ensure full vaccination is completed as early as possible. The state has administered double shots to a little over 51% of its population. State health officials said all the four cases found positive with the variant on Wednesday are asymptomatic. They are in the age group of 16 to 67 years and all of them are currently hospitalised. According to preliminary information, one of the patients from Osmanabad travelled to Sharjah and the other patient is his high risk contact. The patient from Mumbai had travelled to Ireland and the individual from Buldhana had travelled to Dubai. Of the four, three were vaccinated. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC executive health officer, said they have formed a rapid action team comprising epidemiologists, microbiologist and doctors to study the cluster of seven cases detected from one workplace on Tuesday. “We will be doing a thorough field investigation to understand how the infection spread in the workplace,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-four-more-omicron-cases-in-state-fears-of-a-spate-by-jan/articleshow/88309214.cms||Bhavika Jain

Thangappan, a retired school teacher from Pudur in Kanniyakumari district, did his PhD on Gandhian philosophy. Addressing the research scholars, the governor asked them to link ancient India’s knowledge in the fields of science, such as medicine, with the modern technology to come out with path-breaking solutions for health issues faced today. The chancellor said that even 3,000 years ago, Indians, through experience, understood scientific ideas to find remedies in the field of medicine .Ravi expressed concern that modern science diverted the attention towards a different direction away from ancient India’s knowledge.

While about 90 tonnes of segregated waste were collected in a day on an average 10 days ago, it has gradually increased and touched 175 tonnes per day as on Tuesday. The civic body is collecting 850 tonnes of garbage on an average in a day. Segregation at source helps the corporation in disposing waste easily. The segregated waste can be directly fed into shredder to cut it into pieces and use it for production of manure. Segregated waste is also used to produce vermicompost in a facility available in the Vellalore dumping yard, the commissioner told TOI. Each of the 100 wards was given a target of collecting two tonnes of segregated waste a day. With a push from sanitary inspectors of respective wards, the collection of segregated waste has increased in the past few days, the officer said. “While some of the residents handed over degradable and non-degradable waste separately, in some areas, sanitary workers dumped them together during the door-to-door collection defeating the very purpose. It has been set right now by giving clear instruction,” he said. Segregated waste collection at source level was an important aspect in Swachh Survekshan, an annual survey of cleanliness, hygiene and sanitation conducted by the Centre across the country. A sanitary inspector from east zone said there was some reluctance among residents earlier when they were told to segregate waste. “But there is a visible change in the past few days in some of the areas. When people realized that the corporation meant business, they tend to follow the instruction. Non-degradable waste is collected once or twice a day, while degradable waste is being collected regularly,” he said. But still a lot has to be done to make the practice a norm, health officials said. “Sanitary workers, sometimes, face the ire of residents. There are instances when workers were castigated by residents for conveying the corporation’s new rule,” a sanitary inspector from south zone said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/segregation-of-waste-at-source-doubles-in-10-days/articleshow/88306591.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government requested the Centre to advise Karnataka not to go ahead with the project work. The state government said upper Bhadra project is being taken up without any assured allocation. The CWC recently cleared the decks for granting national project status to upper Bhadra project designed to utilise about 36 tmc ft of water. In a letter to the Union jal shakti ministry secretary, special chief secretary (water resources) KS Jawahar Reddy said the upper Bhadra project (UBP) would adversely affect projects of Andhra Pradesh on Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers as there is no surplus water available in them. According to the clearances issued by the CWC, UBP was planned to lift 17.40 tmc ft of water from foreshore of upper Tunga reservoir to Bhadra reservoir and lifting of 29.90 tmc ft of water from Bhadra reservoir. The advisory committee of jal shakti ministry accepted the techno-economic viability of UBP without taking the views of the stakeholders of Krishna and Tunga rivers. The Centre has also granted the investment clearance amounting to 16,125.48 crore. The Centre in its clearance stated that UPB fits the bill for national project as per the guidelines for implementation of the national projects saying that the project has been planned to irrigate an extent of 2.25 lakh hectares and there is no dispute as such regarding sharing of water. Jawahar Reddy pointed out that Karnataka projected a demand of 36 tmc ft for UBP before the KWDT-I to irrigate 4.1 lakh acres in Chitradurga and Bellary districts, which was deferred by KWDT-I because of uncertainty of water availability. He said neither KWDT-I nor KWDT-II has granted clearance to the revised master plan of UBP submitted by Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-contests-cwc-clearance-for-karnatakas-ubp-project/articleshow/88306588.cms||Samdani MN

The currency, mostly UAE dirham and a few Saudi riyal, were seized from an Andhra Pradesh-native woman who was scheduled to fly to Sharjah on Tuesday. The currency was found hidden in her private parts and was found during the security check by CISF women personnel. The accused was identified as Hafeeza Banu (46), a native of Hyderabad. According to sources, the woman was frisked after some of the CISF personnel noticed her suspicious behaviour when she reached the security checkpoint. She was handed over to the customs officials, who later released her on bail after detailed interrogation and confiscating the money. The accused reached Kochi from Hyderabad by air earlier on Tuesday. After landing at the domestic terminal she had undergone Covid test as negative RT-PCR certificate is mandatory for passengers travelling to the United Arab Emirates. She waited at the testing area till she was tested negative and later moved to the international terminal for the boarding process. She was scheduled to fly in a Go First flight (G8 1551) at 1:35pm. However, the woman constable of the CISF deployed at the checkpoint found her actions and behaviour suspicious. “The woman was nervous when she came to the checkpoint. CISF personnel are trained to identify abnormal behaviour of passengers. So the constable did a thorough frisking of the woman during the security check and found a bundle hidden in her private parts. On detailed inspection, the currency was found. The details of the woman were collected and she was immediately handed over to the customs,” said sources. The seized currency included 49 UAE dirham of the 1,000 denomination, 102 UAE dirham of the 500 denomination and 10 Saudi riyal of 500 denomination. A total of 1,00,000 UAE dirham and 5,000 Saudi riyal was seized and it was worth Rs 21 lakh. Sources said that the accused was part of a currency smuggling bid and she was used as a carrier. She was travelling on visit visa to Sharjah. The customs officials have collected the details of the supplier of the currency during the interrogation. A case has been registered and further probe has been launched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cisf-seizes-foreign-currency-worth-rs-21l-at-kochi-airport/articleshow/88306593.cms||---

The coins seem to have been released in the wake of Rajaraja Chola’s first conquest of Sri Lanka. These were in use from the time of Rajaraja Chola I to the time of Kulothunga Chola I. The coins were issued in gold, silver and copper. The coins found now are made of copper and called ‘Eela Karunkasu’ (black coin). On one side of the coin stands a man holding a flower in his hand and on his left are four circles. Above them is the crescent and below is the flower. To the right is the trident and the lamp. On the other side sits a man holding a conch in his hand. Near his left hand is written in three lines as “Srirajaraja” in Devanagari script.Rajaguru said that similar coins have been found in many coastal towns in Ramanathapuram district including Periyapattinam, Thondi, Kalimankundu and Alagankulam. These were issued for circulation in Sri Lanka and circulated in the Pandya country under the rule of the Chola.Rajaguru said coins play a vital role in the study of history and culture. Kings have issued special coins to celebrate their war victory. He said that the students have been trained to identify ancient coins, pottery, reading and estampage the inscriptions. So, most of the members spend their time searching for antiques in their areas, during holidays and leisure time.

Malik pointed out that since Wankhede’s date of birth is December 14, 1979, the licence was approved in his name on October 29, 1997, when he was a minor. However, in his annual property returns, he has declared it as property inherited after his mother passed away on April 16, 2015. “It is clear from these facts that the declaration made by Wankhede regarding the mode of acquiring the property is clearly a false representation,” wrote Malik. The minister said Wankhede has only declared one property jointly owned with his wife, keeping out others. “Please take note of these facts, it is administrative misconduct and misrepresentation of facts in the property statement. Conduct a proper inquiry… ,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-wankhede-malik-asks-central-agencies/articleshow/88307922.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Teachers and other school staff are also to be screened for the infection, she said. Recently, some schools of Chandigarh have closed down, as some children have been found infected. Directions have been issued to conduct RT PCR tests of students as well as teachers and support staff and submit written report every week. DC said, “Mohali administration will conduct extensive sampling of the school teachers, supporting staff and children in the wake of suspected third wave of Covid-19. She said teams have been constituted under supervision of sub-divisional magistrates (SDM) supported by deputy superintendents of police (DSP) and other staff to take sampling in their respective jurisdictions. Sub-division schedule is put in place to cover the targeted locations like housing societies, service industries like L&T, government employees, school teachers, staff and children to increase the contact tracing coverage. Kalia said, “Orders have been issued to conduct extensive sampling among government school teachers, support staff and children. The teams under supervision of SDMs will also conduct the contact tracing of the positive cases found during the sampling.” On the other hand, civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur once again appealed to the district residents to take all necessary precautions to stay away from the deadly disease of Covid-19. She said the basic guidelines like wearing masks, maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing are not being followed by many people, which is a matter for grave concern. She said as there are warnings of a possible third wave of Covid-19 pandemic with the emergence of the Omicron variant in some parts of the world, including India, so it is important to follow basic guidelines. Dr Kaur also said all arrangements have already been made in the government health facilities of the district to tackle the third possible wave of Covid-19. While the Covid sampling is in full swing in various places, Covid vaccination is also going on at full steam. In addition, the number of beds in hospitals has been significantly increased and the cooperation of the public is needed, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dc-issue-directions-to-screen-school-students-for-covid-infection/articleshow/88307598.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Holding that the state government, prima facie, lacks jurisdiction to fix the price, Justice PV Kunhikrishnan asked the central government to file an affidavit within two months explaining how price can be regulated. The court issued the order after considering a petition filed by Kerala Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association. The order fixing the price was passed by the government exercising the powers under Kerala Essential Articles Control Act, 1986. The court said while the intention of the state government is genuine and laudable, it does not have the jurisdiction to do so with the enactment of Food Safety Act, 2006 and as ‘food stuff’ is specified as a commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. After holding that the state government, prima facie, lacks the power to issue an order fixing the price, the court noted that packaged drinking water is now sold at different prices at different places. “According to me, the State Government should come up with a proposal to regulate the same in consultation with the Union of India,” the order said. The court also directed the Union government to file an affidavit within two months on the manner in which price of packaged drinking water can be regulated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-stays-state-govt-order-fixing-bottled-water-price/articleshow/88306607.cms||---

The accused, Rajaguru of Subramaniyapuram, near Puliyangudi in Tenkasi district, is attached to the Kadayanallur police station. On Monday, he was on duty for the security arrangements at Thirumalapuram village near Sernthamaram. Later that day, he consumed alcohol at a Tasmac outlet on the Sernthamaram to Sankarankovil Road. With a beer bottle in hand, he threatened the locals and tried to hit them. A few of them recorded the incident on their mobile phones and circulated it on social media platforms. A complaint was lodged against Rajaguru with the Sernthamaram police for causing inconvenience to the public. The policeman was booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code, arrested and lodged in the Tenkasi sub-jail. He was also placed under suspension. Superintendent of police (SP) for Tenkasi district R Krishnaraj said that the department has taken up the incident seriously and that the policeman will face major disciplinary charges under rule 3b of the Tamil Nadu Police subordinate Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules after administrative inquiry.

It is to be noted that the railway was earlier planning to operate Pollachi-Thiruchendur express train from Wednesday and the same was cancelled on Tuesday without citing any reasons. Now, the railway has cancelled Palakkad-Pollachi passenger train, which it had introduced recently, and announced the Palakkad-Pollachi-Thiruchendur express train. The move has disappointed the rail users in the district who had sought extension of the train to Mettupalayam. Questioning the logic behind operating the train from Palakkad, from where there is another express train to Madurai during the same time, K Jayaraj, member, Salem Divisional Railway User's Consultative Committee, said the train should be operated from Mettupalayam via Coimbatore and Pollachi to Thiruchendur. He said the railway users’ associations were gearing up for a protest against the decision, ignoring the needs of the people in the district. S Shanmugasundaram, member of Madurai Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committee, said the railway should run connection trains to and from Coimbatore to Pollachi for the Palakad-Tiruchendur and Tiruchendur-Palakkad express trains. “After figuring out the occupancy rate from the areas, the railways can decide on whether to operate it from Palakad or Coimbatore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/palakkad-pollachi-thiruchendur-train-service-to-resume-today/articleshow/88306595.cms||---

PWD contractual staff who were also present on the occasion expressed their anger against the government for sidelining them. They said that they should be accommodated in the vacant posts before additional employees are recruited. The contract staff said that despite several meetings with the chief minister and his assurances, their plea has fallen on deaf ears. A delegation led by GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat and vice president Renuka Da Silva met the governor and briefed him about the alleged recruitment scam. “The governor has assured us that he will look into the jobs scam. We have informed him the names of officials who are involved in the manipulation of exams. Action should be initiated against them,” Kamat said.

---||Hyderabad||HC had faulted HCA secretary||New Delhi: The Hyderabad Cricket Association and its member ‘Budding Star Cricket Club' have filed appeals against the order of the Telangana High Court which upheld the appointment of the ombudsman by Azharuddin and others of the HCA. The high court, in its judgment of April 6, had set aside an order of a Hyderabad civil court to suspend the decision of the apex council of the HCA to appoint Justice Verma as Ombudsman-cum-Ethics Officer of the HCA. While upholding the appointment of Justice Verma, the high court had severely faulted the HCA secretary, R Vijayanand, for “playing fraud to abuse the process of the court”. HCA has been divided over appointment of Justice Verma as ombudsman and a case was filed in civil court by one ‘Budding Star Cricket Club', which is affiliated to HCA. It was contended resolution of HCA apex council, in appointing Justice Verma, was without the authority of law. It had contended that the decision of appointment could only be taken at the annual general body. Following this, the civil court had suspended the appointment of Justice Verma. In revision, the Charminar Cricket Club, also affiliated to the HCA, contended in the High Court that the petitioner was in collusion with HCA secretary Vijayanand and was lacking in bona fides. The HC set aside the city court's decision and had come down heavily on secretary of HCA while terming the litigation against the appointment of the ombudsman as a “collusive” one. “It is clear that the secretary of the 2nd respondent (HCA), having agreed to the appointment of Justice Deepak Verma as Ombudsman and Ethics Officer in the meeting of the Apex Council held on June 6, 2020, which was ratified in the subsequent meeting of the Apex Council held on August 13, 2020, tried to sabotage the said appointment by setting up the 1st respondent to file the O.P. giving the incorrect address of 2nd respondent...,” the high court had said. It is clear HCA secretary, agreed to a decision in Apex council meeting, later “clandestinely” arranged another meeting behind back of the president Azharuddin, got passed another resolution and misled court below in getting appointment of ombudsman stayed, HC said. (With Agency Inputs) While upholding appointment of Justice Verma, the high court had severely faulted the HCA secretary, R Vijayanand, for “playing fraud to abuse the process of the court”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-had-faulted-hca-secretary/articleshow/88306609.cms||---

For the Saha family, exploring remote and ancient villages and helping restore their glory is not only a hobby but passion. “I work as a conservationist architect and Udayan has been travelling with me for my projects for a few years now. We mostly operate out of remote villages in Uttarakhand. This is how he got introduced to the cultural and environmental aesthetics,” said Sriparna Saha, the boy’s mother. According to the family, they travelled to Churer Dhar village in Chamba in February where Udayan painted a few murals in the village with the help of the local children there. “My mother also painted a mural on water conservation. We then came to know about the ancient water temple, locally known as a baori or a stepwell, at Matogi village. It became apparent that locals needed to be made aware of water conservation. The murals talk about the ancient Himalayan water sources like nullahs or dharas and help people understand the importance of water conservation,” said Saha, an avid reader and writer. He has a travel blog where he chronicles his personal experiences. He also actively participates in essay competitions. “That is how he came in touch with the Bowseat and Future Blu Youth Council. He was an essay winner in 2016 and was on their mailing list. When he came to know about the fellowship a few months back, he started working on the water heritage mural programme,” said Sriparna. The fellowship provides funding and mentorship to youngsters working on water-related challenges in their local communities. Saha is one of the nine grantees to be selected this year and will receive $800 in early 2022. “Once the money comes in, I will start working on fresh murals around the Matogi water temple for which I’ll also enlist help from the locals,” said the boy. A student of class XI at a private school in Dehradun, he hopes to one day pursue engineering while continuing his work on environmental and cultural conservation. The family resides in the city and will continue travelling across Uttarakhand to help restore the heritage and create awareness among the locals about the environment and its resources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-teen-gets-fellowship-from-us-for-water-murals/articleshow/88305787.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Shops, restaurants and lodges have been losing businesses worth crores of rupees.Residents, shop owners and authorities of a church and school on Town Hall road and the adjacent road have written to corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan, with a copy to the CM’s cell, seeking relief from the pathetic road they have been enduring for the past 26 months. ``Town hall road is the electronics hub of Madurai, where you can buy and repair electronic goods, but even that is not happening now,’’ said T Sankaralingam, a contractor who is a regular to this road.Though the corporation has chosen Nethaji road for the heritage walk route, Town Hall road is the shortest route from the railway junction to Meenakshi temple and hence people who come by bus also take it. Now, all these people are facing a lot of hardships due to the bad condition of the road, said Mariappan, a tour operator. Roshan Malik, a trader, says he witnessed an elderly man tripping over the exposed stones on Nethaji road a few weeks ago, falling down and breaking his teeth. “This was one road where everyone wanted to set up their businesses a couple of decades ago. Now, nobody wants to come,” he said.Since many lodges, restaurants and shops owned by families for generations adorn Town Hall road, many who visited Madurai never failed to visit them, but not any more, said Ashraf Tayub, secretary, Tamil Nadu Textile Merchants Association. People are forced to walk precariously on overflowing sewage at the very entrance to the road. It is not that Nethaji road which runs parallel is any better, said Janikaraman, a resident of Simmakkal.Traders say the old road laid decades ago was much better and trouble-free. Now, the corporation fills potholes unevenly, which makes the problem worse, say the traders. They are counting on chief minister M K Stalin to take note of their problem. Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said a tender had been floated for taking up repair of this road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ditches-of-town-hall-road-now-over-2-yrs-old/articleshow/88306604.cms||---

The villages of Thamarakki north and south, Kumarapatti and Kallangulam are jointly known as ``Thamarakki nadu’’. People of these villages celebrate the annual festival of Kalitheertha Ayyanar and Ezhaikatha Amman temple together. When the festival begins, the villagers start fasting for 15 days and perform special rituals on all days.Little girls in the age group of eight to ten take out a procession carrying pots of water on their heads during “Puravi eduppu’’ festival. Horses made of mud were carried to the Ayyanar temple. Around 200 youth and children smeared their bodies with mud and walked on the streets of the villages and took out processions. They gathered near the local pond and used mud from the banks of the tank for the mud baths. ``It is believed that doing so would ward off evils like diseases and also ensure a good harvest for the villages,’’ said K Jagatheesan, a villager. Youngsters like Dinesh said they had not been able to fulfil their vows last year and hence they did it now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/youths-take-mud-bath-at-temple-fest/articleshow/88306605.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||‘Courage, determination and die-hard spirit of Indian soldiers remembered’||Chandigarh: To coincide with the 50th anniversary celebration of the 1971 Indo-Pak war, a book ‘War In The East, Liberation of Bangladesh, 1971.’ was released in the presence of veterans. The book is written by Colonel Ranbir Singh, VrC (retd) who also participated in the war and was then a Major with 4 Rajput Regiment. The book illustrates the courage, determination and die-hard spirit of Indian soldiers, who faced challenging circumstances and dangerous situations involving risks to their lives. This resulted in the liberation of Bangladesh from the tyrannical rule of East Pakistan. The prominent military veterans who were present on this occasion includes Lt General Bhopinder Singh, former Lt Governor Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Puducherry, Lt General H S Panag, former Northern Army Commander, Lt General G S Sihota, Major Generals P C Puri, Brigadier's H S Lamba, Brig M S Dullat, Brig Harwant Singh and Brig P S Mann. The book was released by chief guest General Bhopinder Singh. A unique aspect was that a majority of veterans present had participated in the war for the liberation of Bangladesh. “The book is a testament to the valour of Indian soldiers and leadership at junior level. A record 93,000 Pakistani soldiers surrendered and were taken prisoners of war by the Indian Army on December 16, 1971.” said the Colonel. Talking about the distinctive features of the book, Colonel Ranbir said, “Most of the books on the East Pakistan war have been written by top military commanders. In my book, the stress has been laid on battalion-level operations, highlighting junior commanders’ leadership. My book also covers the entire offensive operation by India’s Eastern Command and illustrates the war in its entirety.” He said the Indian Army weaved a ‘chakravyuh’ to ensure success. “It was meticulous planning, which was relentlessly executed to perfection by all sub-units,” added the Colonel. Col Ranbir took part in both 1965 and 1971 wars. He was wounded in Kargil attack on May 17, 1965 and was awarded Veer Chakra for gallantry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/courage-determination-and-die-hard-spirit-of-indian-soldiers-remembered/articleshow/88307599.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Centre flags case uptick in 19 Maharashtra districts, falling testing||The ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), in a letter sent on Tuesday, has flagged 19 districts in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, for recording a slight rise in weekly Covid cases during the seven-day period ending December 9. Five other districts have been red-flagged for a reduction in weekly Covid testing.

---||Delhi||SC allows Delhi govt’s decision to issue permits to 4,261 e-autos||NEW DELHI: Observing that even BS-VI compliant vehicles cause pollution and leave a carbon footprint, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Delhi government to go ahead with its decision to issue permits to 4,261 e-autos and dismissed Bajaj Auto’s petition challenging the decision on the ground of alleged discrimination against CNG-operated autos. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said that the decision to promote cleaner fuel and allowing registration of battery-run auto rickshaw did not amount to violation of any rights of the company manufacturing CNG-run autos and refused to interfere in the decision. The company pleaded that the all its autos are BS-VI compliant vehicles and level of emission has improved by more than 90% in comparison to BS-I vehicle and there was no reason for Delhi governemnt to adopt discriminatory policy. But the bench said that there was no infirmity in the decision taken by Delhi government and it is in conformity with Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicle scheme and the Electric Vehicle policy 2020 framed by the Centre. Referring to the pollution level in Delhi, the bench said, “Residents are suffering from air pollution. Undoubtedly a part of it is attributed to vehicles. Even though CNG autos are BS-VI compliant, there is still some carbon emission. We do not agree that fundamental rights of the manufacturer are being violated by the decision”. Bajaj pleaded that there should be no bar against issuance of any number of new permits to autos running on CNG or other clean fuels and the cap of one lakh autos in Delhi should not be applied. The court, however, said that it would examine it later and said that it would continue. “All the concerns expressed by the SC in 1997 with respect to polluting TSRs (Three Seater Auto Rickshaw) have come to be fully addressed by ensuring the adoption of clean fuel technologies in both the existing autorickshaws then plying on Delhi roads (through their mandatory conversion to CNG or other clean fuels) and also through new norms for subsequently-introduced autorickshaws (which only adopted CNG/LPG). Therefore, there was no bar against issuance of any number of new permits to TSRs running on CNG/other clean fuels,” the company said in its petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-allows-delhi-govts-decision-to-issue-permits-to-4261-e-autos/articleshow/88307167.cms||---

Some schools have also partially started with a few classes for KG students unofficially.“There is simply no reason to delay reopening Kindergartens. For schools too, there are no additional efforts or costs involved in having KG students back. It is not only schools who want to have students back but parents are also keen to send their children,” said M Arumugam, state president, Federation of Private School Associations (FePSA). Many schools have, meanwhile, started classes unofficially for KG students for a few days a week for a few hours.“It is for the sake of parents and children’s welfare. Last two years, children could not attend KG classes and have now directly joined Class I, which has been a struggle for them. The main aim of having kindergarten classes is to ease students into the routine of coming to school, developing eating, sleeping habits and socialising, rather than studying,” said the correspondent of a nursery and primary school. Schools that are unofficially holding classes for KG students are calling the students to school for two or three days in a week just for a few hours.At government schools as well, teachers said that some parents are checking whether they can take care of KG students as well. “KG students already spend only a short time in school so there is no reason why we can’t reopen for them,” said a teacher at a government primary school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-parents-want-kg-classes-resumed/articleshow/88306612.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Track the pollution level in your cityA few areas of the capital that continued suffering severe pollution levels till 4pm included Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Mundka, Nehru Nagar, Okhla Phase-2, RK Puramand Vivek Vihar. Like a day before, the weather conditions continued to be unsupportive for dispersing the pollutants on Wednesday as the winds remained at 5kmph in the morning and evening and 10kmph towards the afternoon, which lead to some dispersion. According to the central pollution control board, air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday was 363 against 367 a day earlier. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5 or particles in air with diameter less than 2.5 microns, were still well above the safe limit of 60 microgrammes per cubic metres. The PM2.5 oscillated between 181.3 to 192.8 units, which only worsened or spiked from morning till the evening. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality will oscillate between poor to very-poor category over the next few days. “Delhi’s AQI on Wednesday indicates ‘very poor’ air quality. Shallow foggy condition is likely to keep AQI poor for Thursday. From Friday onwards significant improvement is likely in the air quality due to high wind speeds,” a statement from SAFAR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-stays-very-poor-expect-slight-easing-after-2-days/articleshow/88306621.cms||---

---||Delhi||PWD writes to air panel to lift curbs on construction in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Public Works Department has written a letter to the chairman of Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) MM Kutty, appealing against the ongoing ban on construction activities in the city. A PWD official said the letter has also been sent to the principal secretary of Delhi government's environment department, Sanjeev Khirwar. Due to alarming levels of air pollution, the Supreme Court had on November 24 imposed a ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR till further orders. In an order passed on December 10, Supreme Court had asked CAQM to examine requests of various industries and organisations about relaxation of conditions to restart construction. The PWD official said construction bans are not the solution to air pollution. “With the ban, projects suffer delays and construction workers lose their livelihood. Promotion of BS-VI compliant vehicles, usage of dust control measures at constructions site like anti-smog guns, screening and barricading at the construction sites in accordance to the temperature and wind velocity would provide better results,” the official said. The CAQM) on Wednesday lifted the ban on operation of six thermal power plants located within 300 km radius of Delhi. The commission has given relaxation to some industries, which still have not shifted to PNG or cleaner fuels, to run without any restriction on number of hours per day for five days per week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pwd-writes-to-air-panel-to-lift-curbs-on-construction/articleshow/88307174.cms||---

Justice Devan Ramachandran questioned police’s stance after it was told by a government counsel that the child was not intimidated by the police officer, CP Rejitha, but by the crowd that gathered around them. Though the state police chief had raised such a contention in an affidavit, the court had turned it down at an earlier hearing. When the government maintained the same stance during Wednesday’s hearing, the court pointed out that the police officer had admitted her guilt and asked why police is standing in the way of taking proper disciplinary action against the officer. The court also said the officer’s apology doesn’t mean there wouldn’t be any disciplinary action. While asking the government to arrive at a compensation amount, the court said it is a fit case for granting compensation. Through the petition, the girl has demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh. A psychologist who assessed the girl after the incident informed the court that she is a strong and mature girl and doesn’t require any further clinical support. The court said what she needs is justice and asked the government to arrive at a compensation by Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-asks-govt-to-decide-on-compensation/articleshow/88306631.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai: As crowds surge, theatres struggle to check vaccination status of audience||MADURAI: Theatres in Madurai, which are seeing huge crowds on many days, are in a fix on implementing the district administration’s instruction to check Covid-19 vaccination certificates and not to allow unvaccinated people on the premises. INOX at Vishaal de Maal is among the few theatres in Madurai strictly checking the vaccination status of audience. Only those with vaccination certificates are allowed into movie halls while those unvaccinated are being sent back and their tickets refunded. Even in online booking for the theatre, it has been communicated to the audience to come with vaccination certificates. “I regularly go to theatres. The rule to check vaccination certificates is welcome if it can be implemented without inconvenience. I will personally feel much safer if I know only those who are vaccinated are allowed in the theatre hall,” said Manasa R, a 26-year-old college student. However, most theatres are struggling to implement the rule before a show. “For theatres where thousands come to see movies in a day, it is just not possible to check everyone’s vaccination status every time,” said a theatre owner. Theatres also do not want to risk creating crowds on their premises by making the audience wait to check Covid-19 vaccination certificates. “As of now, we are able to somewhat manage it because the crowds are less. But, during movie releases, it will be next to impossible. Already, our businesses have been affected due to the pandemic and we are currently having less than 50% of the capacity filled,” said Rajasekaran, manager, Ambika Theatre. For senior citizens who enjoy watching movies in theatres as well, the rule to check Covid-19 vaccination has made life difficult. “I have only a button mobile phone and accidentally deleted the message confirming my first dose vaccination. But since I had the second dose confirmatory message, I was allowed in a theatre. For people like us, it is a nightmare to have to keep vaccination certificate just to go to a movie,” said N Gnanapandithan, a 70-year-old resident of Villapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-crowds-surge-theatres-struggle-to-check-vaccination-status-of-audience/articleshow/88306618.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

Early on Wednesday morning, one of these animals was spotted in Kasba Bawda, Bhosalewadi area, which is within the city limits. Meanwhile, a herd of three bison was spotted in the Kagal MIDC area, whereas one solitary animal was seen on Tuesday night at the Prayag Chikhli village. A herd of five bison was spotted on Monday night near the Panhala fort-Pawangad fort road, while a injured bison was rescued in the Harpawde village of Panhala tehsil. Forest department officials have been keeping an eye on the bison that was seen at Peth Vadgaon village and then made its way to the Latawde village. However, late on Tuesday night, another bison entered Peth Vadgaon near the Mangrayachi Wadi area. Range forest officer Karveer Ramesh Kamble said, “The bison that was spotted in the Bhosalewadi area of the city was resting in the sugarcane fields next the Zoom garbage project. Six of our teams, comprising around 60 forestors, are monitoring the area as the animal may come out at night. Though the place is within the city, it has thick sugarcane plantations and tracing the exact location of the animal becomes a tough task.” “We are not sure of the cison spotted now is the same one that was involved in the death of a youth in Bhuyewadi. If people come across a bison, they should immediately alert the forest department by calling on 1926,” Kamble added. When a bison leaves the forest and comes into the farmland, then its smelling power reduces due to the pesticides sprayed on crops. Also if miscreants spook the animal, it tries to escape and takes whichever path it can find, often ending up in urban areas. Devendra Bhosale, a member of the wildlife protection and research society, said, “A bison in a group stays calm, but it gets separated from the group, then there are chances of the animal becoming aggressive. To avoid Bhuyewadi-kind incidents, I urge everyone to not to chase the bison or disturb it in any way. The animal is already stressed. If given safe passage, the animal will return to its own habitat.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-encounters-on-the-rise-in-around-kolhapur-city/articleshow/88305049.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

---||Delhi||Delhi LG Anil Baijal writes to CM Arvind Kejriwal, seeks funds for north corporation||NEW DELHI: With the finances of North Delhi Municipal Corporation in a grim condition, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has interceded on behalf of the civic body with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. In his letter sent earlier this month, the LG requesting the CM to “personally intervene” in the release of funds. “The municipal corporations have been key stakeholders and partners in the management of the Covid-19 pandemic for more than one and half years. However, the non-availability of sufficient funds due to deductions in the budget estimates of the corporations has remained an area of concern,” Baijal wrote. Sanjay Goel, commissioner of the north corporation, claimed that Delhi government reduced the disbursals by Rs 328.6 crore this year. He had written to the LG pointing out that while the state government had reduced its funds provision this year, the dearness allowance liability had increased by Rs 240 crore. This only added to the paucity of funds, which had delayed salaries and pensions amounting to Rs 600 crore.” With the corporation unable to pay salaries for two months, Baijal said to Kejriwal, “I will be grateful if the above request of North Delhi Municipal Corporation for the release of Rs 328 crore can be considered favourably in larger public interest to enable the corporation to make timely payment of salaries to the employees to enable uninterrupted delivery of essential public services.” Earlier, due to a strike called by doctors, paramedical staff and nurses over delayed salaries and the non-implementation of revised dearness allowances, six healthcare centres run by the north corporation face a lot of difficulties in providing care to patients, admitted Jogi Ram Jain, chairman of the civic body’s standing committee, in another letter to the LG. He also said the state government hadn’t released the funds requested in the LG’s letter to the CM. “In order to avoid any unpleasant situation arising due to a strike by health workers during the Covid pandemic, the north corporation released the salaries of all doctors and other health staff for the months of September and October by delaying the salaries of certain other staff and withholding the pension and salary of group D staff,” the letter explained. Later, in a statement on Wednesday, the state government issued a statement in response. “Delhi government has already transferred all the funds owed to the three MCDs as per its constitutional obligations and not even a single rupee is held back. It is the Centre that owes the corporations Rs 12,000 crore,” the statement said. “The Centre gives grants to all municipal corporations across the country, based on a formula of Rs 488 per person of the population. However, it is not paying grants to the three MCDs for the last 17 years. Further, thousands of crores of property tax arrears are also pending from various Central government agencies and for free advertisements on hoardings. The MCDs can pay salaries to its employees by recovering these dues but are not doing so to extort and defame the Delhi government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/baijal-writes-to-kejriwal-seeks-funds-for-n-corpn/articleshow/88307185.cms||---

The arrested accused has been identified as Maharudra, alias Aaba Muley. The suspect is saud to have changed 12 SIM cards to evade arrest while being on the run. He, however, ran out of luck in the early hours of Wednesday and was arrested from his house in the Gangadham area on Jalna Road, Beed. SP R Raja said Muley’s name first cropped up after a special squad first raided two godowns in September — including the one in the vicinity of a school in Ghodka Rajuri village — and seized gutka worth about Rs 63 lakh. Since registration of the offence at Pimpalner police station, the accused managed to evade arrest. However, some of his accomplices were arrested. While the police teams were trying to nab Muley, one team led by probationary IPS Pankaj Kumawat intercepted two trucks carrying gutka from Karnataka, and seized the banned item worth Rs 58 lakh on October 13. Accordingly, an offence was registered with the Manjarsumba police station. Raja said that while the police were trying to nab the accused, he was reportedly changing his hideouts in Pune and Aurangabad. During the same period, he reportedly even changed his SIM cards 12 times. Muley went to his home late Tuesday night. Hours after he got home, a police team raided Muley’s house and nabbed him. Authorities said the preliminary probe indicates that the suspect has a vast network of gutka trade in the district and is accused of sourcing it from other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gutka-trader-uses-12-sims-to-evade-arrest-finally-caught/articleshow/88305081.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Lucknow||‘My husband won’t return, will never leave his men behind’: Sudha Mulla wife of sunken INS Khukri Captain||LUCKNOW: On December 9, 1971, the 94-metre-long Indian submarine, INS Khukri, was hit by two torpedoes from Pakistan’s PNS Hangor off the coast of Diu, Gujarat. The commander of the ship, Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla, remained undeterred and gave away the last life jacket on board, his own, to a young sailor. “Go on, save your life. Don’t worry about me,” he told the sailor. Six officers and 61 men survived but 18 officers and 178 sailors laid down their lives in the line of duty. The most poignant moment for those who survived was the sight of the 45-year-old Captain calmly puffing his cigarette as the ship went down. After the sinking of INS Khukri, Captain Mulla’s close friend, Captain Arvind Kunte, visited the officer’s family quarters in Mumbai to inform the family about the incident. “I was 14 and my sister, Anjali Kaul, was 11. We had returned to Mumbai from Shimla following our school’s winter vacation. That night, we were in our room with mother (Sudha Mulla) when Captain Kunte arrived. He said INS Khukri has been hit by torpedoes and many men are missing. He said Veeru (as was Captain Mulla affectionately called) is helping to save lives,” recalled the captain’s elder daughter, Ameeta Mulla Wattal, speaking to TOI over phone. “Before Captain Kunte could speak further, my mother said, ‘Mera gharwala nahi aayega. Wo jis mitti ke bane hain, kisi ko peechhe chhod kar nahi aane wale (My husband won’t return. He won’t leave any of his men behind),” said Ameeta, a Noida-based educationist and the recipient of National Teachers’ Award (2005). Captain Mulla was honoured with Mahavir Chakra. “My father came from the family of judges, lawyers and writers. He spoke Russian, Urdu and Persian besides Hindi and English. He was well read. A devotee of Goddess Dugra, his life was influenced by Swami Vivekananda. He decided to join Indian Navy after completing education from Boys’ High School, Allahabad (now Prayagraj). He was patriotic since his early age, probably because his mother, Kamla, use to narrate stories of patriotism to him,” she said. Hailing from an illustrious Kashmiri Pandit family, Captain Mulla’s father, Tej Narayan Mulla, was district judge in Gorakhpur, who later shifted to Lucknow’s Elgin Road. His grandfather Jagat Narayan Mulla was a member of Hunter Commission which looked into the the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Mahendra’s mother Kamla (Kshma) was daughter of writer Raja Narendra Nath Raina from Lahore. His wife Sudha is the niece of social worker Rameshwari Nehru and PN Haksar, who was the principal secretary to former PM Indira Gandhi. Capt Mahendra Mulla were 12 siblings, and his sister Malini was the wife of Rameshwar Nath Kao, the first chief of the Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW). “He was a disciplined man and never allowed us to accept gifts even on birthdays. He insisted to consider marginalized ones who can’t arrange food. He would become a child while playing with us. He was a versatile man,” said Anjali, the younger daughter of Captain Mulla. Suddha Mulla, the widow of the braveheart, was discharged from hospital on Wednesday after recovering from prolonged illness. “She is a brave woman and helped many widows of INS Khukri crew to stay strong and lead a normal life. The pain of not been able to cremate the bodies of sailors is still deep-rooted. My mother always told the other widows... Jis din mera gharwala aayega, us din tumhare gharwale bhi aayenge,” said Ameeta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ins-khukri-commander-went-down-with-the-vessel-but-saved-his-men/articleshow/88307197.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Delhi||Delhi-NCR: As pollution hotspots revert to type, 2020 gains lost||NEW DELHI: The Centre for Science and Environment has determined that on average, PM2.5 concentration at 17 pollution hotspots in Delhi-NCR initially showed a fall in 2020 only to rise again at several locations this year, with a few even faring worse than in 2019. The CSE analysis, which is based on the Central Pollution Control Board’s real time air quality data, found industrial locations such as Bawana, Mundka, Narela, Sahibabad, Jahangirpuri and Wazirpur to be among the areas with an upward trend in PM2.5 levels. CPCB and DPCC had identified 13 places in Delhi with average PM2.5 and PM10 levels throughout the year higher than the mean of the city and designated them as pollution hotspots. A comparison of the annual average PM2.5 levels of 17 hotspots show them all recording an improvement in 2020 mainly due to the Covid lockdown. However, the gains made last year were lost this year as pollution levels again increased at most of the locations. Mayapuri in Delhi and Faridabad in NCR were the exception, with the annual average PM2.5 concentration there remaining stable till December 13 compared with the level in 2020. Jahangirpuri and Narela saw a spike in PM2.5 concentration in 2021 against the levels of 2019. The annual average PM2.5 concentration at Jahangirpuri was 129 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019. It reduced to 124 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020 but has again shot up to 131 micrograms per cubic metre this year. Similarly, Narela’s annual average PM2.5 concentration was 101 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019 before it rose to 105 and 112 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020 and 2021, respectively. According to the analysis, of the 17 hotspots, 10 recorded PM2.5 concentrations higher than the Delhi city average of 104 micrograms per cubic metre. However, seven locations — Bahadurgarh, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Mandir Marg, Mayapuri, Okhla Phase II and RK Puram — reported average levels below that of the Delhi city average. Experts said the cause of the pollution spike in some locations should be investigated. They stressed that apart from a city-wide action plan, local issues in certain areas should also be targeted. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, “It is necessary to strengthen targeted action to control highly polluting local sources including waste burning, local industrial stack and fugitive emissions, construction activities, unpaved roads, and traffic congestion. Strong local action has to align with city-wide improvement in infrastructure, compliance systems and clean fuel access." Meanwhile, CSE analysis of the current winter season (October-December 13) showed a mixed trend with several hotspots recording an improvement and a few worsening from the status in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-hotspots-revert-to-type-2020-gains-lost/articleshow/88306651.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Lucknow||‘Refugees on footpath, Kol had become ghost town during war’||Barabanki: As a first-year student of BCom at St Xavier’s College in then-Calcutta, Arvind Kumar Gutgutia was enjoying his college life when a full-scale military conflict broke out between India and Pakistan. The development had followed the genocide of Bengali Muslims and Hindus by Pakistan’s military and other personnel in what was then East Pakistan and present-day Bangladesh. Millions of Bangladeshi nationals had fled to neighbouring Kolkata to escape the massacre. They found shelter on footpaths, public parks and various locations in the city. A full-fledged war broke out on December 3 and lasted 13 days. Going down memory lane 50 years ago, Gutgutia, now 69, said, “I lived in to Poddar Chhatra Niwas (a boys’ hostel) on Chittaranjan Avenue Road.” “In the days preceding, Bangladeshi refugees had started migrating to Kolkata and other parts of eastern India. During the 13-day war period, there was a massive influx. With no food, clothes or shelter, poor peasants from east Pakistan spread across the city and mostly lived on footpath. My grandfather Kashinath Gutgutia use to coordinate with Shree Kashi Vishwanath Seva Samiti in Burrabazaar for their relief. Other youths and I volunteered to serve food prepared by the samiti to the refugees,” said Gutgutia, a businessman now settled in Barabanki. Recalling those days, he added that while daytime was normal, after 7pm, Kolkata would turn into a ghost city. All streetlights would be switched off and curfew imposed. “The nights were terrifying. We were advised to hide under the bed, table or go underground in case of heavy bombardment,” he said. “On the day of Pakistani army’s surrender on December 16, people came out on the streets to celebrate. Refugees raised pro-India slogans,” he added. On December 24, Gutgutia and a bunch of hostel boys decided to visit Bangladesh. They took a bus via Jessore Road but were stopped before the border by Indian Army. “We were allowed to walk into Bangladesh and we did so. Just a few hundred metres after the border, we saw crashed Pakistani Sabre jets and bombarded Patton tanks along the road. But the most horrific scene was of decomposed bodies of men, women and children. There were thousands lying in a field—possibly shot by Pakistani soldiers while trying to flee. It took many weeks for us to psychologically overcome that horrendous scene,” said Gutgutia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/refugees-on-footpath-kol-had-become-ghost-town-during-war/articleshow/88307217.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The municipal elections are likely in April 2022. In a bid to oust BJP from the three municipal corporations, AAP has been reaching out to Delhiites at 3,000 locations throughout the city. “We are attempting to connect with more and more people through this method. I am pleased to report that 6,21,356 people have already joined AAP since the campaign began earlier this month,” party functionary Durgesh Pathak said. He claimed, “This shows that AAP is the only party capable of bringing about a revolutionary change in the corporations to completely transform the way things work.” BJP is at the helm in the three civic bodies for the past 15 years. “People of Delhi are eager for reform in the corporations as they are fed up with BJP governing them. When asked about BJP-led corporations’ corruption, cleanliness and employees’ strike, everyone concurred that BJP has been an utter failure,” Pathak alleged. “The people in Delhi also believe that only the AAP government can bring change to corporations and improve the city’s deteriorating situation,” he claimed, adding that 95% of Delhiites believe that AAP should get a chance at the corporations too. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed that due to political malice, the AAP government had starved the corporations of funds, resulting in pending salaries. “People know about it all and will teach AAP a lesson in the municipal polls,” said Kapoor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6l-new-members-under-mcd-badlaav-aap/articleshow/88307212.cms||---

But a group of village panchayat members have lodged a complaint with DC that illegal mining is rampant in their area. Manauli Surat village panchayat members met the DC and gave complaint regarding illegal mining on shamlat land. They alleged that the mining officers are giving false information to the DC office. Panchayat members led by former Punjab police inspector Mahinder Singh along with Jaswinder Singh, Hari Singh, Gurnam Singh and others knocked the door of the DC office with documentary evidences in the form of photographs to support their claims submitted with the DC. Mahinder Singh said, “The mining officer of our area has been reporting false information and concealing the fact that there is no illegal mining going on in Mohali. We lodged a complaint with the police also and when investigating officer was deployed, the illegal miners told them that mud is being excavated to construct a religious place, but only 10% of the mud is put into construction site whereas 90% are being sold in open market.” After listening to the complaint of the village panchayat members, DC Kalia issued orders to police department to submit a report and also asked mining officer to get the complaint physically checked and verified. She said, “Mining department has been submitting that there are no illegal mining sites in Mohali. We will get this verified and fix the responsibility of the mining department for being negligent.” She also said on the directives of chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the district administration initiated a special crackdown campaign to check illegal mining across various mining sites of the district. CM has directed strict action against unscrupulous elements indulging in illicit practices related to sand mining, added DC Kalia. 3 crusher zones declared legal Mohali administration has fixed the rates for selling of sand and gravel in the district and earmarked three zones as legal sites for purchasing sand and gravel. Mohali DC Isha Kalia has also cautioned of strict action against those found selling sand and gravel over and above the fixed rates.

Meanwhile, chief conservator of forests, north zone, D K Vinod Kumar, who visited the area, said that the images of the injured tiger could not be found in the database of camera trap images collected as part of estimation exercises conducted by the department every year in the Wayanad forests. The department has sent the camera trap image of the tiger to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to ascertain its identity and territory from the national database. “We have sent the camera trap photographs of the tiger to NTCA to find whether it has been recorded in the national repository (of camera trap images of tigers),” he said. As the Wayanad Widlife Sanctuary and North Wayanad forest division is contiguous with Bandipur Tiger Reserve and Nagarahole Tiger Reserve in Karnataka, it is normal for tigers to move between the forests. The camera trap images of the tiger recorded by the forest department on Monday reveal that the animal is in an extremely pathetic condition with serious injuries sustained in the neck possibly after getting caught in a snare. As the stripe patterns of each tiger is unique, the identity of individual tigers could be ascertained by comparing the stripe patters from the flank surface of the tiger images in the database of camera trap images. Meanwhile, the forest department has transferred North Wayand DFO Ramesh Bishnoi and posted as deputy conservation of forests (protection) in Thiruvananthapuram. Darshan Gattani, DFO of Malayattoor forest division, is the new North Wayanad DFO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/camera-trap-images-of-injured-tiger-sent-to-ntca/articleshow/88306668.cms||---

Lucknowites will get to taste mouth-watering kebabs, lips smacking sweets, scrumptious momos and other street food in a hygienic environment at these sites. The Food Safety and Drug Administration (FSDA) has decided to set up these three food zones with 20 vendors each in association with Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) after seeing the success of the Eat Right Carnival underway at Riverfront. FSDA officer and nodal in charge of the Eat Right Carnival Shailendra Pratap Singh said that at present there is no organised food zone in the city like Juhu in Mumbai. Hence, it has been decided to set up such a place in Lucknow. “LMC will provide carts equipped with fire extinguisher, stove, food containers and solar panels and FSDA will ensure proper hygiene and quality is maintained. This will motivate people to eat street food without any fear of catching coronavirus infection,” he added. “Besides training vendors in health and hygiene, we will make arrangements for drinking water and toilets in the zones. Mobile food testing vans will be available in these vending zones on a rotation basis for spot checking of food quality,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-to-get-juhu-like-three-street-food-vending-zones-soon/articleshow/88307226.cms||---

The department of posts headquartered in New Delhi dispatched a circular on December 8 to all postal circles nationwide, requesting them to publicise the decision. “In view of the present disruptions in air connectivity for USA, it has been decided to withhold the booking/collection of all types of mails destined to USA with immediate effect and further orders. Circles shall bring this to the notice of all customers as well as display it for public information,” it read. Meanwhile, clients who send cargo and mail to the US on a regular basis are in a quandary. The circulation department of a community magazine issued an email to subscribers worldwide, saying its consignment of year-end diaries had been rejected at a city post office, and was therefore indefinitely delayed. Currently, international flights are operated under air bubble agreements that India has signed with over 28 countries, including the US. In November, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had announced resumption of regular scheduled flights from December 15. With that, airlines would have been able to add more flights and go back to the pre-Covid schedule. But with concerns over Omicron, in early December, India postponed the resumption of scheduled international flights till January 2022 end. The move has meant continued curtailed operations to all countries. But demand for flights to the US is high, and Air India, the only Indian carrier that flies to the US, announced more flights from December 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-postal-dept-suspends-us-deliveries-on-flight-issues/articleshow/88307633.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

Mongoose is listed in schedule-2, part-2 of the protected animal list. A case has been registered against the five shop owners under sections 39, 49B, 50, 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. In the raid, 37-year-old Rajendra Vitthal Supnekar (Shivani paints), 45-year-old Sandip Devkar (Devkar paints), 39-year-old Tohim Nazir Shaikh (Sunshine paints), 24-year-old Naweed Vaikar (Bharat paints), and 51-yer-old Akhtar Vaikar (Sahyadri paints) have been taken into custody. A total of 1,735 paint brushes have been seized. Of them, 92 brushes have been seized from Shivani paints, 447 from Devkar paints, 212 from Sunshine paints, 163 brushes Bharat paints, and 821 brushes from Sahyadri paints. Mahadev Mohite, the deputy conservator of forests in Satara, said, “Mongoose is a wild animal and plays an important role in the natural cycle of life.

Also, MC will construct an auditorium, install synthetic track in GMADA sports stadiums. Mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu said underground power lines will be laid in Mohali in coordination with Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). He said the bundles of wires hanging on the poles have become an eyesore in the city and the hanging electric wires in some places also cause accidents. Mayor also said in coordination with GMADA, it is planned to use the treated water from the STPs for irrigation. He said the existing STP run by GMADA was treating the water and dumping it in the drain, as no pipe was laid to suppy the water to Mohali. He said the MC was preparing an estimate in this regard so that this water could be supplied back to Mohali and used for irrigation of parks. Mayor also said projects related to construction of auditorium in Mohali and installation of synthetic track in Sector 78 sports stadium have been approved by the chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi. He said similarly two sports stadiums constructed by GMADA in Mohali will be taken over by the MC after renovation by GMADA. According to him, better facilities will be provided in these sports stadiums for a nominal fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mc-plans-to-lay-underground-power-cables-with-pspcl/articleshow/88307628.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Delhi||Why Delhi is enveloped in haze in winter season||NEW DELHI: A research led by IIT-Kanpur and supported by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has found burning of biomass material and industrial emissions to be the biggest contributors to haze in the city during the post-monsoon and winter months. The study, titled “Effect of biomass burning on PM2.5 composition and secondary aerosol formation during post-monsoon and winter haze episodes in Delhi”, was conducted at two sites — Pusa and IIT-Delhi — from October 2019 to January 2020. The research showed that during the post-monsoon period, i.e., late October to mid-November, the haze was caused largely by biomass burning particles, likely from burning of agricultural residue in Delhi’s neighbouring states. The study laid emphasis on the use of alternative methods of disposing of agricultural waste, such as composting. The initial winter period, i.e, late November and December, saw aqueous formation of sulphate and ammonium nitrate, suggesting industrial emissions, according to Sachchida Nand Tripathi from the civil engineering department at IIT-Kanpur and corresponding author of the study. “The study links industrial emissions to hazy periods, but the research did not explore what kind of industries led to that haze,” Tripathi said. In January, winter haze episodes were again largely caused by biomass burning, this time from local sources such as burning of wood, coal or roadside trash for heating or cooking purposes. “Strict control of roadside burning and amplification of subsidised distribution of cleaner fuel to low-income households can help control the high levels of organics related to biomass burning,” said the study. The winter haze particles contained “significant” aged inorganic material, including ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride aerosol, apart from aged organics, the study revealed. It also suggested that night-time ageing of biomass burning contributed to the rapid formation of aged organic and inorganic particles, causing haze. According to Tripathi, biomass burning was dominant during all haze periods. “However, emissions undergo rapid night-time oxidation, resulting in high yields of secondary organics and inorganics,” he added. The study, which has been accepted in Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, used two instruments — high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). “Though a few studies have linked haze and biomass burning using speculative models, this study is based on instruments,” said Tripathi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-delhi-is-enveloped-in-haze-in-winter-season/articleshow/88306706.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Vijayawada||NTPC-Simhadri gets H microgrid project||Visakhapatnam: State-run power giant NTPC Limited has awarded a standalone fuel-cell based green hydrogen microgrid project to NTPC-Simhadri (Visakhapatnam). It is India’s first green hydrogen based energy storage project.  According to a statement by the Union ministry of power, NTPC has awarded the microgrid project with hydrogen production using electrolyser in NTPC guest house at Simhadri. Hydrogen would be produced using the advanced 240 kW solid oxide electrolyser by taking input power from the nearby floating solar project. The hydrogen produced during sunshine hours would be stored at high pressure and would be electrified using a 50 kW solid oxide fuel cell. The system would work in standalone mode from 5 pm to 7 am every day. This unique project configuration is designed in-house by NTPC.  “It is a unique project for India and would open doors for decarbonising the far-off regions of the country like Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, etc., hitherto dependent on diesel generators. The project is in-line with the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to become carbon neutral by 2070 and making Ladakh a carbon neutral territory,” read the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ntpc-simhadri-gets-h-microgrid-project/articleshow/88306659.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Climbers have expeditions lined up after Covid hiatus||Kolkata: Adventure sports enthusiasts in Bengal, who had to stay in quarantine for nearly two years have started lining up expeditions for 2022. They will pack their bags and set to explore newer horizons once the movement restriction is lifted. Satyarup Siddhanta, the youngest in the world to have climbed seven summits and seven volcanic summits, is all set for Greenland. He will ski through the entire stretch of 650 kilometres. Skiing through the treacherous track gets more difficult with numbing cold and wind speed reaching 30km/hours at times. One can get knocked off any time. “The weather is very unpredictable. Moreover, I will need necessary permissions regarding Covid-19. This requires a lot of funding and I am trying to pool that as well,” Sidhanta said. The first successful Indian expedition to Greenland on ski was undertaken by Ajeet Bajaj and his daughter in 2011. Cyclist Chandan Biswas from Kolkata is planning a trans-Siberian expedition on bicycle in winter next year after a two-year break. “So far there is one person who was able to do it in winter. The challenge lies in facing the temperature. During winter temperature drops to levels which are beyond endurance,” he said. Biswas has a plan to start from Vladivostok in Russia and finally reach Murmansk covering a 14,000km stretch. Apart from the coldest of the temperature zones, a cyclist’s biggest challenge lies in carrying supplies for days. “Most of the areas don’t have any human habitation. So I will have to paddle my way for days and nights before I reaching any village or human settlement to get a refill. Then I will have to start again,” Biswas said. Biswas will require at least eight months to travel this distance but was unable to get visa for that period during Covid-19 restrictions. Mountaineer Malay Mukherjee is planning to scale some unknown peaks in the Garhwal Himalayan region next year. “We will try to scale some peaks above 7,000 meters. Mount Chaukhamba is one of our targets this time,” Mukherjee said. Chaukhamba is a mountain mass in the Garhwal Himalayas and is the highest peak in the Gangotri group of mountains. Chaukhamba was first climbed in 1952 by Lucien George and Victor Russenberger. “We also have plans to scale an unknown peak near Shingo La pass near Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh,” said the mountaineer from Howrah. Another group of climbers are attempting Mount Annapurna next year. Annapurna is also a massif in the Himalayas with a peak located over 8,000 meters. Historically, for the climber, Annapurna peaks are among the most treacherous mountains in the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/climbers-have-expeditions-lined-up-after-covid-hiatus/articleshow/88306687.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks police reply on Ansals’ plea||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought a response from Delhi Police on a plea by real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal, seeking suspension of their seven-year jail terms. The term was awarded to the Ansals for tampering with evidence in the 1997 case of the Uphaar cinema fire, which claimed 59 lives. Justice Subramonium Prasad issued notice on the petitions and also sought response from the complainant, Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy. On December 3, a sessions court had rejected Ansals’ plea to suspend their conviction and jail term in the evidence tampering case by a magistrate and refused to release the convicts on bail. Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the petitioners, assailed the sessions court order and argued that the seven-year term exceeded the maximum punishment that could be granted in the case. He submitted that the sentencing was on a “wrong legal premise” and emphasised that even in the main case, the petitioners were convicted and sentenced to two-year jail term by the Supreme Court, which subsequently released them on payment of Rs 30 crore fine each after taking into account the prison time they had done. While dismissing Ansals’ plea for suspension of sentence till the appeal against the conviction by a magisterial court is decided, the sessions court had said that the case was one of the gravest of its kind and the offence appeared to be the outcome of a calculated design on the part of the convicts to interfere with the course of justice. The sessions court had also refused to suspend the seven-year jail term each to former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and two others — P P Batra and Anoop Singh — in the case and release them on bail. “A finding of guilt has already been given by the trial court. Thus the presumption of innocence that attaches to the accused during the trial of the case does not apply at the stage of consideration of suspension of sentence, whereby the appellants/accused persons stands guilty by the court concerned,” the sessions court had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-police-reply-on-ansals-plea/articleshow/88307229.cms||---

During his first visit to the institute on December 5, he asked the institute to install the boxes, which would be opened directly in the ministry every month. Though these boxes were present at all PGI centres, more are being installed. “These boxes can have ideas, feedback, complaints or suggestions from the public and hospital staff. After every month, they will be sent to the ministry and opened by the adviser of the health minister,” said an official in the health ministry. He added, “These complaints and suggestions can be addressed so that we can have ideas from people and doctors to make the institution efficient.” In most private hospitals, there is a system of both offline and online feedback. “Any patient who is discharged leaves the hospital with a feedback form so that the system can be improved. The same is for the OPDs as well but such a mechanism is not consistently followed in any public hospital,” said a PGI faculty. For the first time, these boxes will be opened in the Union ministry of health and family welfare office. “Complaints will be dealt with directly so that there is transparency and anyone can approach without fear,” said an official in the ministry. Prior to this, the boxes were opened and things were dealt with internally by the grievance committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-starts-installing-more-suggestion-boxes/articleshow/88307631.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The police also froze about 30 bank accounts having transactions worth Rs 7 crore which, though in names of different persons, was operated by accused Jatin Pala and Mohit Parmar, said police. Pala and Mohit’s handler, Nigerian citizen Rafael Addedio Yinka was also arrested from Mumbai on Wednesday. “It is suspected that the money from the bank accounts was transferred to Nigeria through hawala. We will be questioning Rafael to know where the money was being channelized,” said Jamnagar assistant superintendent of police Nitish Pandey. “This is an organized racket where the accused targetted people in different cities with lure of attractive offers. They cheated them and extorted money from them which they deposited in different accounts of other victims,” Pandey told TOI. The scam was busted following a complaint lodged by Harish Parmar with the Jamnagar city C Division police station last month. Parmar had told police that Jatin and Mohit promised him a job and asked to open a savings and a current account in a bank. Parmar later came to know that the accused duo had opened a bank account in the name of a firm PL Consultants using his documents and made transactions of Rs 40 lakh in the same account. He suspected something fishy and approached the police. During the investigation, police searched Jatin and Mohit’s houses and found cheque books and debits cards of around 30 bank accounts. On scrutinizing the bank accounts police found transactions worth Rs 7 crore in the last three months. All the bank accounts, with a total balance of Rs 24 lakh, have been frozen. The Jamnagar police have identified at least 20 persons who have become victims of the gang in Bangaluru, Delhi and Vadodara. Box: Modus operandi According to police, the gang used to lure traders by offering them oil or chemical products at cheaper rates from foreign companies. The accused introduced the other gang members to the traders as distributors. The advance collected from the traders was deposited in bank accounts opened using somebody else’s documents. In Jamnagar, Jatin and Mohit used to work under the instructions of Nigerian handler Rafael. They used to withdraw the money through ATMs and send it to Mumbai through Angadiya where Rafael received it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nigerian-among-three-held-for-running-pan-india-hawala-racket/articleshow/88305896.cms||---

---||Goa||‘BJP speaks about Ram Rajya but silent on Milind’||Panaji: While BJP pledges to establish Ram Rajya in the country, the party continues to protect politicians who sexually exploit women, Congress said in reference to the recent sex scandal involving BJP MLA Milind Naik. Congress Margao MLA Digambar Kamat told reporters that Naik’s conduct affects the moral fabric of Goan society and such actions should be shown no mercy. Congress had released photographs and audio clips to back their allegations that Naik misused his official position to sexually exploit a woman from Bihar. The former urban development minister was forced to resign from the state cabinet on Wednesday after Congress put all the alleged evidence in the public domain. “On one hand they talk about bringing Ram Rajya in this country and what is this? Every citizen of Goa needs to introspect on this ahead of the elections. How can this be justified and how can the party keep quiet?” Kamat said. He questioned the delay in action against Naik and said that both BJP and chief minister Pramod Sawant should have taken strict action against the Mormugao MLA the moment Congress made the allegations. Sawant on wednesday announced that Naik had tendered his resignation as minister “to ensure a free and fair probe into the alleged sex scandal”, but this is not enough, Congress said. Naik has repeatedly claimed that he is innocent and that Congress is trying to malign him ahead of the coming elections. “BJP says it is a party with a difference, but what is happening and coming out in the open these days it looks like...,” said Kamat, leaving the rest of his thoughts unsaid. “If this had happened in Congress it would have taken a tough decision straight away. There is no question of showing mercy to such people. This affects the moral fabric of the society.” Congress said that Naik’s behaviour is “extremely shameful” and paints Goa in a bad light. Congress asked voters to “introspect” on the incident. “This proves that women are not safe in Goa,” Kamat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-speaks-about-ram-rajya-but-silent-on-milind/articleshow/88327986.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Mandhare and commissioner of police Deepak Pandey on Wednesday inaugurated the week-long Godavari festival, organised jointly by the state archaeology department, district administration and Itihas Sanshodhan Mandal, Nashik. Mandhare and Pandey also inaugurated the exhibition of paintings related to the Godavari river. The collector stressed on the need to make the new generation aware of the city’s heritage like Godavari and other places. He said steps would be taken to put up informative boards at the heritage sites. He will take help from the NMC to put up these boards and the district administration will provide funds for the informative boards in rural areas. Pandey said the city is known for the temples, but the Godavari is an ancient river with a long history. Hence, focus needs to be on the river to boost the tourism of Nashik. He said thousands come to Nashik to take a dip in the holy water of Godavari. As part of the Godavari festival, a series of lectures of experts on various topics related to the Godavari have been planned between December 16 and 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-district-admin-plans-to-conserve-preserve-temples-along-godavari-river/articleshow/88305115.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Dehradun||Rajnath lays foundation stone of Sainya Dham||Dehradun: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday laid the foundation stone of the 'Sainya Dham' in Dehradun to honour the defence personnel of Uttarakhand who sacrificed their lives for the nation, ever since World War I. The project in Guniyalgaon is being built at a cost of Rs 63 crore and stretches across 50 bighas of land. It is set to be completed within the next two years. The entrance gate of the Dham will be named after the country's first chief of defence staff, General Bipin Rawat. The programme held on Wednesday marked the conclusion of the ‘Shaheed Samman Yatra’, which was conducted throughout the state to collect soil from the houses of 1,734 Army heroes. The soil will be used to construct the Dham. "It was not an easy task, bringing the soil of the courtyard of so many brave soldiers to the Sainya Dham. When I was offering flowers to the soil, I applied some on my forehead,” Singh said. The defence minister observed a two-minute silence to pay tribute to Group Captain Varun Singh, who passed away at the Bengaluru Command Hospital on Wednesday due to injuries sustained in a helicopter accident. The accident also caused the death of 13 others, including General Bipin Rawat. The minister met with and honoured the family members of 204 soldiers. "The Dham should not be limited to just one building or memorial. The names of all soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country should be inscribed on its walls. There should also be a facility of paying tributes online so that people from across the country can have access to it,” Singh said. The defence minister also highlighted the work done by his government in Uttarakhand over the past five years. He said that the BJP government resolved the connectivity issue in the state, and removed the blockage on the all-weather road. He added that the road will bring Garhwal and Kumaon closer. Singh also addressed the issue of Indo-Nepal ties. He said, "Some forces are trying to disturb our relationship with Nepal, a country with whom we share the relationship of roti-beti. We will never allow this. If we need to bow our heads, we will do it, but we'll never break our ties with Nepal."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rajnath-lays-foundation-stone-of-sainya-dham/articleshow/88305898.cms||Kautilya Singh

I was bitten on my way to work,” said Rajwinder Singh. The problem is not new for residents in this complex. There are over 500 such residents, including technicians and other paramedical staff of PGI in the affected area. Many letters have been written to PGI to raise the matter with the officials in the UT administration. “But nothing has been done so far. We had apprised the former director about the bad roads, unkempt parks and stray dog menace,” said Subash Chandra, president of the PGI residential complex welfare society. As residents on campus cannot directly complain to the municipal corporation and the PGI administration has no authority to manage stray animals, residents feel their civic issues are neglected. ““There have been cases in the past as well when dogs have attacked residents. We cannot directly approach the municipal corporation as the campus is under PGI, so we ask our administration,” said a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-residents-hassled-by-stray-dog-menace/articleshow/88307634.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Nashik||Now, grape farmers to decide prices for traders||NASHIK: The Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagaitdar Sangh (MRDBS), an association of grape growers, said the grape-growers would decide the rates of grapes as per the variety from next year. Kailas Bhosle, the vice-president of MRDBS said the government has introduced minimum support price (MSP) for most of the produce, but the grapes are still not under MSP. Moreover, the rates are decided by the traders, who buy directly from the farmers. He said the grape farmers have been incurring losses due to unseasonal rains for the past 3 years, and they are not fetching good rates. Hence, we have decided that from January next year, the grape farmers will decide the rate as per the quality and variety. The farmers will not sell grapes below the production cost. The association said that the decision has been taken to help the farmers get a better price for their grapes. They have also asked the government to provide subsidies for importing plastic covers to protect vineyards from the unseasonal rains and hails. The association said that the container freight charges for grape export have been doubled this year from USD 4,000 to USD 8,000 per container. Moreover, the packing material charges have also increased by 30%. The rise in export cost will indirectly hit grape farmers as they would fetch lower rates. Hence, the government needs to give grants of Rs 15 per kg to the farmers. Earlier, the MEIS grant for the export of grapes was 5%, but now, the centre has replaced the MEIS grant with the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) grant for grapes, which is only 3%.

The on-bill financing model is a mechanism in which a utility company enters into an agreement with non-banking financial institutes, energy efficiency services limited, or original equipment manufacturers for the supply of modern energy-efficient appliances to its consumers. The consumers can repay the amount in their monthly bills to facilitate the power utilities to transfer the same to its MoU partners. As per the officials, the consumer would not be burdened as the repayment is largely out of the savings achieved in energy costs. The proposed model for distribution of energy efficient appliances will be a purely voluntary programme. APERC has directed discoms to examine and study the model for implementation in their jurisdictions and submit their views, comments and suggestions within three weeks. The suggestions and views can include the requirement for issuance of new regulations or amendments to existing ones. During a meeting held at the APERC office on Wednesday on the eve of national energy conservation week-2021, APERC chairman Justice C V Nagarjuna Reddy said the APERC is giving priority to enhance energy efficiency in the state in order to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, demand for energy imports and improve the economy. “Energy efficiency is often the most immediate alternative to renewable energy to reduce the usage of fossil fuels,” said Justice Nagarjuna Reddy. The chairman, along with the APERC members Rajagopal Reddy and Thakur Rama Singh, said the commission is striving to develop a consumer-centric approach in the power sector and strike a balance between the interests of consumers and discoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/discoms-asked-to-study-on-bill-financing-to-boost-energy-drive/articleshow/88306692.cms||---
---||Delhi||Probe custodial torture of accused: Delhi court to police||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has directed police to conduct an inquiry into alleged custodial torture of an accused arrested in a robbery case, saying the concerned SHO, placed with the responsibility of “upholding the dignity and liberty of every stakeholder”, had “miserably failed to discharge his duties”. In an order dated December 9, metropolitan magistrate Vaibhav Chaurasia said it was apparent from the medical report of the accused, that he had injuries on both his feet and “fresh marks of beatings”. The court also noted his “partially swollen” left foot and “red marks” on the lower portion of his back. “The accused is still trembling,” the court said, adding that the photographs have been shown to the ACP and Begumpur SHO. The court observed that while it was apparent that the accused was apprehended on December 8, the arrest memo reflected a different date. Further, it said, the investigating officer “consistently changed his version” — he first submitted that the accused was arrested at 3.30am on December 9, but later said the arrest was made at 6.30am the same day. Similarly, the SHO first submitted that the accused was nabbed at 3.30am but later said during interrogation that he was arrested earlier, at 11pm on December 8, said the court. “The SHO has been apprised of the fact that a CCTV is placed at the house of the accused. Therefore, he is supposed to state the truth to the court… This is a clear case of custodial violence… the SHO, placed with the responsibility of upholding the dignity and liberty of every stakeholder, has miserably failed to discharge his duties,” the court noted. The judge pointed to “deliberate omissions on the medico-legal case record”. “The arrest memo states that the accused was apprehended at 6.30am. However, the version of the SHO is different. This is a gross violation of the guidelines passed by the Supreme Court,” he said. The court directed that a medical examination be conducted in the presence of the counsels of the accused as there were “deliberate omissions and injuries have not been recorded fully”. It directed that a copy of the order be sent to the DCP, Rohini district, and also sought a report from the joint commissioner of Delhi Police (northern range) on action to be taken against erring officers. The court also noted that the wife and the mother of the accused had alleged that some police officials had barged into their house when they came to arrest him and molested them. “The complaint has been given to the Begumpur SHO for further action,” the court stated. According to cops, a team from Begumpur police station went to the house of the accused in Rohini on the night of December 8. The accused, they said, locked himself and didn’t open the door despite repeated requests, following which they had to break it down. At this point, police said, a pitbull belonging to the accused started attacking the team. A bystander’s dog entered the premises and a fight ensued. The accused alleged his dog died later after he was wounded. A vigilance inquiry was ordered after a purported video of the incident was shared widely on social media. In the video, a woman can be seen pleading with a group of people to take the pitbull away and spare their pet. Some men also allegedly hurled abuses at the family of the accused. “The police team does not have a pitbull. The dog belonged to another person,” said a senior police official. Police said the accused was involved in a spate of robberies in Begumpur area on Barwala Road and Rs 92,000 in cash was recovered from his house.

The cat underwent surgery on Tuesday to get the pellet removed but, passed away at night. Vaikom police have charged a case under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act against the neighbour, Ramesh Kumar, 50. Police have received the surgery report from the private hospital in Tripunithura, which confirmed that the cat sustained a pellet injury. According to the police, the autopsy report will be added to the charges against the accused person. According to the cat’s owner Sujatha, Chinnu was found injured on Sunday night and was taken to the veterinary hospital in Kottayam on Monday. They had to return home as there was no X-ray facility in the hospital there. On Tuesday, the owner took the cat to a private veterinary hospital in Tripunithura, where doctors surgically removed the pellet. “Doctors told me that there was internal bleeding, and the pellet shot had affected its liver. They gave her medicines and also asked to put her on drip for four days,” she said. However, Chinnu’s health deteriorated by night, and she passed away. Immediately, police were informed and based on their direction, her body was left on the bed itself. On Wednesday morning, police came and took the body for autopsy. The final charges against the accused will be framed based on the autopsy report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cat-shot-at-with-airgun-dies/articleshow/88306694.cms||---

The bridges will provide relief to over 50,000 commuters who travel daily from trans-Gomti region to cis-Gomti areas. Talking to TOI, Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh’s representative Diwakar Tripathi said, “The two bridges on Kukrail are expected to be inaugurated on former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji’s birth anniversary on December 25. Construction of a flyover near Munshipulia is also expected to start soon.” As per UPSBC officials, both bridges have been constructed above Kukrail drain in Sarvodayanagar and Rahimnagar areas respectively. Commuters traveling from Sarvodayanagar, Rahimnagar, Vikasnagar, Aliganj, Kursi Road, Dandaiya, Mahanagar and Gomtinagar will get direct connectivity between these areas after the bridges are thrown open for the public. Both the bridges have already received approval from the traffic police and a No-Objection Certificate from the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) on safety and quality.

Mumbai’s cases didn’t rise as sharply—235 cases were registered on Wednesday as against 217 on the previous day.

Vaikuntha Ekadashi falls on January 13, 2022 and is celebrated with great fervour at all Vaishnav temples and temple authorities are allowing devotees to pass through the ‘vaikunta dwaram,’ a passage to enter into the sanctum sanctorum of the temples. “We had already issued Covid-19 SoP to the executive officers of all the temples — covering nearly 650 temples — including those in Greater Hyderabad and Telangana, during the first wave. We had asked them to follow the ‘no mask-no entry’ for devotees visiting temples and performing sevas and poojas,” a senior endowments department official told TOI. “Similar norms will also be applicable to priests who take part in rituals and deal with heavy crowds of devotees on various occasions,” the official said. The endowments official added that in the wake of the emergence of Omicron variant of Covid-19 in the state and elsewhere, the department has briefed temples on the pandemic SOPs as part of their routine reminders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/endowment-dept-reminds-temples-to-follow-sop/articleshow/88307009.cms||Sunil Mungara

It will be a joint venture with land owners. The logistic park is to be developed within a 1 km radius on both sides of the proposed Surat-Chennai highway. The last date for submission of the expression of interest is December 20. NMC wants to speed up the process before the code of conduct for the civic elections comes into effect. The proposed IT park project is the brainchild of city mayor Satish Kulkarni, who had called a special general body meeting of NMC on the issue last month. The civic body has already identified 15 acres in the Adgaon area of the city for the proposed IT Park. NMC wants more land from the land owners to develop the IT park so that it may attract IT industries and local talent need not go to cities like Pune, Bangalore and Hyderabad. NMC officials said they will develop IT Park in joint venture with the land owners if they get at least 50 acres or more in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation. Apart from IT Park, NMC has also invited bids to develop Logistic Park in joint ventures with the land owners having land of at least 50 acres along the alignment of the proposed Surat-Chennai highway, in the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation particularly near Adgaon area of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-invites-bids-to-develop-it-park/articleshow/88305147.cms||Tushar Pawar

In this birth defect, the brain of the baby was not fully closed through temporal bones. As a result, spinal and brain fluids start accumulating out of the skull posing threat to the life of the baby. The family of the baby resides in Mainpuri. The birth took place in Safai Medical College on September 17. Doctors referred the child to KGMU a day after delivery. Head of paediatric surgery department, KGMU, Prof JD Rawat after examining the baby asked parents to come after two months as he was not fit enough to bear the surgery. Later, after consulting neurology and ophthalmology departments, a team including Prof Rawat and Dr Nipex Tyagi performed the surgery on December 1. “In two-and-a-half-hour surgery, we successfully removed fluid, placed the brain to its usual place and closed the opening. Now, the patient is fine. We will discharge him on Saturday,” said Prof Rawat. “This disorder is found in one child out of 40,000 live births and occurs in cases where women don’t take enough nutrition, especially folic acid and iron during pregnancy. Such a case was successfully operated at our hospital for the first time,” he said. “It was very difficult for them to give anaesthesia to the baby because the gas mask was not fitting due to swelling in the frontal lobe. Experts used cotton to fill gaps in the gas mask to prevent leak,” he said while praising the anaesthesia team. “Though the baby will still need some corrective surgeries in coming days to minimise face deformity, he will now be able to live a normal life,” he said. Vipin Kumar, the father of the baby, thanked doctors. “We had lost all hope, but doctors gave a new life to my child,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/infant-suffering-from-rare-disorder-saved-by-kgmu-doctors-surgery/articleshow/88307253.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Omicron scare: Mask up, Hyderabad priests tell returning devotees||HYDERABAD: As Omicron cases witness a gradual rise in numbers, city priests urge devotees to mask up and follow all Covid-19 protocol while visiting temples — especially during special occasions like New Year, Mukkoti Ekadashi (major event celebrated before Sankranti) and Sankranti. While the footfall at most temples continue to be lower than the pre-Covid-19 period, many have started visiting places of worship after the lockdown was lifted. At the century-old popular Chilkur Balaji temple, for instance, the numbers have dipped by over 50% — from 5,000 devotees to 2,000 during weekends. “But that too is a significant number and, therefore, it is important that people wear their masks and maintain social distancing,” said the temple’s hereditary priest, C S Rangarajan. The temple is now gearing up for Vaikuntha Ekasadshi to allow devotees a passage through the sanctum sanctorum, albeit while abiding with all Covid-19 norms. “All through the pandemic we have strictly followed the Covid-19 standard operating procedure (SoP) issued by the central government and will continue to do so. Chilkur is the first temple in Telangana to stop circumambulations, which has been a practise for many decades. Even now we are not allowing it, ” Rangarajan added, stressing the need for devotees to be careful for the next few months — at least till March, 2022. At other temples too, priests are doing their bit to educate people about the need to wear masks. “Initially, we had started making announcements about the need to wear masks over our PA system. We stopped it only when we realised that people had become more aware and understood that they would not be allowed entry without a mask,” said Sudarshan Shastry, a priest at an Ameerpet temple, while admitting that many are still flouting the norm. “More than not wearing them at all, people are seen wearing it wrong. In most cases they are pulled down to the chin. It is important that this is rectified,” said S Padmanabham, a 60-year-old priest at the Sai Baba temple in Yousufguda. Realising this problem, trustee of the Bhagyalakshmi temple in Old City, Surya Prakash, has not only started distributing masks among devotees turning up at the place of worship but also taken it upon himself to educate them about how to wear it properly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mask-up-say-priests-as-devotees-start-returning-to-temples/articleshow/88306973.cms||Sunil Mungara

The fact that the three cases were detected in Telangana, of whom one further travelled in a domestic flight, and had travelled from non-risk west Asian destinations — Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Doha, shows that many cases may have been going under the radar, health officials said. “We have tested nearly 6000 samples from the 11 high-risk countries landing at the Hyderabad airport of which we found only three RT-PCR positive but not a single person was detected as Omicron positive. On the other hand, we found three during the random sampling of just 200 passengers,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director (public health) Telangana. “Therefore, we cannot label countries as high risk countries and only screen passengers coming in from these countries. We have requested the centre to enforce same norms for all countries,” he added. The doubling rate of the Omicron variant is less than two days in India and the high transmissibility is a cause of concern, he said. Health officials also confirmed that all three passengers detected Omicron positive in Telangana were asymptomatic, which only means that the threat of the spread is high.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-screen-all-foreign-arrivals-for-omicron/articleshow/88307062.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Kids of Narsingi crash victims face uncertain future||HYDERABAD: A week after losing her parents in a drunk driving crash, 11-year-old Chandrika consoles her two-year-old brother Manideep that they will return in the evening bringing loads of snacks. This has been her routine for the past 10 days since the accident took place. Manideep isn’t aware what death even means. The class 5 student is advised by her uncles to be strong for the sake of her two younger brothers. Chandrika’s parents Durgam Raju (35) was a daily wage worker who would deliver milk and newspapers for a living and her mother Durgam Mounika (29) was a volunteer for a local Mahila Sangam group. They were the sole breadwinners of the family. On December 6, Sanjeeva, a resident of Shankarpally, who was heavily inebriated, crashed his SUV into an oncoming scooter near Gandipet, killing both Raju and Mounika on the spot. Durgam Ganesh, Raju’s younger brother explains that they barely had enough money to conduct the last rites and now they are uncertain about the future of the orphaned children. “Not just the children, Raju was working hard, doing several jobs, as he was looking to get me and my second brother Sathish married next year,” Ganesh told TOI. Ironically, Sanjeeva drank excessively on that day to celebrate the birth of his daughter. Since the beginning of this month, at least seven people have died due to drunk driving across Hyderabad and their families remain shattered and helpless. Renamma, Raju’s mother, who has been inconsolable for days, explains that there was a lot of debt that her son had to clear and now, there is little hope for the children to pursue their education. “Both my son and daughter-in-law were the pillars of my family and even in the neighborhood. Despite earning less, they were generous. They always helped his brothers, friends and even unknown people from the neighbourhood,” she recollects. Raju’s cousin Mahesh says there is nothing left behind such as insurance or savings. “They (Raju and Mounika) are just another number added to the long list of people who died due to drunk drive accidents. I hope the government or someone recognises that behind every number there is a haunting image of a suffering family,” Mahesh tells TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kids-of-narsingi-crash-victims-face-uncertain-future/articleshow/88307129.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Khaunte said he was resigning as an MLA of Porvorim in the larger interest of the people of Porvorim and the state. “Politics has been changing drastically in Goa. For instance, a political party comes to Goa and says Khell Zatlo. I don’t think Goa is a toy store and I don’t think we are toys and I will let Goans become any toys. For this, we need to take strong steps in the interest of Goa,” Khaunte said, taking a dig at TMC. Khaunte, who had briefly flirted with Congress before finally moving towards the BJP fold, said: “We know what Congress and other political parties are doing and with the coming of new parties in Goa, political scenario is changing.” But BJP’s North Goa district president Mahanand Asnodkar and Porvorim mandal strongly opposed his entry into the party at meeting convened by party state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and organising secretary Satish Dhond to inform them about the decision to induct Khaunte into BJP. Asnodkar said Khaunte joining BJP will have an adverse impact on the party’s prospects in the upcoming election not only in Porvorim but the entire state. “We don’t do caste politics but the entry of Khaunte will have severe impact on Bahujan community,” he said, hinting at Khaunte’s upper caste status. “Many of our workers have been working for the party for many decades. Khaunte has even called chief minster Pramod Sawant Pappu. Will the same Khaunte now work under Sawant?” he asked. “Khaunte must have got a washing machine from outside the country to clean himself before joining BJP,” he said. Asnodkar also alleged that Khaunte has harassed BJP workers and it would be difficult for them to work for him. “I have full faith in BJP karyakartas that they will not only vote against Khaunte but also convince others not to vote for him to defeat him,” he said. Asnodkar said senior state BJP functionaries understand their issues, but they claim that they have pressure from the “top”. “All party workers were told to provide a candidate from within the party and they will work towards getting him elected. There can be more than one aspirant, but Khaunte is not from our party,” Asnodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-resigns-as-mla-set-to-join-bjp-tomorrow/articleshow/88307284.cms||Murari Shetye

Several of his supporters attended the meeting and former councillor and BJP Mormugao block president Sanjay Satardekar and Mormugao Municipal Council chairperson Damodar Kaskar were among those present. Kaskar said that they have gathered to tell people that the allegations levelled against Naik were baseless, and that they trust him. “We are with Naik,” he said. “We condemn the dirty politics played by Congress vice president Sanklap Amonkar. Public accusations can destroy someone’s personal life,” Satardekar said at the meeting. He said that party workers and people have been calling them ever since Amonkar named Naik publicly. “Since it was not possible to answer each call and explain, the public meeting has been called,” Satardekar said. Councillor Leo Rodrigues said the accusations made against Naik were nothing but election propaganda. Naik, on Wednesday said that he resigned to ensure a free and fair probe, and that the allegations made against him were baseless.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/trust-milind-say-supporters-at-public-meet/articleshow/88328061.cms||---

Close to 100 employees in Ludhiana and 350 in Punjab are participating in this strike, which will continue till December 17 and if by then the government did not accept their demands, they will proceed on indefinite mass casual leave from December 20. The department’s offices bore a deserted look on Wednesday. Works, like issuance of RCs, assessments, refunds, road checking, issuance of pass and permits for distilleries, breweries and bottling plants, will remain suspended and only the vehicles already detained will be cleared during the three-day pen-down strike. The SOA and ETO association want their two major issues—lower pay-scales and alleged harassment by the vigilance bureau (VB)—addressed. They also alleged that they were being given step-motherly treatment by the government as no action was taken against injustice meted out to the excise and taxation officers by the VB. Meanwhile, the city businessmen want the state government to break the deadlock and talk to the employees to make the department function smoothly. Rajkumar Singla, president of fasteners’ suppliers’ association, said, “The strike of the senior officers and ETOs will affect the day-to-day functioning and offer a setback to the businessmen. The situation will worsen if the employees proceed on mass leave. Therefore, it is our request to the state government that it should schedule a meeting with the office-bearers and resolve the issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/excise-taxation-officials-start-three-day-pen-down-strike/articleshow/88305947.cms||Mohit Behl

The scheme, rolled out by the government on October 21, has managed to address 29 lakh consumers. Till November 30, the scheme had benefited 22 lakh consumers. The 100% waiver on surcharge is meant for consumers having electricity load upto 2 kilo watt (KW). These consumers have also been allowed to pay their arrears in six installments. The 50% rebate on surcharge is applicable in case of consumers having electricity load more than 2KW and up to 5KW. Consumers can pay their arrears at various divisional/sub-divisional offices. In rural areas, they can do so at the Common Service Centres. Consumers can also log in to www.upenergy.in to take an online route. UP Power Corporation Ltd chairman, M Devraj reiterated that MDs of various distribution companies need to ensure that maximum number of consumers avail benefit of the scheme.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Pirotan Island in Jamnagar likely to reopen for public soon||RAJKOT: In good news for wildlife enthusiasts, the Pirotan Island in Jamnagar — known for its rich marine biodiversity — may be reopened for the general public in near future. The islands have been off limits for visitors for the last four and half years due to security reasons. However, the forest department is planning to frame guidelines and throw open the island for the public again. The easternmost island in the Marine National Park, Pirotan is spread over an area of 3 square kilometres. The island, which gets partly submerged during high tide, is located 12km from the coast in the Gulf of Kutch. Pirotan was the only island near Jamnagar’s Bedi and Rozi port where visitors were allowed. Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) is handling the island’s port. Safety of the visitors remains a focal point of the plans to reopen the island, forest officials said. The island is cut-off from the mobile network, there’s no electricity and also no food availability. Marooned due to high tide, which submerges part of the island, a visitor can get stranded here in absence of a trained guide and adequate knowledge about the local environment. Also, at present there is no mechanism to raise an alarm in case of an emergency. R Senthil, deputy conservator of forest, Marine National Park, said that the island will be open to the public once the safety guidelines are approved by higher authorities. “We will prepare guidelines in coordination with agencies like Indian Coast Guard, GMB, Police and district administration to allow visitors considering all the safety aspects,” Senthil said. The coast guard will come into picture in case a rescue operation is needed while GMB’s jetty will be required for visitors to board the ship. The district administration’s overall monitoring is also required. According to forest officials, the district administration is currently busy in conducting the gram panchayat elections. Once the polls get over the guidelines will be prepared. Pirotan Island near Bedi, Rozi and Nava port of Jamnagar is a treasure trove of marine life. Apart from a lot many species of crabs, the island is home to sea scorpions, sea snakes, octopus, sea worms and other marine creatures. Sea birds like pelicans and gulls among others add to the biodiversity of the island. The visitors were prohibited after complaints of several intrusions were received a few years back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/pirotan-island-likely-to-reopen-for-public-soon/articleshow/88305956.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kolkata||Perform or perish, CM Mamata Banerjee tells Trinamool councillors||KOLKATA: Sending out a “work-or-perish” message to councillors, chief minister Mamata Banerjee promised a transparent and responsive civic administration, seemingly confident of Trinamool’s victory in the KMC civic polls slated for Sunday. She pointed out the entire administration was moving towards online sanction, including for building plans, and citizens would no longer have to run from pillar to post to get permissions—be it for water supply, electricity or construction of their own homes. In her first public meeting ahead of the civic polls, Banerjee on Wednesday said, “One day, some neighbours came to me and complained about a tap water pipeline not working. They told me they had complained to the local councillor long ago. I called the councillor and told him why would he hold the post if I have to do his job.” She was speaking at a meeting in Phoolbagan. “A councillor should not force developers to take building materials from him when they build houses in the area. He should not determine how much money the builder has to fork out before he gives the go-ahead. We didn’t give ticket to such a councillor this time,” she said. Turning to urban development and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim, she added, “We have to go in for online sanctions soon. This shift will happen gradually and all such permissions will be given within six days.” Banerjee wants councillors to be “friends in need”. “A councillor has to reach out to residents whenever there is a problem in the area. She or he has to check whether street lights are functioning properly or not and spot problems in drinking water pipelines. MPs and MLAs do not have the time to look into neighbourhood issues. Councillors will have to perform their duties. They will have to perish if they cannot perform,” the CM said. With an eye on slum dwellers, who comprise a substantial population of the city, Banerjee said: “Earlier, those living in slums could not build dwelling units. We gave them residence certificates under Thika Tenancy Act. Now, we will build apartments on government land and give two-room flats to each of them. Councillors have to see these people get accommodation in these flats,” the CM said. Aware of water-logging problems in some areas, Banerjee promised to set up 200 drainage pumping stations. “The city had a record rainfall this time as an after-effect of the series of cyclones. Some people staged a dharna within two days of Cyclone Amphan hitting Bengal, complaining they had no electricity. I went to the CESC office and they brought people from Rajasthan to restore supply,” she said. The CM also told the gathering about the new water project at Palta and the overhaul of Tala Waterworks to address drinking water woes in some areas. She said the new flyovers would make commute easier. Banerjee ended her meeting with the beautification of Kolkata under Trinamool-run KMC: “Anyone coming from other states appreciate the change the city has undergone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/perform-or-perish-mamata-tells-trinamool-councillors/articleshow/88306723.cms||Rohit Khanna

A magistrate court had on November 23 directed the registration of the FIR on the complaint. Patra had challenged the order before a sessions court. Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Sharma stayed the order till January 10, 2022. The complaint had alleged that the fabricated video was published on social media with an intent to cause provocation against the chief minister of Delhi amongst the farmers, who repose strong faith in him. It had further stated that the alleged doctored video also maligned the reputation of the CM and was also purported to cause provocation, leading to a situation of rioting in the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/interim-stay-on-order-for-fir-against-patra/articleshow/88307267.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Environmental engineer caught taking bribe||KOTTAYAM: An environmental engineer was caught red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 at his office on Wednesday, said the officials of the vigilance wing of police. The officials said district environmental engineer Harees A M had demanded a sum of Rs 25,000 from the owner of a tyre retreading unit in Pravithanam near Pala for renewing the firm’s non-pollution certificate. The application for renewing the licence was submitted before the Kottayam district pollution control board and Harris was delaying the issuance of the certificate, said police. The company owner filed a complaint with industries minister P Rajeeve during an adalat. The minister, who found that the case was genuine, directed the officials concerned to issue the certificate. But even after the minister’s directive there was no progress on the matter and on December 10, the company owner had gone to meet Harees at his office. Since he was not in the office, he contacted him over the phone, who told him to come to his office on December 13. During their conversation, the official demanded a bribe in return for issuing the certificate. The company owner informed the police about the official’s demand and the vigilance wing of the police laid a trap to nab Harees. Currency notes were laced with phenolphthalein powder. As the company owner handed over the money to the official, the officials from the vigilance wing nabbed him and recorded his arrest. The police said that a former environmental engineer of the same office had also demanded Rs 1 lakh from the company owner. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/environmental-engineer-caught-taking-bribe/articleshow/88306726.cms||---

The husband was sitting next to her in the car. The accident occurred around 5.30am when the woman, on noticing a two-wheeler coming from the opposite direction, panicked and pressed the accelerator instead of applying the brakes. The car steered off the road and fell into a nearby well.

---||Delhi||Failing to set a benchmark: Kamla Nagar market traders foil pedestrianisation experiment||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s attempt to revive the pedestrianisation project in Kamla Nagar market after conducting a trial run by restricting traffic and parking a 200-metre length of Kohlapur Road hasn’t gone down well with the traders. On Wednesday, as soon as the civic body installed colourful benches on both sides of the road for the convenience of shoppers, irked shopkeepers gathered in protest and removed them. And while the corporation officials claimed they were in contact with the market association, business owners themselves argued that the benches hindered the passage of shoppers and that the corporation had made no effort to remove the unauthorised hawkers who had eaten up pavement space. An official said, “Though the benches were installed amid miscommunication with junior staff, we are keeping everyone in the loop regarding the trial pedestrianisation of a 200-m stretch. We had held meetings with the traders to fix times for them to load or unload their supplies and on other issues. We are also talking to other government agencies for support.” Kamla Nagar Market Association president Nitin Gupta, however, pointed out that the shop owners had agreed to trail run consequent to the removal of the illegal hawkers and encroachments and shifting of vehicles parked on the road. “The corporation is ignoring our demands and initiating the trial run with doing the groundwork,” said Gupta. Pointing out how the municipal body’s action evoked a contrary response, a shopkeeper smirked, “As soon as the benches were installed, hawkers sat on them. We fear that it will be these vendors, rather than shoppers, who will permanently use the benches. That is why we urged the corporation staff to immediately remove them.” Traders said that they are not against the project or the trial and would willingly not park their vehicles on the section, but said the hawkers had to be tackled first. A corporation official countered that everyone’s interest had to be safeguarded under the Street Vendors Act, 2014. “Eventually, of course, we will allow only authorised vendors holding vending certificates to be present. Till then the shopkeepers need to cooperate with us,” the official said. Jogi Ram Jain, chairman of the civic body’s standing committee, claimed to have carried out anti-encroachment drives at the market in the past. He also said he had called a meeting with the traders to discuss it. In December 2019, the north corporation kick-started its pedestrianisation and parking management project at Kamla Nagar and turned Mandelia Road, Maharaja Agrasen Marg and Gali No. 7 into no-parking zones. But shortage of funds halted the exercise. The market with Lajpat Nagar III in south Delhi and Krishna Nagar in east Delhi were to have been developed as models for parking management.

The traders said the island would lead to traffic jams, especially during the peak hours, and their businesses could suffer. NMSCDCL is proposing to beautify the Raviwar Karanja chowk. With an aim to increase the size of the traffic island in the middle of the junction, some area around the existing junction has been enclosed to assess the movement of vehicular traffic around it. This exercise has been underway since Saturday. Since the enclosed area occupies a huge portion of the junction, a section of traders are opposing the island plan. Senior officials of NMSCDCL said the trial run would continue for a few more days. At the end of the trial, suggestions and objections would be taken into consideration. NMSCDCL is planning to increase the size of the existing traffic island so that the circular movement of vehicular traffic around it is more disciplined, said Sumant More, CEO of NMSCDCL. On Wednesday, the size of the enclosed area was reduced marginally, which has given some more space for movement of vehicular traffic, added More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traders-oppose-big-traffic-island-at-raviwar-karanja-in-nashik-city/articleshow/88305169.cms||Santosh Sonawane

But I’m yet to receive it,” assistant teacher Annu Srivastava told TOI. Principal, Baba Thakur Das Inter College, Sudham Chandwani told TOI that Annu’s salary was stopped following orders from the secondary education department. “The department had set up an inquiry. There were allegations that procedures were not followed in her appointment. The Supreme Court, however, found that the due process was followed in the appointment.” She added that after the SC order, the process is underway to release her salary. District inspector of schools, Lucknow, Amarkant Singh said they have already written to the department to release the salary and are awaiting its nod. Srivastava joined the college in July 2013. She filed a writ petition after her salary was stopped in December 2013. On November 15, 2018, she got relief from the high court when it directed the DIOS to ensure payment of salary to the petitioner month by month regularly in as much as arrears of salary, with effect from December 2013 till the date of passing of this order within two months. The secondary education department, however, filed an appeal beyond time. The high court rejected the delay condonation application and dismissed the appeal. Thereafter, UP government filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. Dismissing the SLP against the HC order , a bench of Justice R Subhash Reddy and Justice Hrishikesh Roy on September 23 directed the secondary education department to pay the salary to the respondent.

Setting aside the conviction order of the CBI court in Dehradun, a division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma, while pronouncing the verdict, said there was no concrete evidence against Preneet Bhati. The order came on an appeal filed by Preneet Bhati challenging his conviction. The bench, while dismissing the petition filed by Nitish Bhati for enhancement of Preneet Bhati’s sentence, said CBI was unable to collect sufficient evidence against him and the pieces of evidence collected were self-contradictory. The high court had earlier acquitted former MP DP Yadav, Lakkar Pal and Karan Yadav. The case dates back to September 13, 1992, when Ghaziabad MLA Mahendra Bhati was shot dead and a murder case was registered against DP Yadav, Preneet Bhati, Karan Yadav and Pal Singh alias Lakkar Pala. On February 15, 2015, the CBI court in Dehradun had sentenced the four convicts to life imprisonment.

---||Hyderabad||Revenue staff scouting for land to house MLA camp offices||Hyderabad: Revenue officials have started scouting for land in the core city for construction of camp offices for MLAs in each of the 15 assembly constituencies in Hyderabad district. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has decided that every MLA should have a camp office in his/her constituency where people could meet their elected representative and get their grievances solved. At least 500 square yards of government land, without any dispute, is needed for construction of a camp office in each constituency. As the cost of the land is high in the city and identification of 500 square yards of undisputed government land is not easy, revenue divisional officers of Secunderabad and Hyderabad have been given the task of coordinating with local legislators to zero in on the sites. An MLA from the city, who attended the meeting convened by roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashant Reddy, said these camp office buildings would be in addition to the MLA quarters allotted to the legislators in the city. “In the first phase, construction of MLA camp offices was taken up in the state, except Hyderabad core city, and construction of nearly 90 camp office buildings has been completed. Now, the focus is on the city and the search for suitable land has begun,” the MLA added. By next meeting, the minister wanted clean sites without any disputes to be identified in all the 15 assembly constituencies. The date of the next meeting would be announced shortly. The TRS government wants to start construction at the earliest. Each camp office would be a ground plus one floor building with a spacious chamber for legislator, meeting-cum-conference room, waiting hall, personal secretary office room and front office and resting space for MLA. TRS MLA from Amberpet assembly constituency Kaleru Venkatesh, who attended the meet, told TOI: “The camp office in each constituency is a good idea as it will be a daily meeting point for the people to meet their MLA. As legislators, we can fix our timings to meet people.” Hyderabad: Though All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MLA Ahmed Bin Abdullah Balala said their party has urged the state government to allot government land for construction of school buildings, women empowerment and youth employment training centres among other such facilities instead of MLA camp offices as all its legislators already have their offices, sources said the government’s idea was to have government-owned MLA camp office in every assembly constituency for the convenience of the public. The AIMIM’s proposal would be taken to the notice of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for a final call. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revenue-staff-scouting-for-land-to-house-mla-camp-offices/articleshow/88306730.cms||Roushan Ali

---||Kolkata||BJP slogs to retain its bastion in trading hub||KOLKATA: BJP is slogging hard to retain its bastion in Burrabazar, which bucked the go-green trend the last two civic poll. Even in the May 2021 assembly polls, Trinamool did manage to win Jorasanko but it trailed in four out of the 11 wards there, including 22, 23 and 42. In civic elections, BJP had taken a lead in six to seven wards there—with a population of more than 1,80,000 people. But BJP now faces the challenge of retaining them. These wards, most of which comprise the trading hubs and are populated by the non-Bengali speaking population, are located in and around Burrabazar, covering Posta, Kalakar Street, Ganesh Talkies, Harrison Road, Mahatma Gandhi Road,Canning Street, Rabindra Sarani, Colootola, New CIT Road, Lalbazar, BrabourneRoad and parts of Dalhousie. Trinamool is concentrating on at least four wards—22, 23, 42 and 45—three of which are with BJP and one with Santosh Pathak of Congress. “We have arranged for free vaccination for locals. Now even voters from other areas come there to get their jabs. Ward 42 did not have a health centre and we made one in a dharamshala. Sanitary pads are distributed among the poor,” said Vivek Gupta, Trinamool MLA from Jorasanko. In 2010, when Trinamool won the KMC from the Left, the party failed to win in wards 21, 22, 23, 42, 18 and 45. In 2015, even though it won more wards than that in 2010, it still lost wards 22, 23, 42, 43 and 45. The Congress candidate, who won from Ward 43, later joined the Trinamool.  “Most candidates in the last two polls were not residents here. Communication became a problem in some wards,” said a Trinamool leader in central Kolkata. But this time, senior party functionaries have taken charge of campaign and poll management. “All candidates are residents of the area who are familiar with the locals and their grievances,” said Gupta. The party is hoping to cash in on the steps the Trinamool government has taken for the Hindi-speaking population. “We have got a Hindi university. We have also repaired 120 state and KMC schools in the ward and reopened three hospitals,” said Gupta. But some said BJP had a traditional support base in certain areas that might pose a challenge to Trinamool candidates. “I have been a councillor for almost 25 years only because people have faith in me. I live in the ward and am always available,” said Ward 22 BJP candidate Meena Devi Purohit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-slogs-to-retain-its-bastion-in-trading-hub/articleshow/88306732.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The video which went viral shows a man in Tamil Nadu’s Perambalur trying to save an unconscious monkey by giving it CPR. The monkey is first seen on a tree and then the video shows the animal lying unconscious and the man blowing air into the monkey’s mouth directly after pressing his chest to revive his breathing and heartbeat. After it wakes up, he is shown readying to go to hospital. Seeing the video, renowned US virologist and pathologist Prof Brian Hjelle tweeted cautioning against such acts of affection as all macaques have herpes encephalitis. “I’m still disturbed by that tweet yesterday where that super-nice man was giving CPR, mouth to mouth to a wounded macaque. That man is probably doomed to die of a lethal herpes encephalitic due to #Bvirus. Most macaque have it. Extremely dangerous practice by this nice man. Never Ever handle, mix spit with wild primates. #BVirus is lethal to humans and super-common in macaques,” he tweeted. Echoing similar concerns, veterinarians are asking pet owners not to indulge in any such contact where the saliva or body fluid is exposed into human body. “Macaques are common monkeys which closely share human habitats. They harbor the virus with no signs, but can offer it to anybody who is vulnerable. We have been warning people not to feed or go near monkeys found in many public places,” said Dr Nanda Kumar, state vice-president, Indian veterinary association. “We have to be very cautious while handling pets. There’s no denying that his gesture was very touching and his efforts to revive it were very good. However, CPR is administered differently for animals. In the hospital setting, we would use a tube. We do the chest resuscitation with counts but even in case of dogs and cats, which are supposed to have very less zoonotic diseases, we use the hand as a pipe to blow air. But these days it is not done,’ said Dr Kishore Kumar, a veterinarian in Kochi. He said that the practical risk of doing such a thing is that it could bite you because it does not know what you are doing. “That’s why when we are treating or reviving wild animals, we give the medicine and move far away,” said Dr Kishore. Veterinarians expressed concern about the kind of close interaction seen among pet owners especially when they are with exotic pets. They advise extreme caution with people handling tortoises and iguanas which are found in many homes as pets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pet-revival-with-cpr-docs-warn-of-zoonoses/articleshow/88306750.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Travel companies claimed that the sudden Omicron scare has put on hold travel plans of many. However, those associated with tourism also believe that the fares for New Year would rise because there is a section of people eager to travel but has decided to wait until the last moment to book the tickets. If one looks at the fares (see graphics), the prices from Pune to Goa, Delhi, Jaipur and Srinagar for December 30, is 40% to 60% lesser compared to the fares in 2019 when the pandemic was unheard of. “Not just 2019, the fares are even lesser by around 25% compared to 2020. Travelling was in its peak between October 2020 and January 2021 before the second wave hit India. This year, too, travelling has been decent since August but it dipped suddenly from early December because of the new variant,” a city-based travel company representative said. A glaring example is a one-way fare to Goa this year, which is somewhere between Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,600 during Christmas and New Year’s eve. “It is unusual considering Goa is a tourist hotspot during this time of the year. I remember paying Rs 15,600 one-way fare from Pune to Goa in 2019. After seeing the current price trend, I am tempted to book tickets immediately but my family has asked me to wait,” said Saransh Khairnar, a resident of Balewadi and a working professional. Travel agents said at present many people were not sure whether or not they should travel because of the looming dangers of Omicron. Aviation analyst Dhairyashil Vandekar said there is a lot of hullabaloo about the new variant, which has given rise to hesitancy.  “Travellers are not sure what new restrictions and which state will suddenly come up with new travel norms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/airfares-from-pune-fly-low-in-run-up-to-new-year/articleshow/88306734.cms||Joy Sengupta

It will begin functioning from Monday. ‘Let’sTalk - Vangda amhi ulovya chala boluya’ has been launched with the intention of helping families settle their disputes without taking recourse to litigation. As a family discord leads to multiple litigation causing further distress, the pre-litigation centre will also cater to matrimonial as well as disputes relating to senior citizens.

The lake has been declared a wetland for being critically significant for its ecosystem services and biodiversity values to the local communities. Developmental activities within the wetland as well as within its zone of influence will now be regulated, after the lake has been notified a wetland. Around 1.3 lakh sqm of area will be covered under the zone of influence of the Saulem wetland. Last month, public suggestions and objections were called and decided, which paved the way for Saulem’s notification as a wetland. “All the pre-existing ownership rights and privileges pertaining to identified and notified wetlands will be maintained. Further, no pre-existing ownership rights or property will be transferred to Goa State Wetland Authority as a part of this notification. The status quo of the existing ownership of the notified property will be maintained,” the notification states. In November, Goa got its first six official wetlands under the new central government norms. They were Xeldem lake and Nanda lake in Quepem, Toyyar lake in Chimbel, Dashi lake in Revora, Sarzora lake in Chinchinim, and Cottambi lake. Once an area is declared a wetland, any polluting or encroachment activities that are detrimental to this ecosystem are prohibited in the area, including setting up or expansion of any industry, disposal or handling of any construction waste, solid waste dumping, discharge of untreated wastes, among others. Encroachment or any construction of a permanent nature except for boat jetties will also be disallowed from notified wetland areas. However, any traditional fishing activities in the wetlands will be allowed to continue and water from the wetland will be pumped for the use of locals, if required. Planting of any indigenous trees will also be permitted, provided they are suitable to the ecosystem. Thirty-five major water bodies have been identified in the state in all — with the help of the National Institute of Oceanography — which can qualify to be declared as wetlands. Apart from the seven waterbodies notified until now as wetlands, at least 13 others are in the final stages of being declared as wetlands. These include Bondvoll lake, Parra lake, Banastarim lake, Vodle tollem and Dhakte tollem in Benaulim, Sapu tollem in Velim and Maimollem lake in Mormugao, and Curca lake and Canturlim, Malebhat and Gawali-Moula waterbodies in Curca.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pilernes-saulem-lake-is-states-7th-notified-wetland/articleshow/88286710.cms||---

City ministers Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Mohd Mahmood Ali, P Sabita Indra Reddy and Ch Malla Reddy along with TRS MPs, MLAs and MLCs held a meeting with corporators on Wednesday. BJP corporators had recently attacked the mayor’s office, demanding GHMC council meeting be convened to discuss various civic issues. In vew of the recent incident and considering strength of BJP in the civic body, TRS has decided to work out a strategy to counter the saffron party. “The party corporators should highlight the Centre’s non-cooperation in handing over defence land in Secunderabad Cantonment for road expansion. People have been facing problems due to congested roads,” minister Srinivas Yadav told the corporators. Chevella MP G Ranjit Reddy said corporators should be prepared with full information not only about their respective municipal division, but also the TRS government’s schemes and city development programmes. “We also faced problems in Parliament as first-time MPs. Since many of you are first-time corporators, there will be some problems initially, but it should not be a major issue,” the MP said. Srinivas Yadav said TRS government had spent thousands of crores on strategic road development plan and nala development, road projects and construction of flyovers. Also, at one go Rs 3,000 crore was released for construction of sewerage treatment plants and purchasing Swachh Autos for improvement of sanitation. “Corporators have to highlight all developmental works in the upcoming council meeting,” the city in charge minister said.  A coordination committee has been constituted with 10 corporators on working out a strategy in the council meeting and hold a meeting with city MLAs and corporators every two months||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-draws-up-plan-to-counter-bjp-in-ghmc-council/articleshow/88306739.cms||Koride Mahesh

The incident took place in the middle of two checkposts of traffic police.Victim Rinku Gupta, 45, of Gurbagh Colony, Jeevan Nagar, said in his police complaint, “I was going to Kesarganj Mandi, a wholesale market of grocery items, on my two-wheeler when two men on a bike stopped me for asking the direction towards Sherpur Chowk. As I jammed on the brakes, another bike stopped near me. One of the riders of the second bike took out a pistol and pressed it against my abdomen. He asked me to hand over to them the cash I was carrying. When I refused, he hit me twice with the pistol. Thereafter, he snatched my cash bag. While fleeing, they also took away my two-wheeler keys.” Both the bikes had no registration number plates, he added. Rinku said he made a call to the police control room, but they took almost 30 minutes to reach the spot. “Even as checkposts were set up by the traffic police 500 metres from the spot, the cops did not stop the bikes that had no number plates,” he added. Focal Point police station SHO inspector Sukhjit Singh said, “We are scanning the footage of the CCTVs installed near the spot. Rinku’s statements is being recorded after which an FIR will be lodged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/four-bikers-rob-trader-at-gunpoint/articleshow/88305969.cms||---

However, many private schools in the city have decided to postpone the reopening to the first Monday of January. According to the school management, their Christmas vacations have either started or will start next week, which means even if they begin the school on Thursday, there would hardly be five-six days of classes left before the school again closes for the vacation. Pune zilla parishad primary education officer Anil Gunjal said that since the school reopened on December 6 for Std I onwards, the attendance has gone up to 80% from 50% on day 1. Most CICSE and CBSE affiliated schools also have decided to reopen from their primary classes in January. Rajendra Singh, president of Independent English Schools Association (IESA) said about 247 schools in PMC and PCMC have decided to reopen from January 3. “We had a discussion on Tuesday with the other office-bearers. When schools reopen, there are certain protocols to be followed. Since we already have reopened for higher classes, following the same safety protocols for lower classes is not a problem. However, we need to conduct meetings with parents, get their consent and plan the timetable according to who will attend online and who all will attend the classes offline. It will take 3-4 days. So even if we decide to reopen from Monday, there will just be a day or two before the schools again shut for Christmas break. Hence, we decided to reopen from January 3,” he added. Singh said many parents are looking forward to sending their kids. PCMC education officer Smita Gaud said that there are 128 primary schools which will reopen on Thursday. “We had a meeting on Wednesday with all the headmasters. They have said they will reopen and follow all safety protocols. All our staff, teaching and non-teaching, are 100% vaccinated,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/primary-classes-start-today-pvt-schools-to-wait-till-jan-3/articleshow/88306741.cms||Ardhra Nair

Jagan, a 1995-batch officer who is currently waiting for a posting, earlier worked with the enforcement wing of HMDA. He also worked as SHO of OU and Begumpet police stations. Based on a complaint by B Koteswara Rao, managing partner of Prajapati Constructions and Developers, a case of Registered Crime Others was booked against Jagan and private security guard B Ramu in November by the ACB.  DSP Jagan demanded Rs 4 lakh bribe from the complainant to overlook deviations in apartments constructed by him at Mallampet village in Dundigal municipality. Part of the bribe, Rs 2 lakh, was accepted by Jagan through Ramu, said an ACB official.  Talking to media personnel at her home in Habsiguda late on Wednesday night, DSP Jagan's wife Laxmi alleged that ACB case and the searches were a result of Jagan not doing official favours to an ACB officer. “The gold they found at home belongs to me and our relatives who came for a wedding. Other than this house which we built with both our salaries, we do not have any other property," said Laxmi, who is also a police official. A locker in SBI’s Habsiguda branch is yet to be opened and ACB is still working on the alleged disproportionate assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bribery-case-accused-produced-before-court/articleshow/88306746.cms||---

Transporters said they are stumped by the sudden decision to re-open primary schools in the Pune Municipal Corporation areas. Owners of school vans and buses said their vehicles needed the RTO passing and maintenance and they wanted at least 25 days to get their full fleet operational. “Schools too are not prepared. Most will close for Christmas and open after January 4.Our buses were off the roads and without maintenance since last year, and getting them back on the road will take time,” Raju Latamble, owner of Tej Travels, who has a fleet of 250 school buses in Pune,said. A large section of his fleet was in queue for RTO fitness certificates and maintenance reports. “Earlier, the schools were to open on December 15, but it was postponed due to the Omicron variant. Before this too, there have been several date changes giving us no proper time to prepare. Secondly, diesel prices are high and plying buses as per the old rates is almost impossible for us. We have sought an overall hike of at least 35% to 40% in the fares,” Latamble added. Another transporter, who has 10 school buses, said that getting their drivers and woman bus attendants back on duty was a challenge. “Most left and found other sources of income. They need a guarantee about their jobs with us and at least two months’ pay in advance. Buses will not be able to ply in the existing rates. Moreover, there are a large number of schools who haven’t contacted us,” the transporter added. A Kondhwa-based mother of two school-going kids said that she would like to wait before sending her children to school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transporters-count-losses-hesitant-about-pupils-trips/articleshow/88306748.cms||Joy Sengupta

They handed over a memorandum expressing their objections. Pointing out to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s assurances, of giving preference to loyal and sincere party workers while deciding on tickets, they also referred to party observer P Chidambaram’s statements that the candidates will be selected from among names sent by respective block Congress committees. They insisted that the ticket be given to only those whose names have been sent by the Sanguem Congress Block Congress Committee. Listing out the reasons for their objections to Gaonkar being allotted a ticket, the Sanguem party workers termed the MLA as “unreliable” and “irresponsible” who tends to “change his decisions after fulfilling his greed.” Pointing out to his dalliance with BJP government after contesting against the Congress alliance candidate in the 2017 polls, the Sanguem party workers said Gaonkar was a puppet in the hands of Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai and MGP MLA Ramkrishna Dhawalikar, who were also a part of the BJP-led alliance government “and was dancing to their tunes.” Recently Gaonkar pledged his support to TMC, days before he had emerged at the meeting with Rahul Gandhi alongwith GFP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dont-give-gaonkar-ticket-say-sanguem-congress-workers/articleshow/88307329.cms||---

Police sources said they had evidence to prove all the accused were present at the spot when the attack was carried out.

Towards the end of May, 2015, Tewari was arrested. The trial began in 2017 and the court recorded the statements of 33 witnesses. The trial ended on September 12, 2019, with the order being passed within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-move-hc-against-tewari-acquittal/articleshow/88306756.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Nagpur||Where is my Omicron positive report, asks Nagpur’s only new variant patient||NAGPUR: The first thing Arvind Patre, 40-year-old resident of Dighori, was looking for was his Omicron positive report on getting discharge from AIIMS Nagpur on Wednesday morning. TOI does not reveal the identity of any Covid positive person, unless expressly so desired by the patient. The city’s first and only Omicron patient detected so far, stressing that his name be revealed, questioned the basis for declaring him Omicron patient without showing or sharing with him a confirmed genome sequencing report like the RT-PCR positive result. On December 12, the state public health department, in a press statement, had confirmed that a 40-year-old man, who returned from Burkina Faso in West Africa, had tested positive for the Omicron variant in Nagpur. The new strain has been declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). “Am I being targeted? My company has refused to sanction me paid leave. Unless I submit the Omicron report, I won’t get the paid leave. Who is going to pay me for the loss?” he said. Patre said since the day the news flashed, he had been asking about the genome study report, but no one has so far even showed it to him. He also accused the civic officials of allegedly harassing him, family members and neighbours. “We feel humiliated. They came with cops to my home when they confirmed me as Omicron patient. We had cooperated the first time, and had no problem with another test. Yet, they brought the cops leaving my mother and wife scared,” he said. Patre said the civic administration has been unfair to him and family. “I didn’t meet anyone, but they claimed I had met 17 to 18 people in the locality. I was at home and didn’t contact anyone. They also disclosed my name to some local TV channels. Everyone became aware of my identity, hence I no more want to hide my name,” he said. The Omicron-recovered patient said there was no heavy dose treatment except for some vitamin pills. “I asked the hospital about the Omicron positive report, but they didn’t give. I shall consider myself negative if I don’t get the report,” he said.

Meanwhile, after actor Sanjay Kapoor’s wife Maheep, her daughter Shanaya too has tested positive. Shanaya took to social media on Wednesday to post her symptoms are mild. Kareena Kapoor, Maheep Kapoor and a few others had attended a gathering at filmmaker Karan Johar’s residence last week. Meanwhile, civic officials who had collected more than 100 swabs from residents of the buildings where Kareena Kapoor, Johar, actor Amrita Arora and actor Sohail Khan’s wife Seema Khan live, unsealed the societies on Wednesday after all the samples tested negative. A senior civic official said they received the positive report of Kareena Kapoor’s house help on Wednesday. “We will be checking on their health till the time they are in isolation. Apart from these high-risk contacts, we also tested 108 people from four buildings of actor Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Arora, filmmaker Karan Johar and Seema Khan and all tested negative,” said the official, adding actors Alia Bhatt and Malaika Arora who were at Johar’s home tested negative. Officials are trying to reach designer Manish Malhotra who was at Johar’s home too for his health status. When contacted, Vinayak Vispute, BMC assistant municipal commissioner, H-West Ward, confirmed the BMC has unsealed the buildings. Johar took to social media on Wednesday where he put out a note which read: “My family and I and everyone at home have done their RTPCR tests and with the grace of God we are all negative. In fact, I tested twice just to be safe and am negative. I truly appreciate the grandest efforts of the BMC to ensure the safety of our city. Salute to them. To some members of the media, I would like to clarify that an 8 person intimate gathering is not a ‘party.’ And my home which we maintain strict protocols in is certainly no ‘hotspot’ of covid. All of us are responsible and masked at all times and no one would treat this pandemic lightly. My request to certain members of the media is to exercise some restraint in their extreme reportage without the assessment of facts! Lots of love and safety to all. Karan Johar.”  “Shanaya and her mother are in home quarantine at a building in JVPD,” said Prithviraj Chavan, assistant BMC commissioner, K-West Ward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-kareenas-help-ve-actor-johar-bldgs-unsealed/articleshow/88307667.cms||Richa Pinto

After offering prayers at Hanumangarhi temple and Ramjanmabhoomi, Nadda performed ‘aarti’ on the banks of Saryu along with the delegation of CMs. While a special puja was performed at the Ram Lalla shrine by chief priest Satyendra Das, the Sarya aarti was conducted by a prominent Ayodhya seer, Mahant Shashikant Das. With chief minister Yogi Adityanath busy with a prior engagement in Lucknow, he was represented by his deputies — Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma. State tourism minister Neelkanth Tiwari received the dignitaries in Ayodhya, which was fortified and its borders sealed. Talking to reporters while receiving a model of the grand Ram temple, Nadda said, “All chief ministers expressed their desire to have 'darshan' of Ram Lalla during the Kashi dham corridor inauguration. We also wanted to review the construction of the temple. CMs keep meeting from time to time, since they had come to Kashi, they wanted to offer prayers at Ram Lalla too.” The chief ministers present at Ayodhya included Shivraj Singh Chauhan of Madhya Pradesh, Biplab Deb of Tripura, Pramod Sawant of Goa, Manohar Lal Khattar of Haryana, Hemant Biswa Sarma of Assam, Bhupendrabhai Patel of Gujarat, Prema Khandu of Arunachal Pradesh and Nongthombam Biren Singh of Manipur.

While MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said, he was fortunate to visit Ramjanmabhoomi after temple construction began, his Assam counterpart Hemant Biswa Sarma said, “Hinduism is not an agenda, it is a way of life. Luck will prevail after darshan of Lord Ram.” Talking to TOI, deputy director, information, Murli Dhar Singh, said Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Dhami and Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai skipped their visits due to prior engagements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nadda-leads-8-cms-5-dycms-to-ayodhya-performs-aarti/articleshow/88307295.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Meerut||Our struggle will be written in golden letters: Rakesh Tikait||Muzaffarnagar: Bhartiya Kisan Union's (BKU's) national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait was given a hero's welcome on Wednesday as he returned home to his village, Sisauli, after over 380 days of protests. “Our struggle will be written in golden letters,” he said while addressing farmers here. "I will continue to fight for farmers' rights till my last breath," he said, adding he has no plans to contest elections and cautioned against using his photo on political hoardings. "I have nothing to do with any political party," he clarified. Laddoos were distributed at every crossing on the Meerut-Muzaffarnagar highway and langars were organised every 25 km from Ghazipur to Muzaffarnagar. The Union's headquarters was decked up like a wedding venue. Tikait was seemingly emotional seeing the reception of his procession, which he called the farmers’ “victory march”. The procession began from the Ghazipur border and ended at Sisauli. The BKU leader was showered with flowers on his arrival. He shared his garlands with the elderly and hugged his younger supporters. Tikait's wife, Sunita Devi, who was desperately waiting for her husband to come home for the past one year, lit hundreds of diyas to welcome him at their house in Jaat Colony, Muzaffarnagar city. "My husband is coming home after 383 days today. The number of lamps I should light in his welcome shall be no less. Just as Lord Ram came back to Ayodhya, my Ram is coming home today," she said. Tikait had not gone home ever since the start of the farmers' movement. Before leaving the dharna spot in Ghazipur, a havan was performed in the morning on Wednesday at the UP Gate, near the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, for the well-being of farmers. Farmers then loaded their temporary settlements, which were erected at the protest site over the past year, onto their tractor trolleys. Before reaching Sisauli, Tikait was welcomed at the Soram village, where he addressed a gathering on the "Soram Ka Chopal". Many farmers' movements had been announced from the site over the past several decades. Tikait's father, the late Mahender Singh Tikait, held many panchayats here. "Tikait made us proud. He sacrificed an entire year for us farmers," said Satyveer Singh, a resident of Soram village. The BKU, an influential farmers' union, is part of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which spearheaded the protests against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/our-struggle-will-be-written-in-golden-letters-rakesh-tikait/articleshow/88304443.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The locality residents said the newborn was healthy, but as she was abandoned without any clothes on, she could not survive the cold. No injury marks were found on her body. The police said a former neighbour had raped and impregnated the teenager.A retired inspector had sounded the police on spotting the newborn’s body on Tuesday.He said in his police complaint, “I own quarters in the area and park my car in a garage there. On Tuesday afternoon when I went there to bring my car, I saw blood stains in the verandah. I asked a tenant and he told me that an injured dog was roaming around so the blood stains could be its.” When the retired inspector was leaving, he saw the teenager coming out of a washroom. “I had been seeing her with a growing abdomen for the past few months. But on Tuesday her abdomen looked flat. Later, I came to know that a newborn was found dead in a vacant plot near my quarters. I rushed there and saw the infant,” he added. The police were informed who took the body in custody. “Thereafter, I realized that the teenager could be the mother of the baby and that her protruding abdomen was a baby bump,” he saidThe retired inspector shared the information with the police, who questioned the teenager and her family. Investigating officer inspector Ramandeep Singh said, “The family of the teenager said they were unaware of her pregnancy. We are yet to verify it, as the teenager delivered the baby at her rented accommodation.”On if it was a pre-mature delivery, the inspector said, “The teenager told the police that the accused had raped her in March, which suggests that it was not a pre-mature delivery. However, the medical report will ascertain it.”The retired inspector said, “The accused, along with his brother, lived at my quarters for six months. He went back to his hometown in June. The teenager and her family have been living here for years.” The police have lodged an FIR against the accused under sections 315 (act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth), 376 (rape) of the IPC and the POCSO Act. “Since the mother is a minor, we are not lodging an FIR against her as she is a victim,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/14-yr-old-delivered-baby-at-her-house/articleshow/88305984.cms||Payal Dhawan

Of these, whereabouts of over 490 flyers are not known. Ever since, Uttarakhand family and health welfare department has been on its toes to track them amid the looming Omicron scare, as they had at the airport stated that they would head to Uttarakhand. Speaking about efforts to gather information about their travel history, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general, family and health welfare department, said, “The foreigners had filled in incorrect contact details in the forms handed to them at the airport. We are not even sure if they are in Uttarakhand. The crime unit of state police has been roped in to locate them.” As per authorities, a majority of the returnees are from the United States. What’s worrying health authorities is the fact that most of its health workers are busy sampling those associated with high-profile visitors. “At entry points, we have been told to do random sampling while our entire machinery gets busy in protocol services, which hampers routine testing. And, with political events scheduled ahead of polls in the state, Covid may spread if rapid detection is not done,” said one of the senior doctors in the family and health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/490-foreign-returnees-to-state-missing-being-traced/articleshow/88305993.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Hyderabad||ED officials attach Rs 51 crore in app loan fraud||HYDERABAD: As part of its ongoing investigation into instant app-based finance companies, Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials have seized Rs 51 crore from various bank accounts belonging to PC Financial Services Pvt Ltd (PCFS) for alleged violation of FEMA on Wednesday. ED has been investigating a number of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and fintech companies under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for providing instant micro-financing using mobile apps and then extorting high rate of interest by defaming defaulters through various means. The investigation revealed that foreign parent companies of PCFS had brought in FDI worth Rs 173 crore for lending business and within a short period they made foreign outward remittance worth Rs 429 crore, citing payments to foreign companies, which provided software services. However, the officials did not find any proof of receipt of service. In this whole business, it was Chinese nationals who were the final beneficiaries. “PCFS had illegally remitted huge funds outside India in the guise of imports of non-existent software and marketing services to park funds abroad and hold them in the accounts related to foreign companies. PCFS has contravened provisions of FEMA and thus ED, after identifying the local assets, has issued an order under FEMA Act for seizing Rs 50.22 crore lying in various bank accounts and payment gateway accounts,” ED officials said in a press release. Previously, ED officials had seized Rs 106 crores and Rs 131 crores respectively on different occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-51-cr-in-app-loan-fraud/articleshow/88306758.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Soil testing for Joka Metro starts in Maidan||KOLKATA: The ground work ahead of soil testing for the much-awaited Joka-Esplanade Metro has started in the Maidan area. This is a milestone for the Metro corridor that has been saddled with several missed deadlines even as it was chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s pet project. Banerjee had flagged off the project in July 2011 and planned it when she was the railway minister in 2009-10. Finally, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the implementing agency of the 15km Joka-Esplanade Metro or Kolkata’s Line 3, has started the process of soil testing, after getting a go-ahead from the Army, custodian of the land in and around the Maidan area. The Metro corridor is elevated from Joka to Mominpore. But a 5.6km stretch from Mominpore till Esplanade will be underground. Five stations — Mominpore, Kidderpore, Victoria Memorial, Park Street and Esplanade — will come up along this stretch. A soil testing survey by geotechnical engineers is mandatory before deploying tunnel boring machines (TBMs) to build the underground section. The crucial test is supposed to check the soil condition and other parameters and depending on the results, the further course of work will be planned. The soil test will also study the erosion aspect and other characteristics before the TBMs can be pressed in to dig and burrow the twin tunnels as part of the Joka-Esplanade Metro link. Usually, a series of boreholes, each of at least 15m diameter, is drilled after certain gaps. Normally, a boring rig with an auger (drilling device) drills a borehole and a tube is driven in to collect samples, which are tested for several parameters like density, strength and resistance. But in the case of this Metro work, the locality is Maidan, so soil samples may not be collected from the boreholes to map the strata along the alignment. Instead, a superior technology will be used to detect remotely the topography and related specifications without affecting the Maidan grounds. A senior RVNL official said, “We are trying to use a hi-tech method so that the testing can be conducted in various locations of the proposed route without inflicting any harm on the Maidan, which is an eco-sensitive zone.” Areas on the Maidan have been barricaded for preliminary work ahead of the main soil testing exercise. RVNL is taking an extra care to get the job done following all green rules and guidelines relating to the Maidan. Over the past few months, the agency has been conducting meetings with the Army, so issues relating to the Metro project could be ironed out and the construction could be underway. “The Metro project approved in 2010 can so far be executed till Mominpore. Beyond Mominpore, the land belongs to Army,” said a railway official. Currently, the project is chasing a mid-2022 deadline to commission the 8.5km Joka-Taratala section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/soil-testing-for-joka-metro-starts-in-maidan/articleshow/88306768.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

They recovered the entire stolen property. Meanwhile, three burglaries were reported between Monday and Tuesday, in which cash, foreign currency and gold ornaments collectively worth Rs9.26 lakh were stolen. These thefts took place in Kothrud, Ambegaon and at Satav Vasti near Lonikand.  Ganj Peth resident Venkatesh Palla had collected Rs2.5 lakh and made gold jewellery worth Rs 1.6 lakh for his daughter, who is getting married soon. Before the wedding, Palla took his family to Tuljapur on December 12 to offer prayers. “His neighbour told him about the burglary at his house on Monday. Palla returned to Pune and filed a complaint on Tuesday,” said an officer from the Khadak police. The officer said the complainant was worried as he lost everything he had collected for his daughter’s marriage. “Our team immediately swung into action. As it was a slum area, there were no CCTV cameras around,” the officer said. Police constables Sandip Talekar and Ravi Lokhande received a tip-off that a criminal on the police records, Aakash Bhore (23), was involved in this theft. “We laid a trap and took Bhore into custody from Shankarsheth Road. He confessed and we got the booty intact from him,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-burglaries-in-two-days-in-city-booty-found-in-1-case/articleshow/88306761.cms||---

Around 8 to 10 facilities will undergo revamp in the first phase. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will spend around Rs1.4crore for the work. The PMC officials said that the process of appointing an agency to execute the work has been initiated. The work is likely to begin in the next couple of months. An official said, “Some subways being used by vehicles have been identified for repairs. One such subway near the CoEP hostel is used by vehicles to travel towards the civil court from the Shivajingar end. Other facilities are in Vishrantwadi, Ahmednagar road, Ramtekdi and near the zilla parishad’s old building, close to the Sassoon General hospital. Viraj Kale, who often travels to the district collector’s office, said that the subway at Sasson General hospital chowk was not in good condition. “The walkways are not clean.

---||Delhi||Delhi: How Majnu Ka Tila is turning into no-drugs zone||NEW DELHI: In the past year, cops filed over a dozen cases, made 16 arrests and seized smack, marijuana and other drugs from Majnu Ka Tila in north Delhi. However, this brought little change at the drug hub, which attracts students from across Delhi. Senior cops, therefore, felt another approach was required in place of coercive methods. After police commissioner Rakesh Asthana asked the deputy commissioners of police to experiment with unconventional ways other than arrests and cases, Sagar Singh Kalsi, DCP (North) formed a team last week led by inspector Ajay Kumar to work on a new strategy. The team roped in 25 people from the local associations of residents and traders, created a WhatsApp group and launched an anti-drugs campaign. Counselling for addicts was also arranged, with an NGO managing rehabilitation and treatment. “The drive was named Majnu Ka Tila: No Drugs Zone. We realised that besides arresting or penalising the accused, there should be social reformation to which the public could contribute. The strategy was to discourage the peddlers and encourage the public to join hands with police in fighting this social evil,” said Kalsi. “We sought suggestions from the public in meetings organised in this regard. We also implemented their suggestions. Then we organised meetings in different localities to motivate the public to join the campaign.” In just one week, residents have told cops that change was visible. Neither are peddlers visible nor or the youth consuming drugs on roadsides. Several drug addicts came forward expressing their willingness to quit drugs and revealed to cops the problems they were facing. Lack of money to go to de-addiction centres was one of their main woes, they told police. The cops immediately roped in an NGO running de-addiction centres and requested it to take under its care those who were financially weak but in dire need of treatment Along with the campaign, sports tournaments had been organised and medical camps held for those willing to stay home and get help when the urge to consume became high. Police, however, did not neglect to carry out daily morning and evening combing to keep a check on drug dealings. Street plays were also staged to create awareness, while volleyball matches, thematic drawing competitions and tug of war were held to bridge the gap between police and the public. The DCP added, “Suspicious houses were raided or visited. Both drug users and suspected drug peddlers were motivated to give up such activities and warned about stringent legal action should they not take this last opportunity to reform.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-majnu-ka-tila-is-turning-into-no-drugs-zone/articleshow/88307310.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cabinet grants approval to ropeway project in Varanasi||LUCKNOW: In a major push to the ropeway project in Varanasi, the Cabinet on Wednesday gave approval to the viability gap funding, its feasibility report, request for proposal (RFP) documents, draft concession document, etc. The 3.65 km project will start from Varanasi Cantt and go up to the Church Crossing via Sajan Tiraha and Rath Yatra. As per estimate, 80,000 passengers will use the ropeway per day. “The decision to have the ropeway was taken in light of the massive pressure being exerted by transport on the city’s infrastructure. On October 21, 2021, the housing and urban planning department set up a bid evaluation committee. The project will be developed in public private partnership mode,” an official said. It was decided that Centre will contribute 20% to the Rs 410 crore project as viability gap funding and the same amount will be contributed by the state government. The remaining 60% will be put in by the concessionaire. In another major decision, the Cabinet gave approval for making Bhatkhande Music Institute, a deemed university in the state capital, a full-fledged state university. Sources said institutes like Kathak Academy, Sangeet Natak Academy, Lalit Kala Academy etc., will be affiliated to it and will issue degrees. “Once it becomes a full-fledged university, its scope will expand to the entire state. It will issue degrees and can even associate with foreign universities and promote research,” said an official. The new Khandsari Licensing Policy has also been issued, for five years this time instead of a single year. The policy will help in promoting small and cottage industries, said officials. Under the policy, licences will be given to power crushers and khandsari outside a radial distance of 7.5 km of sugar mills. It will not be required for production of jaggery by power crushers or mini crushers while a minimum of 60 days of crushing in a season will be mandatory for each such unit. The application would be online and will be granted clearance within 100 hours. The applicants will require a no objection certificate (NoC) from the regional pollution control board and the certificate of registration from the state excise department. The excise department has come up with a one-time settlement scheme to recover dues of Rs 53.91 crore up to March 31, 2015. Those who owe dues will have to submit an application to the district excise officer for issuing an approval. The applicant will have to clear at least 50% of the dues within 30 days of the approval and the remaining within 60 days. The government has also increased the annual grant to sports associations from Rs 15,000 to Rs 2 lakh under Eklavya Sports Fund.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-grants-approval-to-ropeway-project-in-varanasi/articleshow/88307303.cms||---

Burglars found it almost a cakewalk to sneak away with valuables worth Rs70,000, including cash Rs4,000.Police said Ninawe, working as a sales manager, was so perturbed with his daughter’s ailment that he had forgotten to lock the house while rushing out with her. He had requested a neighbour to lock the door as there was no one else at home when the family was hurriedly leaving. The neighbour had just closed the door from outside instead of locking it, said police.The Ninawe family was left stunned after returning home as the valuables were missing from his place. The family was initially preoccupied with their only daughter’s ailment and later left befuddled with the burglary at home.Police said the burglars did not have to toil hard for laying their hands upon the valuables which were kept in an unlocked almirah.Hudkeshwar police, which have registered an offence following the complaint of the Ninawe family, also tried to recover some CCTV footage of the locality to spot any suspicious movement but no clues could be retrieved so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-forgets-to-lock-home-burglar-decamps-with-valuables-worth-rs70000/articleshow/88305986.cms||Soumitra Bose

The study has been published in the Indian Journal of Ophthalmology. As a part of the research, transgenders and commercial sex workers diagnosed with severe eye problems were interviewed by medical professionals and NGO volunteers. The study also explored discrimination faced by transgenders at medical facilities. “There are only male or female wards in a hospital. Where do people like us stay?” said a 60-year-old transgender. Kulkarni said, “It is possible to provide eye care to them with active initiatives from the government, NGOs and large health facilities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/accessing-eye-care-difficult-for-transgenders/articleshow/88306773.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

---||Kolkata||Kolkata cops take a leaf out of Big B’s Yaarana costume||KOLKATA: Remember Amitabh Bachchan jiving to ‘Saara Zamana’ in 1981 blockbuster ‘Yaarana’? The light-studded costume of Big B had become an instant hit and remained an eternal favourite of Bollywood buffs for all these years. Kolkata Police has brought the memories back by reintroducing “body lights” for traffic cops on city roads. The Kolkata Traffic Police had bought such lights for the first time three years ago. The cops have decided to procure 240 more police shoulder lights as the old ones mostly got damaged or conked out due to less use during the pandemic when many cops had also refused to wear the device. Now the cops deployed for naka checks will be asked to use the LED lights, which will function as a warning equipment. According to police sources, the decision was taken to ensure the protection of cops in winter when visibility drops to a great extent. “Even with the onset of winter, traffic cops have been asked to carry out checking in the wee hours. This is in addition to multiple nakas being conducted at night on the main thoroughfares of the city. So, cops have to be out on the road, despite poor visibility while speeding will also increase on deserted stretches. We need to ensure safety for the policemen too,” said a senior officer. “The flashing red and blue lights will be visible to motorists from a distance of 500 metres, said the officer. These lights will not only alert motorists about the presence of cops on road but also indicate where they are to stop for mandatory checks. It will act as a deterrent against speeding and signal violation as motorists will know that they are under watch,” said another senior officer at Lalbazar. Cops said the “body lights” will also help motorists to locate cops on road at night and seek help from them, if necessary. Several late evening accidents involving police personnel — a sergeant was hit on the Sealdah flyover recently — led cops to brainstorm various ways to ensure the safety of policemen. While a section of sergeants told TOI they felt “safer” by using the device in the past three years, others were not yet sure of its efficacy. “In winter, our white uniform is not visible as we wear blue jackets. There have been countless occasions when drivers have disregarded our orders or slammed brakes at the last moment, claiming they could not spot us from a distance. These lights will help us and put a stop to such excuses,” said a sergeant from Jorabagan traffic guard. Meanwhile, traffic cops are also buying around 3,000 road signboards, some of which will be written in Bengali. The new signages will include no cycling boards, dedicated bus lane boards and “bump ahead” boards. “We have identified the spots where we will put up the signboards. Some of them are old and have got damaged. We have begun trimming trees and removing advertisements that can stop clear view of the motorists,” said an officer at Lalbazar. The tender for the installation of signboards is worth Rs 6.4 lakh. Cops said they will be procuring 100 pieces of boards that prohibit the entry of cycles while 200 boards will cater to no parking on both lanes. Around 500 other boards will be primarily no entry boards. “Traffic signs provide valuable information to motorists and pedestrians for safety. We are adding more signboards in Bengali because everyone cannot read English or understand picture signs,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-cops-take-a-leaf-out-of-big-bs-yaarana-costume/articleshow/88306788.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Pune||Activists fear property tax waiver misuse||Pune: Civic activists have sought introduction of terms and conditions to restrict any misuse of the municipal corporation’s amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters. “People who have availed of the benefits of this scheme should not be a part of such initiative again,” said Vivek Velankar of citizens’ group Sajag Nagrik Manch. The group on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation. “If the scheme is going to benefit the defaulters but fails to discipline them, it should then be scrapped,” the activists’ group stated. The PMC had introduced the amnesty scheme for property tax defaulters. In accordance with the scheme, 75% waiver on the penalty would be given to the defaulters if they paid the levy as part of the initiative. “Many defaulters have become habitual offenders due to such schemes. The PMC’s revenue collection is adversely impacted in the long run, when amnesty and discount in the penalty are promoted. The PMC is hampering the regular income generation,” said Vijay Kumbhar of Surajya Sangharsh Samiti, another citizens’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-fear-property-tax-waiver-misuse/articleshow/88306785.cms||---

The programme was organized by Maharaja Suheldev Rajbhar Janmabhoomi Mukt Sankalp Maha Abhiyan.

PM Narendra Modi is fulfilling the dream of Suheldev by working for the poor, giving them a pucca house, toilet, free gas connection, free electricity connection and Ayushman card,” he said.

The accident occurred at Gollagudu area near Leprosy Colony on the outskirts of Nalgonda town when five members of a family were travelling on a bike from Yadadri-Bhongir district to Nellore in Andhra Pradesh. Farm worker G Tirupataiah, his wife Annamma, their sons Jasli Kumar, 5,and Sravan, 3, and his father Tirupallu, started the bike journey from Cheekatimamidi in Yadadri-Bhongir district to go to their native place, Nallagolla village in Nellore district. At 10.30am, Tirupataiah applied sudden brake when a buffalo suddenly came on to the road near Leprosy Colony in Nalgonda. “The bike skid off the road and the two boys, who were sitting on the fuel tank, fell on the road along with other family members. Sravan died on the spot with severe head injury. His elder brother was declared brought dead at a nearby hospital,” Nalgonda II Town sub-inspector (SI) Yadagiri said. Police said that the family members also kept a bag behind the handle, making it difficult for Tirupataiah to control the vehicle due to overloading. “All the injured are out of danger. We registered a case against Tirupataiah under Sections 304-A and 337 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” Nalgonda II Town sub-inspector added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-kids-die-in-road-mishap-at-nalgonda/articleshow/88306791.cms||---

The increase will be applicable in retrospect from July 2021 and the arrears will be transferred to the employees’ provident fund account.  The last revision was announced on July 28, 2021 when the DA was revised to 28%, the rate at which employees have been receiving DA since. A revision of the DA was withheld in 2020 due to Covid-19 at which point the DA was 17%. An official said the DA is increased twice annually, on January 1 and July 1 but in April 2020, the Centre and then the state announced that there would be no revision in DA till July 1, 2021 in order to help the government financially tide over the Covid-19 pandemic.  Government sources said for those who are members of the National Pension Scheme, some amount of the revised DA will be deposited in the NPS accounts. Those who retired before the decision was announced will have dues paid to them in cash.  The move will benefit around 16 lakh government employees and 12 lakh pensioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-raises-da-for-govt-staff-from-28-to-31/articleshow/88307315.cms||---
---||Mumbai||92% Mumbai schools open for Class 1-7 but just 28% attend as parental nod a concern||MUMBAI: Around 28% of Class 1-7 students in the city attended physical classes as 92% schools reopened on Wednesday—21 months after the pandemic struck. The 2,000-plus schools that opened their gates saw poor attendance in the primary section, even as more secondary students made their way to classrooms, to be greeted by balloons, music and in some places Santa Claus. Physical school for all classes have now reopened in the city. Principals said obtaining consent from parents of primary students continues to be a task. “We did not get any students for the primary section. In Classes 5-7, student strength was less than 20%,” said Sister Margaret, principal, Canossa Convent, Andheri. All teachers conducted hybrid classes from the school. BMC education officer Raju Tadvi said 36% (2 lakh) of the 7 lakh students from all schools had got parental consent to attend offline classes. “Of those who gave the consent, 77% (1.8 lakh) attended physical classes on Wednesday,” said Tadvi. Most civic and state board schools reopened on Wednesday. A number of non-state board schools did not start physical classes as they are currently centres for Class 10 and 12 board exams. The December 1 reopening was deferred to December 15 in the wake of the Omnicron scare. Principals said while fears may be justified, students cannot afford to stay away from actual classrooms. “If students continue to stay home, learning loss will be irreparable,” said Veena Donwalkar, principal, Chhatrapati Shivaji Vidyalaya, Dharavi. Om Choudhary (6) was among those who happily walked to his Samata Vidyamandir school in Ghatkopar on Wednesday. The Class 1 student spent two hours with a few more who attended. Shubhangi Ghadge, principal, National Education Society School, attributed the poor response to children still being away in their hometowns.  “We called Class 4 and 6 students and will bring in the other classes in the coming days,” said Sajitha Venugopal, principal, Cosmos school. In Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mira-Bhayander, students made it to their classrooms, some in uniform, others in informal attire. Music, flower and balloon decorations brightened up classrooms. Schools in Kalyan-Dombivli will reopen on Thursday. The civic administration on Wednesday directed schools to follow Covid protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-92-schools-open-for-class-1-7-but-just-28-attend-as-parental-nod-a-concern/articleshow/88307678.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Delhi||OMR sheets to go to CBSE, not schools, for evaluation now||NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Wednesday said optical mark recognition (OMR) answer sheets will henceforth be sent to the board instead of being evaluated by schools. The tweaked rules, coming just a day ahead of Thursday’s Class 12 Hindi core and elective exam, led to confusion among teaching staff and principals. A circular issued by CBSE to centre superintendents said, “The practice of evaluation on the same day in the examination centre is being stopped from 16.12.2021 onwards. All the centre superintendents will pack and seal the OMR sheets within 15 minutes after the examination is over in the presence of the observer. The centre superintendent and observer will sign on the sealed parcel and mention the time of packing. Once OMRs are packed and sealed, the same will be dispatched to the concerned regional office.” Asked why the changes had been introduced, CBSE’s examination controller Sanyam Bhardwaj did not respond. With only seven subjects remaining in the Class 12 Term-1 exams, several school principals questioned the need for last-minute changes and expressed surprise at the move. “At first, we thought that the circular was fake. We keep getting new information and changes every morning,” said a principal on condition of anonymity. A senior official told TOI that the changes were introduced after receiving feedback from stakeholders. “It is a dynamic process,” the official said. Among other changes enforced by the board on Wednesday, mails with passwords will be sent to schools, followed by the operation code at 10.45am. “This effectively meant that the printing of question papers has to be done in 15 minutes. Many of the principals protested this as they have a large number of students appearing for the exams,” said a principal. The CBSE circular said that centre superintendents will ensure that the students appearing in an exam are present at the centre latest by 10.45am and in case anyone reaches late, he/she should be frisked properly. “Schools should ensure that the question paper should be printed within the stipulated period and, accordingly, they should make the arrangement for equipment required for printing,” said the circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omr-sheets-to-go-tocbse-not-schools-for-evaluation-now/articleshow/88306812.cms||Shradha Chettri

L S Shashidhara, professor, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, on Wednesday told TOI, “The home-grown Delta variant had emerged as early as October 2020 and was spreading in the country. But its spread was not reported until February. This means that it already had over three months to spread without raising an alarm until mid-February 2021. Omicron has been detected very early in India and patients are being isolated as soon as they test positive for the variant.” Shashidhara said the way forward was to detect the variants at the same time as diagnostics — be it Delta or Omicron. “This also helps to detect in real-time in case a third variant emerges.” Read AlsoCovid-19: Three weeks since first infection, no Omicron cluster in KarnatakaIt was on November 22 that a doctor tested positive for Covid-19 and was later found to be infected with the Omicron variant. That was the first local case without travel history. The Omicron variant in the doctor’s swab sample was confirmed on December 2 through genomic sequencing.Senior scientist Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “When Delta was initially reported, vaccination coverage had just started, with a chunk of the population susceptible to the virus. A big difference now is that over 55% of India’s eligible adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid as against none when Delta was first detected in India in October 2020.” Gangakhedkar said India was in a more advantageous position now than when Delta was detected because the country has already started to prepare for containing the variant, irrespective of the scanty information available on its behaviour: such as severity and ability to escape vaccine-induced antibodies.

But during the same time, we had also projected that the intensity of the third wave at the district and state level would be much less compared to what the country may experience during the second wave. If the ongoing Covid vaccination programme is ramped up, it will be able to further flatten the curve of symptomatic infections." Dr Panda said the intensity of another wave might not be as severe as the second one due to the immunity attained during earlier waves. Senior epidemiologist Dr Amitav Banerjee told TOI, “Cross immunity from natural, prior infection in a chunk of population is likely to give a comprehensive immunity against Omicron.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/india-better-poised-to-fight-omicron-than-delta-experts/articleshow/88306774.cms||Neha Madaan

To transfer the profit amount to the complainant’s bank account, the fraudsters told him to pay 35% of the profit as a dividend to them. The complainant transferred Rs9 lakh to four bank accounts between January and April this year. When the man did not get the profit amount, he realised that he had been duped and filed a complaint with the Cyber police. A case under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act has been registered with the Sangvi police on Tuesday. An officer from the Sangvi police told TOI that in December last year, the suspects contacted the complainant over the phone and assured him handsome profits through their online trading company. “After the complainant accepted the offer, the fraudsters gave him online training too,” the officer said. In January this year, the fraudsters told the complainant that he has earned a profit of Rs 30 lakh through online trading. “They, however, told the complainant that to get the money, he first has to pay them 35% of the profit amount as a dividend.

The Union minister, meanwhile, has been summoned to Delhi later in the day.  In a viral video, the minister, who was attending a government function to inaugurate an oxygen plant, can be seen purportedly abusing a journalist of a TV news channel, and then grabbing his collar, lunging towards him and snatching his mobile phone which was recording the interview. “Don't ask questions like a fool. Have you lost your mental balance? I will beat you here,” he is heard saying in Hindi. “What do you want to know? You turned an innocent person into an accused. Aren't you ashamed?” He is also heard calling the journalists “chor (thief)”. The TV news channel journalist later told TOI, “We were just doing our job and wanted to know his reaction to the latest charges against his son by the SIT. But, the Union minister turned abusive, misbehaved with me and took away my mobile phone. Then he called all of us thieves. I'm yet to get my phone back.” A group of local journalists later in the day met Kheri district magistrate (DM) Mahendra Bahadur Singh and gave him a written complaint against the minister. “We've already lost a journalist because of the minister and his son. No journalist is safe in Kheri. The administration should ensure us proper security when we cover government events here,” a veteran journalist in Kheri said. Meanwhile, Jasbir Singh Virk, president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangathan, said that members of Sikh community will launch a protest if the minister is invited as chief guest to any government event. On October 3, four farmers and a journalist were killed during farm agitation in Tikunia area of Uttar Pradesh's Lakhimpur Kheri district. The Union minister’s son Ashish and 12 others have been arrested in connection with the incident and sent to jail.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been tracing contacts of positive patients and foreign travel returnees after the emergence of the Omicron variant. “Issues such as improper contact details or addresses are creating hurdles in the search. The cross-verification of these details is underway,” said Sanjeev Wavare, the PMC’s assistant medical officer. As of Wednesday, the PMC limits had two Omicron-positive patients. Civic officials said they had got details of the travellers, who reached Mumbai or other cities from different international destinations. Civic officials said that the visitors were told about the rules and regulations, which s/he had to follow after returning from foreign countries. “Not only those who have foreign travel history, there is also a probability that other Covid patients may be infected with the new variant. So, the PMC is focusing on too,” a PMC official said. Civic data showed the PMC had traced 2,873 contacts in around a fortnight. As many as 2,940 tests were conducted. Of them, a total of six were found positive and two were confirmed with the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-faces-difficulty-in-tracing-over-550-people-for-testing/articleshow/88306799.cms||---

The sixth survey showed that Delta derivatives—descendants of the deadly Delta strain that caused the second wave in India—are still the dominant strain in circulation. The BMC gene testing lab at Kasturba Hospital sequenced 297 samples during its sixth survey. Seven of these samples (2%) showed Omicron positive; as per the Union health ministry’s protocol, the state health department announced these as part of its Tuesday’s update. Of the remaining 290 cases, 183 or 62% showed Delta derivatives while 105 (35%) were Delta variant. This is the second survey that detect-ed Omicron cases. “We found Omicron cases only due to cont-act tracing of international travellers. It can be said that there is no community transmission at the moment,” said Kakani. “For the first time, we included samples from private labs.” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-omicron-community-spread-so-far/articleshow/88307688.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: TET leak kingpin held, jail buddy aided scam||LUCKNOW: A medical practitioner who masterminded the UPTET paper leak for big kickbacks was arrested from Mawaiya Metro station in Alambagh here on Wednesday by UP Special Task Force (UPSTF). The accused doctor, Santosh Chaurasia, has eight cases lodged against him in Gwalior, Indore and Jabalpur for his role in the Vyapam scam that rocked Madhya Pradesh less than a decade ago. Days after the UP Teachers Eligibility Test (UPTET) paper leak, Dr Chaurasia’s name cropped up as an accused and FIR was registered against him in Kaushambi district, which served as a scam gateway to eastern UP. Sources said, he was in sync with the tainted exam controller, Sanjay Kumar Upadhyay, who was posted in neighbouring Prayagraj. The blueprint for rigging the UPTET exam was hammered out years ago in a Madhya Pradesh prison, where Dr Chaurasia shared his cell with another Vyapam accused Vikas Dixit. “It was Dixit, who put him through to the scamster duo of Rahul Mishra and Anurag Sharma in February, 2021, and they met in Noida. Rahul was adept at leaking question papers of government jobs and had links with printers,” said additional director general of police, STF, Amitabh Yash. After securing an MBBS degree from premier Delhi medical college, Dr Chaurasia joined the solvers’ syndicate and made fast buck by deputing ‘munnabhais’ (imposters) and rigging OMR sheets of Madhya Pradesh Pre-Medical Test (PMT) in 2013-2014. And he was jailed after the scam-riddled Vyapam board went bust. During interrogation on Wednesday, Santosh disclosed he visited Lucknow in the last week of October and handed over Rs 3 lakh to Rahul, who was confident of accessing TET question papers from the printing press. “Then the doctor met another conduit, Roshan Patel, in Prayagraj, who promised to deliver the UPTET paper on WhatsApp for circulation among exam aspirants in east UP,” said the police officer. On November 28, UPTET was cancelled after a question paper was leaked on social media, triggering arrests of 39 persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/tet-leak-kingpin-held-jail-buddy-aided-scam/articleshow/88307352.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Pune||Maharashtra govt reduces cost of rapid RT-PCR test to Rs 1,975||PUNE: The state government on Tuesday reduced the Rapid RT-PCR test cost to Rs1,975 from the current rate of Rs4,500 and issued a government resolution (GR) regarding it. “The reduction in costs will not only help the travellers at the airport but also those who prefer rapid RT-PCR tests for early detection of any infections. The costs have been reduced by a little more than half,” said Rajesh Tope, the state health minister. The Centre has mandated RT-PCR tests for all travellers arriving from “at-risk countries” following the emergence of the coronavirus’ Omicron variant. The rapid RT-PCR test kits give the reports within an hour, unlike the normal RT-PCR tests having a turnaround time of more than five hours. Tope told TOI that the exorbitant cost of rapid RT-PCR test at airports was a huge issue. Finally, he said, the committee appointed by the public health department reduced its cost after several discussions. The state government’s GR stated that of the three rapid RT-PCR tests, two (Abbott ID and Thermo Fischer Accula) would cost Rs1,975, while the other (Tata MD3 Gene Fast) would be priced at Rs975 at the airports, railway stations, Covid care hubs, hospitals or sample collection centres. Laboratories have been allowed to charge an additional Rs200 if a rapid RT-PCR test is performed after collecting samples from home. The GR stated that the state might revise the cost of rapid RT-PCR test again if there was a further reduction in the cost of kits and in case of reduction in taxes levied by the state and the central governments. The revised RT-PCR rates were proposed by the committee under Sudhakar Shinde, the CEO of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, after several discussions with the laboratories. “These rates are decided after a thorough analysis of input costs and discussions with all stakeholders. These rates will be applicable with immediate effect,” said Shinde. Health officials stated that the revised rate of rapid RT-PCR test in Maharashtra could be the lowest in the country. Earlier, additional chief secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas had written to the Union ministry of health to reduce the rates of rapid RT-PCR test at the Mumbai international airport because the state had issued an order to test all passengers arriving on international flights from “high-risk countries”. Earlier this week, the state had slashed the rate of normal RT-PCR test. The revised cost is as low as Rs350 for the test at the collection site, Rs500 for samples collected from Covid care centres and Rs700 for at-home test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-reduces-cost-of-rapid-rt-pcr-test-to-rs-1975/articleshow/88306810.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Raziuddin’s elder brother and government medical officer Shaikh Mohiuddin (36) has also been arrested. Police said that the suspects have been booked on the charges of cheating and forgery. Jinsi police station inspector Vyankatesh Kendrekar told TOI that based on a specific tip-off, they sent a police staff posing as a civilian in need of certificate sans vaccination to the private hospital run by Raziuddin. He would allegedly collect Aadhaar card details of the person seeking certificate and send it over to his elder brother. “We first nabbed the private medical practitioner and two of his assistants. Based on the revelations made by them, we arrested his elder brother, who turned out to be a serving medical officer currently posted with Shiur primary health centre,” said Kendrekar. Kendrekar said that investigation has revealed that the private medical practitioner would charge anything around Rs 1,000 for certificate sans vaccination for single dose, and Rs 1,500 for certificate sans vaccination for both doses. The police are checking the role of the other suspects named in the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-doctors-among-4-held-for-issuing-certificate-without-vax/articleshow/88305223.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and the three corporations — East, North and South, on the petition seeking direction to the state to immediately withdraw its November 25 notification. In his plea, Garg argued that Delhi government has improperly earmarked the appointment of serving chief secretary of Delhi as Election Commissioner of corporations. He claimed that the appointment was made in utter violation of the settled principles of law, which mandates that important government posts such as election commissioner must be offered to the neutral and apolitical person. It must not be the party to the several political as well as administrative decisions of a particular government as it can be capable of affecting the free and fair election process in the corporation. “In this respect, it is submitted that the serving chief secretary of Government of NCT of Delhi is still serving his tenure of present service till March 8, 2023. However, the respondent no.1 (Delhi government) has acted with vested interest and ulterior motive as the incumbent chief secretary of Delhi has been actively associated with it at every level of administrative decisions and it has obliged the serving chief secretary to pay-back to it in forthcoming election of MCD as the government had decided to extend the service tenure of incumbent chief secretary for more than five years..,” the plea said. It alleged that this “blatant decision” of the government as serious bearing and repercussion to the very foundation of democracy and the notification is improper and illegal and against the settled principles of law and same may be declared as unconstitutional.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-govt-reply-on-plea-against-cs-as-ec/articleshow/88307348.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

About 90% of the healthcare and frontline workers have been fully vaccinated so far. The state public health department is conducting special inoculation drives to complete the second dose vaccination of the employees in these two sectors. The vaccination drive started with the health and frontline workers in January. The data showed that the average complete vaccination for the health workers was 89.8% and for the frontline workers it was 90.3%. “The average has been the same since the last month. Now, efforts are on to reach out to the health and frontline workers to check whether they had enrolled under the general category or under different cellphone numbers and did not got their vaccination certificates,” said an official of the state public health official. State immunisation officer Dr S Desai told TOI that all district-level immunisation officers had been directed to check the data and ensure that workers in both these sectors were immunised through special drives. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, a representative from the Indian Medical Association, told TOI that initially there was vaccination hesitancy among the healthcare workers in January. But the vaccination percentage slowly picked up to 90%. “The numbers that remain are mainly the healthcare workers who maybe non-doctors. The coercive techniques will not work and so persuasive and counselling should be done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-3l-health-frontline-workers-due-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/88306814.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Delhi: LNJP isolation beds upped from 40 to 100||NEW DELHI: The number of isolation beds for Covid-19 patients coming from ‘at risk’ countries and their contacts has been increased from 40 to 100 at Lok Nayak (LNJP) hospital. Officials said the decision was taken in view of a rise in the number of suspected or confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2 over the past few days. “We have been getting four to five Covid patients and their direct contacts on a daily basis,” said a senior official. He added that most of the patients are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. However, as a precautionary measure, a 10-bed ICU facility has been kept aside for patients who have been confirmed positive for Omicron. So far, seven people have tested positive for the new variant in Delhi and one of them has been discharged. However, doctors stressed on a need to expand the facility, saying there is a strong possibility of such cases increasing rapidly over the next few days. Some of the patients who have the Omicron variant do not have any travel history, the doctors added. On Tuesday, the WHO had warned that the Omicron variant was spreading at an unprecedented rate and was likely already present in most countries around the world. Since the new variant was first detected in South Africa last month, it has been reported in 77 countries, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. But, he stressed, “the reality is that Omicron is probably in most countries, even if it hasn’t been detected yet.” “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” he said. Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman and head of endocrinology and diabetes division at Max Healthcare, said booster shots for those at high risk of contracting the infection, for example health workers, is the need of the hour. “Most healthcare workers took the second dose of the vaccine in March. We know the immunity developed through vaccination tends to wane over a period of time. Therefore, the government must give serious consideration to booster doses for those at higher risk or with low immunity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lnjp-isolation-beds-upped-from-40-to-100/articleshow/88306826.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Seven people have been booked for the murder of victim Sanjay Bhusra who died on Sunday after being brutally thrashed in the remote Aaslona village of Kaprada taluka. The videos of the Bhusra being beaten up surfaced on Wednesday. Bhusra and the girl were staying in a live-in relationship for the past one year after their engagement. In the video, a group of villagers is seen thrashing Bhusra with sticks while kicking and punching him. The victim falls from the road into a pit but the villages continue to beat him. Meanwhile, some villagers tried to stop the assailants but they continued hitting Bhusra whose clothes were already torn. Gujarat: Man lynched in panchayat after refused to marry live-in partner Police arrested Lakshman Gavli, Uttam Gavli, Chhagan Gavli, Raman Gavli, Sitabhai Gavli, Sunil Gavli and Mahdu Gavli for allegedly killing Bhusra. The complaint was lodged by Bhusra’s father Anand. Police investigation revealed that Bhusra got engaged with the girl three years ago with approval of both the families. They started living together a year ago but recently he refused to live with the girl and reneged on his promise of marriage. The girl’s father Lakshman then approached the village panchayat to intervene.  On November 29, the panchayat was called in the village. “During the panchayat meeting, Bhusra said he did not want to live with the girl after which her family members launched a brutal assault on him. There was no visible injury but he had suffered serious internal injury,” said a police officer in Kaprada police station.  Bhusra was neither taken for medical treatment then by his family nor was the incident reported to police. After complaining of severe pain, Bhusra was finally shifted to a hospital in Vapi on Sunday where he died during treatment.  “We have already arrested seven persons who were involved in the attack,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/20-yr-old-lynched-for-refusing-to-marry-girl-in-valsad/articleshow/88306061.cms||---

There was no water supply from morning till late evening. “The civic administration has been constantly following up with the board for payment of dues. But with the cantonment officials not responding, we stopped water supply on Wednesday as a last option,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water supply department. As per the PMC, not only the board but a majority of residents in PCB areas have not paid their water tax. Pawaskar said a decision regarding future water supply would be taken based on the response received from the PCB after Wednesday’s action. According to PMC officials, residents in the PCB areas owe Rs 29 crore while the board owes Rs 48 crore. These payments are due for over four years. “The PMC had given notices to defaulters but they have not cleared their dues. Actions such as snapping of water connections were taken in the past. Even then, dues were not cleared. The issue could not be resolved through the alternative dispute resolution system. An expected response was not given to the PMC by the PCB in the recently held Lok Adalat,” said a senior PMC official. PCB cantonment executive officer Amit Kumar said they are in contact with the PMC authorities on the issue. “We are in the process of making part payment of the bill. Due to poor financial condition of the board, we couldn’t make big payments in the past,” he said. Sanjay Kawde, an activist from Ghorpadi, said, “The PCB needs to check all water connections as many citizens have not paid water bills for long.” Another resident, Sameer Shaikh, said, “The board needs to act against illegal water connections.” Cab driver Sandesh Shinde from the Bhimpura area, said, "It was quite unusual as we never experience dry taps on Wednesday. We had to buy water bottles for drinking. The authorities concerned should inform citizens in advance if they plan to stop the water supply.” Satish Mane, a vegetable and fruits vendor from the Taboot street area, said, “I could not wash the fruits and vegetables I had bought for selling.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-suspends-water-supply-to-pune-cantt-areas-over-rs-77cr-dues/articleshow/88306818.cms||Sandip Dighe

A senior state public health department official, however, said, “Despite a reduction in daily Covid detections to 700 on average, the state is conducting more than 1 lakh Covid tests. The state had conducted 1.12 lakh tests on Tuesday. These testing numbers are as per WHO norms (140 tests/million/day) or even higher.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-flags-19-districts-in-maha-for-weekly-case-rise/articleshow/88306819.cms||Neha Madaan

According to the order issued by the health department, the test rate has been capped at Rs 1,975, 50% lower than the Rs 3,900 charged at the airport currently. The state government has also allowed an additional charge of Rs 200 to be taken in case the swab is collected from home. The rapid RT-PCR uses a different technology which takes 15-30 minutes to give results as opposed to the normal RT-PCR tests that take at least a day. The test is used to screen passengers at airports and even for emergency medical procedures or emergency travel. “The rates have been capped after considering all the factors such as the cost of raw material, technology and so on,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rapid-pcr-at-state-airports-50-cheaper/articleshow/88307692.cms||---

---||Lucknow||AAP promises 10 lakh jobs per year, Rs 5,000 monthly aid to jobless in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: The Aam Aadmi Party on Wednesday unveiled a Rozgar Guarantee Scheme for the youth of Uttar Pradesh in the run up to the 2022 assembly polls. Delhi deputy CM Manish Sisodia said if AAP comes to power in UP, it will ensure employment for 10 lakh people each year. “We will give unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 per month to the unemployed till job is provided to them,” he added. The party, which till recently claimed it was open to poll alliance, is now preparing to go solo and will be highlighting the development agenda of the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government on education, health, etc., in its poll campaign. “The Yogi Adityanath government had come to power on the promise of giving employment to 70 lakh, but it has played a cruel joke on people. Now, the paper is leaked whenever there is a recruitment exam. In 2017, the paper for inspectors’ exam was leaked, in February 2018 the paper for the UPPCL exam was leaked, and in April 2018 the paper for the police exam was leaked. There have been multiple such cases over the past five years,” Sisodia said. The party’s employment scheme will cost the government over Rs 20,400 crore while the state’s current budget is Rs 5.50 lakh crore. The Delhi government is working to make youth capable of giving employment, not just getting employment, he said. Sisodia promised 80% reservation for people from UP in jobs. AAP MP and state in-charge Sanjay Singh said 34 lakh people are registered with the state’s employment exchange and hence the employment guarantee scheme will cost the state government Rs 1,700 crore each month. The party has already promised that if voted to power, it will provide up to 300 units of power free to every household in the state||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-promises-10l-jobs-per-yr-rs-5k-montly-aid-to-jobless/articleshow/88307357.cms||---
---||Delhi||Man, earlier held for double murder, arrested for fake Covid report to HC||New Delhi: A 37-year-old MBA graduate, who was earlier arrested for the murder of his girlfriend’s parents in 2019, has been arrested for submitting a fake Covid-19 report before Delhi High Court to get his parole extended. After the extension was rejected in March this year, he absconded and went underground, police said. “The accused has been identified as Prince Dixit, a resident of Gomti Nagar in Lucknow,” DCP (crime) Manoj C said. The 2019 double murder was discovered on March 8 when the cops received a call about a woman’s body lying near the drain in west Delhi’s Nangloi. An FIR was registered and the body was identified as that of Jageer Kaur (47), a resident of Nilothi Extension. Her husband, Gurmeet Singh’s body was also found packed in a suitcase on the opposite side of the drain in which the first body was found. During investigation, it was found that both the murders were planned and executed by the couple’s daughter, Davinder Kaur alias Sonia, Prince Dixit and two of their friends. The motive was to usurp their property. The accused were subsequently arrested and sent to jail. Dixit managed to get an interim bail on September 14 last year on the ground of taking care of his ailing mother. He had to surrender on March 15 this year as his bail extension was rejected, but he absconded and went underground. A crime branch team comprising inspector Arun Sindhu, head constable Gaurav and others found that Dixit was hiding in Karnal. A raid was conducted on December 14 and the accused was arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-earlier-held-for-double-murder-arrested-for-fake-covid-report-to-hc/articleshow/88307364.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Why non-vaxxed can’t take local trains, HC asks Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday directed Maharashtra chief secretary to explain the rationale for division of vaccinated and non-vaccinated persons for travel by local trains.  “The broader issue of the curtailing of fundamental rights of citizens who are not vaccinated to avail suburban train services and the rationale therefore need to be explained either by the state government or the state disaster management authority (SDMA),” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik. They were hearing a PIL by Firoze Mithiborwala and Yohan Tengra to strike down the state’s two August SOPs as discriminatory to those who are not vaccinated and to hold them violative of rights to equality, life and freedom of movement. Tengra’s advocate Nilesh Ojha argued those who have not taken vaccines should not be prohibited from accessing services. He cited foreign studies to show that persons who have been vaccinated have contracted Covid19. He said Omicron is spread by people who have taken two vaccines and are permitted to fly. “It shows that the vaccine is not effective against Omicron, which is a mild variant,” he added. The judges told Ojha he must not compare the situation in India with Europe which has a sparse population. The Chief Justice said , “We have crossed the second wave. There is no lockdown in this country. Though there is a lockdown there. We stand on a much better footing. Don't compare India with them. Let them take lessons from India.” Ojha pointed out that in Mumbai, Nagpur, Assam and Kerala, vaccinated persons were infected. Mithiborwala’s advocate Tanveer Nizam said compelling wearing of masks has resulted in cash being extracted for not wearing masks, “You mean to say they should be encouraged [not to wear masks]?” asked the Chief Justice. Nizam replied, “There is no proof that masks prevent Covid19.” Senior advocate Anil Anturkar, for the state, said what is only restricted is use of local trains by season ticket holders. He said the circular is meant for Mumbai and Pune which have local trains. He said there is no restriction of movement by two-wheeler, four-wheeler or on foot. Anturkar urged the court not to grant interim relief, saying, “Even one day relief may invite or accelerate the third wave. Somebody has to see to believe what happens in a Mumbai local,” he said. As the chief secretary is ex-officio chairperson of the state executive committee as well as member of the SDMA, the judges directed him to file the affidavit.

Former UPCC general secretary Sanjiv Singh, Congress leader Rita Singh, former BSP MLA from Khairagarh, Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha too switched over to the saffron bandwagon. One of the Congress old guards in UP, Tripathi was sacked from the party in 2019, reportedly for challenging decisions related to the UP Congress Committee that were taken by the All India Congress Committee. Tripathi is learnt to have expressed his resentment against the treatment being meted out to senior functionaries following the revamp in the party organisation. Tripathi had contested the 2012 assembly elections from Dibiyapur assembly seats in Auraiya only to have his deposits forfeited after securing only 2.56% votes. The seat was won by SP’s Pradeep Kumar. In 2017, the seat was given to SP as part of an alliance with the Congress. But this time, BJP candidate Lakhan Singh defeated Pradeep by a margin of around 12,000 votes.Tripathi has been training his guns at the party brass, especially national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/veteran-cong-leader-former-bsp-mla-others-join-bjp/articleshow/88307372.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On December 10, Murali R A, who had become a victim of such an extortion in Rayanahalli in Hiriyur taluk, filed a police complaint. The police later identified him as Rajashekharappa S, a 40-year-old a driver and resident of Kudligere in the Bhadravathi taluk of Shivamogga district. Murali told the police that while he was on a phone call on his bike, a man in a bike came up to him. He said he was a cop and started questioning him. Later, he snatched Murali’s cellphone and took Rs 1,000 from him after threatening him and sped away. Murali narrated this incident to Chitrahalli Gate police. Chitradurga SP Radhika G formed a team, headed by Holalkere inspector K N Raveesh, to catch the impostor. The team caught Rajashekharappa on the evening of December 14. He confessed before the police that he had extorted several people in the Chitrahalli Gate police station, Chikkajajur police station and Sri Rampura police station areas in Chitradurga district. He also said that he targeted boys and girls on bikes in parks and secluded places and snatched their valuables pretending to be a cop, SP Radhika added.

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Tigers clash all night, 1 found dead next morning||DEHRADUN: Roars of two tigers clashing with each other echoed all night on Monday, driving residents of Belpadav in the Terai-West forest division near Corbett Tiger Reserve in Kumaon to bolt their doors tightly and stay inside. Children, adults, and the elderly all spent the night in utter panic, worried that the animals might attack them. The next morning, tired villagers who had barely slept a wink the previous night, breathed a sigh of relief after they found the carcass of a tigress lying underneath a tree. She had sustained deep injuries and seemed badly bruised. Some tried to throw sticks at her, checking to see if she was alive. When they realised she had died, they informed the forest department. “We were scared to death all night because we kept hearing the loud roars. Even in the morning, we skipped venturing into the fields in search of fodder for our livestock until it was confirmed that the tigress was dead,” said 43-year-old Kusum Devi, one of the villagers of Belpadav. Officials said that forests in the region have a significant tiger population. Often, they said, fights were caused due to territorial disputes or in defence of cubs. "These fights can get so intense that they may claim lives. November to January is considered the breeding period of tigers. Any tigress with cubs would not like to be disturbed by a tiger. When that happens, it leads to infighting," one official said. The authorities ruled out the possibility of the tigress being attacked by a poacher. They said that body parts such as claws, canines, and hide were found intact. "In cases of hunting and poaching, marks on the body of the animal are also very different. The post-mortem confirmed the death due to infighting,” said Balwant Shahi, divisional forest officer, Terai West forest division. Another tigress was found dead on Monday in the Bankhera area of Terai West forest division. Authorities say she probably died due to a similar reason. Another feline had died in October as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tigers-clash-all-night-1-found-dead-next-morning/articleshow/88306084.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nagpur||Road to 100% first dose: Covid vaccination graph went up & down, but Nagpur Municipal Corporation held its ground||NAGPUR: Ashi Nagar zonal medical officer (ZMO) Dr Dipankar Bhivgade draws an imaginary graph using his fingers to explain the overall Covid vaccination status vis-a-vis the second wave, rumours, conspiracy theories and a projected third wave. Officially, the ZMO was the first beneficiary to receive Covishield dose in the city nearly 11 months ago on January 16, during the inaugural ceremony at NMC’s Pachpaoli Maternity Home. As the NMC achieved the target of administering the first dose to all eligible citizens on Tuesday, Dr Bhivgade recalls how initially even healthcare workers (HCWs) — the first priority group — were hesitant to take the vaccine developed in record time. “Healthcare workers were reluctant, but within a week or so all queued up to take the precious jab,” said Dr Bhivgade. By mid-February, the rush grew as the ongoing second wave became more evident. When the second wave started receding, footfall at the vaccination centres too dropped. By mid-December, all those delaying it took their first dose, Dr Bhivgade summed up. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, the officer who was delegated the task of implementing the vaccination drive across the city, said, “We tried our level best to protect the citizens. Entire medical team worked very hard and dedicatedly. We got very good support from AIIMS, GMCH, IGGMCH and all our hospital staff, and ZMOs.” Joshi always had his ears to the ground which helped him to address seamlessly all issues ranging from senior citizens sitting on the footpath to foreign-bound students seeking special vaccination drive. “It is the result of a perfect coordination under the guidance of commissioner, mayor and all our nagarsevaks (corporators),” said Joshi. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari said the civic body can’t forget the contribution of HCWs, NMC staff and all corporators in this drive. “We started with a limited number of centres, but soon vaccination was taking place at more than 150 places. We also provided doses to different organizations, bar association, journalists, bedridden and students on demand. Initially, the NMC also sent buses to ferry senior citizens to the centres, which were not close to their home,” he said. Tiwari added that he too would visit centres to personally monitor the progress. Following poor coverage in minority areas, the civic body started reaching out to intellectuals and religious heads to convince the unvaxxed people. The mayor said he too visited minority community areas to remove doubts regarding the vaccination. “Gradually, we gained trust and could reach the target. Now, we are awaiting vaccine for kids to ensure entire city is protected,” he said. Among some crucial decisions which worked out for the NMC, the mayor said, was the threat to stop free doses after November 30, Kavach Kundal, centre for handicapped, ‘Har ghar dastak’ etc which expedited the drive. A rethink on 84 days gap for Covishield can speed-up the second dose too, said Tiwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/road-to-100-1st-dose-vax-graph-went-up-down-but-nmc-held-its-ground/articleshow/88306079.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

As per the official data, the city has over 2.07 lakh target beneficiaries, who are yet to take the first dose of the Covid vaccine along with 71,582 others who have are yet to take the second dose even after the required gap between the two doses is completed. They are considered defaulters. Special squads — Nagarik Mitra Pathakas — which were formed earlier by the AMC will slap the ‘defaulters’ with a fine. The squad will comprise ex-servicemen. Half of the fine amount (Rs 500) will go to the city police while AMC will keep the rest of it. Dr Paras Mandlecha, the health officer with AMC on Wednesday said the target beneficiaries should complete their vaccination to avoid any unpleasant action. “The vaccination facility is available around-the-clock at some of the centres for the benefit of citizens. Considering the rising number of Covid cases involving Omicron strain in Maharashtra, 100% vaccination is a must to achieve for all,” he said. Stating that both Covishield and Covaxin are available in sufficient numbers, the health authorities said beneficiaries should visit their nearest centres to complete the vaccination. The municipal limits of Aurangabad have a target population of 10.5 lakh for the ongoing vaccination drive, of them, 80% have received the first dose while the percentage of fully vaccinated beneficiaries is 45%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-than-2-7lakh-vaccine-defaulters-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/88305245.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Akhilesh says he is not averse to idea of Dy CMs||Lucknow: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday dropped broad hints that he was not averse to the idea and tradition of appointment of deputy chief ministers in a state. He also announced that he would get a caste census done within three months of government formation after the Samajwadi Party is voted to power in 2022 assembly polls. “The BJP has started a tradition of appointing deputy CMs. Andhra has many deputy chief ministers. Our constitution does not stop us from appointing deputy CMs. So it is natural that political parties will take advantage of it,” Akhilesh said when pointed out that the BJP claims of having two deputy CMs in UP. Responding to a query on what was his stand on the issue of appointment of deputy CMs, Akhilesh said: “Agar samman dene ke liye vichar karna para to vichar kiya jayega (… In case we have to appoint a deputy CM to honoUr someone, the option will be considered),” he said talking to a news channel in Jaunpur. Political observers feel that Akhilesh’s comment on being open to the concept of deputy chief ministers will only strengthen his association with his major alliance partners who have joined hands with the SP in the run-up to the 2022 assembly polls. Earlier in the day, addressing media persons onboard his Vijay Yatra rath, Akhilesh set a three-month timeframe for getting caste census done in Uttar Pradesh from the day SP government was formed in the 2022 assembly polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-says-he-is-not-averse-to-idea-of-dy-cms/articleshow/88307382.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Over 500 weightlifters from 14 states will vie for top honours in the event to be held at Katargam Community Hall. The meet is being jointly organized by the city police and the Sports Association of Gujarat with the slogan ‘No to Drugs, Yes to Sports’. In 2020 city police had organized a state-level Powerlifting and Bodybuilding Championship. “Police are organizing sports events to divert youth away from drugs and crime. If young people want to get addicted then there is no better high than sports,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar. Senior powerlifting champions who have won national level events in the past will attend the event to motivate the participants. “A large number of young people from the city are getting associated with the police in our initiatives against drugs. We are organizing various sports events in different parts of the city,” Tomar added. Currently, a cricket tournament is being held in the Limbayat area of the city. “It being a national event local sports persons will get to rub shoulders with champion players. Also, sports persons from city and state will get an opportunity to interact with athletes from other states,” said a police officer. As part of its ongoing campaign ‘No Drugs in Surat City’, the city police have seized drugs worth Rs 4.83 crore since September 2020 from within the city limits. Total 144 persons were arrested in 40 cases registered with different police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/police-to-host-natl-powerlifting-championship/articleshow/88306101.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC finds 249 new tuberculosis cases in house surveys||MUMBAI: A special door-to-door drive to detect tuberculosis (TB) in November found 249 new cases, said BMC officials on Wednesday. Of these, 24 had multi drug-resistant TB that requires longer and expensive treatment. Similar drives carried out by the BMC in 2020 and 2019 found 434 and 170 cases, respectively. These special detection drives are important as India has announced a goal to eliminate TB in the country by 2025. In Mumbai — described as the world’s TB capital after “totally drug-resistant” TB cases immune to all known TB medications were detected here in 2012 — detections dropped significantly in 2020 due to Covid lockdown that prevented people from travelling. In 2020, only 43,319 cases were notified in Mumbai as against 60,465 in 2019. In 2021 so far, the BMC has notified 53,877 cases. “Of these, 33,738 are still on treatment,” said a public health department doctor. Around 10% of the total TB cases in Mumbai are either ‘multi-drug-resistant’ or ‘extremely drug-resistant’ needing treatment that continues for up to 24 months. A senior BMC bureaucrat said the lower detections in 2021 as compared to the pre-Covid days could be due to the fact that many patients from outside the city limits could not come to Mumbai for treatment and detection. “We get patients from Raigad or Palghar or Virar who travel to our centres for free medications every month. However, due to Covid, it seems many such patients didn’t travel far for treatment,” he said. A recent World Health Organisation report showed that registrations in India had dropped significantly in the last 20 months. Failure to register (or notify) means the patient doesn’t get access to free testing or medicines. Moreover, a patient could spread the disease to others if there is a delay in starting treatment; one TB patient can infect 15 others in a year. In November, 876 civic teams screened 17 lakh people across the city’s 24 wards, and identified 11,416 TB suspects. “These suspected patients were given special vouchers that entitled them to free testing at designated diagnostic centres,” said a BMC official. TB detections had come to a near standstill during the first wave of Covid, resulting in many people ignoring their symptoms or being unable to access treatment.  Although there was fear that TB patients would be most vulnerable to Covid, the BMC has found that very few cases of co-infections were found in the city. TB specialists said this could be due to medications and stringent surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-finds-249-new-tb-cases-in-house-surveys/articleshow/88308045.cms||---
---||Delhi||IGI lab says trying to cut rapid RT-PCR test cost||NEW DELHI: Genestrings Diagnostics, which operates the Covid testing lab at Delhi Airport, late on Wednesday night said it is trying "ways to reduce cost". A rapid RT-PCR test at IGIA currently costs Rs 3,500. The statement came hours after the Maharashtra government came to flyers' rescue by getting Mumbai Airport to drop rapid RT-PCR test price from Rs 3,900 to Rs 1,975, from Wednesday. Genestrings Diagnostics COO said Chetan Kohli said: "In line with the recent price capping at Karnataka and Maharashtra, we’re also working diligently with our equipment and kit suppliers to find ways to reduce cost. The focus here is not on profitability but rather feasibility and ensuring quality output. While a large proportion of costs goes in procurement of testing kits, there are unseen costs as well in case of an airport testing facility." "Nonetheless, we’re hopeful that as a natural progression of reduction in kit costs, which we have already witnessed in case of RTPCR, we’ll also be able to bring down the costs considerably, soon," Kohli said. Like Mumbai, a rapid RT-PCR at Delhi’s IGIA used to cost Rs 3,900 till last month and then was reduced to Rs 3,500. But despite that recent cut, Delhi Airport has the second steepest cost for rapid RT-PCR tests among big Indian airports. Hyderabad Airport, also run by the GMR Group like Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), has the highest among busy airports (see table) at Rs 3,900. State-run Airports Authority of India has affordable test rates at Kolkata and Chennai. Delhi Airport sources say Mumbai price drop move came following a government (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) directive. Chetan Kohli, COO of Genestrings Diagnostics, the Covid testing lab at Delhi Airport, had recently told TOI: “The rapid kits coming from Abbott India are very, very expensive, costing upwards of Rs 2,000. There has been a slight price reduction since the second wave. Abbott has not reduced prices (recently) despite us being the biggest buyers in the country." An Abbott India spokesperson said: "Abbott’s ID NOW test is a fast molecular point-of-care rapid test that delivers reliable results when and where they're needed.

---||Delhi||Babasaheb thoughts resonate in the theme song of musical||NEW DELHI: The Delhi government launched on Wednesday the theme song for the musical play on the life of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar, which is scheduled to kick off on January 5 and continue for 50 days. The song, “Bhimachi Jai”, has been composed by music band Indian Ocean. Reflecting the philosophy of Ambedkar’s life, its lyrics promises, “Jab tak gann ka maan rahega, jab tak Samvidhaan rahega, jab tak Hindustan rahega, Babasaheb ka naam rahega.” During its launch, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said, “The Delhi government is the first government in India that is organising such a grand event to introduce the legacy of Babasaheb to every child. Everyone across the country will be familiarised with the life of Babasaheb and his contribution in laying the foundation stone of modern India.” The song, Sisodia said, will help in explaining to people the teachings of Ambedkar. The musical play is being organised to mark the 75th year of Independence so that the country can express its gratitude towards Babasaheb. Sisodia even asked people from other states to come to Delhi to watch the play. “The play will obviously be for free, but you will be required to book flights to come to Delhi,” he said. Such a grand play has never been organised in the country earlier, claimed the minister. “Until now, this tradition was limited to European countries where governments organise plays on a large scale to ensure that the citizens and tourists could recognise the great personalities of their countries and their contribution.” Indian Ocean artiste Rahul Ram said the initiative was commendable. “Such initiatives should be taken up in other parts of the country as well... The entire team of Indian Ocean thanks the Delhi government for this opportunity,” said Ram. Music composer Amit Kilam said the youth had a unique enthusiasm for music, which was a powerful tool to get any message across to everyone. “We are happy that by joining this campaign, we will work to spread Ambedkar’s message of equality, harmony and brotherhood to the people through music.” Sisodia said well-known personalities were involved in the direction, art and creation of this play, for which a 100-foot stage has been built at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/babasaheb-thoughts-resonate-in-the-theme-song-of-musical/articleshow/88307380.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SC disposes of Munde plea in govt land purchase case||Mumbai: The Supreme Court last week disposed of the special leave petition filed by state cabinet minister Dhananjay Munde and others, who are facing a probe for alleged fraudulent purchase of government land in Beed district, after they decided to withdraw it. The SC has asked the police to complete the probe. On December 8, while rejecting Munde’s petition challenging the 2019 Bombay high court order directing an FIR to be registered, the SC said, “Looking at the allegation in the FIR, we direct the investigation agency to...conclude the investigation earliest.” Munde was not available for comment. His cellphone was switched off. It was alleged that the disputed 17-acre land plot at Pus village belonged to the state government and was given to the Belkhandi Math as a ‘gift’ to its chief priest, but Munde purchased it from the legal heirs of the chief priest illegally in 2012. A local resident approached the police to file a case against Munde, his wife and others for fraudulently purchasing the government land, but the police didn’t entertain his complaint so he approached the HC in 2019. The court then passed a directive to Beed police to lodge a case of cheating and forgery against the NCP leader and 13 others. On Wednesday, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya submitted the documents, along with an FIR copy, to Enforcement Directorate (ED) and requested the agency to investigate a money-laundering angle in the case. In another development, on Tuesday, a few RTI activists from Beed, through their advocate Asim Sarode, submitted a written complaint to the ED office in Mumbai, requesting to investigate BJP MLC Suresh Dhas’s role in the fraudulent sale of ‘Devasthan Inam Land’, part of which also comes under Wakf Board, worth Rs 1,000 crore. They submitted a copy of the FIR registered at Ambhora police station, in which two people have been named as accused, but Dhas is not mentioned. Dhas’s personal staff said he was busy in local election campaign, and he has already refused the allegation. But Sarode alleged, “During the previous government when Dhas was a minister, he misused his position and in connivance of government officials changed the status and title of the non-transferable inam land meant for religious and socials benefit of a different community. Later, Dhas, through his relatives, staff and close party workers, purchased these lands. The ED must investigate him and senior politicians who had supported him in the fraud for money laundering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-disposes-of-munde-plea-in-govt-land-purchase-case/articleshow/88308063.cms||Vijay V Singh

Sources in the government confirmed that the vaccine will be available from January if all goes as per plan. As of now, Covidshield, Covaxin and Sputnik are available in the state. Earlier on Monday, the Union health and family welfare ministry had agreed to launch the vaccine in seven states, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Health sources said the vaccine will be initially available in 14 districts — Agra, Aligarh, Ayodhya, Azamgarh, Bareilly, Ghaziabad, Gorakhpur, Kanpur Nagar, Lucknow, Meerut, Moradabad, Prayagraj, Saharanpur and Varanasi. Member, UP state task force on Covid-19 vaccine and health officer, Unicef UP, Dr Praful Bharadwaj said that NTAGI had given emergency use authorization to the three-dose-vaccine on August 20. The doses are given on zero, 28th and 56th days. “This is the first vaccine that can be given to persons above 12 years of age. However, the government is yet to decide if the same can be used for children or not,” he said. Zydus Cadila officials had earlier said that the company could manufacture 40-50 million doses by end of January 2022. Dr Bharadwaj said the biggest advantage with this vaccine is that it is an almost painless, needleless vaccine which is something that scares many. “The method also makes it more acceptable among children,” he added. Over 12 cr partially vaccinated in UPIn another milestone, the number of partially vaccinated persons in UP crossed the 12-crore mark which is highest in any state. This means that over 80% of the eligible population in the state has taken at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, the total number of Covid-19 tests conducted in the state crossed the nine-crore mark. Health officials stated that new cases were reported in just five districts in the past 24 hours, while 40 districts remained free from any active case. They advised people of the state to adhere to the Covid-19 prevention protocol in individual and social interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-roll-out-zydus-cadila-vaccine-in-jan/articleshow/88307412.cms||Shailvee Sharda

But, the party said nothing much has emerged out of the meeting and it has very little to worry about. The party unit was watching KCR’s discussions with Stalin to party’s national president JP Nadda, Union home minister Amit Shah and Telangana party affairs incharge Tarun Chugh. “There was a debate within the party about the CM’s visit to TN,” a party insider said. However, party leaders claimed the central leadership did not take the developments seriously. The party believes that efforts to establish a non-Congress coalition will prove to be futile. “If we look at KCR’s meeting with Stalin and his words, there is a grim prospect because DMK has always been with Congress while the TRS sees Congress as a rival party just like Mamata Banerjee’s TMC,” said BJP leader NV Subhash. According to BJP insiders, whenever KCR is under pressure, he rakes up the federal front issue and then goes silent. “We consider the recent meeting and posturing as a diversionary attempt by the TRS,” Subhash said. DK Aruna, party national vice-president, said people were happy with Narendra Modi’s leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nothing-much-to-worry-about-kcr-stalin-meet-says-bjp/articleshow/88306859.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kannur University: Kerala HC upholds VC’s reappointment||KOCHI: In a reprieve to the state government caught in a tussle with governor Arif Mohammed Khan over political interference in universities, the Kerala high court on Wednesday upheld the reappointment of Gopinath Ravindran as vice-chancellor of Kannur University by holding that there was no violation of law in it. Justice Amit Rawal dismissed a petition filed by senate member Premachandran Keezhoth and academic council member Shino P Jose alleging that the reappointment was in violation of provisions of the university statute. The court also dismissed an application, filed as part of the petition, for its scrutiny of documents with the governor, related to the reappointment. Turning down the petition challenging the reappointment, the court said Ravindran was appointed vice-chancellor of the university in 2017 by following the stipulated procedure. The petitioners had contended that the university statute doesn’t allow appointment of a person aged above 60 as vice-chancellor and the procedure for appointment, such as forming a selection committee, was not followed. The court accepted the state government’s contention that the statute does not specify an age limit or procedure for reappointment. Welcoming the decision, higher education minister R Bindu defended her interventions in the reappointment but said she did not want to publicly react to allegations levelled against her. The opposition had been demanding her resignation in the wake of reports that she had written to the governor twice in favour of Ravindran's reappointment. Ravindran also welcomed the decision, saying it showed that there was nothing improper in his reappointment. Khan had, in his letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, cited the reappointment as an instance of political appointment in universities affecting the academic standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kannur-university-hc-upholds-vcs-reappointment/articleshow/88306860.cms||---

The university was not demoralised by the violence which took place two years ago on December 15, she claimed. “It is a day to remember, but we have moved forward. Had we been demoralised that day, then we would have lost. This (the NAAC ranking) is an aggressive reply from us stating we did not lose two years ago,” Akhtar said. Speaking about the steps taken by the university to improve its ranking, Akhtar said, “Active steps were taken throughout by all the university stakeholders concerned. Even during the pandemic, our teachers were trained to hold online classes, unlike other universities. The university also saw good placements despite the pandemic.” Stating that the varsity was not competing with either the Jawaharlal Nehru University or Indira Gandhi National Open University — the other universities in the capital region with an A++ grade — Akhtar added, “Ours is a multi-faculty university and it cannot be compared with the others. We generally do not get the cream students, but when they graduate, they are the best in their fields.” The vice-chancellor also said that with a minority institution getting the highest grade, the university’s value has also increased manifold. “This rank will also help us in getting funding for various projects. We are also in touch with the government to approve a medical college. We are now confident that such projects will also take off thanks to our improved rankings. We cannot relax now and need to ensure that we maintain our position,” said Akhtar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vc-a-grade-by-naac-aggressive-response-to-critics/articleshow/88307413.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Autopsy revealed the animal was beaten up with lathi, iron rods and even sharp weapons and was finally battered with boulders, which led to the death of the animal protected under schedule I of Wildlife Protection Act. Soon after the finding, the Jaldapara wildlife division employed a sniffer dog that led to the nearby Dukhua labour line, where, foresters believe, the animal was beaten. “From the signs it seems the animal was first attacked at Dukhua Line. The leopard somehow managed to drag itself out of the area and reach near Gergenda primary school. There the animal was killed, using boulders. A hunt has been launched to catch the culprits,” a senior forest official said. More than 100 leopards have been rescued from north Bengal over the past six years and in most cases, the animals, covered as a co-predator under the tiger conservation programme, were rescued from tea gardens. Garden bushes provide natural cover to these animals, which often hide in the drains, especially the females when they are about to give birth. The heap of leaves in the drains act as natural cushion for them. They usually take refuge in tea estates in the winter when there is no tea production. In many cases, this leads to man-animal conflict, in which leopards are often killed. While in the garden, leopards often steal goats, pigs and other small animals belonging to the garden labourers and villagers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/leopard-beaten-to-death-in-tea-estate/articleshow/88306870.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

He was only against the wrongs happening around him,” said Farzana Yasmeen of her brother, Meeran Haider, a PhD scholar of Jamia Millia Islamia who is in jail for involvement in the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens. Speaking at an event to mark two years of the violence at Jamia, Yasmeen, however, was optimistic her brother would get “justice”. At the event at Press Club of India on Wednesday, organised by ‘concerned citizens and students of Delhi’, activists recalled the night of December 15, 2019, when police entered the Jamia campus to quell a student protest against CAA and NRC. In the violence, several students were injured. Even as riots broke out in northeast Delhi, the protest continued, only to be called off with the Covid outbreak. Many of the student activists were arrested. Some are out on bail, some still in jail, Haider among the latter. Haider was charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. His sister said, “It is part of the constitutional right to fight wrong or injustice. My brother was doing just that.” With Yasmeen was Saima Khan, daughter of Salim Khan, another person charged under UAPA in a rioting case. Khan said, “During the three months of the lockdown, we didn’t know where my father was. He is not a terrorist, just a simple man running a shop.” Akhtarista Ansari, a student activist involved in the CAA protest, recalled the night when the police ran riot in a masjid, reading rooms and libraries at Jamia. “That was the day when students were treated as criminals. But it was the cops who behaved like terrorists. Today, it is important to remember all our friends who are still in jail. Our fight will not stop until they are freed,” said Ansari. Anugya Jha, 4th year law student, said, “That day, I realised what it means to be a student of a minority institution. That day is not just for us to remember, but for everybody, never to be forgotten.” Writer Arundhati Roy, the chief guest, hit out at the government. “The state wants to decide whether you can be called a citizen. It was in Hitler’s Nazi regime in 1925 that a similar thing was done,” Roy said. “The poor people, Dalits, Adivasis and women don’t often have documents, so, CAA/NRC is a move by a fascist government to cut the ground from under the feet of citizens.” Some members of Jamia’s fact-finding committee questioned why till date no case had been registered against the cops and paramilitary personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jamia-remembers-the-night-of-horrors/articleshow/88307449.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Mumbai||BMC recalled 117 ‘tainted’ officials for Covid duty: RTI||MUMBAI: The BMC has reinstated 117 officials, many of whom were suspended over graft charges, citing shortage of staff to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. According to data from the BMC’s enquiries department received under the RTI Act, even engineers and officials from outside the health department have been called back. Among the 117 who were recalled include assistant engineer M G Shelar and junior engineer Dharmaraj Shinde, who were found guilty in the BMC’s departmental enquiry (DE) into the 2017 Kamala Mills fire and were ordered to be removed from municipal service, and sub-engineer Dinesh Mahale, who was also found guilty and punished with severe reduction in pay. In April 2020, then BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi had issued orders to reinstate all engineers who were under suspension in view of shortage of staff to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. These engineers were to be assigned duties at quarantine centres and Covid hospitals and their suspension apparently was taken back only temporarily. “Although the reinstatement should have been of staff related to healthcare services alone, 53 staffers from the solid waste management (SWM) department, 23 from the city engineer’s department, six each from water, security and fire departments, 17 from health department and six from three civic hospitals were taken back on duty,” said Jeetendra Ghadge of The Young Whistleblowers Foundation, who filed the RTI application. “In April 2020, the BMC had issued another circular making 75% attendance mandatory in BMC departments, mainly to maintain social distancing. So, it made no sense to reinstate suspended officials from the engineering cadre and SWM department and at the same time order 75% attendance. Now there is no need for these officials; they must be sent back into suspension,” Ghadge said. While some officials were suspended following cases of misconduct and negligence, others were removed from service after being trapped by the anti-corruption bureau in graft cases. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said that the BMC should scrap the May 2020 circular reinstating the two engineers indicted in the Kamla Mills fire probe. “The two engineers were not suspended, but ordered to be removed from municipal service. Those charged with negligence and dereliction of duty that led to the death of 14 people should not have been reinstated; they must be dismissed from service immediately,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-recalled-117-tainted-officials-for-covid-duty-in-mumbai-rti/articleshow/88307731.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

There was no confirmation by Indian authorities of any plan to hold such a summit. The claim by Ushakov followed President Vladimir Putin's virtual summit with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in which, according to Kremlin, the topic of cooperation in the Russia-India-China format was addressed. Russian TASS news agency quoted Ushakov as saying the leaders "agreed to continue exchanging opinions in this regard and to endeavour to hold the next summit within the RIC framework in the near future. "Putin informed Xi Jinping about the visit to New Delhi on December 6 in this context," the Kremlin's spokesperson said. PM Narendra Modi has had no bilateral summit with Xi since the ongoing LAC stand-off started in April last year and India has repeatedly stated that there cannot be business as usual with China until the LAC disengagement is complete. As TASS said in its report, the last meeting of leaders of the three countries in the RIC format took place in June, 2019 on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka. "The topic of cooperation within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation was also discussed in detail," Ushakov said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/russia-india-china-may-hold-summit-soon-says-putin-aide/articleshow/88308298.cms||---

A recent communication from Karnataka State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) is indicating that the state higher education department has curtailed the academic autonomy of universities. According to the latest instruction issued by KSHEC to vice-chancellors, they are warned against changing the curriculum content. The VCs are informed that the council has received complaints that the board of studies (BOSs) are diluting the subject content and affecting drastic changes in the contents of the core papers as per their will and wish. It has been warned that if they do so, it will affect the students’ credit transfer and mobility. It will also create equivalence problems. The contents of the discipline core papers of any subject shall remain more or less the same in almost all universities. The VCs are warned against teachers diluting content just because they cannot teach them. All vice chancellors are also asked to adhere to the national patterns. “Even in the most developed countries like USA and UK, the teachers are given the autonomy to design the curriculum. All these years in Karnataka, BoSs were preparing the curriculum framework according to the local needs. However, this year, it has been imposed by the KSHEC. It has affected the autonomy,” said a senior professor. According to a lecturer from Chamarajanagar, the syllabus for first-year degree colleges is yet to be notified officially. When contacted, University of Mysore vice-chancellor G Hemantha Kumar denied any major problems in the implementation of NEP 2020. “When the semester system was introduced, there was protests for nearly a year. A few are making complaints assuming problems in future,” he said. “There may be some teething problems. All will get resolved soon,” he said. “NEP has a philosophy. If it is not followed properly, NEP will become another ordinary exercise. To reap the benefits of the system, we need to implement the new system properly,” he said. KSHEC vice chairman B Thimmegowda denied all allegations. “I am available to clarify any doubts. The curriculum committees had members drawn from all the universities, autonomous colleges, subject experts. So, all these complaints are meaningless and baseless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/questions-over-nep-curtailingacademic-autonomy-of-varsities/articleshow/88305321.cms||---

The proposed project, estimated to cost Rs 16,000 crore, has already been given in-principle approval by the Railway Board and the railway ministry. “The state government has sanctioned its share of 20%. The proposal for raising 60% through equity has also been sanctioned. The proposal is lying with the railway ministry for the past six months,” Godse said. In his reply, minister of railways Ashwini Vaishnaw said he would discuss the project with the MP and take it forward. On the other hand, the farmers whose land will be either bought through dialogue or acquired for the project have demanded better value for the land. The farmers are demanding compensation equal to five times the land value – just as was given to the land owners in case of Samruddhi Expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/godse-seeks-final-nod-for-railway-track/articleshow/88305322.cms||Abhilash Botekar

A police officer said that it was a ‘big catch’. One of those arrested on Monday was a native of Kerala. A cop said, “All these years, we nabbed only miscreants who felled the trees, and were involved in transporting them. We never seized such a huge cache of sandalwood earlier.” Acting on a tip-off, police barred the way of a utility vehicle transporting sandalwood logs. The two people in the vehicle were arrested at a junction near Pulakeshi Road, falling the jurisdiction of Mandi police station. Police said that both the individuals nabbed were in their 20s – one of them was from Mangaluru, while the other was from Kerala. “They had stored the sandalwood logs, each weighing around 500g to 3,000g, inside a hidden chamber in the vehicle,” police said. The duo was ferrying sandalwood logs from Mysuru to Bengaluru, when sleuths of the City Crime Branch waylaid the vehicle. Police are yet to ascertain the scope of the operation, and the other individuals involved in the same. A statement released to the press by the Mysuru city police commissioner pegs the worth of the seized loot at Rs 1 crore, with each log estimated to cost Rs 26,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/500g-sandalwood-seized-duo-held-in-mysuru/articleshow/88305326.cms||---

According to the latest health department records, so far 1,165 dengue cases have been confirmed in Agra district, this year. This is, in fact, the highest number of dengue cases reported in the district in one year. The maximum number of cases were reported in the months of September and October. Over 100 people suffering dengue-like symptoms and high fever have died in the district in the past four months. A majority of them were children. However, according to the health department records, only seven dengue patients have died in the district. In 2018, 190 dengue cases were reported in Agra district, 144 in 2019 and only 25 cases in 2020. This year, the spread of the DENV-2 variant which is the most potent variant of dengue resulted in the maximum number of cases. District disease surveillance officer Dhruv Kumar said, “Over 30,000 samples of patients with fever have been tested in the last five months. Out of these, 1,165 cases of dengue have been confirmed. Health department teams are still conducting surveys in the rural areas to identify patients suffering from fever and help them in getting the required treatment. Cleanliness work and anti-larvae spraying is being done in the villages to prevent the further spread of dengue. With the drop in temperature, the number of new cases have significantly declined in the last one month." Additional director of the health department, AK Singh, said, “The effect of dengue infection remains in patients for a period of 21 days. Further drop in temperature will stop mutation of dengue virus. The situation is completely under control. There are vacant beds available for dengue patients in government hospitals across the region. People need to be on alert during the next 10 days. Mosquitoes move indoors as the temperature outside is cold and not suitable for them. It is good to use a mosquito net while sleeping. Special care needs to be taken for children.” The health department records say, so far, over 6,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra division. Out of these the majority are reported in Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria and scrub typhus were also reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dengue-cases-continue-to-rise-in-agra-dist-tally-crosses-1100-mark/articleshow/88305328.cms||Deepak Lavania

These seven players — Promea Therapeutics, Huwel Life Sciences, Akriti Oculoplasty, Arka Engineers, SVP Techno Engineers, Elvikon and Rees Medilife — will be generating around 1,300 jobs in the region. Telangana IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao, who inaugurated the facilities on Wednesday, said the Medical Devices Park in Sultanpur, since its launch in 2017, has attracted over 50 companies that have committed an investment of Rs 1,424 crore and total employment of around 7,000 direct jobs. Stating that the park has grown despite Covid-induced slowdown, KTR said, “We aim to make this park not just a global factory for the world but a global medtech innovation ecosystem.” Medical devices manufacturing has been identified as one of the key focus areas by the state government as this segment has immense growth opportunities. India currently meets nearly 80% of its requirements via imports from countries such as Germany, US, China, Singapore and Netherlands, among others, offering a good opportunity for the state government to attract investments. “Our focus is not only helping the medtech industry establish their manufacturing center here but also supporting innovation and R&D, which will ultimately lead to large scale manufacturing. And hence, we have adopted an end-to-end approach for promoting growth in this sector with a larger thrust on promoting design and development of innovative medical devices,” he said. He also pointed out that Sahajanand Medical Technologies that is setting up one of largest stent manufacturing units in Asia at Sultanpur park is set to be inaugurated soon. Even B Braun, that invested more than Rs 100 crore in the state, is planning to scale up operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/7-cos-set-up-units-at-medical-devices-park-in-sultanpur/articleshow/88306877.cms||---

In his plea, Pantnagar resident Keshav Kumar Pasi has said that the proposed airport should not be built on the university land and should instead come up at about 76,000 thousand acres barren land in the foothills of Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar. Pantnagar already has an airport. But to boost tourism and the industrial sector in Kumaon, another airport was proposed. Pasi said the new airport will affect the functioning of the university, which was established in 1957.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Drunk driving on wrong side hits 2-wheeler, infant killed||MUMBAI: Irfan Pathan’s hand trembles as he swipes his mobile phone screen and an image of his five-month-old son, Arfan, appears. The infant was travelling with his parents on the family’s two-wheeler on Sunday when an inebriated motorist, driving in the wrong direction, rammed his SUV into them. Arfan battled for his life for several hours at a hospital before he succumbed later that night. “I could smell liquor in the motorist’s breath,” said Irfan, his voice breaking. “Nobody should have to lose their child this way.” While the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act has hiked fines for drunk driving from Rs 2,000 to Rs 10,000, there have barely been any police checks on the street since the Covid-19 outbreak began. Meanwhile, wrong-side driving has reached enormous proportions, witnessed even on express highways in Mumbai. The Pathans reside in Goregaon East and planned to meet relatives in Kurla on Sunday. Irfan was riding the scooter while his wife, Sania, sat pillion carrying Arfan. They had not ventured very far from home when an SUV hurtled towards them from the wrong direction near Lakshdham School. “The motorist couldn’t control the vehicle. He first hit the Pathans’ scooter and continued to plough ahead, hitting an autorickshaw next. The auto turned turtle from the impact,” said a police officer. Sania and Arfan were thrown off the scooter and suffered injuries. A crowd of bystanders gathered and caught hold of the motorist. “I was furious with the motorist but Arfan had hurt his head and I knew we had little time,” said Irfaan. He dialled a cousin and took his help to admit Arfan to a local private hospital. The infant was critical though, and had to be moved to Nanavati Hospital at Vile Parle shortly. Treatment was started but Arfan could not make it through the night. TimesViewThe Traffic Police's sustained campaign against drunk driving over the past decade had brought down fatalities and non-fatal injuries considerably. But the pandemic applied brakes on the campaign. The drive needs to be resumed with no further delay. Strict enforcement and a re-look at street design could help tackle instances of wrong-side driving.Dindoshi police booked the motorist, Sunil Yadav, under provisions of the IPC and Motor Vehicles Act. Yadav (32) is a driver with a private company. He had planned to meet a friend and downed some drinks at home before setting out in his company’s car. A medical test detected alcohol in his blood, police said. As the offence is bailable, the court released him on Monday. Irfan said his wife was unconsolable and they are seeking exemplary punishment for the motorist. “I have identified a few eyewitnesses and want their statements to be recorded by the police so that the gravity of the offence can be established,” he said. Activist A V Shenoy with the Mumbai Mobility Forum said traffic offences need to be categorised into ‘most severe’, ‘severe’ and ‘less severe’ depending on the risk they pose to the life and safety of other road users. “For the ‘most severe’ offences category, punishment must be swift and stringent, otherwise there will be no deterrent effect,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-drunk-driving-on-wrong-side-hits-2-wheeler-infant-killed/articleshow/88307755.cms||Nitasha Natu

Karnataka issued guidelines to all airlines that passengers flying to the state from Maharashtra have to furnish reports of RT-PCR test, conducted less than 72 hours ago, confirming that they are not infected. The passengers must produce the result of the RT-PCR test regardless of their vaccination status. Dakshina Kannada district nodal officer Dr Ashok laid the blame for the present situation. “They allow flyers to board the flight without furnishing the report of the test. As a result, passengers create trouble for the staff at the airport. There have been instances wherein passengers have thrown money at airport staff when asked for the results of their RT-PCR test,” Dr Ashok said. The officer, however, pointed out that passengers flying into Mangaluru on an emergency were exempted from the rule. “But they have to be tested on arriving at MIA. A facility has been set up for this exclusive purpose. Passengers flying to Dakshina Kannada from Maharashtra, regardless of whether they have received one or both the doses of the Covid vaccination, must furnish reports of the RT-PCR test. Most passengers try to bypass this by showing us certificates of their vaccination status, which is not acceptable,” Dr Ashok added. Following many such instances, officials at the MIA had written to authorities in Mumbai, asking them to adhere to the guidelines stipulated by the Karnataka government for flyers from Maharashtra. “Such incidents have reduced recently, but they have not stopped all together. When airlines can subject 2% of passengers from countries categorised ‘not risky’ flying to India at random, why can’t all passengers from Maharashtra be asked for RT-PCR test reports?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/passengers-vent-ire-at-mia-staff-when-asked-for-rt-pcr-test-report/articleshow/88305337.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Vadodara||Golden Bridge: Portal to heritage||Vadodara: It is believed that when it comes to sacred rivers of India, even the holy Ganga comes in the form of a cow for a purifying bath in Narmada, whose very name means the ‘giver of pleasure.’ That’s a saying! But for thousands of commuters crossing just 1.41 km stretch from Bharuch to Ankleshwar and vice-versa used to be hardly a pleasurable experience. Noxious fumes emitted by vehicles, traffic snarls, deafening honking and hours long frustrating traffic jams during the peak hours just to cross river Narmada hardly provided any opportunity to commuters to enjoy the blissful sight of Gujarat’s lifeline Narmada passing beneath. This has changed as hundreds of morning walkers, heritage enthusiasts and pedallers are experiencing a whiff of fresh air on the magnificent British-built ‘Golden Bridge’ in Bharuch that has turned into a literal ‘heritage walk’ since it ‘retired’ this July. For 140 years, this rail bridge-turned-road bridge acted as an umbilical cord between the twin towns of Bharuch and Ankleshwar on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad national highway in South Gujarat. Now, it has turned into a means to connect with heritage, health and nature. After the swanky new ‘Narmada Maiya’ four-lane road bridge built in 66 months for Rs 430 crore was inaugurated in July this year, the ‘Golden Bridge’ has suddenly turned into a walker’s paradise. “There is nothing that can match the 45 minutes morning walk that I enjoy daily on Golden Bridge,” said Sanjay Shah, 53, a Bharuch resident, who is into industrial trading business. Cycling enthusiasts have got a new venue too with Ankleshwar Bicycle Club with 220 members regularly pedaling on this bridge. Except the sprinkled two-wheelers and autos from nearby villages, one can see pedestrians trooping down the bridge, taking leisurely walks end-to-end, admiring the beauty of the engineering marvel atop the Narmada as it meanders to mingle in a misty haze with the Gulf of Khambhat, around 50 km westwards. “It is an engineering marvel, an architectural masterpiece that has survived through the ages. It should be declared as a national heritage monument for tourists,” said retired government employee Shreyansh Shah, who recollects how he flung coins out of his pocket into the river while crossing the bridge as a prayer for good luck to ‘Maa Reva’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/golden-bridge-portal-to-heritage/articleshow/88306245.cms||Prashant Rupera

A purported video of the incident went viral on social media. The accused had already stolen a battery of a tractor before being caught by locals, claimed police. The man is a resident of Banakia village and he was arrested and remanded in judicial custody on Wednesday. He had been arrested earlier too for a similar offence, said station house officer (SHO) of Bewar police station Suresh Chand Sharma. In the almost three-minute video, the accused can be seen begging people to let him go while they are partially tonsuring his head. He was also kicked and beaten by some people. Some of the residents can be heard saying that the video should be widely circulated on social media to make people aware about the man's identity. The SHO said an FIR was registered against the suspect under sections 379 (theft) and 311 (whoever is a thug, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine) of IPC. A second FIR was registered against two men, including the owner of the tractor, who had tonsured the suspect’s head, and his neighbour under section 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/caught-stealing-mans-head-moustache-shaved-partially-in-mainpuri-village/articleshow/88305364.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Nashik||Nashik rural would require over 800 medical workers||NASHIK: The Nashik administration could require more than 800 medical staff, including doctors, nurses and the health assistants in the wake of fresh surge in covid cases in rural Nashik. Going by the norm of two doctors per ten beds, one staff nurse per two beds and one health assistant per 10 beds in case of ICU and one doctor per 15 beds, 1 staff nurse for every four beds and one health assistant per 15 beds, the district health authorities underlined the need of about 800 staff that would be sourced from the National Health Mission (NMH). “The state government had allowed sourcing of 1,052 persons during the peak of the second wave. Though the wave is expected to be bigger, primarily we will need 800 personnel in various categories and the administration is in touch with most of them,” said Dr Rahul Hadpe, District Health Mission officer. It is expected that the administration could require 170 doctors, 360 staff nurses and 350 health assistants among others to mitigate the crisis when it blows up. During the peak of the second wave the administration had received 53 doctors, 343 staff nurses and 300 health assistants, which was still lower than what was required by the administration then. According to senior health officials, the administration would follow the guidelines from state government over appointment of the people. The personnel hired were directly involved in treating and looking after Covid patients after being hired on contract during the second wave and once the pandemic ebbed in rural parts of the district, their services were terminated. Hence, they would be given priority. “They are trained for handling covid and they have good experience as well. Given the situation, they will be on the priority list of the administration. We are in touch with the administration,” the officers added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-rural-would-require-over-800-medical-workers/articleshow/88305400.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Patna||Install prepaid meters at all houses before 2025: Bihar CM||PATNA: CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked the officials and engineers concerned in the energy department to complete the installation of Smart Prepaid Meters (SPMs) at all the households across the state before 2025. He also ruled out giving free electricity to the consumers. The SPM installation would entail an expenditure of Rs12,657 crore, including Rs11,100 crore in the rural areas. As many as 3.5 lakh of SPMs have been installed in 19 towns till December. The 19 towns where the SPM installation work has been going on are Bettiah, Raxaul, Motihari, Sitamarhi, Chhapra, Ara, Arwal, Rajgir, Hajipur, Patna, Masaurhi, Biharsharif, Samastipur, Dalsingsarai, Begusarai, Khagaria, Munger, Purnia and Katihar. The CM also inaugurated the completed projects and laid the foundation stones for schemes worth Rs3,452 crore. He also dedicated the newly constructed energy auditorium and art gallery at Vidyut Bhavan. Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav, development commissioner Amir Subhani, additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit and CM’s principal secretary Chanchal Kumar were present on the occasion. Nitish said the SPM would bring immense benefit to the power consumers as they will not suffer the hardships caused by the wrong billing. “They will pay the charge for the power they consume,” he said. Given the performance and achievements made by the department on several fronts, Union power minister Raj Kumar Singh praised the state at a high-level meeting in Delhi, Yadav said. Nitish said just as the SPM installation work has begun on a big scale, some sections might demand free electricity. Ruling it out, he said the government has been purchasing power of Rs12,000 crore every year, but the revenue returns to the department is only Rs5,500 crore. “The remaining sum is being given to power consumers as a huge relief. Anything beyond it will not be sustainable. This, I have said even at the election meetings,” Nitish said, adding that the power consumption in the state has increased from 700MW in 2004-05 to 6,627MW at present. The CM said his government has made remarkable achievements in the power sector and the Centre has also consented to let the state purchase power from its quota. He also noted that another achievement would be the entry of Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) in the production of renewable energy. He laid the foundation stone for its schemes worth Rs1,011.95 crore. Among the other projects were of Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) worth Rs30.83 crore, South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited worth Rs60.04 crore, North Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited Rs 289.87 crore and of Bihar State Power Transmission Company Limited worth Rs 2,059.42 crore. Energy department secretary Sanjeev Hans said 12 lakh electricity connections had been given through the paperless online submission of applications on the Suvidha App during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since every application required filling 10 pages, the department saved 1.2 crore pages and complied with the environmental concerns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/install-prepaid-meters-at-all-houses-before-2025-cm/articleshow/88306259.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Hyderabad||India Cements moves HC to quash CBI case||Hyderabad: India Cements company, which is facing a chargesheet in the quid pro quo case, on Wednesday urged the Telangana high court to quash the CBI case against it. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing a petition filed by the cement firm which blamed the CBI for seeking to criminalise its normal business activity. Appearing for the company, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy said the company was granted the lease of mines and water allocation for running its business and it was there even prior to YS Rajasekhara Reddy government in AP. The lease was renewed during the YSR government. “Since we were going for expansion of our cement factory, we had asked for additional water allocation. The same was granted to us from Kagna river, a tributary of the Krishna,” he said.  Then irrigation minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah said before the Supreme Court that there was nothing wrong in allocating water to a cement factory, Niranjan said. “It was precisely on this ground, the high court earlier quashed the case against then irrigation secretary Adityanath Das and MD of India Cements N Srinivasan,” he said.“There was no other additional benefit given to us during the YSR regime. Hence, the charge that we had invested in firms belonging to YSR’s son on account of this water allocation is absurd,” he added. The CBI would present its case on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/india-cements-moves-hc-to-quash-cbi-case/articleshow/88306927.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC stops govt from shifting Medchal ITI||Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Wednesday stayed the proposed shifting of Medchal government Industrial Training Institute (ITI) to a far-off place. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji, which converted a letter written by 133 students from the ITI into a PIL, directed the state government not to disturb the functioning of the ITI. “Do not create any hindrances in the running of this institute,” the bench said. The bench passed an interim order saying that it had gone through the letter written by the students. “The students are from poor and lower middle class backgrounds. Some of them are working part-time in the nearby industries to sustain themselves and are also continuing their study in the ITI. If the ITI is shifted to a far-off place, then the students would be burdened with transport expenses that they may not afford to pay. We see a prima case has been made out,” the bench said while staying the plans to shift the ITI. The bench directed the state government to file its counter within eight weeks and adjourned the case to March 29, 2022. When the case came up for hearing, the government pleaders for general administration and technical education departments did not turn up. The students, in their letter, expressed an apprehension that the state government was making moves to shift their ITI to a far-off place in order to hand over the site in which their ITI is located to another organisation. “We are studying here with great difficulty. We hail from poor families. In order to sustain ourselves, some of us work in the nearby industries on a part-time basis. If our ITI is shifted to a far-off place, then we will be put to severe hardships,” they said in their letter addressed to the Chief Justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stops-govt-from-shifting-medchal-iti/articleshow/88306918.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt set to trim list of university VC aspirants before governor chooses||MUMBAI: Whittling down the autonomy of public universities, the state cabinet on Wednesday cleared amendments to the Maharashtra Public University Act, 2016, and decided to shortlist vice-chancellor candidates. Altering the selection method, the state will now receive the list of five nominees picked by the selection panel, choose two and dispatch them to the governor, the chancellor of universities, to finally pick the candidate. Taking a cue from the agriculture universities, the state also decided the higher education minister will now be the pro chancellor of all state public universities. The pro VC, who is appointed by the chancellor in consultation with the VC, will now be only from a government or an aided college. “The VC selection process has been changed to avoid the political interference of the chancellor,” said a state officer. To date, the selection was free of governmental interference. The VC/proVC search panel was headed by a governor’s nominee, one member was recommended by the management council and the third by the academic council. It invited applications, shortlisted aspirants, interviewed them and sent five names to the chancellor, who picked one. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant told TOI that these recommendations were made by an expert panel under Sukhdev Thorat, former UGC chairman. The panel was formed to suggest changes in the Act for effective implementation of the national education policy. “The agricultural universities have a post of pro chancellor, which is held by the agriculture minister. It was only the universities under the higher and technical education department which did not have the post,” said Samant. “Also, as far as the selection process of VCs and pro VCs is concerned, we have followed the procedure in the central universities in which the selection panel sends its recommendations to the government which then sends it to the President,” said Samant. The minister denied speculation that the decision is likely to become another flashpoint between the governor and the MVA government. “The governor is a constitutional post and there is no question of taking away its rights,” said Samant. The ties between the MVA government and Governor B S Koshyari have been strained with differences on a host of issues, including the governor-nominated seats in the legislative council. Educationist and former principal Anil Rao condemned the decision. “This is an unwarranted attack on the pre-supposed autonomy of academics. The chancellor is the apex authority and above all politics. Higher education should be completely autonomous and miles away from politics. Also, vested dubious interest will creep in with the decision to appoint the higher education minister as the pro chancellor.” “It is doubtful if there is such over-centralisation of university functions and powers with the government in any other state,” said A Mathew, National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-set-to-trim-list-of-univ-vc-aspirants-before-guv-chooses/articleshow/88307776.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Goa||NFL: When Indian football took the first step towards professionalism 25 years ago||The Indian football calendar till 1996 was dotted with state leagues and a host of all-India tournaments with the Federation Cup, organised by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), enjoying a pride of place. The tournaments often overlapped, and it was not uncommon to see the big clubs embark on a never-ending trophy hunting spree across the country, leaving players fatigued. A concerned AIFF first restricted each tournament to a fortnight with the limited participation of just 12 teams. The days of replayed matches – and more revenue for organisers from gate collection -- were now a thing of the past, but Indian football’s fortunes were clearly nosediving. “Indian football has failed to emerge out of its ancient traditions and if international standards are any yardstick, we have only slipped down the ladder. Reverses have had such a depressing impact on our players that we seemingly stare at defeats even before we actually start any international contest,” PK Banerjee, former India captain and coach, wrote in one of his newspaper columns. As Banerjee pointed out, India’s competition structure wasn’t doing any good to football, so FIFA – concerned by the falling standards – deputed a three-member study team to India in 1995. They spent two weeks here, studying the systems and infrastructure. When the team deputed by the governing body for world football submitted their report, the launch of a national league was on top of the priority list. A year later, on December 17, 1996 to be precise, the first-of-its-kind National Football League (NFL) was born. Twelve teams from across the country played the preliminaries and the best eight – four from each group played in Kolkata and Goa – qualified for the final round, played on a home-and-away basis. “Starting the league was a huge challenge,” Alberto Colaco, chairman of the league for many years since inception, told TOI on Thursday. “It was difficult to assess information, so we didn’t know how to go about with the regulations. The (AIFF) secretary P.P Lakshmanan then gave me a manual of the French league (also semi-professional at the time), and with my limited knowledge of the language, I put together the rules.” The AIFF first invited 22 clubs from across the country for a seminar in Bengaluru and asked them for their willingness to take part in this new project. Eighteen of them put down their interest in writing and the federation then finalised the 12 eligible teams. Three teams each were invited from Bengal and Goa, two from Mumbai, besides league champions from Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Each team got Rs 7.5 lakh as participation fee, even before the league kicked off. Since the time was short, AIFF decided to have a qualifying tournament for the 12 teams, eight of whom would qualify for the final round. The big upset was Mohun Bagan missing out at the expense of Air India and Mahindra & Mahindra, both from Mumbai. The Kolkata giants alleged that the two teams joined hands to secure a contrived result, but with just one win from five matches, even the AIFF’s review panel was not impressed with their protest. “Starting the league was only half the battle won. The bigger challenge was availability and condition of the grounds. While preparing the fixtures, we had to keep festivals in mind. No matches during Durga Puja in Kolkata, Holi in north and Christmas in Goa. Getting enough police security was another issue,” said Colaco. Unlike now when everything can be done at the click of a button, AIFF had to draw travel plans for each team and deliver flight tickets physically. Hotel bookings were also challenging, while the broadcast crew had a cargo plane of their own. “The first edition was a huge success,” remembers Colaco, who was elected secretary in 2000 and appointed general secretary in 2004. “This was a new concept and it really caught everyone’s attention. We didn’t have live telecast since Star TV (a foreign channel) was unable to get uplinking facilities for live broadcast due to the government's licensing laws. But everyone waited to see the broadcast later in the day or next morning. It was top stuff.” When the league kicked off, Churchill Brothers were in sparkling form as they grabbed 26 points from the first 10 games. Without much of a challenge, they seemed destined for the title, until the league table was turned on its head on the final day. Churchill (28 points) faced lowly Indian Bank in Chennai, needing a win to become champions in the concluding clash. Simultaneously in Goa, JCT Mills (27 points) took on the might of Dempo Sports Club, knowing that even a win wouldn’t help them finish on top. As luck would have it, Churchill were held to a 1-1 draw, while JCT ran out 4-1 winners as the star-studded side from Phagwara won the big prize in dramatic fashion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nfl-when-indian-football-took-the-first-step-towards-professionalism-25-years-ago/articleshow/88326842.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

On November 11, the SDMC of Nellikatte Government School in Puttur razed the historical school building, which was in a dilapidated state for many years. The demolition of the building had irked villagers and lovers of Kannada writer, social activist, environmentalist, Yakshagana artiste, filmmaker and thinker Kota Shivaram Karanth. The school building was the first school of Puttur taluk, and also the workplace of Jnanpith awardee Shivaram Karanth. “The SDMC decided that the building was in a dilapidated state and posed a danger, so they went ahead with their plans, without obtaining permission from the competent authorities. We have decided to take action against the school head, who is the official custodian of the building. There was no need to demolish the building, even though it was in a bad shape,” he stressed, adding that the PWD decides about the condition of a building, before taking any such decision. The district administration had planned to turn it into a memorial or museum, after handing over the building to the archaeology department. Kumar said that a proposal was already sent to the archaeology department, to restore the building and turn into a memorial or museum. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that based on newspaper reports, an inquiry has been initiated, and DDPI Malleswamy has been asked to submit a report regarding the demolition of the school building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/action-against-sdmc-school-head-for-buildings-demolition/articleshow/88305428.cms||---

Dayanand Swami, the convenor of the All-India Vegetarian Federation, a forum of Lingayat seers, told mediapersons on Wednesday that the government has to withdraw the decision before December 19. If the government proceeds with the decision, a convention of Lingayat seers will be held in front of the Suvarna Vidhan Soudha in Belagavi on December 20 and there will be protests, he said. The seer said that in 1991 the S Bangarappa government and in 2007 the H D Kumaraswamy government withdrew the decision to serve eggs to schoolchildren for mid-day meals. The seers have accused the government of taking commission from poultry owners to distribute eggs in schools and demanded a CBI investigation. Dayanand Swami said that with a pretext of malnutrition, the government was misguiding Lingayats, Brahmins, Vaishyas, Jain and other communities, who are vegetarian, to break their age-old traditions and customs. Was malnutrition only there in Karnataka, the land of Lord Basavanna, he asked. The decision to end malnutrition was good but were eggs the only solution to this, he asked. He said nutritional vegetables could be given to the schoolchildren. He said he had nothing against non-vegetarians or the government, but against those trying to break traditions and customs. “It is unfortunate that eggs will be supplied in schools which are temples of learning. Should the teacher engage classes or keep busy boiling eggs?” he asked. Nearly 80 per cent of educational institutions in Karnataka are run by mutts and temples and this is a systematic conspiracy to spoil the sanctity of the mutts, Dayanand Swamy said. The government should immediately withdraw this decision and provide vegetables to children, not eggs. If the government continues with its decision, it will face the ire of the seers and the people, he warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/lingayat-seer-wants-govt-to-withdraw-order-on-serving-eggs-in-midday-meals/articleshow/88305778.cms||---

This is the first case in Vadodara where a student has tested positive after offline classes were re-started. The school officials said that it was on Sunday that they were informed by the parent of the student following which the offline mode of learning of that particular class was suspended for four days. The school is continuing with the offline mode for other standards.  “The child and his family members are under home quarantine with mild infection and are doing well. No new cases have been reported,” school principal Suprabha Menon said. Menon said that the school is adhering to all the guidelines and protocols related to Covid-appropriate behaviour for the safety of its students, staff and their families. “We will continue to be alert and responsible at all times. All details sought by the officials of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) have been provided by the school,” she said. “Rapid antigen test was done by VMC’s health department for the teachers of that class. All tested negative,” she said. But the Vadodara Parents Association (VPA) demanded action against the school alleging that Covid-19 related protocols are not being followed at the school premises. In a memorandum to Vadodara district education officer (DEO), Navneet Mehta, VPA alleged that the school kept the education department officials and health officials in the dark even as the said child had shown symptoms from Thursday while the student tested positive on Friday. Mehta told TOI that offline classes of just one standard have been suspended by the school. “The school has taken precautionary measures like sanitizing the classrooms. It has also informed all parents asking them to get their wards tested,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/student-tests-ve-class-suspended/articleshow/88306260.cms||---

With the death of yet another person on Wednesday, toll rose to eight so far. With the first four deaths taking place in quick succession on day one, giving doctors no time to treat the patients, the incident has raised eyebrows since the beginning. The remaining deaths took place over the next two days. Thirteen persons were rushed to hospitals after they had food at the ‘Jatar’ ceremony. Doctors who treated the patients have told the police that there was a possibility that the deaths could be from organophosphorus pesticide poisoning (OP poisoning). Dahod superintendent of police, Hitesh Joysar said that samples of meat, cooked food, some powder, three bottles of liquid and other items had been collected from the site of the rituals. Joysar said that the primary opinion of the doctors was a possibility of OP poisoning, but this will have to be confirmed by forensic tests. He said that cops had extensively surveyed the village to ascertain that no other person had taken ill. “There are no more cases in the village,” said Joysar, adding that the ritual was being conducted for the well being of the village. Sources said that four or five goats were sacrificed on the last day of the ritual and those who had partaken the meat had fallen sick. The condition of a couple of the five hospitalised patients is said to be serious. The doctors have suggested that all the surviving patients will have to stay under treatment for at least a week to help docs monitor their condition. Narrow escape for many Around 50 persons had gathered for the ‘Jatar’ ceremony at Bhulvan village in Devgadhbaria taluka of Dahod district, but only 13 took ill after consuming food. Inquiries made by the police and district administration have revealed that the eight deceased as well as five who were admitted in hospitals had consumed food including meat and other items at the ritual site. Other villagers had taken the meat home to cook and eat with their families. Those present at the ritual site and took ill later include the ‘badva’ who performed the ritual and his aides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pesticide-poisoning-suspected-even-as-another-dies-toll-at-8/articleshow/88306275.cms||---
---||Kolkata||After West Bengal’s first Omicron case, push for kids’ vax||KOLKATA: The first Omicron case in Bengal — a seven-year-old child in Murshidabad — affirms the need to bring children under the vaccination fold without further delay, felt experts in Kolkata. Children and those below 18 should be vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent an Omicron outbreak, they said. While most other countries have started inoculating their under-12 population months ago, it is time for India to join them, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “This is probably the first case of Omicron in an unvaccinated individual in India and points at the risk they are exposed to. This variant is apparently the most transmissible so far and threatens to affect a large number. While the vaccinated population, too, has been affected by Omicron in several countries — including India — they have probably had a mild disease due to the vaccine shield,” said Dhar. Paediatrician Santanu Ray felt children should have got the vaccine with the onset of the second wave. “A large number of children had got infected then but fortunately, most had a mild disease. With Omicron, it could be different and we should begin vaccinating them immediately. This is a fast-spreading variant and a late reaction could be useless,” said Ray. All Covid precautions should now be stepped up, especially for children, said CMRI Hospital paediatric intensivist Satarupa Mukherjee. “While we need to vaccinate children, there is a substantial section of our adult population that remains unvaccinated. They need to be inoculated immediately for they, too, pose a risk to children,” she said. There is, however, no need to press the panic button, she felt. “So far, Omicron cases have been largely mild and there has just been a single death so far. But we should guard against it,” said Mukherjee. Dhar added that along with children, those who completed their inoculation 7-8 months ago and may have suffered an antibody depletion should also be given the third dose immediately. “They, too, are at risk of contracting Omicron and could well infect unvaccinated children,” added Dhar. “We are yet to know much on how Omicron affects children. Even as this variant is known to cause mild infection, we have seen cases of severe multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children who were either asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, that were triggered by the other variants. Therefore, we need to protect our children with vaccines and we can begin with immunocompromised children and those with co-morbidities like asthma, congenial heart diseases and malignancy,” said Mihir Sarkar, professor of paediatrics at Medical College Hospi-tal, Kolkata Prabhas Prasun Giri, assistant professor of paediatrics at Institute of Child Health, said: “We don’t yet have clear data on Omicron’s impact on vaccines. But we know for sure that the vaccine will still provide some amount of protection, which is better than no protection at all. We should begin offering the jab to children at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-states-1st-omicron-case-push-for-kids-vax/articleshow/88306268.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Council changes 12 questions in ISC computer science paper at 11th hour||KOLKATA: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations replaced 12 questions in the ISC computer science paper while the test was in progress on Wednesday. Candidates were handed the new set of questions after they started writing the exam, though white boards had announced the change and the supervising examiners alerted the candidates after all had entered the hall by 1.45pm. A late-evening circular had reached school principals on Tuesday saying 12 questions in booklet would have to be replaced. The circular had given step-by-step instructions about how this was to be done so that the exam progressed smoothly. No official reason was cited. Many principals said the earlier questions were from the junior level and technically out of syllabus for ISC candidates. However, candidates said the original questions were very easy. Students described the new questions to be easy, too. The white/blackboards at the exam halls announced that questions 7-18 had to be replaced. The new set of questions were uploaded by the Council on the “Careers” portal at 2pm. Prints or photocopies were taken of the questions in the presence of supervising examiners and the school principal and distributed among candidates. The entire process took less than 10 minutes. The circular asked supervising examiners to ensure that each candidate had stapled the new sheet along with the booklet they were using for the rest of the questions. “The process was smooth and we followed instructions. All ended well and students were happy with the new set of questions,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys. “The children were in by 1.30 pm and the supervising examiners had reached by 1pm. So, candidates got to know about the change well in advance and the process was smooth,” said Sujoy Biswas, principal of Rammohan Mission School. At South City International School, principal John Bagul supervised the process from taking prints till distribution. Ved Sengupta, an ISC candidate, said, “The older questions were of Class VIII-level. We could have easily tackled them though. The new questions were easy too.” Srinka Ghosh, a candidate from St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, said, “I was prepared and the questions were easy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/council-changes-12-questions-in-isc-computer-science-paper-at-11th-hour/articleshow/88306279.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Delhi||...Both carriageways open for traffic at Singhu border, finally||NEW DELHI: After more than a year, both carriageways of the Singhu border were reopened to commuters on Wednesday. However, there was some confusion in the afternoon as barricades were put by Delhi Police due to repair work on the Haryana side. Later, a senior Haryana official visited the site, inspected the area and got the barricades removed. “Vehicular movement was restored around 7pm. Initially, there were snarls as several vehicles piled up but traffic eased later. Officials were deployed on the ground to assist commuters,” said a senior Delhi Police official. He added that the remaining roadblocks will be removed in due course of time. Brijendra Kumar Yadav, DCP (Outer North), confirmed the reopening of the Singhu border. “The road is open now for both light and heavy vehicles,” he said. Meanwhile, shopkeepers expressed relief. Sube Singh, who had shut his grocery shop when the farmer protests were on, said he was hopeful business will pick up now. “We were opening the shop only for people who wanted some things as they knew me personally. But I was not able to sustain this and shut the shop later. I didn’t have any issue with the farmers. I’m glad the government heard their demands and they reached an amicable solution. Now, I hope my business, as well as that of petrol pump owners, will be restored,” said Singh. Farmers protesting against the three agriculture laws ended the agitation after the PM accepted their demand to repeal the laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/-both-carriageways-open-for-traffic-at-singhu-border-finally/articleshow/88306938.cms||---

Kotvani is one of the key accused in the recent racket busted by cops where liquor was being manufactured at a unit meant for making ayurvedic syrup on the outskirts of the city. “He was booked under PASA for being a ‘dangerous person’. Kotvani has committed similar crimes in the past and he is a habitual offender whose activities can endanger lives,” said Jatin Patel, police inspector. The police said that Kotvani can make formulations for Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL). “He has done Bachelors in Science (BSc) and hence he has a thorough knowledge of chemicals. Many years ago, he was booked for making non-alcoholic beer that had more liquor content,” Patel told TOI. Thirty-six-year-old Kotvani was also arrested earlier this year for making duplicate sanitiser during the second wave of Covid. He made a plan to make duplicate liquor when he was lodged in Vadodara central jail. Kotvani met two other key accused Bhajanlal Bishnoi and Hanuman Bishnoi, both residents of Rajasthan, in the jail. The duo was jailed under the Prohibition Act. While Kotvani offered to make IMFL formulation and manufacture liquor, Bhajanlal took a unit in Sankarda on rent. They then roped in five other persons to make the liquor and then sell it across the state. The cops had raided the unit some days ago and seized hundreds of litres of ethanol along with some machines. “We have arrested five of the accused while Bhajanlal and Hanuman are yet to be nabbed,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mastermind-of-counterfeit-liquor-racket-detained-under-pasa/articleshow/88306291.cms||---

The NHAI has floated a tender for construction of a four-lane elevated road from Kapasia Chowk to Begusarai jail area. State road construction minister Nitin Nabin said the road will cover a stretch of 4.3km involving a cost of Rs371crore. The agency selected for its construction by the NHAI will have two-and-a-half years time to compete the project from the day of starting the construction. It will also be responsible for maintenance of the road for a period of 10 years after completion of the project. “Begusarai is an industrial city with several key industries like Barauni refinery, a fertilizer plant, power station besides other ancillary industries which puts immense pressure on traffic on NH-31 in the town area leading to consistent traffic jams. Besides, it will soon be connected with a six-lane bridge over Ganga, which will put further traffic pressure. The four-lane elevated road will facilitate hassle-free travel on the highway passing through the town area,” Nabin said, while offering gratitude to the union ministry of road transport and highways for being sensitive to the needs of the state. This apart, the long-pending Munger road bridge, a part of rail-cum -road over bridge will also be dedicated to the nation on December 25, which is also the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who incidentally had launched the project in 2003. Though, after several delays in the time frame, Munger rail bridge was launched in April 2016, the road bridge could not be opened for traffic owing to the failure to complete the construction of the approach roads on both ends of the bridge. However, on Wednesday, road construction minister Nitin Nabin along with additional chief secretary Pratyaya Amrit visited the site and gave directions to all concerned to ensure opening of the bridge for traffic on the given day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nhai-floats-tender-for-four-lane-elevated-road-in-begusarai/articleshow/88306286.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal and private hospitals gear up with infrastructure, strict protocol to tackle ‘O’ challenge||KOLKATA: State-run hospitals have been asked to remain prepared so they can isolate and treat any confirmed Omicron-positive or a suspected patient at short notice. Medical colleges and district hospitals, in particular, have been asked to strengthen their infrastructure after Bengal’s first Omicron case was detected in Malda. A 50-bed ward at the Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital has been set up for Omicron patients and suspects. “A dedicated ward has been kept at ID Hospital for either suspects or confirmed cases. But now we have the first confirmed case in a district. So medical colleges in the districts are being asked to remain prepared,” said a health department official. Sources said ID Hospital will continue to cater to suspected or confirmed cases from the city and the suburbs. If need arises, more dedicated wards will be opened up in other government hospitals. Currently, only one suspected case is admitted at ID Hospital. Private hospitals in Kolkata, too, have been gearing up to meet the Omicron challenge. Most have stepped up their screening process and at least one has set up an Omicron unit. Patients’ travel history is now being recorded diligently so that suspected cases can be readily identified and isolated. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has set up an eight-bed Omicron unit. “We have split the unit into four to make the beds as isolated as possible. That apart, screening has been made more stringent. It is now compulsory for each healthworker to wear double masks, face shield, gloves and eye-protection in the Covid ward. Each Covid suspect is being asked for a detailed travel record,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. AMRI Hospital, where the first Omicron suspect in Bengal was treated, has revived its Covid Task Force Committee that includes an infection control team, microbiologists and critical-care experts. “They are now engaged in collecting data on Omicron and are in touch with experts in the USA. Even though the inputs they have got so far are not scary, we have gone back to the precautions in place at the beginning of the pandemic,” said a hospital source. At RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS), those with a recent travel history to South Africa and certain European countries are being isolated and tested for Covid before being guided to the fever clinic if they have symptoms. “Samples of those with a travel history testing positive will be sent for genome sequencing to the eastern region reference centre at NIBGM (Kalyani) through ID Hospital,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-and-pvt-hosps-gear-up-with-infra-strict-protocol-to-tackle-o-challenge/articleshow/88306277.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

A group of CRPF personnel not only attended the marriage of Jyoti Singh, the youngest among three sisters of Shailendra, the constable who lost his life while fighting terrorists in J&K's Pulwama on October 5, 2020, but they also performed each and every role supposed to be performed by a brother on such occasions. Of the three sisters of Shailendra, two were married before he gave his Supreme sacrifice while serving the nation, and only Jyoti was to be married. "Brothers for life: As elder brothers, CRPF personnel attended the wedding ceremony of Ct Shailendra Pratap Singh's sister. He made supreme sacrifice on October 5, 2020, while valiantly retaliating terrorist attack in Pulwama," the CRPF tweeted with a few pictures of the marriage. The jawansblessed her, presented gifts to her and carried the veil above her as she walked to the mandap. Shailendra Pratap, who joined the CRPF in 2008, was posted in the 110th battalion of CRPF when he lost his life. His company was in Sopore then. His family consists of his father, mother, wife , three sisters and a nine-year-old son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jawans-play-brothers-role-at-wedding-of-slain-soldiers-sister/articleshow/88308301.cms||---

Leena (52) became only the second Indian-origin woman to take over as CEO of a large global company after Indra Nooyi (Pepsico). Born in Kolhapur, Leena (nee Menon) attended Holy Cross Convent School, then the only all-girls convent school in the city. “She was a ranker right from KG and never lost that position. She was humble then and is even more humble now. I reminded her some time back about her growing humility despite climbing the ladder. She simply replied that humility happens as one rises in one’s career,” said Deepa. After her appointment as chief of human resource at Unilever, the youngest to chair the position and prior to settling in London, her classmates in Kolhapur gave her a grand welcome. Leena (52) had visited Kolhapur recently to take her 90-year-old father to London. “This was after her mother had passed away a few months ago. I was a daughter to her parents in her absence. Leena made frequent visits to Kolhapur and ensured she spent time with my family. When I said that she had no reason to visit Kolhapur again after taking her father to London, she promised to visit again,” said Deepa. Leena’s cousin, Vijay Menon, managing director of well-known engineering unit Menon and Menon Limited in Kolhapur, remembers her early career achievements. “She was head of Unilever’s Taloja plant which was battling labour issues. She had to deal with fiery union leaders like Datta Samant. But she bravely dealt with the situation and resolved labour problems, which I think helped her climb the ladder. I remember Leena being publicly felicitated by Taloja residents. She was an outstanding student from the beginning and secured a gold medal at XLRI Jamshedpur. During her visits to Kolhapur, she would take time out to interact with industry leaders,” he said. Before getting her MBA degree, Leena had studied electronics at the prestigious Walchand College of Engineering in Sangli. During her interaction with the students of Shantiniketan School in Kolhapur a year ago, she had said, “We were just 18 women students among 3,000 male students at Walchand College. I was privileged to do what I was doing but was also burdened with expectations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mama-wouldve-been-happiest-today-leena-nair-texted-friend/articleshow/88305438.cms||Abhijeet Patil
---||Kolkata||Restaurants’ pre-festive season gift: A sharp dip in liquor price in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Ushering in the New Year with a few drinks at your favourite restaurant may not burn a hole in your pocket this time. The drop in alcohol prices last month is going to be passed on to bar and restaurant customers by Christmas, said the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI). While several bars in central and south Kolkata have already reduced their IMFL price per peg by around 20%, some of the bigger restaurants, including those on Park Street, will follow soon. HRAEI says the average price slide per peg could be around 35% and is set to come into effect by the Christmas week. “We have targeted the Christmas-New Year period to implement the price drop, which will be a big relief for patrons. This is the time when restaurants and bars get the highest footfall. It will encourage more to visit restaurants,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. “It will be unfair if we don’t pass on the benefit to our customers, especially since liquor prices had gone up by 35%-40% last year,” he added. The price slash per peg of India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) — including whisky, vodka and rum — could be a sharp 30%-35%. It could be around 20% for imported liquor that includes the Bottled in Origin (BIO) category. While some restaurants said they are ready to slash prices and will effect it soon, others said they are waiting for the old stocks – purchased at higher prices – to run out. Bar-B-Q and One Step Up on Park Street will reduce liquor prices next week. “We are getting new menu cards printed and the drop would be between 20% and 35% depending on the price of the liquor,” said owner Rajiv Kothari. Oasis, too, has ordered new menu cards with reduced liquor prices. It has started offering ‘combo meals’ with drinks at lower rates. “We have have started passing on the price benefit to customers,” said Oasis owner Pratap Daryanani. Trincas, too, is working out a new price liquor price list. “The drop could be around 20%-25%,” said owner Anand Puri. Some, however, said their existing stocks may not run out this month. Raul’s at Hazra has dropped IMFL prices by 15%. Others like Zyka in New Alipore said they may not alter liquor price since they were not raised last year. “There had been a 35% jump in alcohol price last year but since we had very few customers due to the pandemic and the lockdown, the prices remained unchanged. So, now that the price has been reduced, we don’t see any reason to change,” said Zyka partner Uttam Singh. New menu cards with reduced liquor prices have already been ordered by Songhai and Manthan, said Poddar who owns the restaurants. “At my restaurants, the price drop will be around 30% per peg of IMFL and 20% -25% for imported liquor. A peg of Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky, for instance, that now costs Rs 680 a peg will be cheaper by Rs 100,” said Poddar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restaurants-pre-festive-season-gift-a-sharp-dip-in-liquor-price/articleshow/88306302.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Bangladesh@50: Victoria to host Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations||KOLKATA: Year 2021 has been marked as Swarnim Vijay Varsh to commemorate the Indian Army’s decisive victory over Pakistan, which resulted in Bangladesh’s liberation in 1971. To mark the culmination of celebrations of Swarnim Vijay Varsh, Eastern Command will host a programme — Swarnim Vijay Gatha — at the Victoria Memorial on Thursday. Apart from a customized light-and-sound show on the walls of Victoria depicting the story of Bangladesh’s Liberation War, this programme will also have a tribute segment by Gulzar where he will be reciting a poem specially written for this occasion and songs by Sonu Nigam. A concert, musically designed by Sourendro-Soumyojit, will feature stalwarts like L Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurti, along with performances by the likes of Papon, Somlata, Ujjaini, Durnibar, Saikat and Brinda. The grand finale will be on a nostalgic high with Soumyojit singing ‘Mile sur mera tumhara’. The event would be graced by Lt General Manoj Pande, AVSM, VSM, Army Commander, Eastern Command and war veterans, among others. The release of Eastern Command's history book has also been planned. Sourendra-Soumyojit, who had designed the musical gala to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose at Victoria, is happy to have been given this responsibility to design the concert. Swarnim Vijay Gatha, Sourendra said, is a very “delicate” concept that deals with the friendship of two nations – India and Bangladesh. “It is very rare that a war actually paved the way for the friendship of two nations. Music is the best language to transcribe it. We have chosen songs where the rivers of two countries meet, songs where the languages of two countries meet. The idea is to pick songs where the glory and bravery of the Indian sena who helped in bringing the two countries together,” he said. To make the programme visually grand, all the folk forms of Bengal have been included. At least 11 to 12 classical dance forms will also be presented. An exclusive anthem has been composed for the occasion called ‘Vijaya Bhava’. Papon, Somlata and Soumyojit will lend their voices to this anthem. This will be followed by Krishnamurti singing ‘Ae mere watan ke logon’ with L Subramaniam and a huge section of children’s choir from different schools of Kolkata. A mash-up of patriotic Bollywood numbers will also be presented. To make it a comprehensive presentation, this segment has been synchronized with choreography of 150 dancers by Nilay Sengupta. National Award-winning art designer Sushanta Paul, who has made props for the show, said: “This space has a larger- than-life feeling. That’s why we have tried to give a larger-than-life form to the props.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangladesh50-victoria-to-host-swarnim-vijay-varsh-celebrations/articleshow/88306293.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Murder case: No action on repeated orders, Delhi court fumes at ‘indifference’||NEW DELHI: A court has come down heavily on Delhi Police for non-compliance of its orders repeatedly in a murder case, saying it “has never experienced such indifference”. Additional sessions judge Sanjay Sharma said the issue got further aggravated as the case was regarding the alleged murder of a citizen of Nepal. The remarks came after police repeatedly failed to produce two witnesses, both from Nepal. The court said it had issued summons to them as many as 15 times since September 1, 2016. “Till date, the court has not received back any summons with report of service of the said summons upon the said witnesses. This court is of the opinion that the embassy of Nepal would render all possible assistance as the case is related to homicidal death of its citizen,” the judge said on Tuesday. The court directed the Delhi police commissioner to submit a report as to whether the embassy was aware of the case, whether it would assist the court in securing the presence of the witnesses and why previous summons had not been returned to the court. It further said that if there was no response from the office of the commissioner, it would seek assistance of the Union home ministry. On November 20, 2021, the judge noted that neither Directorate of Prosecution nor Delhi Police had informed the court as to what assistance they could provide the court in securing the presence of the witnesses. It appears that the prosecution was content with mere issuance of process through the investigating officer and Delhi Police was happy with forwarding such process to the foreign ministry, the court had said, issuing a notice to the commissioner’s office to ensure the presence of an officer who could take appropriate steps for effective service of summons. On November 24, the court noted that it had not received any response and once again issued notice to the commissioner to ensure the appearance of a senior officer. On receiving no response again, the court, on November 29, said it appeared that the office of the commissioner was not taking its direction sincerely. On December 4, it issued notice to the commissioner as to whether the previous orders were received by his office, and, if so, why they were not complied with. On December 14, the judge again said there was no response to its previous orders. “This court has never experienced such indifference to the repeated orders of this court by the office of commissioner of police,” he observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murder-case-no-action-on-repeated-orders-court-fumes-at-indifference/articleshow/88306941.cms||Usha Das

In the wake of the high court indicating taking suo motu cognisance of issues pertaining to the dog menace in parks, and problems posed by stray cattle, in case the authorities fail to take timely action, animal activists have demanded that the government introduce mandatory guidelines to be followed by pet owners. Animal Care Trust (ACT) trustee and advocate Suma Nayak told TOI: “Every city needs to have a dog park, where pets can play, socialise and even get pampered. These parks should have facilities like a dog trail, space for running, swimming, digging, trailing and other activities for canines. Apart from this, a dedicated space for defecating, and a waste bag dispenser to collect pet poop in the bag should also be set up. Since we do not have a dog park, the state government must introduce mandatory guidelines to be followed by pet owners in public places. For example, leashing of pet dogs must be made mandatory, a muzzle must be placed over the snout of a dog, to prevent injuries due to them biting at public places. Denying hounds or breeds such as the Great Dane a walk may not be practical,” she said, adding that in Mangaluru every ward must have a dog park, and every city should have at least one government-run cattle shelter. Tauseef Ahmed, founder and rescuer at Mr Rescuer, said that there have been several instances in the city, where pet owners do not leash their dogs, and they either chase children or other dogs in public places. “There were two instances of locals complaining about two Rottweilers being taken for a walk unleashed, and I have also seen a golden retriever chasing another dog in the city. Also, animal droppings could spread infection. Hence, the government must make it mandatory for all pet owners who take their dogs for a walk, to carry a biodegradable bag to carry the animal’s poop. Big cities can have dedicated pet zones. On several occasions, the need for a pet park and a crematorium were discussed with city corporation officials, but the request was blatantly dismissed,” he said. “Pet dogs in public places should be leashed, no matter how well trained they are. Having a dog park could be of great help, as dogs need a place to run around and play. In cities spaces can be rationed. Some can be opened to dogs, however with clear signboards and guidelines to be followed by the pet owner,” said Dr Ashitha Suresh, a veterinarian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/activists-bat-for-dog-parks-in-every-city/articleshow/88305443.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Additional Sessions Judge Naveen Kumar Kashyap said it appeared that there has been no investigation/analysis about the claims of the parties. “On bare reading of the chargesheet in the present case, it prima facie appears that the same is just a reproduction of the original complaint filed by the complainant, apart from moving of anticipatory bail application and for cancellation of the same. Prima facie it appears that there is no investigation/analysis about the contrary claims by the parties. Police officials are duty-bound to fairly and in an unbiased manner investigate the case,” the court said in its order on December 14. It noted that on inquiry, it was stated by the investigating officer that she did not bother to collect photographs/conditions of building in question or the ownership claimed over the same by the parties or even proof of settled possession over the same by the parties. It further said that under these circumstances, notice be issued not only to the investigating officer, but also to the inspector who forwarded the chargesheet and to the ACP concerned, who ultimately was responsible for the investigation in question and through whom the chargesheet was filed. The court directed them to file their replies within two days and put the matter for further hearing on January 14, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-seeks-reply-from-cops-in-case-of-house-trespassing/articleshow/88306959.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

After getting a final shape from the consultation, it will be discussed with the chief minister before making a stern and neutral decision,” Babu told reporters at the Sri Subamania Swamy temple in Kumara Vayalur in Trichy. The issue was raked up after a bharatanatyam dancer Zakir Hussain was denied entry to the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy Temple by a man named Rangarajan Narasimhan a few days ago. On the shortcomings being pointed out by Narasimhan, the HR&CE minister said the department was open to suggestions and ready to rectify if there were faults. “We welcome anyone who raises fair things, but we will not entertain any forces of separatism,” he said. Babu said the HR&CE department had not banned any puja at temples in view of Covid-19. In case of any such issue, action would be taken, he said. The HR&CE minister said that DMK government would complete the process of appointing temple trustees by next year. “The posts of trustees were not filled in the past 10 years. We will form a committee on the guidance of the chief minister and get a report on the appointments of trustees. The appointments will be done perfectly,” he said. Later, the minister along with the municipal administration minister K N Nehru inspected the Pundarikaashan Perumal temple at Thiruvellarai and Gneelivaneshwarar temple at Thiruppainjeeli in Trichy before attending the festival of golden chariot procession at Samayapuram Mariamman temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/min-promises-neutral-decision-on-temple-entry-of-non-hindus/articleshow/88306942.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pornography case: Supreme Court relief from arrest to Raj Kundra||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted protection from arrest to businessman Raj Kundra in connection with an FIR registered against him for allegedly distributing pornographic videos. In July this year, Kundra, who is married to actor Shilpa Shetty, was arrested by the Mumbai Police in another case where he was accused of distributing porn films through an app. He was granted bail in September. A bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Aniruddha Bose on Wednesday issued notice to the Maharashtra government on an appeal filed by Kundra against a Bombay High Court order rejecting his anticipatory bail.

In an order issued under the foreign exchange management Act, the central bank said travellers using this corridor can carry outside and bring in Indian or foreign currency notes the value of which can't exceed Rs 11,000. The Kartarpur Sahib Corridor enables Sikh pilgrims from India to visit the gurudwara, which is within Pakistan's borders without a visa. But the permit is for a limited purpose. Pilgrims can go in the morning and must return the same day. They are not allowed to visit any place outside Kartarpur Sahib. RBI rules for international travel allow Indians to carry currency (in cash) up to Rs 25,000 and foreign currency up to $3,000 per trip. Travellers (other than those from Pakistan) can enter India with up to Rs 25,000 of Indian notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pilgrims-to-kartarpur-can-carry-just-rs-11000-in-cash-rbi/articleshow/88308312.cms||---

District child protection officer (DCPO) RAnitha said on Wednesday that while184 who lost single parent got Rs 3 lakh each, seven others got Rs 5lakh each as they lost both the parents, either to Covid-19 or one of them died even before the virus struck. The process of monthly maintenance grant of Rs 3,000 to children who lost both parents is expected to take off shortly. The social welfare and women empowerment department had announced rehabilitation and protection of children who lost both or single parent to Covid-19 in June. DCPU identified a total of 306 children under the two categories. It has verified the deaths of 1,084 patients and picked 94 patients whose 147 children were in need of support. It also took 27 children of 20 patients off the lists as any one of the parents of the children had a government job. The DCPU was flooded with applications from children of parents whose deaths were not mentioned in the medical bulletin, something which still begs an answer. “The department has advised us to entertain applications of such children too. Our office staff will verify the death summary, RTPCR certificate and CT scan reports to confirm if the death was caused by Covid-19,” DCPU Anitha told TOI. She added that the application of a child who lost both parents could not be processed as there was no solid proof of death due to Covid-19. DCPU Trichy processed the applications of 115 patients in that category who died either in government or private hospitals in the district. The process of identifying eligible children threw more light on the fact that some children lost both the parents but one of them died due to other reasons while other one lost his/her life due to Covid-19. Children identified under the scheme belonged to the age group of zero to 18 years here. It was also found that a maximum of three children who were born to the same parents applied for assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/191-children-of-covid-victims-get-government-aid-in-trichy/articleshow/88306963.cms||Gokul Rajendran

Aryan Khan, 23, had last week moved the HC seeking modification of the bail rule stipulating three-hour attendance at the investigating officer’s office here every Friday in the cruise ship drugs case. On Wednesday, senior counsel Amit Desai told the court that with the probe now with a special team from Delhi, Khan’s weekly attendance in Mumbai should be dropped and he should be permitted to attend the Delhi SIT office whenever asked to. Shreeram Shirsat, counsel for the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), accepted it. Desai said another condition of submitting Khan’s itinerary when travelling may also be amended. Justice Nitin Sambre ordered Khan can attend the NCB Delhi office as and when called with prior notice and said “as far as other travel plans are concerned, other than his requirement at Delhi office of NCB, he is duty bound to furnish his itinerary”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-condition-relief-for-aryan/articleshow/88307798.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Not proper to keep man jailed because of slow trial: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over keeping an accused in prison in a fake currency case for five years as the National Investigation Agency (NIA) prosecutes the matter sluggishly. The court was hearing a bail appeal filed by one Shailesh Barvadiya. In this case, the NIA sought to examine more than 40 witnesses, which will prolong the trial. The high court had requested the chief justice to recommend to the Centre that the number of special NIA courts be increased to expedite trials. But the request was not accepted by the CJ who said that there are only 12 pending cases before two special courts. The NIA submitted on Wednesday that the principal sessions judge has transferred six cases to another NIA court. It was also submitted that the main accused, who were granted default bail, are delaying the trial by filing frivolous applications. But the judges were not impressed and commented that the NIA court has been moving very slowly with the trial. “Take it from us, the trial will not be completed in the next five years,” the court said. The judges were critical about the pace of the trial and added that one witness was examined in 15 days and there are more than 40 witnesses still to be examined. The court asked, “Is it the fault of the accused? Why should he be languishing in jail? What prejudice would be caused to the prosecution if he is released on bail?” The judges also said that keeping the accused in jail for long does not appear proper. The court has asked the NIA to obtain instructions about the process for a speedy trial by December 22. The high court also said, “The NIA court is not coping with the pressure. It is unfortunate.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/not-proper-to-keep-man-jailed-because-of-slow-trial-gujarat-high-court/articleshow/88306329.cms||---
