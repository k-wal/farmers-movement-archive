Naidu, a former district judge, will monitor investigation into Kalahandi teacher Mamita Meher’s murder which has kicked off a political controversy. The state government on November 26 had requested the HC to nominate a sitting/retired judge of the HC or a district and sessions court to monitor the probe. The HC nominated Naidu on Tuesday, it is reliably learnt. The government had requested the HC for a judicial supervision of the probe order to have transparency in the matter as it is a sensitive case, a government officer said. The development comes a day before the winter session of the state assembly begins on Wednesday when both BJP and Congress have announced to raise the “lopsided” probe into the teacher’s murder. The two parties have been seeking resignation of minister of state for home Dibya Shankar Mishra for his alleged collusion in the crime. While BJP has been agitating to press for a CBI probe, the Congress has been seeking probe by a special investigation team (SIT) monitored by a HC judge. Police have arrested Mamita’s employer Gobinda Sahu and one of his aides in connection with the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-retired-judge-abs-naidu-to-monitor-mamita-meher-murder-probe/articleshow/88015829.cms||Ashok Pradhan
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha police officers charged with murder over 2017 custodial death||BHUBANESWAR: The Odisha Crime Branch has registered a murder case against four police officers for their alleged involvement in the custodial death of a person in Koraput district in 2017. At a time when the opposition parties have been targeting the police over the alleged worsening law and order situation in the state, the registration of murder case against the four cops has left the Odisha police embarrassed. Jeypore native Akash Mahuria (28), who was wanted in some offences, was allegedly tortured and beaten to death inside Jeypore Town police station in Koraput district on January 30, 2017. Police had then attributed Mahuria’s death to accidental fall while being chased for his arrest. “We have booked the Jeypore police station’s former inspector-in-charge Tapan Narayan Rath (IIC), former sub-inspectors (SIs) Siba Prasad Sahu and Rajesh Baliarsingh and former Jeypore sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Rajendra Prasad Senapati for alleged murder of the man. A team led by additional superintendent of police Ramachandra Thamb took up the investigation,” a senior Crime Branch officer told TOI. The four cops have been booked under sections 302 (murder), 323 (causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 325 (causing grievous hurt), 505 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by more than one person) of the IPC. A few days ago, the deceased’s mother Prabina Mahuria lodged a complaint with the Crime Branch. Prabina alleged though she had lodged complaints against the four officers at Jeypore police station in the past, the police hushed up the investigation as Rath was then heading the station. “Around 1 pm, Rath and his staff forcibly dragged my son in their jeep, assaulted him brutally in the lock-up and killed him. In their defence, the police took the plea that my son tried to run to evade arrest. Police said he slipped and sustained severe head injuries after falling on the ground, leading to death. Now, I request the Crime Branch to give me justice and punish the erring cops,” Prabina said. It must be noted the Odisha human rights commission (OHRC) pulled up the state police on several occasions for their highhandedness and brutality towards crime suspects in their custody. Instances of police excess also led to suspension of some cops in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odisha-police-officers-charged-with-murder-over-2017-custodial-death/articleshow/88016583.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Namma Metro requires 12 lakh daily ridership to break even||BENGALURU: Namma Metro met just 27% of its ridership target in 2019-20. While its projected daily ridership was 15 lakh, the average ridership was just about 4 lakh when the corridor length was 42km. Namma Metro needs a daily ridership of 12 lakh — a 208% increase — to break even. This was revealed in a report titled ‘Performance of Indian Metro systems: lessons for upcoming urban rail projects’, prepared by the International Association of Public Transport, an NGO. It studied four Metro systems in the country: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai. Today, the 56km Namma Metro’s daily ridership has fallen further to 3 lakh because of the pandemic and work-from-home arrangement. In Bengaluru, the daily ridership in 2019-20 was only 9,456 per km, as opposed to 40,650 in Mumbai and 14,653 in Delhi. Chennai had the lowest with 2,553. “A key reason for lower Metro network development in Indian cities is high capital costs. Costs are dependent on land acquisition, share of underground network and other aspects,” the report said. Namma Metro’s cost per km is Rs 327 crore, compared to Mumbai Metro’s Rs 390 crore, Chennai’s Rs 259 crore, and Delhi’s Rs 181 crore. Non-farebox revenue About 79% of Bengaluru Metro’s operational revenue is from passenger fare. However, its non-farebox revenue like rent and advertisement forms is only 9% — the lowest among the four cities. In Delhi, passenger fare revenue forms only 48% of the operational revenue, while 37% comes from sources such as feeder bus, rental, revenue from real estate, and consultancy. The non-farebox revenue in Mumbai and Chennai is 14% and 16%, respectively. Meanwhile, the non-farebox revenue contribution is 58% and 28% for MTR Hong Kong and SMRT Singapore, respectively. According to the report, cities such as London, Hong Kong, and Singapore succeed through an integrated transport authority which cross-subsidises public transport through revenue from congestion and parking charges, property development, and other non-transport operations. Bengaluru’s plan to have a unified metropolitan transport authority has remained on paper. SuggestionsThe report stated that Metros can only be implemented successfully if they are integrated with other public transport modes to provide adequate first- and last-mile connectivity. “Indian metro systems are heavily reliant on operational revenue and within that on farebox revenue. Delhi Metro provides the best-case example of increasing non-farebox revenue through land value capture. Other systems need to build on this example for long-term financial sustainability,” it said. It suggested improving farebox revenue through strategies such as dynamic pricing with targeted discounts based on time of day and distance of travel. Non-farebox revenue can be improved through land value capture, advertising, co-branding of metro stations, smart cards, and providing consulting services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-namma-metro-requires-12-lakh-daily-ridership-to-break-even/articleshow/88016611.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

The border-guarding force neutralised five intruders and apprehended three Pakistani intruders this year, besides shooting down several drones from across the border and seizing huge quantities of arms, ammunition and narcotic substances sent from Pakistan to fan terrorism in J&K. Sharing details of BSF activities in the Jammu region on the eve of Raising Day on Tuesday, BSF IG (Jammu Frontier) D K Boora said, “2021 witnessed manifold challenges like drone intrusions and increased attempts by Pakistan to push terrorists into India but BSF Jammu thwarted all attempts of the adversary and foiled their nefarious designs.” “BSF is manning about 192km of international border and Line of Control alongside the Indian Army in Jammu region. Several tunnelling and smuggling attempts were made from across the border, but thwarted by BSF. As a result of robust domination and surveillance on the international border, there has been continued peace on the Jammu border,” IG Boora said. “BSF battalions in Rajouri/Poonch also seized arms/ammunition in the hinterland during the year, which include five AK-47 rifles, 15 AK-47 magazines, 421 rounds of AK ammunition, one AK-56 rifle, 16 pistols, 36 pistol magazines, 348 rounds of pistol ammunition, 10 hand grenades, four grenades, besides other things,” the IG said. He added that BSF also made the border population aware of drone operations carried out by Pakistan-based elements and many drone awareness programmes were organised. “Apart from these, several civic action programmes catering to the needs of border population were conducted by the BSF battalions where medical equipment, sports items, stationery items and Covid kits (sanitizers, masks, etc) were provided,” IG Boora said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2021-witnessed-increased-drone-intrusions-bsf/articleshow/88016702.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

The devices are being given under the scheme announced by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in October to equip students with gadgets so that they can use technology to study. A dedicated portal named ‘DG Shakti’ has been created for facilitating the distribution of smartphones and tablets which will be soon launched by the CM, said a government spokesperson. “The students will not have to apply or register anywhere to get free smartphones and tablets. The entire process, from registration to smartphone and tablet delivery, is free,” the spokesperson said. The colleges are transferring details of their students directly to the university which is feeding the data on the portal. Till Monday, data of about 27 lakh students had been uploaded on the portal, said officials. The work order for distribution of phones and tablets will be issued by the first week of December and 5 lakh smartphones and 2.5 lakh tablets will be distributed in the first phase, he added. “The government floated the largest tender for smartphones and tablets worth Rs 4,700 crore on the GeM portal. Many well-known companies have submitted their bids which are in the stage of finalisation. The companies include Vishtel (Iris), Samsung (Vision) and Acer (Celkon) for tablets and Lava, Samsung (Celcon) and Samsung (United) for smartphones,” the official added. The state cabinet had cleared the proposal for distribution of smartphones and tablets on October 5, being seen as the government’s aim to reach out to the young voters in the state ahead of the 2022 assembly polls. The expenditure of Rs 3,000 crore had been approved initially. The free tablets and smartphones will be given to youths enrolled in graduate, postgraduate, diploma, paramedical, nursing courses and skill development programmes under the state government as well as to skilled workers who are enrolled on the government’s Sewa Mitra portal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-to-start-distributing-smartphones-tablets-to-students-from-december-2nd-week/articleshow/88016705.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||India||Flexi-fare mechanism in trains discriminatory: Parliament panel||NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel on railways has recommended the concerned ministry to review the flexi- or dynamic-fare mechanism in Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains, flagging that such pricing appears to be somewhat discriminatory.  It has also recommended the railways to revisit its policy of issuing a second reservation chart between the time frame of 30 minutes and 5 minutes before a particular train departs.  The report on the “Passenger Reservation System (PRS)” was tabled in both the houses of the Parliament on Tuesday.  The panel, headed by BJP MP Radha Mohan Singh, has observed that the fares in the premium trains are already higher as compared to other mail and express trains and are almost at par, and at some instances, higher than those of budget airlines.  It said with an enhanced fare structure in place for these trains, passengers with modest income or the financially disadvantaged rail users may not be able to afford these fares and may not opt for these trains. It has recommended the ministry to take a prudent decision of pricing of fares, which are balanced and based on equal footing.  On the issue of wait-listed tickets, the committee said the passengers can book tickets 120 days prior to the date of scheduled journey and the accommodation through the PRS is allotted on the first-come-first-serve basis. Thereafter, reservation against cancellation (RAC) and wait-listed tickets are issued. The status of RAC tickets gets updated automatically against cancellation of confirmed tickets.  However, taking note of the provision to book tickets after the first chart gets prepared, the panel said it found no logic in booking of tickets between the time frame of 30 minutes and 5 minutes before the departure of the train, when there are thousands of RAC and waitlisted tickets already booked and waiting for confirmation.  “The committee, therefore, is of the opinion that since Tatkal facilities are available for passengers wishing to travel at a short notice, all seats of the train found vacant after preparation of the first reservation chart — prepared 4-5 hours before the departure time — should automatically be allotted to RAC and wait-listed passengers,” it has recommended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/flexi-fare-mechanism-in-trains-discriminatory-parliament-panel/articleshow/88016686.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Return military land under commercial use to government: Pakistan SC||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Tuesday said the country’s law does not allow land meant for defence purposes to be used for commercial gains and that such land must be returned to the government once its strategic use ends for the armed forces. The apex court stated this while hearing a case related to the construction of commercial properties on the land allocated for defence purposes. A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed, Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin, and Justice Ijazul Ahsan was hearing the case. The court questioned the military for conducting commercial activities on government land and described the engagement of army in commercial activities as “unconstitutional and illegal”. “If these lands are not being used for defence purposes, then they must be returned to the government,” the top judge said, adding that the government was the owner of these lands. The chief justice observed that cinemas, marriage halls, petrol pumps, housing societies, and shopping malls are being constructed on land owned by the defence forces. “These are not defence-related objectives,” he reiterated. This practice, according to him, has been found on cantonment board lands all over the country. He said houses built on defence land were being sold for Rs 100 million. “Who will make these payments in return for taking the land back?” he asked. Expressing dissatisfaction over a report submitted by defence secretary Lieutensnt General (retired) Mian Mohammad Hilal Hussain, the top judge said: “General Sahib claims that illegally built buildings have been demolished, but they are still there.” The court directed the defence secretary to submit a detailed report within four weeks, identifying the purposes of each piece of cantonment land. “Under the law, strategic land can only be used for defence purposes,” the chief justice said. Cantonments in Pakistan are governed by the Cantonments Act of 1924. These huge military bases were primarily established for defence and strategic purposes but, in post-Partition era, the demographic character of these lands changed, as vast areas of cantonments were turned into centres of high-end housing societies and private businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/return-military-land-under-commercial-use-to-government-pakistan-sc/articleshow/88016743.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard an oral argument, still ongoing, in Trump's appeal of a judge's decision that the records should be turned over to a Congressional committee.  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why Trump should be able to challenge and overrule President Joe Biden's determination that the records should be handed over.  "Is there a circumstance where the former president ever gets to make this sort of call," asked Jackson, seen as a possible future Supreme Court nominee for Biden.  Clark argued that a 1978 law called the Presidential Records Act gives Trump that power.  "I don't see that in the statute," Jackson responded.  The House of Representatives select committee investigating the riot has asked the National Archives, the US agency housing Trump's White House records, to produce visitor logs, phone records and written communications between his advisers. The panel has said it needs the records to understand any role Trump may have played in fomenting the violence.  Judge Patricia Millett also asked why a former president's determination should overrule one by the current president.  "We only have one president at a time under our Constitution," Millett said.  The three judges also pressed Trump's lawyers Jesse Binnall and Justin Clark over whether courts even have jurisdiction to hear the former president's claims.  "All three branches of government have acknowledged there is a right of former presidents to challenge the designation and release of presidential records," Binnall responded.  Trump sued the committee and the National Archives to try to prevent the release. In court filings, Trump's lawyers called the Democratic-led investigation politically motivated, and argued that the documents sought by the committee are protected by executive privilege a legal doctrine that allows presidents to keep private some of their conversations with advisers.  During Tuesday's hearing, Judge Robert Wilkins said that Trump is not entitled to the type of document-by-document review he has requested before any of the records are released.  "It seems to me that your argument is inconsistent with our precedent," Wilkins told Clark.  Douglas Letter, a US House lawyer, told the judges that the committee is moving "expeditiously" with its investigation.  Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from formally certifying his 2020 presidential election loss to Biden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/judges-question-trump-bid-to-keep-us-capitol-riot-records-secret/articleshow/88016780.cms||---

An announcement to this effect was made by IDL on November 19, which stated that NASA and INL are seeking proposals from nuclear and space industry leaders to develop innovative technologies for a fission surface power (FSP) system for lunar power applications. The deadline for submitting the proposals is February 19, 2022. TOI had reported on December 27, 2020, that one of the last acts of President Trump was to issue on December 16, 2020, what is known as “Space Policy Directive-6” which lays out a national strategy for the responsible and effective use of space nuclear power and propulsion systems. The FSP project is sponsored by NASA in collaboration with the Department of Energy and INL “to establish a durable, high-power, sun-independent power source for NASA missions on the moon by the end of the decade, as well as potential subsequent missions”. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” said Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at INL in a statement. “Plentiful energy will be key to future space exploration,” said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate in Washington DC, which funds NASA’s fission surface power project. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Reuter added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soon-nuke-power-on-the-moon/articleshow/88016802.cms||Srinivas Laxman

The federal auditor has concluded that Indian Railways and forest departments did not give priority to construction of underpasses and overpasses on tracks to facilitate elephant movement, which resulted in high casualties. The CAG report, which was tabled in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, said the audit analysis found that 37 elephants were killed in the identified passages and 24 deaths occurred in the unidentified passages during the three years, which was covered in the audit. It found that precautionary measures like speed restrictions were not being enforced in the notified elephant passages. “There was no uniformity in dimension, height, colour and content of the elephant signage boards in Indian Railways. They were also placed in an incorrect position defeating their purpose of forewarning the drivers. Honey bee sound devices were not installed in some of the Zonal Railways,” a statement issued by the CAG said. The report consists of audit findings relating to compliance issues in respect of the ministry of railways and its various field units. According to the report, the audit reviewed 1,050 works contracts and observed that the price variation clause (PVC) was included, in contravention to the provisions of the General Financial Rules, in the general conditions of contract for even those whose period was less than 18 months, leading to avoidable payment of Rs 913 crore in 811 contracts. It was also observed that incorrect adoption of ‘base month’ for payment of PVC led to excess payment of Rs 20.3 crore in 93 contracts and short payment of Rs 4.3 crore in 35 contracts. “In most of the work contracts, time extensions were granted due to administrative failure on the part of railways. As a result, railway administration had to make an avoidable payment of Rs 187.5 crore to the contractors towards price variation in 514 contracts,” the CAG statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/more-elephants-died-on-identified-tracks-than-on-unidentified-ones-cag-audit-report/articleshow/88016842.cms||Dipak K Dash

While providing information, ADC (Jagraon)-cum-nodal officer vaccination Dr Nayan Jassal stated that a total of 7,90,263 persons are yet to receive their second jab of Covid-19 vaccination. She said that sadly, people believe that the Covid-19 has become thing of the past, which is not true. She said that everyone knows that with the new variant ‘Omicron’, people should not take Covid-19 lightly and should get fully vaccinated by visiting their nearest centre. She further stated that in the interest of public, 35 permanent vaccination centres have been set up in the district, where people can visit on any working day for vaccination. Dr Nayan further stated that 3,36,979 people are yet to receive their second jab of Covid-19 vaccine in Ludhiana Urban, 8,589 in Samrala, 97,305 in Koom Kalan, 6259 in Jagraon, 24585 in Hathur, 16685 in Machhiwara, 24278 in Malaud (Dehlon), 29030 in Pakhowal, 24278 in Mannupur (Khanna), 27671 in Payal, 7024 in Raikot, 88473 in Sahnewal, 25109 in Sidhwan Bet and 48999 persons in Sudhar area are yet to receive their second jab. She informed that some people still have their misconception that Covid-19 vaccination is not safe and that is why, they are not coming forward. “Such people should understand that if anyone wants to travel to any part of the globe, they require a vaccine passport certificate, that they would get only when they are fully vaccinated,” she said while adding that even for visiting Gurudwara in Shri Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, they need to be fully vaccinated. The ADC (Jagraon) herself made 30-40 calls to such persons today and urged them to get fully vaccinated at the earliest. She said that the SDMs have been directed to set up call centres in their respective sub divisions through which they would call such persons and motivate them to get fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/ludhiana-district-administration-urges-residents-to-get-second-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine/articleshow/88015870.cms||Shariq Majeed

It, however, did not disclose any timeline for notifying the CAA rules. In reply to a written question in the Lok Sabha, MoS(Home) Nityanand Rai also said the government had also not taken any decision to prepare the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), the official coinage for an all-India National Register of Citizens or NRC. Widespread protests and sit-ins against CAA and NRC were held in several parts of the country between December 2019 and March 2020. CAA was enacted in December 2019 but the rules are yet to be notified. The government has sought multiple extensions from committees of subordinate legislation, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with the latest one due to expire on January 9, 2022. Meanwhile, the home ministry informed the Lok Sabha that 1.33 crore Indian nationals were living in foreign countries. Also, 1.11 lakh Indians gave up their Indian citizenship till September 30 this year, up from 85,248 in 2020, but lower than 1.44 lakh in 2019, 1.34 lakh in 2018 and 1.33 lakh in 2017. As many as 10,645 foreign nationals applied for Indian citizenship between 2016 and 2020, of which 7782 were Pakistanis. Also, 4,177 applicants were granted citizenship between 2016 and 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/apply-for-citizenship-under-caa-once-rules-come-govt-says-but-mum-on-timeline/articleshow/88016873.cms||Bharti Jain

"We are very sensitive to this aspect. We are regularly monitoring and tracking terror plans and conspiracies hatched across the border, and since this is to be done by intelligence agencies, we are in touch with them to keep a strict watch. The government is very concerned and careful lest it is caught unawares," he said at a press conference organised by the BSF here. Stating that BSF has deployed around 62 companies, or roughly 6,000 troops, in Kashmir purely for law and order duties – years after it made way for CRPF to assist the J&K police in this function – Singh said this was done at the request of J&K police following the string of targeted civilian killings in October. “The main force for law and order there is CRPF…a huge chunk of CRPF. BSF that way is a much smaller composition as of now. But yes, we have sent this from all over because they probably thought that after the targeted killings that happened, it would be very essential and in interest of trying to build more confidence in the people in the rural areas as well as in Srinagar…that more forces should be seen and should be assisting J&K police in their law and order role,” he told mediapersons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bsf-dg-concedes-threat-of-pak-pushing-in-taliban-fighters-abandoned-us-military-equipment-into-kashmir/articleshow/88016912.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||'Shoptimize witnesses 650% rise in revenue in healthcare and nutrition segments'||Mangesh Panditrao is the co-founder and CEO of Shoptimize, a SaaS company with a subscription-based commercial model that helps brands take control of their digital growth. It has positioned itself as a one-stop platform for all direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce needs. Panditrao talks to TOI about the consumer trends witnessed by D2C brands during the festive season. Excerpts: How has the D2C market fared post the lockdown lift? How has the festive season uplifted the market for local merchants?The Covid-19 pandemic changed people's lives and affected businesses, and caused significant changes in consumer behaviour. Consumers started exploring other options to meet their requirements and interests. So, cashing in on the opportunity, D2C models were thrust into the forefront, allowing brands to access new consumers. With the increasing popularity of e-commerce, D2C is removing the barrier between vendors and consumers. Festivals hold a special place in our hearts, as they give us reason to celebrate. With the vaccination drive in full gear, there was a sense of optimism in the market during the festive season. Besides that, the brands also sought to entice customers with appealing deals and accept the new normal, concentrating on delivering personalised experiences. Traditional businesses, as well as new brands and start-ups, have started focussing on D2C as a revenue-generating channel. What were the key trends witnessed during the festive season across industry verticals?We noticed that online shopping dominated the retail ecosystem this festive season. A lot of categories saw tremendous growth in GMV from their D2C stores. Consumer buying sentiment has been very optimistic. One of the key trends we saw was a 50% increase in average order values across purchases in fashion, jewellery, accessories, cosmetics and personal-care products. The other trend we saw was that buyers are actively using mobile devices to not only research but also buy. Almost 90% of traffic and orders are via mobile devices for most of the categories. The only exception is the electronics and consumer goods category, where traffic is still mainly via mobile, but over 60% prefer to purchase via desktop. We also saw a 650% increase in revenue in the healthcare and nutrition sectors. The growth of D2C e-commerce is visible across almost all segments. Brands are adopting D2C with renewed vigour and developing connections with their buyers. Any significant changes in the consumer buying patterns?The pandemic has expedited digital adoption in India, which had already begun to gain traction because of high internet and smartphone penetration. Consumers are increasingly interested in value-based purchasing and online shopping. As people have grown more health-conscious, their focus has shifted to necessities and sustainable living, increasing the demand for hygiene and cleaning products. We've witnessed a shift in spending patterns on our platform, with a preference for the right digital payment platform and options. Many consumers are opting for 'buy now pay later' or 'zero-cost EMI' options, especially for high-value items. The concept of digital payments is leading us toward a cashless society, which will persist beyond the pandemic. We've also noticed that social media has a substantial impact on purchasing decisions. How has Shoptimize Growth Platform enabled small merchants to scale up? How many merchants are active with Shoptimize currently?Direct-to-consumer (D2C) e-commerce is becoming an increasingly important growth channel for brands, traditional and new-age. We work with ambitious D2C brands in scaling this channel and making it profitable. We recently launched the ‘Shoptimize Accelerator’, an exclusive, invite-only programme aimed at helping consumer brands achieve exponential revenue growth. This programme operates on a revenue-sharing partnership model. What sort of traction have you observed from Tier-2 and 3 cities in the last three months?In the last year and a half, with the pandemic, we already knew that Tier-2 and 3 cities had begun to actively adopt online shopping. But this year's festive shopping data clearly reflects the penetration of not just marketplace e-commerce but also D2C brand e-commerce, which is a very encouraging sign for brands adopting this channel. Tier-2 and 3 cities have contributed high volumes to D2C sales over the last quarter. As per data from the growth platform during the festive season, Tier-1 cities accounted for 50% of revenues. However, Tier-2 and 3 cities had 15-20% higher average order values than Tier-1 buyers. The rising adoption of digital payment coupled with the high adoption of social commerce has led to the growth of D2C sales in Tier-2 and 3 cities. Brands have been actively using vernacular language ads to attract and retain buyers from small cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shoptimize-witnesses-650-rise-in-revenue-in-healthcare-and-nutrition-segments/articleshow/88015243.cms||John Sarkar

---||India||Demographic shift in Assam, Bengal likely behind jurisdiction move: BSF DG||NEW DELHI: BSF director general Pankaj Kumar Singh on Tuesday said the “demographic balance has been upset to a great degree” over a period of time in border states like Assam and West Bengal and the Centre possibly extended the border force’s jurisdiction to 50 km in these states and Punjab so that it could help and coordinate with state police to catch hold of infiltrators. His statement coincided with the home ministry’s reply to a question in Lok Sabha, stating that the federal concerns of Punjab and West Bengal government over the notification enhancing the BSF’s jurisdiction are “ill-founded” and the extension of territorial jurisdiction of BSF would result in better control on trans-border crime in conjunction and cooperation with state police. Addressing a press conference, Singh said,“ There have been agitations in certain states andrevolts by people because of reasons like the demographic pattern change. Even the voter pattern has changed in border neighbouring districts.” He said that a survey in the border districts by the BSF had corroborated this. “The government, probably in its vision, thought that BSF being a border guarding force, if its jurisdiction is increased from 15 km to 50 km (belt along the international border), it can help, support and coordinate with the state police in catching hold of infiltrators,” he said. He clarified that there is no case for BSF trying to intrude into local police’s functioning or trying to function as a parallel police force. He said the BSF’s extended jurisdiction would allow it to help state police also effectively curb trans-border crimes like smuggling of narcotics and weapons. While in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam the BSF jurisdiction was enhanced from the earlier 15 km to 50 km, in Gujarat, the same limit has been reduced from 80 km to 50 km and kept unchanged in Rajasthan at 50 km. The issue created controversy as opposition ruled Punjab and West Bengal denounced the move and their respective assemblies moved resolutions against this decision of the Union government. The BSF DG on Tuesday said cattle-smuggling had been tackled to a great extent on the Indo-Bangladesh border with cases down to 18,000 till October this year from 1.70 lakh till 2-3 years back. Also, around 3,000 persons were arrested while infiltrating or exfiltrating across the eastern border. Singh said the BSF was using indigenous technical solutions for stepping up border surveillance as servicing and maintenance of foreign gadgets was expensive and time-consuming. He admitted that there is no foolproof anti-drone system yet. The DG further added that the 674-strong dog squad of BSF was being deployed in border areas with low visibility as the canines could see, smell and hear infiltration activity better than humans. There have been 10 cases where the dogs detected the infiltrators, some of whom ran back to the neighbouring territory while abandoning the contraband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/demographic-shift-in-assam-bengal-likely-behind-jurisdiction-move-bsf-dg/articleshow/88016928.cms||Bharti Jain

The award has come Nandani Kushwaha’s way for devising a smart data-based AI tool that identifies the most suitable crop for soil by analysing the various nutritional components present in it The entire initiative has been envisioned under the national programme for government schools, named ‘Responsible AI for youth’. It has been conceived and designed jointly by the national e-governance division, ministry of electronics and information technology, government of India and Intel India. The prodigal girl, a resident of village Patha under Mahroni tehsil of Lalitpur district, is a student of grade IX of GGIC. She was inspired by her mathematics teacher Prakash Bhushan Mishra during the Covid-19 lockdown, when the specially devised website under project ‘Responsible AI for youth’ was launched. At that time she was in grade VIII, studying in the upper primary school of her village. Inspired by her teacher, Nandani took online classes through her mobile phone and showed her talent. As a result, she was presented with a laptop by Intel India, which further pushed her motivation. Sensing the day-to-day problems related to skewed crop production because of poor soil quality, Nandani based her project on the issue and named it ‘Mitti ko jano, fasal pehchano’. Elaborating her project, Nadani said, “It is a smart data-based AI tool that identifies the most suitable crop for soil by analysing the various nutritional components present in it. This model can be deployed as a physical soil detection tool that will help farmers to understand their soil accurately and make informed decisions.” “With the help of my AI project, data is retrieved from the mud for its content of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity content, PH value and rainfall. Based on these data, we can predict the right choice of crop for getting optimal production. I have seen all the farmers, including my father, facing this challenge of low crop production for years together,” she said. “Despite the best of the efforts, they failed in achieving good results. This burning problem became my source of inspiration for selecting this project,” said Nandani over a phone call with TOI from India Habitat Centre, Delhi. She was invited to the programme along with other selected participants to receive the prize and display their projects during the ongoing weeklong ‘Azadi ka Digital Mahotsav’. The projects were viewed by some of the top scientists and experts from across the country. Talking to TOI about the outstanding achievement of Nandani, CDO Lalitpur, Anil Kumar Pandey said, “It is a very inspiring story for all the students of the district as well as the state. We will not only felicitate her once she comes here, but will set her example to motivate other students also.” Nandani was accompanied to the exhibition by her father, Jamunaprasad Kushwaha, a farmer, who had no idea as to what her daughter has achieved, except the fact that she has been invited for some big invention by the Union government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-lalitpur-village-girls-device-among-countrys-top-20-ai-based-projects/articleshow/88016954.cms||Arindam Ghosh

---||World||Over-60s, vulnerable should postpone travel due to Omicron: WHO||GENEVA: The WHO said Tuesday that while blanket travel bans would not stop the spread of the Omicron variant, Covid-vulnerable people, including the over-60s, should postpone plans to travel abroad. Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant of concern which the World Health Organization says poses a "very high" risk globally, has prompted many countries to shut their borders. "Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread, and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods," the WHO said in a travel advice statement on Omicron. "In addition, they can adversely impact global health efforts during a pandemic by disincentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data." First reported to the WHO less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier this month, Omicron has already appeared in several countries. The WHO noted the increasing number of governments introducing travel measures, including temporarily banning arrivals from countries where the variant has been found. The WHO said that as of Sunday, 56 countries were reportedly implementing travel measures aimed at potentially delaying the importation of the new variant. "It is expected that the Omicron variant will be detected in an increasing number of countries as national authorities step up their surveillance and sequencing activities," it said. "Persons who are unwell or at risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease and dying, including people 60 years of age or older or those with co-morbidities (e.g. heart disease, cancer and diabetes), should be advised to postpone travel," said the WHO. The WHO advised countries to apply an "evidence-informed and risk-based approach" when implementing travel measures. The UN health agency said national authorities in countries of departure, transit and arrival could apply mitigation measures that might delay or reduce the exportation and importation of the variant. They could include screening passengers, testing and quarantine. "All measures should be commensurate with the risk, time-limited and applied with respect to travellers' dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms." The WHO said that "essential international travel", including for humanitarian missions, repatriations and transport of vital supplies, should always be prioritised during the pandemic. Earlier Tuesday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told member states to keep calm and take "rational" steps in response to Omicron. "We call on all member states to take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures," he said. "The global response must be calm, coordinated and coherent." Tedros stressed that it remains unclear how dangerous the variant is. "We still have more questions than answers about the effect of Omicron on transmission, severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines," he said. The WHO chief said it was understandable that countries wanted to protect their citizens "against a variant that we don't yet fully understand". "But I am equally concerned that several member states are introducing blunt, blanket measures that are not evidence-based or effective on their own, and which will only worsen inequities."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/over-60s-vulnerable-should-postpone-travel-due-to-omicron-who/articleshow/88016967.cms||---

---||World||US judge sentences wife of Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo' to three years in prison||WASHINGTON: A United States judge sentenced the wife of imprisoned Mexican drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman to three years in prison on Tuesday, after she pleaded guilty to helping the Sinaloa drug cartel.  Before her sentencing in a federal court in Washington, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 32, pleaded with US District Judge Rudolph Contreras to show her mercy.  "With all due respect, I address you today to express my true regret for any and all harm that I may have done, and I ask that you and all the citizens of this country forgive me," she said in Spanish through an interpreter.  She added that she feared the judge might find it difficult to forgive her because she is Guzman's wife. "Perhaps for this reason you feel there is a need for you to be harder on me, but I pray that you not do that," she added. Coronel pleaded guilty in June to three counts of conspiring to distribute illegal drugs, conspiring to launder money and of engaging in financial dealings with the Sinaloa drug cartel.  Federal prosecutors on Tuesday asked that a four-year prison term be imposed on Coronel, adding that she would be forfeiting $1.5 million as part of her sentence.  "While the overall effect of the defendant's conduct was significant, the defendant's actual role was a minimal one. The defendant acted primarily in support of her husband," federal prosecutor Anthony Nardozzi said.  He noted that after her arrest, she "quickly accepted responsibility for her criminal conduct".  Coronel, a US-born former beauty queen who married Guzman while she was a teenager, was arrested at Dulles International Airport outside Washington in February. She and Guzman have nine-year-old twin daughters together.  As part of her plea agreement with prosecutors, Coronel admitted to acting as a courier between Guzman and other members of the Sinaloa cartel while he was being held in Mexico's Altiplano prison following his 2014 arrest.  Guzman used those communications to plan his 2015 escape from the prison, through an underground tunnel built by the cartel leading to the shower in his cell.  The drug lord was recaptured in January 2016 and extradited one year later to the United States.  He was convicted in February 2019 of drug trafficking, conspiracy, kidnapping, murder and other charges, and later sentenced to life in prison. Coronel's attorney on Tuesday stressed that she was swept into the world of drug trafficking while still a minor, and deserved mercy.  "She met Joaquin Guzman when she was a minor. She was 17 years old, and she married him on her 18th birthday," said Jeffrey Lichtman, a defence attorney who also represented Guzman in his US trial three years ago.  Lichtman added that Coronel now finds herself in danger, noting that anonymous law enforcement sources told news media that she was cooperating with the government.  "I'm not sure that she could ever go back home," he said.  Contreras said that he took her background into consideration when weighing the sentence, as well as the fact that she will be the sole caretaker for her children due to her husband's life sentence.  "Good luck to you," he told her as the hearing concluded. "I hope that you raise your twins in a different environment than you've experienced today."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-judge-sentences-wife-of-mexican-drug-lord-el-chapo-to-three-years-in-prison/articleshow/88017098.cms||---

Naidu criticised the 12 suspended MPs, saying that their behaviour in the House during monsoon session was an “act of sacrilege” since the Parliament is the “temple of democracy”. He defended the decision to suspend them stating that the lawmakers have not expressed any remorse, rather they were justifying their actions. As he turned down the appeal of leader of opposition (LoP) M Mallikarjun Kharge saying the appeal is “not worth considering”, Congress and most other opposition party MPs staged a walkout from the Upper House. However, in an indication of the faultlines in the opposition camp, Trinamool MPs walked out a short while later after Derek O’Brien said it’s not the opposition, but 80 NDA MPs who should be suspended for blocking discussions. Earlier, raising the issue of the suspended MPs, Kharge said the motion for suspension moved by the government had been in “gross violation” of the procedure with the Chair not even allowing his point of order. He urged Naidu to set aside the suspension. Rejecting the charge that he suddenly permitted parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi to move a resolution as anti-democratic, Naidu said, "Action has been taken to protect democracy". Read AlsoTRS says time to end pro-BJP perception, opposition waryThe surprise TRS aggression caught all parties unawares, with many including Congress seeing a “hidden agenda” behind keeping the House disturbed when the opposition wanted to join discussions. Senior TRS leader and Rajya Sabha MP Keshav Rao, however, sought to allay apprehensions by saying that hisThe day saw both sides trading charges and accusing each other of short-circuiting parliamentary norms and procedures, but some of the ice was broken at a meeting of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla with floor leaders in the evening. The opposition leaders are understood to have agreed to participate in discussions from Wednesday though TRS remains determined to raise the demand for a law on minimum support prices by entering the well. The likely situation in Rajya Sabha is not clear. Read AlsoSuspension flawed: Opposition ups ante, writes to NaiduNEW DELHI: The opposition on Tuesday termed the order to suspend 12 Rajya Sabha MPs for an incident that happened in the monsoon session of Parliament in August as flawed and violative of the rules, even as it rubbished the argument of the Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu that the Upper chamber"..the august House is being subjected to sacrilege and that too propelled by a sense of competition among some sections of the House since the commencement of monsoon session. Everything said or done, violating, hurting and destroying the sacredness of any place amounts to an act of sacrilege...Entering this sanctum sanctorum of the House, in itself is an act of sacrilege and it has been happening quite often in a routine manner," Naidu said on Tuesday. He also rejected arguments that the suspended MPs had not been named earlier citing that 33 members who had violated norms were indeed named, and this included the 12 members. Naidu flagged some members disrupted House proceedings for 17 days during the monsoon session. On the issue of bills being passed in din, the Chairman said, "You create din and then you don’t participate. I have the list." Lok Sabha proceedings were disrupted on Tuesday and the House was adjourned till 2 pm soon after it met at 11 am, amid opposition protests over various issues. Speaker Om Birla’s repeated pleas to run the House were ignored when TRS members shouted slogans and displayed placards standing in the well while other opposition members, including from Congress and Left parties, sought to raise some issues from their seats. In signs of a deepening rift between the government and the opposition, essentially over the expulsion of 12 members from the Upper House, Congress, NCP, DMK and Left parties walked out of the House alleging that the government was suppressing the voice of the opposition. The TMC MPs however did not walk out along with the rest of the opposition just as in Rajya Sabha. At 2 pm when the House met again, the same demand from TRS members in the well saw A Raja, who was in the Chair adjourning House till 3pm and a similar scene was repeated when it reopened at 3, at which the House was adjourned for the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/parliament-stalled-as-vp-refuses-to-revoke-suspension-of-12-mps/articleshow/88017169.cms||---

Held over the weekend at CyberHub, the event saw dozens of bearded and moustachioed men participate in the competition, across several categories. Ayush Naresh Kumar's unusual and elaborate beard was a subject of much fascination at the eventThere were prizes for the longest beard, the funkiest beard, the best handlebar moustache, etc. The two grand prizes were dubbed Mr Beard 2021 and Mr Beard and Body 2021. Over 150 participants from across the country participated in the competition, with some travelling from Kerala and West Bengal. Praveen Parameshwaran, who travelled from Kerala to participate in the event, said, "I'm pleasantly surprised to see so many interesting beards coming from different parts of the country. It's amazing." The competition has been hosted in Gurgaon for four years now and this year, post-pandemic, it saw an increase in number of entrants as many people began keeping facial hair during the pandemic. "I have kept this beard for around 10 months. My family and girlfriend aren't big fans of it but I refuse to let go of this," said Rakesh from Jind in Haryana, who started growing his beard after watching Saif Ali Khan's bearded look during the pandemic. Praveen Parameshwaran travelled all the way from Kerala to participate in the eventRakesh Kundu told us he started keeping his beard after watching Saif Ali KhanThe competition aside, there was quite a lot of bonhomie and camaraderie among the participants with newbies and veterans sharing tips and gyaan on facial hair grooming. Talking about what his beard means to him, Jai, a contestant from Delhi, shared, "For me, beard is part of my identity. Shaving this off is almost like being naked. It's my baby and I care for it just like that. Whether it is long or short, I always have a beard." The event was part of the global No Shave November movement, which is aimed at raising awareness about the hazards of prostate cancer in men.

---||Business||Q2 GDP growth at 8.4%, government sees double-digit rise in FY22||NEW DELHI: The country’s economy grew by 8.4% in the July-September quarter, broadly in line with expectations, led by a steady farm sector and double-digit expansion in public administration, defence and other services as the impact of the base effect waned and weighed on the overall numbers. Data released by the National Statistical Office on Tuesday showed the economy grew an annual 8.4% in the three months to September, slower than the 20.1% expansion recorded in the previous quarter but above the 7.4% contraction in the second quarter of the previous year. The Indian economy has recovered swiftly after the bruising impact of the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2020-21, when it contracted a record 24.4%. While some economists said the disaggregated data for the September quarter was far from convincing, the government asserted that the economic recovery has continued robustly in the second quarter and the base effect does not make it less noteworthy. Chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said the economy was likely to have double-digit growth in 2021-22, 6.5% next year and above 7% thereafter. He said the impact of the second generation economic reforms unveiled by the government will continue to unfold and strengthen the recovery. Read AlsoJoblessness in urban areas fell to 9.4% in January-MarchThe unemployment rate in urban areas in the January-March quarter of 2020-21 was 9.4%, lower than the 10.3% recorded in the October-December quarter of the previous year, data showed on Thursday. The rate cooled down after being in double digits for the past three quarters.Industry and the crucial services sectors were largely the growth drivers in the second quarter. The services sector rose 16.2% quarter on quarter and 10.2% year-on-year. The reopening of economic activity and resumption of contact-intensive services has added to the momentum. The sharp pick-up in vaccination is expected to help in boosting consumer sentiment. The data showed that private consumption was up 11% from the previous quarter while investment was 13% higher but estimates by Care Ratings showed that as a percentage of GDP private consumption at 57.3% was the lowest in the last five quarters while investments (as measured by gross fixed capital formation — GFCF) continued to be below 30%. A State Bank of India research report said overall, the economy is still operating at 95.6% of pre-pandemic level (with "trade, hotels, transport, communication & services related to broadcasting" still at 80%) and it should take one more quarter to recoup the losses. Economists said price pressures and the risk posed by the new coronavirus variant could pose challenges for the domestic and global economic recovery. "While the Indian economy has come off the record decline of last year, it is yet to surpass pre-pandemic levels in a meaningful manner. Even if the pace of recovery is sustained in the next two quarters, India’s GDP for the year is expected to be only marginally higher than that in FY20 (by around 2%)," Care Ratings said in a note. "Demand and investments are yet to see a meaningful and durable pick-up. Improvements in these are expected to be limited and gradual given that even before the pandemic, the domestic economy was grappling with low demand and subdued investment climate. To add to this, domestic and external challenges and uncertainties abound. The rise in price levels and the underlying threat from new variants of the Covid virus and the associated challenges of on-and-off restrictions and lockdowns could be a setback/challenge for domestic as well as global recovery," according to the credit rating agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/q2-gdp-growth-at-8-4-government-sees-double-digit-rise-in-fy22/articleshow/88017212.cms||---

The markets started on a strong note after US President Joe Biden said the new variant was a cause for concern but not panic. The sensex was up about 900 points. The mood, however, changed soon after the chief of Moderna, the US drug maker whose Covid vaccine is widely used around the world, said the existing vaccines may not be as effective against Omicron variant. As a result, the sensex lost over 1,300 points (about 2.2%) from its intra-day high at 58,184 to 56,868. Some end-of-the-session buying saw the index closing with a loss of 196 points at 57,065, near a three-month low. On the NSE, the nifty closed 71 points down at 16,983. During November, the sensex lost 2,242 points or 4%, the worst monthly points and percentage loss for the index this year. However, thanks to a series of new listings, which added to the country’s market capitalisation, the dip in total investors’ wealth on a monthly basis was limited to just 2 lakh crore with BSE’s market cap now at Rs 260.2 lakh crore, official data showed. The recent slide in the sensex came on the back of aggressive selling by foreign funds while domestic funds bought to cushion the impact of that selling. For November, while foreign investors were net sellers at about Rs 11,400 crore, domestic funds recorded a net buying figure of Rs 30,560 crore, BSE and CDSL data showed. In Tuesday’s market, Reliance Industries, Kotak Bank and HDFC were the top contributors to the sensex’s loss while Infosys and TCS, to some extent, cushioned the fall. At close of the session, foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 5,445 crore while domestic funds were net buyers at Rs 5,350 crore, BSE data showed. According to Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, global markets remained weak over concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccines against this new Omicron variant. Sentiments got charred following Moderna’s statement that existing Covid-19 vaccines would struggle to cope with the Omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness. “The new variant has now spread to more than a dozen countries around the world, thus, prompting the introduction of new travel curbs,” Khemka wrote in a post-market note to investors. “Crude prices too came under pressure as the Omicron concerns returned, with investors worried about fresh lockdowns and its impact on global demand.” Around the world, Nikkei in Japan closed 1.6% lower in late sell-off while Europe was deep in the red in early trades when Indian markets closed. The US markets also opened weak on fears that the new variant may again lead to lockdowns around the world that, in turn, could affect the current fragile economic recovery process. Leading US indices were down around 1.3% each in mid-session while WTI crude oil was down over 4% at $67-per-barrel and bitcoin was trading flat at around $57,300.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/omicron-effect-doubts-over-moderna-vaccine-efficacy-roil-markets/articleshow/88017297.cms||---

---||India||Covid-19: Omicron does not escape RT-PCR and RAT, says govt||NEW DELHI: The Omicron variant does not escape RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing (RAT), the Centre has underlined while advising states to immediately ramp up testing. A senior official said 764 samples were genome-sequenced between November 26 and November 30 and no case of the Omicron variant was detected till Tuesday. Genome sequencing is crucial not only to ascertain whether the new variant has entered the country, but also to identify and analyse its characteristics, behaviour and severity. The health ministry also advised states to strengthen surveillance. In a review meeting with states and UTs on Tuesday, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan stressed the need to send all positive samples for genome sequencing to INSACOG labs (mapped with states) promptly. He also advised states to undertake aggressive contact tracing of positive individuals and follow up for 14 days. Testing of samples of international travellers coming from “at risk” countries on the first day and of specified category of passengers on the eighth day needs to be scrupulously done, he said. Passengers from “at risk” countries are being advised to prepare to wait at the airports till their report of the RT-PCR test reports are available. The Centre also extended the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ vaccination campaign till December 31 with a focus on 100% first-dose coverage and completing the backlog of second-dose vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-omicron-does-not-escape-rt-pcr-and-rat-says-govt/articleshow/88017600.cms||Sushmi Dey

The authors suggest prioritising this group for vaccination has important implications worldwide. The Scottish study covered over 7.5 lakh school students aged 5-17 in the UK between March 2020 and July 2021. The findings, published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, assume significance as an expert panel in India has also readied a comprehensive plan to prioritise children of a certain age group and with underlying conditions to receive the Covid vaccine first. Once the plan is approved, the government may consider starting vaccination of children though it is too early yet to specify a date for the same, officials say. At present, India has approved only Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D for immunisation of children above 12 years. The Lancet study points out the overall risk of children with asthma becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 is low, with 1 in 380 children with poorly controlled asthma in the study hospitalised with Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kids-with-poorly-controlled-asthma-more-at-covid-risk-says-study/articleshow/88017669.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Act, which had led to constitution of Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, on lines of Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, headed by an IAS officer, was opposed by priests of the Char Dham shrines as they claimed it would deprive them of their “centuries-old rights of administering temples.” Speaking about the move to repeal the Act, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, “The decision has been taken on the basis of reports of two committees formed by us, whose members spoke to stakeholders and recommended the law be repealed. Social organisations, priests and several sections of the society were consulted. In the future, if we do decide to take a call on the issue, we will make sure everyone’s opinion is taken into account.” The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill had been mooted by ex-CM Trivendra Singh Rawat. The board was mandated to be responsible for management of funds received by the temples, take decisions related to pilgrimages and carry out developmental works in and around the four Char Dham shrines. Bureaucrats and public representatives were made members of the board while teerth purohits (priests) claimed they were not made part of the process. Soon after it was formed, protests, led by priests and opposition Congress, started across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/char-dham-law-junked-shrines-back-in-priests-control/articleshow/88017709.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||India||Supreme Court seeks Mallya's presence on January 18 to sentence him for contempt||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked fugitive businessman Vijay Mallay, sheltered in UK despite proceedings for his extradition to India attaining finality, to appear before it on January 18 for quantification of sentence, more than four years after he was convicted for contempt of court for transferring abroad $40 million from United Spirits despite the SC barring it. On May 9, 2017, The SC had convicted Mallya guilty of contempt of court and had directed him to appear personally before the court on July 10, 2017 for determination of quantum of punishment. But, Mallya had already fled the country to the UK by then and never bothered to appear before the court while contesting in various forums the Indian government's attempt to extradite him. After he lost in resisting his extradition, he appears to have entered into a secret proceedings with the UK government Ministry of External Affairs through solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed a bench of Justices U U Lalit, S R Bhat and Bela M Trivedi that the extradition proceedings have attained finality but the UK government has not divulged any details of the 'secret' proceedings pending qua Mallya, which is delaying his extradition to India. Justice Lalit-led bench said he was found guilty of contempt of court on May 9, 2017 and has never bothered to appear before the court. Thereafter, even though the court had directed the Centre to secure his presence before the SC, it could not be done because of pending proceedings in the UK. Adjournments and intervention of pandemic delayed hearing on quantification of Mallya's sentence, the bench said. "We have waited sufficiently and cannot wait any longer. The matter has to see the light of the day. If the person wants to appear before us on January 18, he can do so. Otherwise, he can be brought before the court through extradition. If these two options do not happen, he can appear through a lawyer. He is at liberty to advance his arguments on sentencing on January 18," the bench said and appointed senior advocate Jaideep Gupta as amicus curiae to assist the court in the matter. The MEA's note to the SC said, following refusal of leave to appeal against extradition, Mallya should have been extradited to India within 28 days of the May 14, 2020 order. However, the UK Home office intimated that there is a further legal issue which needs to be resolved before Mallya's extradition, it said. "The UK side has informed that extradition of VM (Mallya) cannot take place until a separate legal issue, which is judicial and confidential in nature, is resolved. The UK side emphasized that neither they can provide more details nor intervene in the process. They have also indicated that through the designated channel, the UK Home Office has received a request to serve summons on VM for his hearing before the Supreme Court (of India). The British Home Office has forwarded. the Supreme Court's order through the Hertfordshire Police on September 17, 20202 for serving it to VM," MEA informed the SC. Mallya was found in breach of orders of the Debt Recovery Tribunal, Karnataka HC and the Supreme Court. SC had found that money had come to the United Spirit account from Diageo PLC on February 25, 2016 and it was taken out by Mallya between February 26 and February 29, 2016, despite an express court prohibition against this. Again, the accrual of this money to your account was never disclosed to the SC along with your assets as you were mandated to do," the bench said before reserving the verdict. Mallya had received $40 million from Diageo Plc for a non-compete clause relating to the United Spirits, from which the board of directors he resigned following the agreement and payment. He had transferred this money out to other accounts, thus putting it beyond the reach of the court which was hearing petitions by a consortium of banks led by SBI demanding repayment of Rs 9,000 crore loan with interest advanced to Mallya and his companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/convicted-4-years-ago-vijay-mallya-told-by-supreme-court-to-appear-for-sentencing/articleshow/88017770.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The rate cooled down after being in double digits for the past three quarters. The data — released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday — showed that the unemployment rate for females of all ages cooled to 11.8% in the January-March quarter from 13.1% in the October-December quarter. It was at 10.5% in the January-March quarter of 2020. The overall unemployment rate for all ages was at 9.1% in the January-March quarter. The strict lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of Covid pushed the overall unemployment rate to 20.9% in the April-June quarter of 2020, raising worries about the job situation across the country. Since the opening up of the economy, there has been a steady improvement in the job scenario although the unemployment rate remains high. Several states still displayed double-digit rates for the all-ages category. “The latest PLFS survey for Q4FY21 reveals a steady improvement in employment over previous quarters of FY21. While the overall unemployment rate improved from 10.3% to 9.4%during the quarter, state-wise data indicate a mixed picture with some of the advanced states still witnessing double-digit unemployment rate,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor at State Bank of India. “Perhaps, the most satisfying was the decline in female unemployment rate far outpaced male unemployment rate," said Ghosh. The NSO released the quarterly bulletin of the Periodic Labour Force survey, which is a key indicator of the measure of labour force participation rate, the worker population ratio and the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons unemployed in the labour force. The PLFS was launched by the NSO to estimate the employment and unemployment indicators in the short time interval of three months for urban areas only in the current weekly status. Under CWS, a person is considered as unemployed in a week if he/she did not work even for one hour on any day during the reference week but sought or was available for work at least for one hour on any day during the week, according to PLFS. The annual PLFS report covers both rural and urban areas whereas the quarterly bulletin is for urban centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/joblessness-in-urban-areas-fell-to-9-4-in-january-march/articleshow/88017810.cms||---

Just over 3.1 lakh cases were reported during the month, a drop of 40% from 5.2 lakh infections logged during October. This was the sixth consecutive month of falling coronavirus cases in India since the peak of the second wave in May this year, when more than 90 lakh Covid-19 cases were officially recorded in the country. Meanwhile, for the first time since June 3 last year, active cases of the virus in the country fell below the 1-lakh mark on Tuesday, marking the lowest point in the pandemic in India in nearly 17 months. In November, except for the week after Diwali, daily cases of the virus have steadily fallen through the month. The average daily cases in the first seven days of the month was 11,559, which had fallen to 8,893 by the last seven days. More than 1.7 lakh cases during the month were recorded in Kerala alone, which accounted for nearly 56% of all infections in India. The pandemic, however, receded steadily in the state through the month. While cases continued to fall in the country, the death toll count appeared bleaker because of a large number of old fatalities from previous months being added to the count. The country reported 10,812 deaths in November, up from 10,169 in the previous month, and the highest toll since August. Of these, only 3,744 were recent deaths while the rest were fatalities from previous periods added to the toll, mostly by Kerala. In the last two months since October 1, the cumulative Covid death toll in Kerala has risen from around 25,000 to 40,132, as of November 30. A majority of these deaths were from earlier periods and have now been designated Covid fatalities following court guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/with-3-1-lakh-cases-covid-tally-in-november-lowest-since-may-2020/articleshow/88017849.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Moreover, on a question of legal guarantee to minimum support price (MSP), the agriculture ministry preferred to keep mum and instead listed steps the government had taken to ensure procurement at support price so that subsidised foodgrains are supplied to the poor and needy. “The ministry of agriculture & farmers welfare has no record in the matter and hence the question does not arise,” said agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Lok Sabha in his written response to a Parliament question on the number of cases registered against farmers during agitation, data on the number of farmers who died during protests and whether the government proposes to provide financial assistance to kin of farmers who died during the movement. Farmer unions have claimed that over 700 farmers died during the agitation and cases were registered against over 50,000 farmers in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi. Besides, they claimed, the railways also registered hundreds of cases. On the MSP issue, Tomar said, “The government extends price support for paddy and wheat through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State agencies. Under this policy, whatever foodgrains are offered by farmers within the stipulated period & conforming to the specifications prescribed by government are purchased at MSP by the state government agencies including FCI for Central Pool.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-stays-mum-on-msp-says-no-record-of-dead-protesters/articleshow/88017896.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||India||Suspension flawed: Opposition ups ante, writes to Naidu||NEW DELHI: The opposition on Tuesday termed the order to suspend 12 Rajya Sabha MPs for an incident that happened in the monsoon session of Parliament in August as flawed and violative of the rules, even as it rubbished the argument of the Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu that the Upper chamber was a “continuous house” where punitive action was not restricted by the limitation of individual sessions. CPM MP Elamaram Kareem told TOI that the 12 MPs are seeking legal counsel over their suspension. Terming the suspension as “unprecedented excessive action” in a tersely-worded letter, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge appeared to refer to the discussion in the RS on Tuesday morning, in which Naidu had said that the opposition was wrong to claim that action could not be taken in the winter session on an issue pertaining to the monsoon session. He has argued that unlike Lok Sabha (which is renewed after every general elections), the Upper House was a “continuous house”. Kharge wrote that while the council of states is a “continuous house” as per Article 83 of the Constitution, its functioning is based on each session being summoned by the President under Article 85(1). He argued that after every session, the House is adjourned sine die and prorogued, and the monsoon session was prorogued by the President on August 31. “If the House had only been adjourned and then re-convened without any prorogation, the argument of continuity would merit any justification,” Kharge said. Besides, Kharge told Naidu that the government motion seeking suspension constituted three violations of the “rules of procedure and conduct of business”. He argued that the motion could not be considered passed by the House since the entire opposition was opposed to it, and did not constitute consensus of the House. He said the members were denied an opportunity to present their cases while one suspended MP was never referred to in the bulletin on August 11. Besides, Kharge said the suspension had to be preceded by the naming of the members. The letter questioning the chair as well as the government’s arguments for suspension marked an escalation of the confrontation. The opposition has decided to meet again on Wednesday morning to decide on the future course. Suspended MPs, along with other opposition leaders will also regroup after the dharna on Wednesday to take stock of the day’s developments and decide the future course of action. Trinamool Congress, which has been protesting separately, will also join the opposition dharna tomorrow (Wednesday). While some opposition MPs had on Monday raised the possibility of the boycott of entire winter session if the suspension was not reversed, the anti-BJP bloc appeared to relent on Tuesday. Many felt it will not send the right message. The two meetings in Kharge’s office, one before the start of the proceedings and another after the walk out, saw some parties speak against full boycott and advocated that they continue to raise the issue in the house. The morning meeting was also attended by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is a Lok Sabha member. A surprise addition to the strategy session was Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) through senior MP Keshav Rao, who also extended support to opposition protests inside and outside Parliament. The opposition bloc struck a strident “no apology” stance. Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Apology for what? For raising people’s concern in Parliament? Not at all!” However, the joint opposition met chairman Naidu and also deputy chairperson Harivansh. A leader said that compromise was still not ruled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/suspension-flawed-opposition-ups-ante-writes-to-naidu/articleshow/88017911.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||India||TRS says time to end pro-BJP perception, opposition wary||NEW DELHI: As the Speaker adjourned the Lok Sabha on Tuesday following protests by Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) members, Congress distanced itself from the south-based outfit and said it wanted to participate in the proceedings of the House. The surprise TRS aggression caught all parties unawares, with many including Congress seeing a “hidden agenda” behind keeping the House disturbed when the opposition wanted to join discussions. Congress deputy leader in Lok Sabha, Gaurav Gogoi, tweeted to this effect. Senior TRS leader and Rajya Sabha MP Keshav Rao, however, sought to allay apprehensions by saying that his party was genuinely committed to the opposition ranks. “We are fighting BJP, we opposed the farm laws. But there is a perception that TRS is close to BJP. That perception has to go now. It’s time,” he told TOI. Lok Sabha MP Venkatesh Borlakunta said BJP is confusing the Telangana farmers over paddy procurement and the Centre needs to clarify. What was even more intriguing was that TRS, which has largely kept a distance from the opposition bloc, joined the strategy session called by the leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, with Rao attending. It is to be seen how the change of stance by TRS is viewed by the opposition, specially Congress, which is fighting the party directly in Telangana and suspects its motives. Congress bid to appear as favouring normal proceedings came a day after party MPs told the leadership at a meeting that they should participate in discussions since disruptions were robbing them of opportunities to raise people’s issues. Congress had only planned for a symbolic walkout for Tuesday. Gogoi tweeted: “Lok Sabha again adjourned because of TRS MPs. Meanwhile, Congress and other opposition parties want the important issues facing the country to be discussed inside Parliament. Raised the demand for discussion on MSP, inflation, Chinese aggression and Covid. Will BJP accept?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-smells-hidden-agenda-in-surprise-trs-aggression/articleshow/88017951.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard told a news briefing hours after the rampage at Oxford High School that investigators were at a loss to explain what might have precipitated "an unspeakable and unforgivable" act of violence. The suspect, disarmed and taken into custody by sheriff's deputies minutes after the shooting began, has declined to speak with investigators after his parents retained a lawyer and denied authorities permission to interview their son, Bouchard said. "The person who's got the most insight on motive is not talking," the sheriff told reporters. Bouchard said he was unaware of any previous run-ins with law enforcement by the suspect, a high school sophomore, adding there was "nothing to suggest that there had been disciplinary issues or problems with him at school." The bloodshed unfolded around midday in Oxford, Michigan, about 40 miles (65 km) north of Detroit, as terrified students and teachers taking cover inside the school flooded the county emergency dispatch center with more than 100 calls for assistance, authorities said. Bouchard credited swift action by his deputies, who he said arrived on the scene in minutes and moved straight toward the sound of gunshots, with preventing a much higher casualty toll. They confronted the young suspect advancing down a hallway toward them with a loaded weapon, when he put his hands over his head and surrendered, Bouchard said. The precise sequence of events during the violence remained unclear, but police believe the boy carried the weapon into the school in a backpack, the sheriff said. "The only information I have is that he came out of a bathroom with a weapon, and I don't know where he went first," Bouchard said. Placed in Juvenile detention Police will ultimately turn over the findings of their investigation to prosecutors, who would decide what charges to bring and whether the suspect would be charged as an adult or a juvenile, the sheriff said. For now, the 15-year-old suspect, whose name was withheld by authorities because he is a minor, was being detained in a special cell under suicide watch at a juvenile detention center, Oakland County Executive David Coulter said. Three students died in the shooting spree - a 16-year-old boy who succumbed to his wounds en route to a hospital in a patrol car, and two girls, aged 14 and 17, authorities said. Of the eight others struck by gunfire, seven were students, two of them hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the head. At least two girls, aged 14 and 17, were described by Bouchard as critically wounded with chest wounds, one of them placed on a ventilator. A teacher was also treated for a shoulder wound and later discharged. Undersheriff Michael McCabe said earlier that 15 to 20 rounds were fired during the rampage, which lasted no more than five minutes. Bouchard said the boy was armed with a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun his father had purchased on Nov. 26, along with three 15-round magazines. Seven live rounds remained in the gun when the youth was arrested, the sheriff said. The boy apparently "had been shooting" with the gun before Tuesday's attack and had posted pictures of the weapon and a target he was using, according to the sheriff. 'American problem' "My heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one," President Joe Biden told reporters while touring a Minnesota technical college. The latest in a long series of U.S. school shootings will likely fuel debates about gun control and mental health care, with many states allowing easy access to firearms while mental health disorders frequently go untreated. "This is a uniquely American problem that we need to address," said Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who rushed to the scene and appeared with McCabe before the media. Student Abbey Hodder told the Detroit Free Press she was in chemistry class when she heard the sound of glass breaking. "My teacher kind of ran out and was scrambling," Hodder, 15, told the newspaper. "The next thing I knew I saw he was pushing tables. It's part of school protocol to barricade, so we all knew, barricade, barricade down. And we all started pushing tables." Video posted on social media showed students huddled in a barricaded classroom while someone outside shouts through the door that it is safe to come out, identifying himself as being with the sheriff's office. But the teacher responds: "We're not taking that risk," and incredulous students who feared the shooter might have been trying to lure them into the hall escaped out a back window and were soon met by uniformed deputies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/three-students-killed-in-us-high-school-shooting-police/articleshow/88017967.cms||---

This is part of the action taken in response to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports. The report of the committee presented in Parliament on Tuesday deals with the action taken by the government on the recommendations, in its report on demands for grants 2021-22, of the WCD ministry, which was presented in the Parliament in March.  The committee had recommended that the ministry should chalk out a blueprint in coordination with the ministry of education to modernise anganwadis and strengthen them as early-childhood education institutions in line with the overarching goal of ensuring universal access to ECCE as envisaged in the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, latest by June 30 this year. The committee also recommended that suitable training to anganwadi workers/teachers for this increased responsibility needs to be imparted in a time-bound manner.  The WCD ministry, in its reply on Tuesday, said that they have developed year-wise activity books for the children of 3-6 years age group. Further, in convergence with the department of school education, the curriculum of children of the age group of 3-6 years will be finalised, and for this purpose NCERT will be in touch with the WCD ministry and NIPCCD.  “Anganwadi workers will be further trained for imparting quality education to the children of the age group of 3-6 years. Class 10-pass Anganwadi workers will be given one-year online training and 12-pass workers will be given six-month online training,” the ministry explained.  The WCD ministry said that it has been proposed to upgrade two lakh anganwadi centres to “Saksham Anganwadis” at the rate of 40,000 AWCs per annum, by adding more services with better infrastructure in health, nutrition and ECCE. To track the data on ECCE, templates would be integrated with Poshan Tracker so that data on a real-time basis is available to the district and state authorities, and remedial measures can be taken by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-proposes-roll-out-of-early-childhood-care-education-in-anganwadis-from-2021-22-itself/articleshow/88017904.cms||Ambika Pandit

The decision was taken at a review meeting here chaired by CM Pinarayi Vijayan.  An official release said the government would not pay for the treatment of those testing positive for Covid without receiving the vaccine. Those who could not get vaccinated due to health issues should produce a government doctor’s medical certificate to avail treatment, the release added. Teachers and staff of educational institutions who have not taken both the vaccine doses due to illness or allergies should also produce a government doctor’s certificate to join work. They will have to submit a negative RT-PCR certificate every week to attend institutions. The directives will also be applicable to government employees. The decisions came in the wake of reports that there are 5,000 teachers and non-teaching staff attending schools without taking the vaccine doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-free-covid-treatment-for-unvaccinated-kerala-cm-vijayan/articleshow/88018165.cms||---

State home minister Dilip Walse Patil had asked Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to conduct a probe into the closed-door meeting and accordingly, the entire escort team was summoned to Colaba police station. A three-member police team, led by a sub-inspector, had escorted Waze from Taloja central jail to the commission. A senior IPS officer said, prima facie, it appears that there was dereliction of duty, and a default report has been submitted to the Navi Mumbai police commissioner. The Navi Mumbai police have reportedly recorded their statements. It was found that the escort team did not warn Waze not to interact with Singh without permission of Justice Chandiwal or the court that had sent him to jail custody. Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino and Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe had taken objection over the meeting, while Walse Patil had said it was wrong on the part of both Singh and Waze to meet without permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/waze-param-bir-singh-meet-made-possible-by-escort-teams-laxity-police/articleshow/88018321.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

It was conveyed that this reprehensible incident had deeply hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community in India and worldwide, according to a statement issuedby the MEA. “Such continued incidents of desecration and disrespect of places of religious worship of the minority communities in Pakistan highlight the lack of respect for the faith of these communities,” said the ministry, while calling upon Pakistani authorities to sincerely investigate the matter and take action against those involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-summons-pak-official-over-kartarpur-model/articleshow/88018335.cms||---
---||India||Conversions not forced, Karnataka calls off survey||BENGALURU: Just a month after a Karnataka legislative committee ordered a survey of churches in Karnataka, which drew opposition from the Christian community, the tehsildar of a taluk in Chitradurga district conducted an inquiry into complaints of forced conversion of Hindus to Christianity in October. Sources said based on the complaints, the tehsildar of Hosadurga taluk ordered a survey in two villages — Devipura Bhovihatti and Marutinagar. However, the inquiry showed there was no substance in the allegations as the families confirmed they had converted to the new faith of their own volition. Tehsildar Thippeswamy told TOI that officials spoke to 12 families in Bhovihatti and 34 families in Marutinagar. “Since the families claimed they had wilfully converted to Christianity, we decided to call off our survey,” he said. He said Christian families claimed their conversion was on account of “a string of health issues and other constraints that drew them to Christianity”. “These families say they are in a much better place now and believe the new faith is the reason for their wellbeing,” he added. Hosadurga BJP MLA Goolihatti Shekar, who had raised the issue of forced religious conversions in the legislative assembly on September 21 and alleged that his 72-year-old mother had converted to Christianity, denied that any survey had been ordered. “There was no survey. Based on a complaint, there was an inquiry by the government,” he said. Expressing resentment against the church survey, Bangalore Archbishop Rev Peter Machado had written to CM Basavaraj Bommai thrice to abandon the idea and the move to bring in an anti-conversion law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/conversions-not-forced-karnataka-calls-off-survey/articleshow/88018339.cms||---
---||World||IIT-Bombay alumni in US celebrate Agrawal’s appointment as Twitter CEO||As Parag Agrawal, the new chief executive officer (CEO) of microblogging site Twitter, joins a growing number of Indian-American executives leading top American tech firms, no surprise he also checks the box of being an alumnus of the elite IIT Bombay.  Fellow alumni of IIT-B across America are celebrating the elevation of Agrawal, who studied in the tech college from 2001 to 2005, as Twitter CEO. “Things have changed since I was trying to break through. Brand IIT and Brand India are well established here. With Sunder Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet; Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft; Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe Systems; and Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM; as heads of top American tech companies, these appointments don’t make big news here in the Silicon Valley anymore,” distinguished IIT-B alumnus Kanwal Rekhi, who is considered to be the first Indian-American founder and CEO to take a venture-backed company, Excelan, public on the NASDAQ in 1982, told TIMESOFINDIA.com in an exclusive interview.  He said that several Indian Americans such as Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo; Vikram Pandit, former CEO of Citigroup; Rajiv L Gupta; former CEO of Rohm & Haas; and Ajay Banga, executive chairman of Mastercard, had made their mark in the US East Coast, too, as power CEOs, adding to the respect garnered by the community.  Even though Rekhi, who graduated from IIT-B way back in 1967, doesn’t personally know Agrawal, he feels that the Stanford University scholar must be “sharp as a nail”. “He has been at Twitter for a long time and was CTO. My sense is that he has been very influential and was responsible for shutting down (former) President Trump's account. I am sure he will be able to handle Twitter well, it is really a simple advertising-driven business,” Rekhi said.  Suresh P Sethi, professor and director of the Center for Intelligent Supply Networks at The University of Texas at Dallas and a distinguished IIT-B alumnus, is happy to see another IITian joining the long line of successful alumni from his alma mater, beginning with his batchmates Rajiv Gupta and Kanwal Rekhi in business and several top scholars in academia. “With excellent education from IIT-B and Stanford and a decade-long experience at Twitter, Agrawal should do well. Given that the world is taking note of what Twitter does and how influential the platform is, it needs a rational, thoughtful, and sensitive person at its helm and evidently, it found that in him.”  Several senior IITians in the US, who don’t know Agrawal personally because he’s their junior by many years, nevertheless share the excitement of the young Indian American being named the CEO of Twitter. “It is the entire ecosystem at IIT-B of a merit-based entrance examination, talented faculty, the residential system and an environment that promotes innovation, followed by an educational pathway to top American universities such as Stanford that is behind the success of tech leaders like Agrawal,” said Pratim Biswas, dean, engineering, University of Miami, and board member of the IITB Heritage Foundation.  He added that the strong alumni network of IIT-B, which was established in the early 90s in the San Francisco Bay Area, helps in connecting members across the US states and across generations. “It’s not just leadership roles in top corporates and cutting-edge start-ups; IIT-B alumni now form a strong academic network as well, with more than 250 in senior faculty positions across the US universities,” he said.  Sarita Adve, professor at the Siebel Center for Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, too, is proud that Agrawal is from IIT-B, her alma mater. “There are many aspects about his appointment as the CEO of Twitter that are heart warming to me. I am delighted to see that he has a PhD and started his career in research. The importance of the rigorous training provided by research has been the driver behind all the visible changes in technology,” she said.  She also highlighted the many ways, in which technology today is hurting society through inadvertent use of biased algorithms or malicious propagation of disinformation and invasion of privacy. “Social media companies have a particularly large role to play here. While I am thrilled to see first generation Indian Americans leading the tech sector, there is so much more to be done to ensure we have a plurality of viewpoints that represent all of society,” she said.  The current tech leadership, including Agrawal, she believes, has a huge responsibility in enabling change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/iit-bombay-alumni-in-us-celebrate-agrawals-appointment-as-twitter-ceo/articleshow/88018230.cms||Ishani Duttagupta
---||World||Biden sells infrastructure bill at Minnesota tech college||ROSEMOUNT: President Joe Biden used a visit to a Minnesota community college Tuesday to highlight how his $1-trillion infrastructure law will create jobs and help train workers, and to make the case for nearly $2-trillion more in spending.  Biden, who delivered remarks on Tuesday afternoon at Dakota County Technical College in Rosemount, Minnesota, first met with students in a garage space with a bulldozer, backhoe and cargo truck. The president stressed to the students the importance of education as part of the infrastructure package, even though the administration says the jobs being created won't require college degrees.  Biden's $1.75-trillion social and economic bill, which he is still trying to get through the Senate, includes $5 billion for community colleges to expand workforce training programs.  "Technology moves so rapidly," Biden told students. "You've got to get an education to make it work."  The trip occurs at a crucial pivot point for Biden who is facing the threat of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus and high levels of inflation as vital parts of his agenda are still awaiting congressional approval. Biden also needs to get Congress to move to temporarily fund the government and preserve its ability to borrow as the debt limit could be breached in December.  Biden holds out the infrastructure package, containing money for roads, bridges, broadband, water systems and a shift to electrical vehicles, as evidence that he can work across the political aisle. The measure passed with solid Republican support.  One key obstacle for the infrastructure package will be having enough skilled construction workers. Labor Department figures show that roughly 7.5 million people hold construction jobs, nearly as many as there were during the housing bubble about 15 years ago. Builders say it's been difficult for them to find workers and the spending on infrastructure could only increase demand further.  Biden won Minnesota in last year's presidential election with 52.6% of the vote. He's visiting the state's second congressional district, a potentially vulnerable seat in the midterms that narrowly went to Democratic Rep. Angie Craig in 2020.  The president has recently been in close contact with the heads of several major retailers, including Target, which is headquartered in the state, as he attempts to resolve supply chain challenges that have clogged ports and caused consumers to wait longer for electronics, furniture and other goods.  The supply chain challenges have contributed to prices in October rising 6.2% from 12 months ago, the highest pace in 31 years. The White House National Economic Council issued a report Monday suggesting that there has been progress on addressing the problems, with a decrease in long-dwelling containers waiting at ports and an increase in retail inventories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-sells-infrastructure-bill-at-minnesota-tech-college/articleshow/88018355.cms||---

When the House resumed after lunch in the afternoon, Goyal explained the suspension of the 12 members from the House on Monday, saying a resolution is passed for the purpose. He said the House is a continuous institution and it cannot be said that the matter of the last session is over with the end of it. He challenged opposition members who have alleged that the 12 MPs were suspended because the ruling party does not have the numbers in the Rajya Sabha. “They are welcome to discuss bills in the House and seek division. They will themselves come to know whether the government has the numbers in the House or not,” Goyal said. After Goyal’s statement, deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh also reiterated Chairman Venkaiah Naidu’s directions that there needs to be a discussion in the presence of the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House to find a solution. After the deputy chairman’s statement, parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi sought discussion on the Dam Safety Bill 2019 be deferred for a day as, he claimed, the government wanted bills to be debated and put through constructive criticism. He said that as far as he was aware, the opposition decided to boycott proceedings for a day. “If they are coming tomorrow we can take up this bill tomorrow. We want to run the House with opposition and discussion. Our party is the most democratic...,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/goyal-justifies-suspension-rajya-sabha-holds-back-bill-for-opposition/articleshow/88018381.cms||---

Those who test negative must remain in home quarantine for seven days; those who test positive will be immediately hospitalized and treated separately. The government will soon issue a notification on when the new travel guidelines come into force. After chairing a meeting of the Covid Technical Advisory Committee, state health minister K Sudhakar told reporters: "Currently, the RT-PCR test on arrival is conducted only on passengers coming from ‘at-risk' countries notified by the Centre. Going forward, we have been instructed by the chief minister to test travellers from all countries." The state will write to the Centre seeking ban on travellers from the countries where Omicron variant has been detected. The state witnesses around 2,500 international arrivals per day, with a majority of them landing at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru and the Mangaluru international airport. "Those who are symptomatic and negative will have to undergo testing at home on the fifth day of their arrival. Asymptomatic passengers will be tested on the seventh day," the minister said. While the incoming passengers have to pay for the test (Rs 3,000 for the quick test), the government will deploy tech tools such as the Quarantine App and Tele Medicine to track and treat them.The government's travel restrictions, which come ahead of Christmas-New Year season, has disrupted travel plans of thousands of Bengalureans, especially technology professionals working in the US and European countries and locals planning to fly abroad for vacation. Many would be forced to cancel or alter their travel plans fearing more restrictions in the coming weeks, thereby sending the travel and hospitality sector into a tizzy. Sudhakar justified the restrictions, stating: "We cannot take chances. Unlike other countries which are banning foreign travelers following the fear of Omicron, we have been considerate and telling people to undergo quarantine for a week at home. We have initiated this because the new strain seems to be contagious. We need to take preventive action now so that we do not regret later."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-test-all-intl-flyers-7-day-home-quarantine-if-ve/articleshow/88018384.cms||---

Its software identifies processes in a company and helps understand how those can be made more efficient. GE Healthcare, for instance, is said to have achieved a cash flow improvement of over $1 billion by improving efficiencies using Celonis's tech. Deutsche Bank has optimised its processes to achieve over $60 million in savings. Celonis raised $1 billion in June at a valuation of $11 billion, four times its $2.5 billion valuation in 2019.Malhar Kamdar, who is also chief customer officer for Celonis, said, “We can work with any industry, any process and we can provide digital insights instantly and in real-time. Think of us as providing x-rays of the company’s business, process, and operations regardless of what is the underlying complexity of IT. The X-ray provides you an incredible ability to identify areas of inefficiency and optimisation to reduce costs. The software even applies intelligence to fix those problems.”Kamdar said India is the epicentre of process execution. “Half of the world’s GCCs (global capability centres) run in India and these centres are full of processes. Many BPO firms are here where we can drive efficiency and reduce costs. India is an accelerating factory for us,” he said. Among Celonis's customers are Accenture, Cognizant, Deloitte, Tech Mahindra and EY. “Every significant process innovation wave, from client-server, to the internet, to the cloud has gone through the heart of the India business process industry,” said Bastian Nominacher, co-CEO and co-founder of Celonis. Celonis, he said, would help drive the next generational shift in process modernisation in India by embedding its state-of-the-art process mining and execution management technologies into the world’s leading BPO, GCC, system integrator and consulting firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/german-tech-co-celonis-to-invest-100mn-in-india/articleshow/88018390.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||Bengaluru||Only 1 in 4 women in Karnataka has knowledge of HIV/AIDS||BENGALURU: Only 25% women in Karnataka possess comprehensive knowledge of HIV/AIDS, according to National Family Health Survey report of 2019-20. This, however, is way better than what was recorded in NFHS 2015-16, according to which just one in 10 women knew about it. The improvement is in stark contrast to the data pertaining to men: 27% were found to have comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS in both surveys. Nationally, 21.6% women and 30.7% men have the knowledge, up from 20.9% and 32.5%, respectively, in NFHS 2015-16. Going by the NFHS-5 report, Mizoram boasts of the highest figures — 64% women and 65.6% men have comprehensive knowledge about HIV/AIDS. The numbers for Manipur are 50.6% and nearly 60%, respectively. Stigma associated with itSenior officers in Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS) say there is so much stigma attached to HIV/AIDS that women would not want to talk about it even if they are aware. “The NHFS data needs to be seen from the context of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. We don’t agree with the data. Every pregnant woman in Karnataka is tested for HIV and is counselled about the same prior to testing. In 2019-20, 14.4 lakh pregnant women (104%) were tested for HIV, exceeding the target. A total of 623 were found positive,” said KSAPS officials. As per the KSAPS data, the number of pregnant women testing positive for HIV has gradually reduced. “In 2013-14, 1,445 women were found positive during antenatal scanning. In 2018-19, the figure reduced to 786 and dipped further to 723 in 2019-20. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2019, the prevalence of HIV in Karnataka is 0.22%, slightly lower than than the country average of 0.24%,” KSAPS authorities said. According to Dr Glory Alexander, director, ASHA foundation and HIV/AIDS specialist, who has been working with marginalised groups, there is a possibility of lack of comprehensive knowledge about HIV, but everyone is aware of it. She said there are awareness campaigns to reach out to working women and homemakers. ‘New infections, deaths dip’“Everyone knows about the infection and how it spreads. New infections have come down. With novel drugs and antiretroviral therapy (ART) made available to all patients, the number of deaths has reduced and the quality of life has improved. We counsel the affected persons that HIV/AIDS is a chronic but manageable illness, unlike the fatal disease it was earlier perceived to be,” said Dr Alexander. However, she added that awareness campaigns have taken a beating for nearly two years due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-1-in-4-women-in-ktakahas-knowledge-of-hiv/aids/articleshow/88018392.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The project has been taken up by the centre for smart governance (CSG), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Karnataka government. The intent of the project — named Kaveri blockchain — is to digitise and authenticate all land records in the state. From government-owned properties to agricultural land and commercial and residential properties, every property owner will soon be handed a smartcard which will store the land records in his/her name. As many as 67 types of land transactions, including sale, purchase, lease, mortgage, gift deeds etc,. will be recorded and can be verified using the smartcard. CSG has already undertaken a pilot in Tumakuru district, with farmers and property owners registering their property records and carrying out transactions using only the smartcard. How the system worksThe government will issue a smartcard with a chip in it to property owners whose names have been registered by the revenue department against the land/properties they own. It is issued to any person who intends to register a property or already owns one. The card is then authenticated at the local sub-registrar office with an e-KYC process, wherein the person’s Aadhaar number is verified and biometrics are recorded. “Once the Aadhaar number is verified with the records preserved in the Kaveri portal, the same will be locked into a blockchain and can be accessed at any time by the owner using a four-digit password,” said a CSG official. However, when it comes to the smartcard and key, the owner will have to access them through a kiosk installed at the sub-registrar office. In case of a sale, the buyer will also be issued a smartcard. “Once the purchaser and the seller arrive at the kiosk, they can use the card and access the records to verify that there is no encumbrance on the property which is being purchased. The sub-registrar, who will have access to the property document through his master key, can register the sale after cross-checking the details,” said the official. Once the sale is completed, land records will be almost immediately transferred into the name of the buyer, which can be confirmed through his own smartcard and key. In its testing phase, over the past one month, centre for smart governance has issued 781 smartcards and conducted 310 transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-launch-digital-wallet-to-store-property-records/articleshow/88018393.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

On August 26, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) issued a notification on BH series, which came into effect on September 15. However, the transport department delayed its implementation. In Tuesday’s notification, the department said: “MORTH has issued a notification to further amend the Central Motor Vehicle Rules for registration of non-transportation vehicles under BH series. Accordingly, permission is accorded [to do so] ...” Rajender Kumar Kataria, principal secretary, transport department, told TOI, “The transport commissioner is expected to issue guidelines in a few days. Once it is done, those eligible can register their vehicles under BH series. There will be some revenue loss for the state because we are now collecting lifetime tax. Under BH series, we will be able to collect MV tax for only two years. But this scheme mainly helps those who have transferable jobs in multiple states.” Many vehicle users in the state had launched a campaign — #ImplementBHregistrationinKA — on Twitter. BH series is mainly to facilitate seamless transfer of vehicles from one state to another. It is also considered the preliminary step towards the Centre’s ‘one nation, one motor vehicle tax’ plan. According to the Motor Vehicle Rules, a vehicle is not permitted to ply with another state registration number beyond 11 months from the date of migration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-to-roll-out-bh-series-registration/articleshow/88018394.cms||---

When his family decided to take him to doctors at Manipal Hospitals on Millers Road, six people had to carry him in a blanket as no stretcher could bear his weight. The team of doctors could not perform MRI on Singh as he would not fit into the machine. That is when they decided only weight loss could heal his condition. G Moinoddin, consultant bariatric and advanced laparoscopic surgeon at the hospital, took over the case and decided that bariatric and metabolic surgery was the best bet. Singh underwent the surgery after spending 10 days undergoing optimisation with the help of a team of pulmonologists, anaesthetist and orthopaedics. “Singh was discharged three days after surgery and he had lost 34kg by then. He was able to walk on the evening of the surgery. Singh is a super-obese patient and suffered from severe obstructive sleep apnea. He required a BIPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machine to sleep and faced breathing difficulty...,” Dr Moinoddin said. BIPAP machines help patients breathe more easily, either while sleeping or when experiencing a flare-up of symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-weighing-235kg-sheds-34kg-in-3-days-after-surgery/articleshow/88018396.cms||---

Two priests, in the presence of about 25 people, performed the puja in the middle of the road. A special homa was conducted. “We decorated the potholes with garlands, lit incense sticks and did aarti using camphor,” said NS Ravi, president of the RWA. “There are more than 100 potholes on the stretch and people can barely commute on it,” he said. Residents said they hope their puja will draw the BBMP’s attention to their plight and it will fix the problem. Vijay Singh, who’s been staying in the area for over 40 years, said over the past few years the stretch has been damaged extensively and the Palike has failed to fix it. “During monsoon, the road is reduced to a pathetic state. Motorists try to ride on little patches of the road only to end up falling into the potholes,” Singh said. He recalled five years ago the road had only one pothole and BBMP officials fixed it and retarred the stretch. But that is when the problem began. “Poor asphalting of the road is why potholes started popping up,” he added. “The potholes are being filled and we are working very hard to ensure there are none,” said BS Prahallad, chief engineer, road and infrastructure. “If not for rain, most of the roads would have been neatly asphalted with no potholes,” he added. By the beginning of the New Year, BBMP will ensure the city is pothole-free, Prahallad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rwa-performs-pothole-puja-to-draw-bbmp-attention/articleshow/88018403.cms||Nithya Mandyam

According to him, the menace of online gaming activities is much worse than liquor, the prohibition of which has been upheld by the apex court.Citing the example of horse-racing, which takes place for a limited number of days in a year, Navadgi pointed out that unlike physical gambling, online gaming allowing betting is a through-the-year activity where any person, irrespective of age, can participate if he or she possesses a hand-held device ( mobile phone) and gamble. “In physical gambling, the stakes are limited. Here, everything is online and can be operated from anywhere. I am told that it is difficult to detect the servers as well. The payment is through online banking and there are instances wherein entire bank accounts have been wiped out,” he added.Since the arguments remained inconclusive, the hearing was adjourned to Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/regulating-online-betting-a-gigantic-challenge-ag/articleshow/88018404.cms||---

Their office at MEI Layout, Bagalagunte is locked since the second week of November and their mobile phones are off. The first complaint was registered on November 16. “I had attached my cab with RS Tours and Travels in March this year. Shivakumar would pay me Rs 15,000 every month for attaching my car. Like me, there were hundreds of cab owners, who had attached their four-wheelers with Shivakumar for a monthly income of Rs 15,000,” cabbie Yashas HG of Laggere stated in his complaint. Thereafter, more complaints started pouring in, said police.Preliminary investigation revealed that the accused would get cabs attached to their agency and pay their owners Rs 15,000 per month.

Not only has the road been relaid after several years, but it has also been cleaned of all the debris dotting its sides.Thousands of students using the road were in for a pleasant surprise on Tuesday, as the new blacktopped surface was among the smoothest they had seen anywhere in the city.BBMP officials confirmed that the road was relaid in view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bengaluru on December 6, when he will inaugurate Dr BR Ambedkar School of Economics building on Jnanabharathi campus of Bangalore University. PM Modi will be taking the road to reach the venue.“If not for the PM’s visit, I don’t think that officials would have asphalted this road. I myself have fallen on this road many times during rain when potholes get filled with water and it is impossible to know how deep they are,” said Ravi N, a resident of Nagarbhavi.“I have done my graduation and post-graduation from Bangalore University and am currently pursuing PhD here.

Chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said that the structural reforms initiated by the government during the last few months will not just help ensure a growth of around 7% over the next few years but also keep a check on inflation as supply side issues have been tackled. “India is likely to have double-digit growth this year. The overall growth for the first half has been 13.7%, so even a little more than 6% growth in the subsequent quarters should be able to deliver double-digit growth for this year,” he told reporters. The economist, who has decided to head back to academics after a three-year stint in North Block, also said the Modi government’s decision to reverse the amendments to three farm laws will not be a major setback to the overall process. “In a democracy like ours, political economy matters a lot and I think it is a fact that the way agriculture generates emotion other sectors do not… Therefore, extrapolating anything that you are seeing in agriculture, be it reforms or otherwise, onto other sectors...I would not recommend, because the dynamics are quite different,” he said.  Although Subramanian said it was too early to comment on the possible impact of the new coronavirus variant, he expects the earlier experience in dealing with the deadly virus to come handy“Given that we are still amidst pandemic and the Omicron variant seems to have actually created some concern, we are all waiting for evidence to come on how infectious it would be, and how debilitating it would be as well compared to the Delta variant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/economy-to-grow-at-double-digit-rate-in-current-fiscal-finance-ministry/articleshow/88018426.cms||---

Agrawal’s annual salary will be $1 million, apart from which he will also receive restricted stock units valued at $12.5 million that will be vested in 16 equal quarterly increments, starting February 2022. Interestingly, Jack Dorsey — a co-founder of Twitter who also holds a 2.3% stake in the company — had been taking home an annual salary of a mere $1.4 since 2018, justifying the uncanny compensation to his “belief in Twitter’s long-term value creation potential”. Agrawal’s elevation not only catapulted him to worldwide limelight almost instantly, considering he is succeeding one of the tech world’s top tech titans Dorsey, but also ensured a hefty compensation package that comes along with the responsibility of leading the world’s most alive and biggest micro-blogging platform. Agrawal, a passout of IIT Bombay and a PhD in computer science from Stanford University, was the chief technology officer of Twitter since October 2017 after having joined the company in 2011 as a software engineer. While working on his unique strategy for the tech giant at a time when governments and regulators across the world are wary about social-media companies and their hold on public sentiments, he also has a lot of catching up to do when one compares the compensation of other India-born CEOs. For example, 49-year-old Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google’s parent Alphabet, received $281 million in total compensation in 2019, becoming one of the biggest salary-drawers in the world. Compatriot Satya Nadella (54 years), the chairman & CEO of Microsoft, took home $43 million in the same year, while Shantanu Narayen (58 years) got $39.2 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/agrawal-to-draw-1-million-annual-salary-get-restricted-stock-worth-12-5-million/articleshow/88018512.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||Business||Never dilute standards for recognition at workplace||At Diwali, we all received numerous messages. Many were the usual forwarded types, some were mass messages on e-groups, some clear visual re-pastes, and still fewer were typed or customised for you, mentioning your name. How did your response vary? Did some mean more to you than the others. To me it did. Not that getting a cut-paste greeting had an indifferent intent, but it just did not connect. Worse, we were both recipients and transmitters, and responders. And we did also respond differently. At least I did. This is exactly the issue with much of the recognition efforts in organisations. They either become de rigueur, a ritual that just stayed a checkbox. The Diwali moments got me to cull some learnings from experience for most firms and their leaders… * Clarity over intent: Corporations often get their intent muddled. What do you want to recognise? Outcome? Behaviour? Then, who do you want to recognise? Individuals or cross-functional teams? When do you want to recognise? Now or later? Who should recognise? Someone really big or someone closer to the awardee? The simple answer would be a medley. But think well on these questions. All of these will make or break your recognition culture. It is too important to be left to intent and serendipity.  * Think of effect, not ease: Very often, firms adopt cookie-cutter thinking while designing their recognition programmes. What is easy to do? What can be scaled up? What can get system-generated? And they kill the spirit of recognition. If you do recognise, do it well — very much like gifting. How will this be experienced by the recipient? What will touch the recipient? Work backwards from there. * Harmonise but differentiate: Recognition is a fundamental psychological need. Much of recognition can be a timely thank you, but an authentic one. Different levels of impact or behaviour must be expected across the hierarchy. Don’t dilute your recognition standards. Differentiate. You may have a broad framework that enables recognition at various levels of business. This helps interconnect but always differentiate, otherwise it will become another misplaced example of tokenism. * Heart over mind: While one makes a thoughtful judgment on what to recognise, the recognition philosophy is essentially a heart exercise. It must make the person feel appreciated, recognised and wanted. It must trigger a sense of pride and inspiration, after seeing the recognition to that person. It must make lunch table conversations positive, not toxic. So, think well about your recognition — beyond classical left-brained logic. Don’t distribute recognition like alms. You thought you bought peace? You just trivialised your recognition. * Recognition does not breed complacency. Period: I have had this conversation with many client CEOs in my career. Many are hesitant in appreciating, as they believe recipients will become lazy. And those upset will drag their feet. To me, both are untenable arguments. As I told one CEO once, “If you are waiting for them to reach Mount Everest before you appreciate, they won’t go beyond the first base camp.” Every recognition does not have to be an Oscar. But every positive word allows you to raise the bar. It builds a cache of good will. It inspires others too to get better. It builds a culture of positivism. Let our recognition practices be critiqued and polished. Make the recognition count with those who get them. Don’t ever trivialise it. The recognition is not about a check box, it is actually about eliminating them. Make them authentic and vibrant, not sterile. Your recognition philosophy and practice can then enable your strategy to move from just intent to impact.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujaratis take political guard in US||AHMEDABAD: In early November, Samip ‘Sam’ Joshi, 32, created history of sorts when he was elected as mayor of Edison in New Jersey – the first Indian-American in the town of one lakh population with 44% Asians. Joshi, who is a second-generation Gujarati settled in the US, traces his roots to central Gujarat. His term as mayor begins from January 2022. Interestingly, one of the other candidates in fray against Joshi was Mahesh Bhagia, another second generation Gujarati in Uncle Sam's land. “Indian-Americans are the fastest growing minority in New Jersey and constitute a sizable share of the population. Year 2021 saw the highest number of candidates from the Indian American community in political fray across the US,” Joshi told TOI. “We have already seen several legislators and senators, but now the community participation has widened in the past few years.” Joshi's major poll promises during his campaign included a new township master plan and municipal broadband for faster, reliable internet. Apart from Joshi, eight-odd persons with Gujarati roots have either been elected or appointed to various public positions in the past few years, says Ankur Vaidya, president of Federation of Indian Associations (FIA). Gujaratis constitute a big chunk of diaspora in the US and many have earlier got appointed to top offices including Natwar ‘Nat’ Gandhi who was chief finance officer for Washington DC from 2007-13 and Rajiv ‘Raj’ Shah who was appointed administrator of USAID from 2015-18. However, the entry of Gujaratis into active life is a rather recent phenomenon driven by second and third generation Gujaratis. Currently Ami Bera is a US senator elected from California while Niraj Antani and Amish Shah are members of state-level house of representatives from Ohio and Arizona respectively. “Indian Americans form a sizable share of the population and are keen to participate in the electoral process of the country. Majority of those politically active are second or third-generation Indian-Americans and Gujaratis who feel a much closer connection with the US than India,” said Vaidya. “We however have only a few names to quote when it comes to successful candidates such as Sam Joshi of Edison.” Kenny Desai, owner of a New Jersey-based engineering firm and a prominent member of the Gujarati diaspora who had accompanied Bill Clinton during his India visit in 2000, says earlier Gujaratis would remain ambivalent and were loath to take political sides, a trend which is fast changing. “We built businesses, brought families and settled here but remained active only as campaigners and fundraisers. It’s the new generation that is taking keen interest in electoral politics. The US currently has about 30-40 lakh Indian population with a sizable number of Gujaratis. The new generation is born and brought up here and is not inhibited,” said Desai. “I surely foresee a rise in their representation in time to come.” Ram Gadhvi, founder of Gujarati Literary Academy of North America, said that politics is all about representation, and Gujaratis are now getting active with fielding candidates at all levels. “We may however have to wait for a few years to see how the trend continues. We have already seen a large number of Indian Americans at prominent positions in state and centre,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-generation-of-gujaratis-take-political-guard-on-american-pitch/articleshow/88016835.cms||Parth Shastri

From the United Kingdom to Dubai, the organic tea from this small village is now selling everywhere. It all started in 2011 when Vinod Karki, a progressive farmer, started planting tea saplings on his barren land. Now, over 30 farmers have joined the programme, with over 600 nalis (12 hectares) of land in the area under tea cultivation. Besides, eighteen workers, including eight women, work in these tea gardens. “I had 400 nalis (8 ha) of land lying unused. In 2010, I entered into an agreement with the Uttarakhand Tea Board, which said that it will be developed into a tea garden and tea leaves will be cultivated here over the next seven years,” said Karki. In 2018, after the completion of seven years, the board returned the tea garden to him. “In 2018, we approached the Tea Board of India at their Kolkata office. With their help, farmers of the area constituted the Parvatiya Chai Utpadan Swayatt Sahakarita Samiti and the board gave us a license for tea processing. Subsequently, we started a tea manufacturing cooperative unit,” said Karki. This year, the cooperative produced 8,000 kg of tea. The tea produced in the region is organic and has a special flavour and aroma. It is available in three categories -- black orthodox, green orthodox, and little leaves, as per Karki. The tea manufacturing unit is also helping people who had migrated from the area return to their roots. Rajan Ram, who came back to the village from Delhi during the Covid-induced lockdown and decided to stay on after he got employed in the tea manufacturing unit, said, “It‘s good that we now don’t need to go to Delhi or any other big metro city to earn a living since there is plenty of work in our village itself.” Watch Uttarakhand: This Pithoragarh village grows organic tea with unique flavour||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/remote-village-in-ukhand-turns-barren-land-into-tea-gardens/articleshow/88015657.cms||Prem Punetha

So we believe by December 10, the schools should start functioning,” collector Suraj Mandhare said. The government guidelines call for various facts, including ensuring that there was no covid active case for the past 20 days, vaccination of the teaching and non-teaching staff, getting the RTPCR test conducted 48 hours before the beginning of the school, consent of the parents for the starting of physical schools, starting of health clinic in every school, etc. “Today, we have asked the education officers to conduct a meeting with the school authorities and seek the reports from them as per the government orders. After having verified that the measures are in place and that the parents are ready to give their consent, the respective schools can start. It will, however, take some time,” he added. Primary education officer Rajeev Mhaskar said that chief executive officer Leena Bansod has directed the education authorities to furnish the detailed information about the schools as per the directives of the collectorate at the earliest. He also pointed out that the schools have been informed to carry out all the measures of sanitisation, which also includes the santisation of the classes after the school. Schools have also been told to identify children who are unwell and to consider students sitting on three rows on all four sides of a confirmed patient to be at “high risk” of catching the infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/after-city-nashik-rural-schools-also-to-stay-shut/articleshow/88014904.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Aurangabad||HC: Issue show cause notice to college||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has directed the state director of technical education (DTE) to issue a notice to city-based Bhagwan College of Pharmacy showing cause as to why the state should not take over the management of the college in view of continuing deficiencies and mismanagement. “We direct the respondent No. 3 (DTE) to proceed as per the provisions under section 3 of the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (management) Act of 1976 and issue show cause notice expeditiously and preferably within a period of one month from today,” the HC bench of Justice S V Gangapurwala and Justice R N Laddha said on November 26. The bench added: “The respondent Nos. 5 and 6 (i.e. Bhagwan Shikshan Prasarak Mandal and its pharmacy college) shall be entitled to file a reply along with all the attending documents. The respondent No3, naturally would be required to consider the reply filed along with documents, if any, and after considering the reply to the show cause notice, form an opinion for himself to take over the management in so far as its activity relating to imparting the education or otherwise.” The college and its management has been involved in a tussle with regulators — All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the Pharmacy Council of India — since 2018 after the latter put the college under the No Admission Category based on an expert committee’s report that cited several deficiencies and shortcomings at the institution. In 2018, the HC had passed a ruling in favour of some teachers from the college, who had filed a petition in 2013, seeking implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission salaries for the teaching staff. However, despite the HC order, the college management did not implement the pay scale and went on to hand out relieving letters to 10 teachers, who later moved the HC citing all deficiencies. Also, there were complaints about the college not paying salaries to the teaching staff. In its November 26 order, the HC took a strong exception to the fact that the DTE did little in terms of proceeding under Section 3 of the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (management) Act despite having strong reasons to proceed. Lawyer Pushkar Shendurnikar, who represented the petitioners, brought to the HC’s notice that the college management did not make any effort whatsoever to address the deficiencies pointed out by the expert visiting committee in its report dated April 16, 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-issue-show-cause-notice-to-college/articleshow/88014844.cms||Mohammed Akhef

He also said being the elected representative from the area in Lakhisarai district, he was aware that work on a sluice gate meant to drain out floodwaters has not been completed in the last four years. Earlier, in reply to the call attention information of BJP member Arun Kumar Sinha related to the farmers, WRD minister Sanjay Jha informed the House that the large ‘taal’ area comprises 1.06 lakh hectares of land. Apart from the floodwaters, waterlogging was also caused by the backwater effect from the Ganga. Earlier, a few projects worth Rs185.50 crore had been taken up to drain out water from the ‘taal’ area, but it proved to be inadequate, he said. Following a review of the situation done by CM Nitish Kumar, projects worth Rs1,178.50 crore have been taken up. Of the six major projects to drain out water, tendering process had been completed with regard to five of them and the work order has also been issued. The tendering process with regard to the sixth project has also been started. The new projects envisage construction of barrage, embankment, check-dams, weirs, culverts and clearing of the ‘paeens’ which store water. The work would be completed in the next around two years. Paddy procurement: Food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh informed the House that it was not mandatory for the sharecroppers to identify the details (‘khata’ and ‘khesra’) of the plots of land on which they had done the paddy cultivation. She said the farmers (ryots and sharecroppers) had to make online registration on the website concerned, and the paddy procurement is to be done from these registered farmers only. She said 1.16 lakh metric tonne of paddy had been purchased from the farmers through PACS and vyapar mandals till Monday. She also said the state government had no intention to restore the marketing board that had been abolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/house-panel-to-review-progress-of-wrd-works-in-taal-areas/articleshow/88015625.cms||Abhay Singh

ECR GM Anupam Sharma is personally supervising the execution of the winter safety measures. The drive will continue till January 2022 or may be extended till February 2022, depending on the weather condition. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has started counselling session with loco pilots and guards to ensure strict implementation of the winter safety guidelines. The key men and track patrolling members have been given GPS trackers to get position of the fog affected signals. The alert safety staff will thus put on alert loco pilots of trains on ‘walkie-talkie’ about foggy weather condition during night, he said. In addition, safety officials have been assigned job to monitor safety drive from 8pm to 8am every day and carry out ‘foot-plating’ on the locomotives with loco pilots of the trains during night to check alertness of cabin man and gateman deployed at different places, he said. To meet emergency needs , railways has requisitioned detonators (fog signals) in good numbers to use as fog signals at vulnerable places during foggy weather condition. November, December and January are the most crucial period for railways to run long-distance passenger trains with full precaution, the CPRO said. Railways has set up a separate control room at the ECR headquarters in Hajipur to keep a close watch on the movement of passenger trains under the ECR jurisdiction. About 40% stations on the mainline route of Danapur division are fog-affected. Railways has also installed flasher lights and retroreflective posts at each vulnerable place to avert any mishap on tracks. The visibility test objects (VTOs) and track falling lines have been painted in fog-prone areas. Railways is extra alert this year following an increase in the speed limit of passenger trains from 110km per hour to 130km/hour on the Jhajha-Patna –Buxar- Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction route, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/winter-safety-measures-in-5-ecr-divisions-launched/articleshow/88015555.cms||Kumod Verma

Amid the usual hectic activity around it, the monument was ignored by those at the helm of the city's affairs. Nyay Mandir was inaugurated on November 30, 1896, by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III. Designed by Robert Chisholm, the building was supposed to be a vegetable market, but eventually used as the judiciary of erstwhile Baroda state. Named after Sayajirao’s wife Maharani Chimnabhai, a marble statue of the queen prominently placed inside the building is a reminder of its royal past. The building was a hub of activity till 2018 when the courts shifted to a new building in Diwalipura. While plans to set up a city museum and other facilities were doing the rounds since 2014, but little has transpired regarding the historical building, so far. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) that is supposed to develop the facilities is yet to get possession of the building. The VMC was reminded about the date by architect Sanjeev Joshi, convenor of the Vadodara chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). Joshi had written to VMC last week about the 125th anniversary and how the opportunity could be used to set out an agenda for the building in the coming days, but in vain. “It was a missed opportunity for us to express our intent regarding the building. The silence regarding it is really worrisome,” he said. There were, however, some developments on the day that might hint at better days for the structure in the offing. Vadodara mayor Keyur Rokadiya who was in Gandhinagar on Tuesday said that he had discussed the issue with revenue minister Rajendra Trivedi and in-charge minister for Vadodara Pradip Parmar. “I have asked them to expedite the process of handing over Nyay Mandir to the VMC so that we can begin work on it,” Rokadiya said, but didn’t clarify on what the building will be used for. “We can plan anything only when we have its possession,” Rokadiya added. Sources said that there has been a delay in the handing over of the building to the VMC due to change in those at the helm of VMC and even the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nyay-mandir-ignored-on-its-125th-inauguration-day/articleshow/88015788.cms||Sachin Sharma

It comes under the Vaigai’s cascading system and fills up whenever there is copious flow in the river. However, encroachments of the supply channels and lack of maintenance resulted in the tank remaining dry for more than 40 years. The last time it filled up is stated to be in 1980.Since time immemorial the tank has been protected and preserved by the traditional families that operated the sluices of the tank, which is usually at the bottom of a well in the tank bed. The madayar dive into the depth of the well, when the tank fills up and operates the sluices.There is a stone inscription on one side of the tank, which states that the tank was dug up under the rule of a chieftain named Veeranarayanan in 1475 CE, and that he appointed the madayar to operate the sluices, says P Sivakumar, a resident of this village.When the tank fills up, the local people come together to celebrate it. They place a pole painted in red and white, decorated with mango leaves and flowers, on the middle of the tank bed. “The ritual is called ‘Muhurthakaal naduthal’,” said Selvam, a villager.The villagers, including their leaders N Muthukumar and M M Karuppu offered prayers at the Ayyanar temple on the banks of the tank and the members from the madayar family took the Muhurthakaal and tied it on the water level indicator. They reached it by carrying the pole in a coracal and swam back after performing the ritual.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ritual-performed-as-madakulam-tank-brims-after-40-years/articleshow/88017241.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Due to this, the garbage was piling up and spilling onto the road, emanating a foul smell and making it difficult for passersby to use the stretch,” said Manav Parikh, the citizen reporter who highlighted the matter. Published on November 17, the grievance was noticed by SCB authorities who swung into action and got the garbage cleared. “Soon after the problem was aired on the TOI app, the garbage collection van started coming every day,” said Parikh. Irregularity in collection of garbage vans is being reported in many other neighbouring areas. “At some spots, there are boards being set up that this area is under CCTV surveillance. Despite this, people end up throwing garbage at those spots, which remain uncleared for many days,” said P Manjulatha, a resident of Rasoolpura. Officials from SCB said that they are acting upon the complaints and have a separate vehicle for Balamrai area. “The collection van is now visiting the Balamrai area thrice every day.

The board of management members includes DV Ravi, MD, Shriram Capital, R Duruvasan, whole-time director, Shriram Capital, Umesh Revankar, VC & MD, Shriram Transport Fin Co and Jasmit Singh Gujral, executive VC for Shriram General Insurance Co. “The four members of the board have all been in the group for more than 20 years each and the belief is that no single person has the capability to be CEO and hence will need assistance from everyone from the key management team.” The Trust was formed a few years ago.Ravi will hold the position of managing trustee, among the other three trustees. The group’s founder R Thyagarajan, who will not run the day-to-day operations but will be available for consultations, and mentor the board of management. As per the succession plan, the promoters stake in the Shriram Group, will be owned by its current and future leaders. The Shriram Ownership Trust, a private discretionary body was set up in 2006 to provide opportunity for the current and future leadership of the group to be beneficiaries of the Trust. On the role of the board of management, he said they will be responsible for defining the long-term strategy of the individual entities and the group and overseeing its execution.

---||Business||RCap, IL&FS resolutions have parallels||Mumbai: Reliance Capital’s insolvency will not be a group resolution but will be restricted to the parent company. However, the process could get shades of a group resolution if the sale of the subsidiaries to resolve the parent’s debt is challenged. RCap’s position is similar to the IL&FS resolution, to the extent that most of the value lies in the subsidiary companies which are going concerns. According to bankers, if the sale of RCap’s stake in its subsidiaries does not face any impediment, the resolution process would be restricted to that of the holding company. The RBI-appointed administrator is likely to be appointed as the resolution professional once the central bank’s application to initiate insolvency proceedings at the National Company Law Tribunal is admitted. The resolution professional will take over the role of the chief executive and the committee of creditors (largely debenture holders) will play the role of the board of directors of RCap and wield power over the subsidiaries. Even before the RBI superseded the board of RCap, there were ongoing efforts by debenture trustees to recover money due to debenture holders by selling a stake in group companies including life and non-life insurance, Reliance Commercial and Reliance Housing Finance, among others. The sale of the non-life company was stymied by litigation. In 2019, RCap said that its stake in Reliance General Insurance was transferred to IDBI Trustee Services upon invocation of pledge by the trustee company. Meanwhile, the RBI on Tuesday appointed a three-member advisory committee to support the administrator in the running of the company. This panel consists of Sanjeev Nautiyal, ex-DMD of SBI, Srinivasan Varadarajan, ex-DMD of Axis Bank, and Praveen P Kadle, ex-MD & CEO of Tata Capital. The RBI said that the three would assist Nageswara Rao Y, former executive director of Bank of Maharashtra, who has been appointed as the administrator for RCap. The central bank also said that it will apply to the National Company Law Tribunal to appoint Rao as the resolution professional. According to bankers, selling the subsidiary companies would be a complex process as all of the firms are regulated financial sector entities. For instance, bulk of the value is in the two insurance companies Reliance General Insurance and Reliance Nippon Life Insurance, which is a joint venture. While some private equity firms have shown interest in buying the entire group by acquiring RCap. The committee of creditors will have to ensure that while selling a stake in the insurance arms, the foreign shareholding norms are not breached. Also, the insurance regulator needs to ensure that the buyers of the insurance companies are fit and proper. The committee of creditors will have to decide on whether to continue with the asset sale process initiated by debenture Vistra ITL on behalf of debenture holders. The debenture trustee had invited bids for group companies was in the process of finalising the sale of lending arms. Speaking at the RCap annual general meet in September, chairman Anil Ambani said that lenders have selected Authum Investment and Infrastructure as the successful bidder to acquire Reliance Commercial Finance and Reliance Home Finance. Bankers said that if the committee of creditors is similar to those who were handling the asset sale, the process is likely to continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rcap-ilfs-resolutions-have-parallels/articleshow/88017370.cms||---

In the last four days, the domestic currency has lost 77 paise. The foreign exchange markets have turned volatile in tandem with equity markets, which have seen a sharp fall after reports that a new strain of the coronavirus has emerged in Africa. Markets have turned jittery over concerns that fresh restrictions would halt an ongoing recovery. On Tuesday, the rupee opened at 74.91 and firmed up to 74.86 in line with the recovery in the stock market, but soon fell to 75.19 as stocks tumbled before closing at 75.17. “News that some vaccines and drugs may be less effective against Omicron triggered a reversal in risk sentiments. However, the upside reaction was muted due to MSCI rebalancing-related inflows and FPI flows into Star health IPO,” said Kotak Securities deputy VP (currency & interest rate derivatives) Anindya Banerjee. He added that over the near term, volatility will be high. While the rupee was expected to remain under pressure, especially against low-yielding currencies like euro and yen due to carry unwinding, he forecast the currency to trade within a range of 74.70 and 75.40. Goldman Sachs in its recent India 2022 outlook has forecast the Indian rupee to have the highest expected return among Asian currencies. “We forecast dollar/rupee at three months, six months and 12 months at 74, 73 and 72 respectively,” the investment bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/re-slips-8p-to-75-17-on-omicron-fears/articleshow/88017332.cms||---

In a letter written to the AG, education department additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar has pointed out that the income-expenditure accounts of different universities have not been audited for the last several years in violation of the statutory provisions. “There should be item-wise audit of the accounts so that a clear picture of the exact utilisation of grants may emerge. The universities are supposed to follow the Bihar Financial Rules in spending the money sanctioned to them by the state government or other funding agencies,” he wrote. The state government sanctions the universities grants for payment of salaries, pension, retirement benefits, honorarium to guest teachers and staff hired on outsourcing basis every year. Besides, the universities also receive funds from the government for purchase of books in libraries, equipment and chemicals in laboratories and computers in offices and departments. Universities have been spending money on various counts, including printing of question papers and answer books from the government grants. Besides getting grants from the government, universities also generate funds from their internal resources. But all these income and expenses made by the universities and colleges are not audited by the competent authorities regularly. Higher education director Rekha Kumari said universities have also been directed to specify the procedure adopted in the purchase of books in libraries. “The Raj Bhavan has also been informed of the same. Moreover, some universities have submitted their reply, but the department has not found them satisfactory,” she added. Welcoming the government move, Federation of University Teachers’ Associations of Bihar working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said till three to four decades back every budgetary demand of the universities were being scrutinized by the state government before their passage from the state legislature and subsequently the universities were restricted to keep their expenditure within the limit of approved grants. “Unfortunately, the government examines in detail only the salary, pension and arrears released to the universities nowadays. Demands under other heads are left untouched, giving a long rope to the university authorities to spend the funds at their own will. The receipts and expenditure of university examinations are not scrutinized at all even though examinations entailing purchase of answer books and printing of questions have become major sources of corruption,” they added. Opposition MLCs corner govt over anomalies in universities: The issue of alleged corruption prevailing in universities of the state was raised by the opposition members in the legislative council on Tuesday. The MLCs of RJD and Congress demonstrated outside the House separately over the issue. As soon as the House proceedings began, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra raised the issue and demanded a debate on it. “Irregularities in different universities of Bihar have come to light. Crores have been recovered from the houses of several VCs. A VC ordered purchase of books, notebooks without floating tender. Mustaq Ahmad, who had been made the registrar of Mithila University, was earlier suspended as the principal of Millat College and Marwari College in Darbhanga for embezzlement of Rs 7 lakh through fake utility certificate without the construction of girls’ hostel,” Mishra said. RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey too said sought discussion in the House over the issue. “This is a serious issue,” he added. Acting chairperson Awadhesh Narain Singh told Mishra that the government has already ordered a probe into the alleged irregularities in different universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-govt-acts-tough-asks-ag-to-audit-accounts-of-universities/articleshow/88015481.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Bihar: RJD, BJP legislators engage in ugly spat||PATNA: RJD MLA from Maner, Bhai Virendra, and Sanjay Saraogi of the BJP had a sharp exchange of unparliamentary words bordering on verbal violence in full public view on the road outside the state legislature building on Tuesday. According to eyewitnesses among the mediapersons before whom the unsavoury incident happened, there was no apparent cause that should have led to such an unsavoury incident, but it soon turned out to be the most-discussed item of the day before the detection of the empty liquor bottles beside the annexe building of the state legislature. As it happened, a few mediapersons from a TV news channel got together Darbhanga MLA Saraogi and Virendra to elicit from them their opinions on a host of issues in the format of the point-counterpoint to play the zero-sum game for a live show. Just about the time they were getting ready for the media game, Saraogi told Bhai Virendra, rather mocking and provoking the latter with his holier-than-thou attitude while referring to the 15 years of RJD rule in Bihar: “What will you say? you people have looted the state for years.” In Saraogi’s sentence, ‘you’ had been uttered in its dismissive and disrespectful Hindi intonation ‘tum,’ which immediately brought out the adrenalin and vitriol from Virendra, who, in turn, threw expletives and caste-based slurs at the BJP MLA. “How dare you speak to me like that. You are ‘milawati’ (adulterated),” said Virendra, who is senior to Saraogi. He even hurled some abuses at the BJP MLA and also threatened to bash him up (“patak kar maarenge”). If the mediapersons had not intervened and put themselves as a wall between the two MLAs, they might have also come to real blows, they said. State BJP spokesman and national general secretary of OBC Morcha, Nikhil Anand,condemned the RJD MLA’s behaviour. “Bhai Virendra repeated utterances of the term ‘milavati’ was a disgusting allusion to Saraogi belonging to the Vaishya caste,” said Anand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-bjp-legislators-engage-in-ugly-spat/articleshow/88015610.cms||Abhay Singh

The government had directed district collectors to complete the disbursement of pensions in three days, starting Wednesday. Panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy reviewed the issue of disbursement of pensions with senior officials on Tuesday.

Seema Singh, principal of St Karen’s High School, said only 12 students are allowed to sit in a class to maintain social distancing. “Thermal screening and sanitization are done regularly. Kids also carry their own hand sanitizers. Right now, we are conducting Term-I board exam with all precautionary measures,” she said. Prerna Gupta, a resident of Ashiana Nagar and mother of two kids, said, “There is constant fear among parents about the safety of children in times of Covid-19. But I am relieved that the school in which they are enrolled is following safety protocol.” Another parent, Yash Sinha, whose daughter studies in Class IV, said, “After the second wave of the pandemic, we have become more cautious. It is a big relief that no case of the new variant has been reported in the country so far. I am also in contact with family doctor as the cases of viral fever are rising,” he said. BPSCWA president Shamael Ahmed said on Tuesday, “I have asked the schools to encourage the parents to take the vaccine and even keep a tab on medical conditions of their wards. The visitors should also be screened in the schools as a safety measure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/schools-on-alert-amid-fear-of-new-variant-of-covid-19/articleshow/88015388.cms||Faryal Rumi

The number of patients experiencing respiratory problems has increased at the outpatient departments (OPDs) of different health facilities in the city due to the deterioration in air quality. Dr Sanjiv Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P), said deterioration in air quality would affect people’s respiratory system and cause cardiovascular diseases. “Exposure to particulate matters can affect lung and heart. With the rise in pollution, the level of carbon dioxide has also increased, causing breathlessness especially to those suffering from comorbidities. It can also affect heart because of acidosis (build-up of acid in the bloodstream), which occurs when kidneys and lungs cannot keep body’s pH in balance. In this situation, people get easily fatigued (respiratory) and it also causes depression in cardiovascular. Those whose lungs are already compromised during the second wave of pandemic will be more affected,” Dr Kumar said. Dr Mukul Kumar Singh, an epidemiologist at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital-Patna, said there has been a rise in number of patients suffering from asthma, lung and heart diseases as well as tuberculosis due to rise in pollution level. “If we compare with the previous year, the number of patients with respiratory problems is more in the OPD this year,” he said, adding people should wear face masks to keep diseases at bay. Dr A K Ashu, joint director of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, said poor air quality could also affect healthy individuals. “People should use mask to avoid respiratory and other health problems. The society should also contribute to control the rising level of pollution. In Patna, there is very little paving. If paving is not possible, there should be grass over it, which is the natural way of controlling air pollution. Just sprinkling water on roads will not help much,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/wear-masks-for-protection-from-air-pollution-doctors/articleshow/88015583.cms||Faryal Rumi

District collectors of Anantapur, Nellore and Guntur have been asked to establish help desks at international airports in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad, respectively to conduct RT-PCR tests on international travellers whose destination is Andhra Pradesh. If any traveller is found positive for the disease, the teams will coordinate with the local administration to ensure isolation. In case it is negative, such travellers will complete residential details and undergo home quarantine at their residence. They will be subjected to RT-PCR tests after seven days of arrival. Positive samples will be sent for whole genome sequencing. District teams will communicate details of travellers to officials of the respective mandals to ensure strict home isolation. Field-level teams will also collect samples from the international travellers who arrived in the recent past in the state. District officials of Chittoor, Krishna, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, Kadapa and Kurnool will set up help desks at local airports to screen international travellers arriving in domestic flights to the state. Based on guidelines issued by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the state health department has listed 12 high-risk countries, including South Africa, China, Bangladesh and New Zealand. Foreign returnees travelling from and transiting through these countries will be subjected to rigorous screening and testing. Their contacts will also be closely tracked and tested. All district medical and health officers have been directed to establish help desks at railway stations in their respective districts to conduct RT-PCR tests on international travellers entering the state by train. Guidelines also asked officials to intensify awareness programmes to promote Covid-19 appropriate behaviour among the public. All eligible persons in the state shall be vaccinated with at least one dose by December 15. Special drives will be taken up to achieve 100% first dose vaccine coverage. Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh reported 184 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the cumulative caseload to 20,72,909. The toll increased to 14,442 as three more patients succumbed to the pandemic. One patient each died in Chittoor, Krishna and West Godavari districts. Altogether, 134 patients were declared cured on Tuesday. There are 2,149 active cases with 20,56,318 cumulative recoveries and 14,442 fatalities. Andhra Pradesh conducted 25,925 Covid-19 tests on Tuesday and detected 184 new cases. This translates to a case positivity rate of 0.7%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-to-tighten-vigil-at-airports-rail-stns-over-omicron-threat/articleshow/88016118.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

A CBI court had recently issued non-bailable arrest warrants against the trio and other accused while acting on a complaint of the probe agency that they were not complying with the summons. The three arrested women were identified as Aparna Verma, Rajrani Verma and Jasima Khatoon. The CBI officials interrogated the three women separately before producing them in the court of ADJ-VII at Bhagalpur. The CBI has sought transit remand of the accused so that they could be produced before the CBI court at Patna. SMVSS, a co-operative society registered under Bihar and Orissa Cooperative Societies Act of 1935, was founded by late Manorama Devi in early 1990. It is under CBI probe after the scam came to light. Manorama’s son Amit Kumar and his wife Rajni Priya along with several others are accused in the multi-crore scam. CM Nitish Kumar had formed a special investigation team (SIT) of Economic Offences Unit (EOU) and ordered an inquiry into the scam in the first week of August, 2017. Altogether 22 FIRs were registered against the accused persons, including managing committee members of the SMVSS. Several accused were arrested by the SIT before the CBI took over the case for investigation. Government funds worth crores were fraudulently transferred between 2004 and 2014 in the accounts of SMVSS. The SMVSS had allegedly transferred government funds meant for various welfare schemes from the Bhagalpur district administration’s accounts to its bank account in connivance with some district officials and bankers. During investigations, it came to light that SMVSS used to fraudulently procure cheque books from banks and forged signatures of the district magistrate to issue cheques in its favour in order to transfer huge funds to its account. Sources said the CBI had gathered information about the SMVSS and its bank accounts from the time of its inception in early 1990s. Similarly, the income-tax department had also started gathering information about the major beneficiaries of the Srijan scam. The CBI had filed three charge sheets in the multi-crore Srijan scam against over 60 people. The charge sheets named Manorama’s son Amit and daughter-in-law Rajni apart from some bank and district administration officials. A case against all 10 managing committee members of the SMVSS was registered at Sabour police station by the block cooperative extension officer. According to sources, the CBI and Enforcement Directorate have already arrested former BJP leader Bipin Sharma, Rubi Sharma (wife of Bipin Sharma) and auditor and businessman P K Ghosh in connection with the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/srijan-scam-three-women-accused-held-in-bhagalpur/articleshow/88014801.cms||Kumar Rajesh

Employees’ associations formed a JAC to take up the agitation opposing the transfer of deposits. “The state government is diverting university funds for its welfare schemes. The university never deposited money in financial institutions other than nationalised banks. The APSFSC is offering 5.5. per cent interest while nationalised banks are offering a 5 per cent interest rate. This is just a plan by the state government to take the university’s money,” said employees’ JAC convener Venkata Narayana.

At least 4,800 public sector bank branches will remain shut for two days across the state, as some 70,000 bank employees and officers go on strike, according to Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA). Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA, said, “We are against the tabling of the proposed amendment to the Banking Regulation Act in the parliament. Public money is for public welfare and it should not be moved to private hands. We are against the privatisation of nationalised banks. The government must realise that all the government schemes are being effectively implemented by the nationalized banks instead of private counterparts and the efforts should instead be made to strengthen public sector banks than shut them down.” Transactions worth an estimated Rs 20,000 crore are expected to be impacted across Gujarat according to estimates by MGBEA, over the two days of strike. NEFT and RTGS transactions can be made online but the necessary formalities from the banks will be done only as the banking operations resume. MGBEA has been aggressively protesting the privatisation bid for banks. “If the government does not heed our demands, we may further intensify the agitation against privatisation of banks,” said Rawal. Bank employees are also planning demonstrations and agitations across the state, in the run up to December 16-17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nationalized-banks-to-strike-work-for-2-days/articleshow/88017265.cms||---

The government gave dearness allowance for about five months and decided to withdraw it, and recover the money paid from the salaries of professors,” said Dr Rajnish Patel, president, Gujarat Medical Teachers Association (GMTA). The Maha Rally will be held on December 4 to press their demands, he said. The pay cuts have affected some 3,000 faculty members, including 360 professors at BJ Medical College. Members of GMTA have already begun protests and plan to intensify their stir. Apart from the Maha Rally, they have planned Ram dhuns, blood donation camps and rallies at six government medical colleges, where they are expected to be joined by GMERS doctors and medical officers from every district. A few months ago, GMTS members called off their strike when they were assured by the state government that their demands would be addressed. The demands of GMTS members included higher non-practising allowance in line with the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations. Another demand was regarding abolition of contract appointments. As medical college teachers are barred from private practice, an allowance is paid to them as compensation. GMTA had also demanded that medical college teachers be allowed to start private practice after 10 years of regular service. Citing a government resolution of 2017, GMTA also sought an increase in the cap on the maximum monthly salary. Promotions of many faculty members at GMERS colleges have also been pending for a long time. “We called off our protest after we were promised that our demands would be met. The government has gone back on its word, giving us a pay cut instead. We will continue our protest till our demands are fulfilled,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/medical-teachers-gear-up-to-protest-against-salary-cut/articleshow/88017267.cms||---

Condemning the incident, women activists have called for strict action against the cop and monitoring of police personnel on night duty to prevent recurrence of such incidents. The victim had gone for the movie on Saturday night with her co-workers and employer. She left the theatre with her male employer when the couple was pulled up by constable V Murugan (41) who was on night patrol on his twowheeler. After making inquiries, he questioned the nature of relationship between the couple as they were not husband and wife. Police sources said that he subsequently threatened to tell both their families about their “illicit relationship” and also took money from the ATM with debit card snatched from the employer. According to the complaint lodged by the woman, Murugan told her employer that he will drop her at her house and left with her. However, she said the policeman took her to a lodge instead where he raped her before sending her home in an autorickshaw. On Monday morning, the victim confided with her employer about what had happened. Subsequently, she filed a complaint and a case was registered against Murugan at the all-woman police station, south, under sections 366, 342, 376(2)(a), 392, 506(ii) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for rape, kidnapping, criminal intimidation and robbery of Rs 40,000. He was subsequently arrested and remanded in judicial custody and also placed under suspension. A senior police official said that police personnel on night duty are being monitored by higher officials with the e-beat system now in place. Meanwhile, women activists said police were more inclined to shame and blame the victim rather than act responsibly when they inquired about the case. “When such an offence is committed by a police official, how will women come forward to report rape or sexual harassment? Suspension is not a solution, harsher punishment is needed so that such incidents do not repeat,” said R Sasikala, district president of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/policeman-rapes-woman-returning-from-cinema-held/articleshow/88017259.cms||---
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Government Rajaji Hospital doctors seek steps to expedite NEET PG 2021 counselling||Around 75 postgraduate resident doctors staged a protest at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Tuesday demanding for steps to be taken immediately for expediting the NEET PG 2021 counselling and admission process, and to fast-track the Supreme Court proceedings on an urgent basis. The top court had previously asked the Centre to temporarily halt the counselling for NEET PG 2021 until a decision is taken on the validity of the move to introduce OBC and EWS reservation in the all India quota. The protesting doctors said that government hospitals have been functioning without an entire batch of doctors, which is one-third of its workforce since May 2021, and the remaining doctors were working beyond their capacity to provide uninterrupted services to the patients. “We continue to be severely overburdened. But, unfortunately, there seems to be no respite to our prolonged physical and mental distress as the next court hearing has been scheduled on January 6, 2022. Hence, we have resorted to the protest,” said a doctor. Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Resident Doctors Association has also decided to withdraw from outpatient department (OPD) services from December 1 indefinitely, if their demands are not met. “We urge the Union government and the Supreme Court to take note of the grievance of resident doctors and take steps immediately for expediting the NEET PG 2021 counselling and admission process, and to fast-track the proceedings. It is high time that the overworked doctors are unburdened,” said the association. The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA) is also supporting the demands of the resident doctors and has already appealed to the Chief Justice of India. “There is danger of a whole batch of doctors from all over the country losing a whole year. There is a need to immediately resolve the issue instead of any more delay,” said Dr K Senthil, state president, TNGDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grh-docs-seek-steps-to-expedite-neet-pg-2021-counselling/articleshow/88017256.cms||---

Criticising the state government for not opening paddy procurement centres in rabi season, Sanjay said: “What if we also respond in the same way.” At a press conference in Delhi, he said KCR was frustrated after Huzurabad bypoll setback and deflecting people’s attention away from Dalit Bandhu. He said Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana grow more paddy, but only Telangana, which ranks sixth in production, appeared to be experiencing procurement problems. “What is the backup plan if paddy cannot be raised? Have the farmers been informed about any new strategy?” he questioned. Party leaders D Arvind, Gudur Narayana Reddy and Ponguleti Sudhakar Reddy criticised the CM’s comments on Union minister G Kishan Reddy on the paddy procurement issue. “The state government is trying to favour the millers’ lobby,” Arvind said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-poser-to-t-on-paddy-backup-plan/articleshow/88016591.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||My bottle art decorates many homes today||I was always interested in art and during my school days, vacations were spent dabbling in various art forms -- fabric painting, glass painting and doll making. I even went to a tailoring class during my extended 10th standard break. I used to proudly proclaim to all and sundry that my mother’s artistic genes had rubbed off on me and even though buying greeting cards was quite popular in those days, I preferred making my own. Marriage, motherhood, and a full-time career made me forget my first love. Other interests like running, cycling, trekking and photography kept me busy on weekends and holidays. The lockdown with its embargo on physical movement helped reawaken my passion for art. I was fascinated by the plethora of art forms available on the net. I began using my free time to watch videos and became a part of several groups where I could connect with like-minded talented individuals and learn art from them. A small stationary vendor who began selling art supplies from the boot of his car during the lockdown ensured that I had a steady supply of material. I became fascinated with converting waste into artwork and repurposing material that I would have normally thrown away. The lockdown taught me the value of minimalism and I started collecting old glass bottles and converting them into art. I used scrap material around the house like jute thread, pieces of cloth, buttons, beads etc to decorate the bottles. Even an egg carton was converted into a fancy dress for a clay figurine. I started gifting these bottles to friends and family for their gardens and balconies. Their joy and amazement at seeing this bottle art gave me creative satisfaction. Now my daughter takes care not to throw away anything which she thinks can be used for my art. (The writer is a HR professional) ..................................... Picked up the ghungroo again By Shraddha Agrawal This pandemic taught us the value of life and helped us push our limits and explore ourselves. I had lost the real me after my marriage. The daily rigmarole of taking care of my family and my kids kept me occupied and I could barely get any time for myself. One thing that really bothered me was: What next? During the lockdown, I was able to pick up my hobbies again and give time to the activities I had always loved doing. Dancing was one such lost passion. During my time in boarding school, I had learnt Kathak for eight years and it not only help me build my confidence but also shaped my personality for the better. Be it dance, theatre or mime, I always loved performing. Participating in college youth festivals used to give me immense pleasure. But lately the only opportunities I was getting to perform were at family functions. And that certainly was not enough for my interest in dancing. To get serious about it was a challenge in itself. And for that I obviously needed a mentor who could guide me and push me to start again. YouTube served this purpose and I started watching various tutorials and videos to help me practice. The digital space can really prove to be a boon when used correctly. I also realised that it’s never too late to start something new or pick up something old if you are serious about it. A skill always lies within you, and you just need to find the right tool to dig it and discover it like a hidden treasure. I learnt, practiced, and uploaded some of my videos on Youtube and the response from my family was very encouraging. It motivates me to keep going, keep dancing and never stop learning. (The writer is a homemaker) ........................ Found my passion for emerging techs By Geetha Charmi Nunepally Many termed the pandemic as a black era that adversely affected the social and economic growth of the world. I feel, it affected the students’ lives to a greater extent. I had just completed my class 10 board exams when the pandemic brought every single activity to a halt. My classes (for grade 11) were shifted to online. Though everyone was losing hope, I decided to light a candle of hope and positivity. As I was at home, I wanted to do something which would be interesting, engaging, and productive. I saw a news article about Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. I found it very interesting and wanted to know more about it. Since I am very curious about things, I couldn’t stop reading more and more about it. Slowly I realised that I enjoyed knowing about these technologies and the solutions AI was bringing to the world. I started taking coding courses every week. And recently I enrolled myself for a long-term course in AI and machine learning in addition to my regular intermediate classes. Coding now is a very big part of my life. I find coding peaceful and especially fun like I find singing – It is like therapy to me. Coding is all about guessing the logic. And after I obtain the expected output, the joy just can’t be expressed. It has also improved my way of thinking in life. I can now solve logical reasoning questions with more ease. AI intellectuals all over the world are conveying the message that AI is the future. I am on my way to study and rule the future and nothing can pull me back as long as I continue to code with excitement and learn more and more coding languages and tools.

---||Ahmedabad||BJP plans Article 370 themed tournaments in Gandhinagar||Gandhinagar: The ruling BJP in Gujarat will organize kabaddi and cricket tournaments featuring the theme of ‘Article 370’, in Union home minister Amit Shah’s Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, the party’s office-bearers said on Tuesday. The modalities are still being worked out. But the name of the tournament has been finalized as ‘Gandhinagar Lok Sabha Premier League 370’. An official announcement about the tournament will be made soon, said Gujarat BJP general secretary Pradipsinh Vaghela. He said the tournament has been named after Article 370 of the Constitution because Amit Shah, the Lok Sabha member from Gandhinagar, was instrumental in its abrogation. The article had conferred special status on Jammu & Kashmir. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all MPs to organize sports tournaments in their constituencies,” said Vaghela. “Thus, to provide a platform to talented youth, Shah asked us to host such tournaments in his constituency.” He added: “We will start with kabaddi and cricket and then take up other sports.” Vaghela said that the people of Gujarat, especially in Gandhinagar, were in love with the term Article 370 because their MP had tabled a proposal in the Parliament that led to its abrogation. “As of now, it has been decided to hold one kabaddi and one cricket tournament for the entire Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat,” Vaghela said. “Since there will be more rush for cricket, one cricket tournament for each of the seven assembly segments of the Gandhinagar seat will be held.” He added: “Winners of these assembly-level tournaments will compete against each other for the crown.” A registration drive for the tournaments and teams will begin soon, he said. Hitesh Patel, the BJP’s media coordinator for north Gujarat, said that people from Gandhinagar in the 16-40 age group can participate, with booth and ward level teams winning and advancing. “The process to choose grounds has begun. It is possible that the cricket games will be of 10-12 overs so that at least five games can be played daily,” Patel added. Party sources said the tournament will most probably begin from December 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-plans-article-370-themed-tournaments-in-gandhinagar/articleshow/88017274.cms||---

Samples of all patients have been sent for genome sequencing to ascertain if they are infected with the newly detected Omicron variant, which has been designated as a variant of concern and is highly transmissible. Talking to TOI, medical officer, community health centre, Vrindavan, Dr Swati Jadia, said that a 51-year-old woman from the US and the 13-year-old daughter of a woman from Austria, who was earlier found infected, have tested positive for the virus. On Tuesday, six samples were taken to trace the contacts of the US woman, she said. On a random, 400 samples have been taken to ascertain the prevalence of the new variant. “Panicked foreigners are leaving Vrindavan after learning about the cases,” Jadia said, adding that health department is focusing on tracing every primary and secondary contact of the patients. Nodal in-charge of the rapid response team, Dr Bhudev (who goes by his first name), said that district administration has declared another institute next to Girdhar Dham ashram a containment zone after two persons staying there tested positive.

---||Kolkata||Boards on, Cov +ve kids give exams a miss||Kolkata: The city witnessed an exam rush on Tuesday, as both ICSE and ISC papers were conducted in two different shifts across schools affiliated to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the first major paper for CBSE Class X was also conducted in affiliated schools. Though all the three exams ended without any major hitch and the uploading of marks went off smoothly, a few candidates had to stay away from the exams as they tested positive for Covid. Those down with viral fever and chicken pox have been writing their exams from isolation rooms. La Martiniere for Boys has two candidates who have had to opt out of the boards as they have tested positive for Covid. One more boy reported very high fever, though tests showed not Covid, malaria or dengue, said acting principal John Stephen. One candidate at each of South City International School, DPS Ruby Park and Sushila Birla Girls’ School could not take the board exams because of Covid. “We have informed the board about this child and she is staying out of the process till her quarantine period gets over,” said Sushila Birla Girls’ School principal Koeli Dey. In some cases, teachers also have had to pull out of the examination process after reporting high fever. At St Augustine’s Day School, Kolkata, the headmistress reported fever and decide to stay away for now. ICSE candidates wrote their literature paper while ISC candidates wrote their business studies paper on Tuesday. CBSE X candidates had their social science. The students described their tests as easy though some ICSE candidates claimed it would have been better had the test not been conducted in the MCQ mode. “Can literature be tested in the hit or miss method? I finished the one-hour paper in 20 minutes flat,” said Pranov Bangur, an ICSE student a South City International School. CBSE X students said the social sciences paper could be tackled only if the text books were studied thoroughly. “The NCERT text books were the key to doing well,” said Riddhima Dey a CBSE candidate from DPS Ruby Park. Examiners of all three tests were happy that they could evaluate and upload the marks on time on Tuesday. On Monday, a server glitch held up the uploading of marks of ICSE and the CISCE had to ask for a closure of exam centres. Examiners had to return at 8am on Tuesday to complete the uploading of marks of Monday’s paper. “In our case, one examiner faced the glitch and he had to return to school at 8am to complete the process. Thankfully, everything was smooth on Tuesday,” said Father Thamacin Arulappan, principal at St Xavier’s Collegiate School. CBSE X had a smooth evaluation and uploading, too, said most affiliated schools. The exam was conducted on OMR sheets, unlike like that in ICSE/ISC, where the tests were conducted on answer booklets. The challenge was to print out OMR sheets and most schools had organised seven to 10 printers so that the process remained smooth. “We had organised several additional printers because apart from our students, we had students of some other schools writing the exam from here. Everything went off smoothly,” said Meena Kak, director at Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, where candidates wrote from 25 rooms in the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/boards-on-cov-ve-kids-give-exams-a-miss/articleshow/88016626.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra may have missed 10,000 new HIV cases in pandemic year||MUMBAI: Maharashtra is likely to have missed nearly 10,000 cases of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections due to a significant drop in testing in 2020-21. Activists fear it could set back significant gains achieved by the state over the years in controlling the disease.  Testing for HIV declined by 38% in the state and a staggering 50% in Mumbai after a nationwide lockdown was announced last March. As a result, the new cases detected in 2020-21 dropped by 46% in the state and 54% in Mumbai. With testing services normalising to a great extent in 2021-22, Mumbai managed to regain some lost ground since April, but the rest of the state has a lot of distance to cover. Maharashtra, which has the highest HIV cases in the country, has 2.5 lakh patients on life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART).  The state had been successfully scaling up its testing services by 10% to 30% every year till the pandemic hit. In 2018-19, 30.5 lakh tests were carried out, which jumped by 36% to 41.4 lakh in 2019-20. In 2020-21, though, merely 25.7 lakh tests could be performed as HIV diagnostic centres and clinics shut, hospitals focused on Covid care, several HIV staffers were sent on Covid duty and people couldn’t travel. In Mumbai, too, testing fell from 4.75 lakh in 2019-20 to 2.3 lakh in 2019-20, leading to barely 2,063 new detections compared with 4,473 in the prior year.  A senior official from Maharashtra Aids Control Society said while NGOs and community organisations have been asked to increase testing, they have been facing new challenges. “People are indulging in high-risk behaviour (unsafe sex) through online platforms, mobile applications and newer mediums, where our intervention is yet to make major inroads,” the official said. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society, said 95% of the transmission in the city is still due to unsafe sex. The city positivity rate (0.9%) remains almost three times that of the state average (0.3%). A silver lining, said Dr Acharya, was the viral load was suppressed in 96% of 26,130 cases checked recently.  Testing for pregnant women didn’t see as much of a drop. Of the 21 lakh tested, 720 (0.03%) were found positive. The state official said though they may have missed detecting new cases, they went the extra mile to ensure people on ART didn’t miss their medication. Ganesh Acharya, an HIV activist, said, “Delay in diagnosis and initiation of ART are some key causes of death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-may-have-missed-10000-new-hiv-cases-in-pandemic-yr/articleshow/88018578.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||Plant trees to make up for loss of green cover due to Delhi Metro: SC||NEW DELHI: Holding that construction of the Metro project caused loss of vegetation as well as flora and fauna in the national capital, the Supreme Court has directed the Delhi government and DMRC to formulate a plan for plantation of trees and saplings to increase green cover in the city. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said that the entire world is grappling with the problem of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions and it must be addressed at the local level also by planting more trees. The bench asked the government to take the help of students, NGOs and members of civil society in the plantation drive in the city and directed it to place before it the plan within three months. The bench passed the order on a plea filed by DMRC seeking the court's approval for felling of around 10,000 trees for its Phase IV Metro project. The court asked it to approach the Delhi government to get prior forest clearance. Referring to various global summits, including the recently concluded Glasgow Climate Change Conference, the court emphasised that environmental problems needed to be dealt with seriousness as the global environmental degradation resulted in extinction of certain flora and fauna with a cascading effect on planet Earth. “Projects such as the metro railway in question have already been implemented in parts of NCT of Delhi/NCR. One cannot lose sight of the fact that it has resulted in loss of vegetation as well as flora and fauna in certain areas. The implementation of Phase IV of MRTS Project may be a further threat to the ecology of NCT of Delhi/NCR,” Justice Nagarthna, who penned the judgement, said. “To meaningfully arrest the problem of declining tree cover, the civil society must also be placed with the responsibility to carry out reforestation activities. While we cannot ignore the importance of governmental responsibility in materialising the goals of sustainable development through reforestation, we strongly endorse the idea of collective responsibility towards ensuring a sustainable future. The engagement, inclusion and participation of citizens and perhaps more significantly, the ownership of the sustainable development agenda by empowered citizens and community-level actors will contribute in a significant manner to achieving the economic, social and environmental pillars of the sustainable development agenda,” it said. “... the GNCTD as well as DMRC are directed to conceive a plan of action for the purpose of planting trees in the NCT of Delhi. For that purpose, GNCTD may involve school and college students, educational institutions, non- governmental organisations, citizens’ welfare associations, public servants and every citizen or person who is interested in the ecology of NCT of Delhi to plant trees/saplings and ensure that they are nurtured and protected so that the NCT of Delhi would in passage of time have more greenery,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plant-trees-to-make-up-for-loss-of-green-cover-due-to-metro-sc/articleshow/88017276.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

But when the builder didn’t give him possession of the shop in time, Shailesh Bhatia, a resident of Dahod, approached the consumer court that has ordered the builder to return him the booking amount with interest. Bhatia had booked a shop in Krishna Shri scheme floated by Harsh Developers and paid Rs 5 lakh. The builder promised possession of the shop by September 2018. “But the builder hadn’t started the construction and couldn’t give possession on time. Bhatia kept visiting the city frequently to find out when he could get the shop’s possession,” said P V Moorjhani, managing trustee, Jagrut Nagrik Grahak Mandal. “Bhatia then asked the builder to return the advance he had paid. In 2018, the builder gave a cheque of Rs 5 lakh to Bhatia but it couldn’t be encashed due to lack of bank balance. Bhatia got Rs 1 lakh from the builder but Rs four lakh were still due. So, he approached the consumer forum,” Moorjhani told TOI. “No one from Harsh Developers turned up at the consumer forum for 30 months following which the court gave an order. The consumer forum has ordered Jayanti Mali, owner of Harsh Developer and landowner Pratapsinh Gohil to return Rs four lakh with 9 per cent interest and another nine per cent interest on Rs five lakh between November 2016 and October 2018,” Moorjhani added. The court has also asked the duo to pay Rs 5,000 towards mental harassment and Rs 5,000 for the complainant’s cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/builder-told-to-return-advance-for-not-giving-shops-possession/articleshow/88015799.cms||Tushar Tere

A murder case has been registered against unidentified person on the complaint of the woman’s family members. Police said that Usha Agarwal, 65, stayed alone in the house and it was locked from outside. Her neighbours said they did not notice any suspicious activity until a stench started emanating from the flat on Tuesday afternoon, following which they informed police. Station house officer, Chhatta police station, Sher Singh, said when police entered the house, the woman was lying dead in her bedroom with her face covered with a blanket. He added that she could have died 4-5 days ago. “The body has been sent for post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death.

---||Aurangabad||Most MSRTC employees continue stir, may lose November salaries||Aurangabad: The ongoing extended strike of the MSRTC employees is likely to witness further friction between the administration and employees over the release of salaries for the month of November. An MSRTC official on Tuesday said the disbursing November salary to the agitating employees was almost out of question. “The MSRTC has incurred monthly loss of nearly Rs 450 crore during November due to the strike. The pandemic had already strained the financial condition of the MSRTC and the extended agitation has made the situation worse,” the official said. According to senior MSRTC officials, the overall losses of the state transportation body have mounted to whopping Rs 12,000 crore. Till 6pm on Tuesday, only 960 MSRTC buses plied across Maharashtra. Not a single bus plied in the Amaravati region and just 13 buses in Marathwada. Majority of the employees have still not resumed their duties. As per official data, the MSRTC has suspended 8,195 employees so far, and dismissed another 1,827 till November 29. Out of 92,266 employees, 73,103 employees were participating in the strike. Union leader of one of the 28 registered employee unions of MSRTC said the agitating workforce was firm on their demand of the merger of the state transportation into the government. “The non-release of staff salaries will further add fuel to the fire. The staffers anyway now have become used to inordinate delay in salaries during the pandemic,” he said, preferring anonymity. Meanwhile, the passengers continued to suffer due to strike of MSRTC staffers with rural areas taking maximum hit. Many villagers said they were using two-wheelers to fulfil their commuting needs. “Even if driving two-wheeler on busy highways is a risky preposition, we are left with no option. The private vehicles are charging more from us,” said Ganesh Chavan, a farmer from Phulambri taluka of Aurangabad district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/most-msrtc-employees-continue-stir-may-lose-november-salaries/articleshow/88014924.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Trichy||Crocodiles sighted in Trichy||Trichy: In less than two weeks, Trichy residents have spotted crocodiles at three different locations in the city. On Tuesday, youths playing near a stream passing through Kattur spotted one basking on the bank, which they recorded on a mobile phone. The Kavutaar stream passes through residential neighbourhoods in Thiruverumbur. The crocodile, measuring around four to five feet, was reaching out to the banks dotted with thickets. As the youths started making noise, it returned to the stream. This was the first sighting of a crocodile in Thiruverumbur in recent years, but residents in other parts of the city spotted a crocodile in Uyyakondan canal on Vayalur road and Korayar river passing through Pirattiyur. Forest officials said the ones spotted at Pirattiyur and Thiruverumbur cannot be the same as the two localities are not interconnected. Residents said there is a possibility of the sightings at Vayalur road and Thiruverumbur being the same considering its size and also because Uyyakondan canal passes through both the localities. “Crocodiles are aware of the water network and their destination would be Kollidam river. Our team is stationed at Thiruverumbur,” said a forest department official.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/crocodiles-sighted-in-trichy/articleshow/88016614.cms||---
---||Meerut||Cops jail hotel owner in 'false' case, help goons seize property||Meerut: Twelve policemen in Meerut, including an inspector, first framed the owner of a hotel in a false case and then helped a bunch of goons take over the property. All of them have now been served a show-cause notice by the department. Investigating officers cited CCTV footage as evidence and said that one of the accused, inspector Prashant Kapil, who already has several cases pending against him, booked the hotel's owner, Haji Afaq, and put him behind bars in a "fake" case so that the criminals could get ample time and opportunity to seize the property. The policemen were from the Lisari Gate thana. "Why shouldn't we deduct a months' salary from your pay and not take any action against you?" asked senior superintendent of police (SSP) Prabhakar Chaudhary in the notice that was sent to the cops. A deputy superintendent of police (SP) leading the investigation said the footage shows that the cops were "clearly guilty" of letting goons take over the hotel. Action was taken after the minorities commission took cognisance of the complaint filed by Afaq. Police said that the incident took place in August 2020. When Afaq came out of jail, he filed a complaint with the commission against the policemen and the accountant of his hotel, Mohammad Qadir. "Qadir has now been arrested. He was earlier absconding," said the SSP. “Afaq says he set up his hotel in 2015 and it was doing well until the Covid-19 pandemic. His business took a hit and he decided to sell half of the property. This is when his accountant conspired to illegally encroach upon the hotel land,” the officer probing the case told TOI. Inspector Kapil has in the past been accused of arresting an "innocent" boy under a "fake" case. His role in the death of a man who was killed after being charged with cattle theft had also come under the lens of higher-ups. "I have received the show-cause notice and will respond to it. I do not want to comment on the matter right now," Kapil said. The minorities commission took cognisance of Afaq’s complaint and ordered the district magistrate to conduct an inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cops-jail-hotel-owner-in-false-case-help-goons-seize-property/articleshow/88015735.cms||Ishita Mishra

Localities such as Khajamalai, K K Nagar and Kattur were the most hit as underground drainage work is going on. Corporation officials said that a mixture of gravel and m-sand were applied on the roads to prevent cars from getting stuck in the UGD manholes and pipelines installed recently. The corporation also undertook road repair work in RS Puram and Bharathidasan Road as dry weather prevailed on Tuesday. Commuters said that the work on filling the potholes should be carried out periodically. “Royal Road and Major Saravanan Road in Cantonment are also in tatters. The surplus water stagnating the roundabouts is affecting the durability of the roads,” V Kumaran, a resident of Raja Colony said. Corporation officials said that run-off water from St Johns Vestry school inundating the roads in Cantonment was notified to the school management. “The school was told to install a rainwater harvesting mechanism on their premises to plug the water flow. We will repeat the restoration work as a permanent solution can be given only after the northeast monsoon ends,” a corporation official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-starts-restoration-of-roads-damaged-by-rain/articleshow/88016621.cms||---
---||Trichy||Trichiites relieved as water recedes||Trichy: A day after floods affected the normal life of residents in Trichy city, water level in the inundated neighbourhoods came down significantly on Tuesday since breaches in rivers flowing through the city were attended to. With no heavy rainfall in the catchment areas, the discharge of surplus water into three rivers that caused inundation dipped marginally, much to the relief of residents. With the inflow in Ariyar river reduced, vehicles commuted at ease through the Trichy-Dindigul NH on Tuesday. In Pirattiyur, the inundated residential streets saw water receding gradually. Although the city had moderate rain in the morning, the dry weather for the rest of the day helped the water recede. Similarly, MM Nagar and Shanmuga Nagar extension locality on Vayalur road, where the overflowing Kudamurutti inundated Vayalur road highway, saw stagnant water receding. As there was no rain in the catchment areas, water level in Kudamurutti river near Kuzhumayee Amman temple reduced by around 3 feet.  “The residential streets remain inundated but the main roads that were flooded on Monday have recovered. Hope the dry weather prevails for the next few days so that stagnant water from the houses goes back,” S Balachandar, a resident of Shanmuga Nagar, said. Lingam Nagar and Kuzhumani road that were flooded by Kodingal river also saw a major respite on Tuesday. PWD officials said the water level in the rivers flowing through the city might reduce further as the catchments areas in Manapparai, Trichy district, Pudukottai, Dindigul and Karur districts are expected to remain dry. Trichy corporation, through its mega kitchen established at the K Abishekapuram zonal office, continued preparing food for 3,000 people stranded at their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichiites-relieved-as-water-recedes/articleshow/88016630.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi breathes easier than a day earlier, but see-saw to continue||NEW DELHI: The city’s air quality improved to the lower level of the “very poor” category due to favourable meteorological conditions and fewer farm fires. Westerly winds blowing at 8-15 kmph cleared off most pollutants and pulled several highly polluted areas out of the “severe” category on Tuesday. Both visibility and air quality improved and an AQI of 328 was recorded on Tuesday against 389 a day earlier. Pollution monitoring agencies said the air quality could fluctuate over the next few days in the “very poor” category. The air quality started to improve in the morning due to better ventilation. The wind speed dropped slightly towards the evening, but it didn’t become nil. “Westerly winds blew up to 12kmph in the morning hours. The visibility was better in the afternoon, but in the morning some areas had a mixture of fog and smog,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, India Meteorological Department (IMD). Weather analysts said the city may see similar conditions on Wednesday, though wind speed could reduce in the morning hours. “Due to an approaching western disturbance, the wind speed may drop and change from westerly to easterly. The ventilation on Wednesday may be slightly lower and air quality could drop but stay within the very poor category. A drizzle may be seen around December 2, but that won’t have much effect on pollution levels. Moderate rain is expected on December 5 or 6 due to a stronger western disturbance, which might wash away most pollutants,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, climate change and meteorology, Skymet. Meanwhile, PM2.5 oscillated between 138.9 and 178.2 micrograms per cubic metres, which was an improvement over last week, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The minimum temperature was recorded at 9.8 degrees Celsius. SAFAR said AQI was likely to fluctuate within the “very poor” category. “Local surface winds are likely to remain relatively high, leading to an improvement in AQI. On December 1 and 2, winds are likely to be calm, which would deteriorate air quality. From December 3, winds are expected to increase, but AQI is likely to remain in the very poor category. The farm fire count was 186 and it’s share in PM2.5 was 1%,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-breathes-easier-than-a-day-earlier-but-see-saw-to-continue/articleshow/88017291.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Business||Reserve price relook: Trai seeks views||NEW DELHI: After handing out a relief package to the telecom industry in September, the government has now kickstarted work on auction of airwaves aimed at ushering in 5G and higher technologies, bringing in new spectrum bands and looking at pricing afresh in view of not-so-optimum sale in the previous bids.  In a consultation paper running up to 207 pages, regulator Trai — which gives final recommendations on auctions — spoke about a gamut of issues through a detailed analysis of the telecom sector in view of the recent bailout package, rapidly-evolving technologies, and need for higher spectrum. Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said that he expects Trai to come out with its final set of recommendations by March next year, following which auctions can be held by around April-May. Trai asked a set of 74 questions for consultation, seeking views on critical aspects such as valuation and reserve price of airwaves, including 5G, quantum of spectrum to be sold, block size, eligibility conditions for participation in auctions, rollout obligations, spectrum cap, and surrender of the asset. Norms will also be worked out for new frequencies such as 526-698MHz and millimetre band, that is 24.25-28.5GHz, in addition to bands such as 700MHz, 800MHz, 900MHz, 1800-MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2500MHz & 3300-3670MHz. The last round of spectrum auctions, held in March this year, had raked in winning bids of over Rs 77,800 crore for 855.6MHz of spectrum. But, nearly 63% of the total airwaves on sale remained unsold, with industry body COAI and telecom companies complaining of high reserve prices. Trai said that provisions announced in the September reforms package, including those related to surrender of spectrum, rationalisation of bank guarantees, and extended 30-year tenure of spectrum, will also be taken into account, while working on the valuation of spectrum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/reserve-price-relook-trai-seeks-views/articleshow/88018540.cms||Pankaj Doval

Sources said that the party will cut tickets of around eight to 10 sitting councillors to make way for “winning” candidates. There are a number of reasons for this, including reservation of wards, age factor, non-performance and giving chance to new faces. The party high command has called senior party leaders to Delhi to discuss names of candidates. The list will be released on December 2 and 3. BJP has already announced that senior leaders, including party president Arun Sood, MP Kirron Kher, former president Sanjay Tandon and former MP Satya Pal Jain will lead the party’s election campaign in Chandigarh.

Due to the Covid pandemic, the CBSE board examination is being held in two parts for the first time. Also in a first, CBSE released the question paper and answer sheet 20 minutes before the exam was to start. The school management was to download and print the material for distribution among students. However, slow internet connection and faulty printers caused trouble, delaying the exam by 15 to 30 minutes. According to exam organisers, simultaneous release of the link slowed the server down. There was also the problem of printer overuse. Students were given extra time to compensate for the delay. A total of 110 examination centres were set up in the city, in which more than 16,000 students are taking the exams. The exam started at 11.30am and continued till 1pm. Students reached examination centers at 10.30am, after which they were admitted inside in compliance with Covid guidelines. According to CBSE rules, only 12 students can be accommodated inside one hall in the examination centres. In city schools, apart from Class X, all other classes are being held online. As per the rules, lessons of other classes will be held online on the day of the board examinations. Only those students who are to appear for the exams will come to school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tech-glitches-delay-first-cbse-class-x-paper-by-15-to-30-mins/articleshow/88016640.cms||---

Elected members are now pressing to allow residents to avail of the Urban Poor Health Scheme, especially against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic. They are demanding that expenses of these treatments also be compensated for residents at the earliest. After the merger, the population of PMC went up by around 4.5 lakh. As part of the said scheme, needy residents get financial help for medical treatments from PMC. The initiative was started in 2010, and covers both Covid and mucormycosis treatments. Any citizen with less that Rs 2 lakh annual family income can avail of the said scheme. Beneficiaries get a card for this same, which remains valid for one financial year. On average, Rs30 crore are spent annually to keep the scheme running, with both government and private hospitals under PMC limits empanelled. Referring to the earlier merger of 11 villages in 2017, Ganesh Dhore, a corporator from these areas, said, “Residents of 11 merged villages got benefits of this scheme. It helped the needy in the pandemic, compensating their medical expenses. The same should be introduced for 23 merged villages.” The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has approached the civic administration for making all the necessary provisions to enabling these citizens to benefit now. “After the merger, these residents have become PMC’s responsibility. We cannot wash our hands off them by pointing to the administration’s financial condition. The civic body will have to take on the financial burden and provide relief to the needy,” said Deepali Dhumal, leader of the opposition in PMC. PMC became the biggest municipal corporation in Maharashtra after the inclusion of 23 villages in July, increasing its limits to 518.77sqkm. A senior PMC official said, “All municipal schemes will be implemented in the merged villages. The initiatives of the district administration, which were present earlier in these villages, will be replaced.” PMC has also planned expansion of the Urban Poor Health Scheme, for which financial provisions are being made, and a proposal is pending before the general body for its approval. In recent times, several other issues have also emerged concerning the 23 merged villages. Many of the administrative staffers from the local gram panchayats, who were going to be absorbed into PMC, had complained that they were simply not getting salaries for months, ever since the merger took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmcs-health-scheme-eludes-merged-villages/articleshow/88016638.cms||---

A New Mandi police team nabbed Ankush Tyagi, Alok Tyagi, Sandeep Kumar and Sudhir Kumar, all residents of Muzaffarnagar, and seized four luxury cars worth Rs 70 lakh from their possession. The crime became known when a resident approached a bank seeking a loan, but he was told that he had already taken a car loan from the bank, said police, adding that the victim then lodged a police complaint. The gang in connivance with bank employees used to create fake identities using fake documents to secure hefty car loans and they would also deposit 20% of the loan amount to avoid detection, said police, adding that they would then disappear with the vehicle. So far, 15 high-end cars have been bought by the accused. Police said they were yet to identify and arrest bank employees involved in the crime.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: HS council asks schools to hold offline tests by December 31||KOLKATA: For the first time since the pandemic broke out, state board schools are set to conduct an offline exam. The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education on Tuesday issued a notice, asking all its schools to conduct a 50-mark test for every theoretical paper for Class XII students by December 31 this year. Schools can decide on their schedule.These Class XII candidates will appear for their Higher Secondary board exams from April 2 to April 20 next year. Sources said, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, which conducts Madhyamik, the Class X board exams, would issue a notice to conduct offline tests but th timeframe was yet to be decided. None of the boards could hold Class X or XII exams in 2021. The state council notification makes an on-campus test for Class XII compulsory though some schools have been holding offline assessments for classes X and XII. Schools have been instructed to preserve the results and subject-wise marks that the XII students will obtain in the physical test. Chiranjib Bhattacharjee, president of the higher secondary education council, said, “Students haven’t been to schools for nearly for two years. So, they need to take in-person tests before appearing for offline board exams. Secondly, we want to be prepared for any kind of possible adverse situation during on-campus tests.” But not everyone is happy with the notification. Soudipta Das, secretary of Collegium of AHMs, said, “This notice has been issued rather late. Many schools have already printed 70-80-mark question papers, now what will they do?” Animesh Haldar, member of STEA, said, “Very short time has been given by the council. January would have been the best time to conduct the selection test so that a large part of the syllabus could be covered.” After schools reopened on November 16 and classes IX to XII started attending classes on campus, many institutes had planned to hold offline exams in January so that students could go back to their pre-Covid practice of writing offline exams. Now that the notice fo Class XII has been issued, schools will bring the test dates forward. Some schools, such as Taki House, already started their offline exams from Monday, fearing mid-December would clash with civic elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hs-council-asks-schools-to-hold-offline-tests-by-dec-31/articleshow/88016688.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Four of a family found dead in their bedroom||NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old man allegedly ended his life after poisoning his wife and two children following a marital dispute in their house in Outer Delhi’s Samaypur Badli early on Tuesday. No suicide note was found by police. The man, Amit Kumar, was married to Nikki (27) and they had a six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son. The incident came to the fore around 8am on Tuesday when Kumar’s nephew, Sourabh, went to their room to call his cousins for breakfast. He noticed that the room where the family lived was locked. “When no one responded, Sourabh alerted his father, Satish, who found the door locked from inside. The father-son duo then looked inside a window and found the family lying dead. They broke open the door and called the cops,” said a senior police officer. Brijendra Yadav, DCP (Outer-North), said, “After we got a call about the deaths, a team reached the spot and found Kumar’s body hanging from the ceiling. His wife and children were lying dead in the same room. There were no external injuries on the children’s bodies. We suspect they were poisoned by Kumar. The bodies were moved to a hospital for an autopsy. We are awaiting the autopsy results to confirm the cause of deaths.” As no suicide note was found in the room, a case of murder was registered by police to probe the matter. Initial probe suggests that Kumar suspected Nikki of having an extramarital affair, which led to frequent arguments between the couple. “The family members said there were issues, but they had no idea that things would turn this ugly. The couple also tried to get separated in the past, but they fought over the custody of the children. A few months ago, Nikki had left Kumar and gone to her parents’ place in Meerut. However, they supposedly resolved their issues and Nikki returned to live with Kumar around two weeks ago,” added the senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/family-of-4-found-dead-police-say-man-may-have-killed-wife-children-before-hanging-self/articleshow/88017324.cms||---

CB submitted in court that it needed him in custody for two more days as the details collected from him and his digital gadgets showed that he was involved in selling synthetic drugs. The court approved the custody application and decided not to consider the bail application filed by Thankachan. CB submitted in court that one of the reasons that led to the accident was Thankachan chasing the ill-fated car. During the party at No.18 Hotel in Fort Kochi, Thankachan had made advances with malicious intentions towards the models but they refused him. When they tried to avoid him by leaving the party, Thankachan relentlessly chased them in his Audi car. This forced Abdul Rahman, the inebriated driver of the ill-fated car, to increase speed, leading to the car crash. CB told in court that Thankachan was a drug addict and was selling synthetic drugs, including MDMA, to several parties held at places like Munnar. The videos and photographs collected from his smartphone showed him using and distributing drugs at parties. Also, the messages in his chats with women on various social media platforms also pointed at his illegal drug business. CB told the court that further investigation was needed to know more about his activities and if he was released on bail, the accused would try to influence witnesses and destroy evidence. The custody petition filed by CB said that in one of his Instagram chats with women; Thankachan was seen boasting of a party in which they had consumed the meat of bison and illicit arrack. The chat also said that the bison was hunted down and the meat was cooked inside the forest. CB said that further probe is needed into Thankachan’s social media accounts with the help of cyber cell. “We will produce him in court on Thursday. Until then interrogation will continue,” said a senior officer, who is part of the investigation. Meanwhile, Kochi commissioner CH Nagaraju said police are looking for complaints from any person who was exploited by Thankachan. A detailed probe will be launched into the accused’s drug dealings and financial resources to lead a luxury life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/syju-sold-synthetic-drugs-at-parties-cb/articleshow/88016681.cms||---

Out of the eight mining leases, five are at Bordem in Bicholim taluka and three in Sattari, including two leases in Pissurlem and one in Poriem. A senior government official said the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) will conduct a detailed study to ascertain the iron ore reserve in these mines, as well as the vegetation around the leases and submit its report to the mines department. “On basis of the report, it would be decided whether to auction these mining leases or not. But the mining leases in Bicholim and Sattari have been tentatively finalised for auctioning,” the official said. All eight mining leases were operational during the Portuguese period, the official said, adding that some of the mining owners had applied for first renewal of their mining leases in 1987 but did not pursue their applications. The official added that some mines had opened but as it was not profitable they did not excavate any iron ore. The official also said that with the help of State Bank of India (SBI), the leases would be put up for auctioning. This would be the first time in the history of Goa that mining leases will be auctioned. The state had formed Goa Mineral Development Corporation to start mining in the state. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese period, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987, after concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 lease-holders had applied for the first renewal of the leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/8-mining-leases-tentatively-set-for-auction/articleshow/88017986.cms||Murari Shetye

About 2,000 tonnes of grains procured from farmers through various direct procurement centres in and around Sirkazhi during the kuruvai season are stocked at the TNCSC storage point on Poompuhar Road in open space. The paddy bags are being stacked and covered by tarpaulins. But rain lashing the region in the last few days caused flooding of the stockyard premises leaving several hundreds of paddy bags drenched, farmers said. TNCSC senior regional manager at Mayiladuthurai, P Pandian, visited the yard and instructed his subordinates to start moving the paddy bags into a safer place. Subsequently, he speeded up the process of draining the rainwater by digging a drain using an earthmover. Pandian told TOI that though rainwater flooded the premises of the stockyard, it did not damage paddy grains much. “Rainwater from the premises has been completely drained. We have taken necessary steps to safeguard the paddy grains from rain and floodwater,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/paddy-stockyard-flooded-near-sirkazhi/articleshow/88016673.cms||---

The civic administration on Tuesday clarified that the official call on reopening of primary schools within Aurangabad municipal limits will be taken on December 10. Ramnath Thore, education officer with the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said, the civic administration has decided to not restart classes for primary students from Wednesday, even if the state government has given a go-ahead for resuming the classes. He said, “The reopening of primary classes has been deferred in the wake of detection of the new variant of Covid-19 and stepped up measures in our country. We have decided to observe the Covid situation for the next few days before taking any final call.” Around 740 primary schools with cumulative strength of 2 lakh students fall under the municipal limits of Aurangabad. Pradnya Tulpule, a parent said, there is no harm in waiting for a few more days. “The Covid-19 is rearing its ugly head in the form of the new variant.

The doctors have maintained the delay has not only caused loss of pay for 1.6 lakh doctors across the country, but has also put and additional burden on the remaining batches. Moreover, in view of a possible third wave keeping an entire batch of the healthcare system could have devastating impact. “T-JUDA stands in accordance with consensus decision of Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) and other states resident doctors associations (RDAs) to hold protest and boycott OPD services from December 1 to December 3 regarding expedition of NEET PG-21 counselling process, provided the Supreme Court hearing happens by the stipulated date of 03-12-2021, beyond which we will have to escalate the protest by boycotting all elective services throughout the state,” the TJUDA said in an official statement. The association said repercussions of this will have to be borne by the government. “Our primary demand is to take necessary measures for expediting NEET-PG counselling as well as admission process and to fast-track the court proceedings on an urgent basis by Union Government and Supreme court of India,” said Dr D Sagar, president TJUDA. “With the possibility of an imminent upcoming Covid wave, it is essential that the counselling process is started at the earliest to prevent collapse of the healthcare system...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jr-docs-to-boycott-outpatient-services/articleshow/88016689.cms||---

In Trichy, airport authorities held separate meetings with higher aviation officials as well as the district administration to ensure proper monitoring. A separate holding area has been demarcated at the terminal building for passengers coming from the “at-risk countries”. Trichy international airport handles flights to Dubai, Sharjah, Kuwait, Colombo, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. The Madurai district administration and health department said all international passengers from countries that reported Omicron variant must undergo two mandatory RT-PCR tests and home quarantine for seven days. Though there are no direct flights to Madurai from countries where Omicron cases have been reported, flights coming in from Dubai will be closely monitored. “As far as Trichy airport is concerned, Singapore is the only country in the ‘at-risk’ category. So, RT-PCR tests and quarantine for all passengers coming from Singapore have been made mandatory. After giving the samples, these passengers will be made to wait at least four to five hours till the results come. A separate security hold area has been established at the terminals,” airport director S Dharmaraj told TOI. For passengers who arrive from other countries, random testing will be conducted at the airport and if anyone is found positive, they will be sent for institutional quarantine, he said. “The district administration has arranged a team of medical staff comprising five to seven members from a private lab for this purpose. It has been decided to complete the process within 30 to 40 minutes for a flight,” he further said.

---||Meerut||Tusker loses battle, bleeds to death in Amangarh reserve||Bijnor: The silence of the night was suddenly shattered by angry trumpets of elephants and they continued all night long in Amangarh Tiger Reserve (ATR). When a foresters team ventured into the reserve on Monday morning, they found a huge patch of what must have been a violent bloody battle that left one bull elephant, about 40 years old, dead. The carcass, lying in a six-foot-deep ditch, bore at least 50 deep gashes and contusions. Blood was splattered all over the area, 10 km from ATR’s guest house inside the dense forest. Corbett National Park is about 1 km from there. Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor DFO, was of the view that the battle could have been between the elephants over dominance or over a mating issue. “Sometimes, an elephant is killed by all members of the herd when it troubles others and causes anarchy,” he added. Patel said Moradabad’s forest conservator, Vijay Singh, inspected the place. The post-mortem was conducted under the supervision of a team from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute of Bareilly. It revealed excessive bleeding as cause of death. The tusker’s viscera was sent to Bareilly for testing. Its denture was preserved while the rest of the carcass was buried, he added. As per norms, the tusks are preserved till permission is granted to burn and destroy them by the higher authorities. The tusks cannot be sold in the market, forest department officials said. The DFO claimed, “The dead elephant sustained many deep gashes and contusions. After losing the battle, it may have tried to flee. That may explain why it fell into a deep ditch and bled to death there.” The forest staff has been put on alert as a herd was sighted near the battle ground, said Patel. Amangarh, a buffer zone of Corbett Park in neighbouring Uttarakhand, is home to at least 102 elephants. Elephant herds freely move about between Amangarh and Corbett as there is no natural barrier. The well maintained waterholes and lush Rohini forests attract elephant herds to ATR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/tusker-loses-battle-bleeds-to-death-in-amangarh-reserve/articleshow/88015772.cms||Harveer Dabas

Nagpur municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B issued a detailed letter and cited the Omicron variant factor as the main reason behind postponing the reopening.Nagpur district collector R Vimala did not issue any separate letter, instead giving her approval for reopening to the education department in an internal file noting. This was a departure from the earlier practice of district collector’s office issuing closing or reopening orders on their letterhead for pretty much everything.NMC, which did issue a letter, mentioned the decision will be reviewed after December 10, and a final call taken on reopening. Lack of information about how dangerous the Omicron variant really is has forced NMC to tread on the side of caution.The day started with utmost certainty that schools in both urban and rural will be reopened. As per sources, NMC even had a draft letter ready for the same. Ultimately, the civic body took the same route as Mumbai and postponed the decision.For rural schools, it was a long drawn drama, which kept academics on tenterhooks. As per sources, the district collector was of the view that no letter needs to be issued for reopening. The collector office’s stand was that since the education department has issued a GR, schools can be reopened directly. This was a big deviation from the regular practice, in which local bodies issued orders on what was to be opened and what was to be closed. Also, an education department video conference meet on Monday had made it clear that officials must take permission from civic body before reopening.This technical tussle dragged on for some time on Tuesday, in which ultimately the collector’s office triumphed. It stuck to its stance of not issuing a separate letter for the permission already granted in internal file, and the local education department had no option but to proceed with its own order.Many parents and academics, who are habituated to seeing reopening orders from local authorities, were a bit taken back. A CBSE school principal said, “Our practice is to forward the district collector’s orders in our parents’ Whatsapp groups, along with our own office notice. Now, with the collector’s letter absent, some parents may wonder if reopening is legit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rural-schools-reopen-today-deferred-in-city-till-dec-10/articleshow/88016694.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The school administration has undertaken cleaning and sanitization of the school premises and various activities have been planned to welcome back the students after lmost more than 18 months. Sandhya Chougale, principal of a school from Shivaji Peth area said, “As per the guidelines received from the state government, all the classrooms and the school premises including the toilets have been sanitized and the benches have been arranged in a way to ensure physical distancing. The students will be given entry only after the thermal temperature screening, sanitization and oximeter checking.” We will be distributing roses to the kids while welcoming them back to the school premises. Also, separate online lectures will be conducted for the students whose parents have not given consent for offline classes.” The parents, meanwhile, are reluctant to send their children to school in the urban areas. However, in the rural parts, the schools are starting full-fledged offline lectures. Bharati Salokhe, a parent from Rukdi village said, “The Covid cases are comparatively less in our village. There are no active cases here. I will send my 9-year-old daughter to school for offline lectures. Until now, the school used to call the students in batches for workshops or practical sessions, so I don't see any problem in sending children for offline lectures. The children are also frustrated sitting at home for the past one and half years, so it is good that schools are resuming offline classes."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/primary-schools-to-reopen-in-kolhapur-rural-areas-to-see-good-attendence/articleshow/88015007.cms||---

The temporary bund constructed across the backwaters for facilitating the work on Vallarpadam railway line is causing waterlogging in many places. Vriksha Paristhithi Samrakshana Samithi, an NGO, has come up with a demand that the district disaster management authority should order for removing the bund as well as the silt and debris of Vallarpadam railway bridge from backwaters at Vaduthala. “We staged a protest near the collectorate a few days ago. Then, we met the district collector. As per the collector, it is up to the railways and the Union government to take a call in this regard. While the state and Union governments engage in a blame game, the people in the areas like Eloor and Vaduthala are at the receiving end. This bund causes flooding in these areas,” said T N Prathapan of Vriksha Paristhithi Samrakshana Samithi. “If the authorities fail to take proper action, we would explore the possibilities of taking legal recourse in the matter,” he said. As per a study conducted by the irrigation department, the bund which was constructed in 2009 for facilitating the work on the railway line to International Container Tran-shipment Terminal (ICTT) at Vallarpadam obstructs the flow of water. It is near Vaduthala Don Bosco Kadavu, which is the confluence point of river Periyar and the backwaters, that the bund had been constructed. The removal of the bund will also help the dredging activities being carried out by Cochin Port Trust (CPT), the study report states. It will also help smooth fishing in the backwaters in the area. The study by the irrigation department also recommends that the DP World, the firm which operates the ICTT, and the contractor who had undertaken the work on the railway line should be made part of the bund removal. The contractor of the railway line had agreed to disband the bund and remove the silt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/call-to-remove-bund-gets-louder/articleshow/88009289.cms||---

When the man, an autorickshaw driver, stepped out for a while, a group of young men started pestering his minor daughter. When the teasing continued his wife called him up and he returned to the auditorium. He confronted the youths and in response they thrashed him and stabbed him with a knife. The man was left with several stitches on his back and wounds all over his body. This horrific experience was that of a man from Panangad and the police were yet to arrest the group led by a youth identified as Jimshad, 22. This is not the first such case that was reported recently. The city has been witnessing a sudden spurt in violence by anti-social elements over the past week. In a similar incident on Saturday, a 38-year-old Panangad native had allegedly stabbed a man for questioning him after he saw him harassing a woman in a bus. The victim had seen the accused harassing the woman and told the conductor about it. The accused then followed him after they got off the bus and stabbed him violently multiple times on his neck and chest near the Vyttila Metro station. Autorickshaw drivers in the area restrained him and handed him over to Maradu police. The accused, Anilkumar, had cases for drug peddling and assault in various police stations. City police commissioner Nagaraju Chakilam said that the issue has come to the attention of the commissionerate and the department was planning to undertake more detentions under the Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention act (Kaapa) to curb such incidents. “Recently, a special drive was launched by the district commissioner of police for checking such persons by summoning them to the police station, opening history-sheets, etc. To curb such violent behaviour, we have been registering non-bailable cases and arresting the accused in almost all the cases by hot pursuit. We are also making it a point to search their locations, seize vehicles and weapons as well,” said the commissioner. Meanwhile, in another case on Sunday, a four-member gang had attacked two guest workers along the side of national highway at Nettoor and brutally attacked the duo with a belt before stealing cash and mobile phone from them. Police are also suspecting whether the clash was part of a fight amongst guest workers. The accused in this case was also on the run. In the latest violent incident, a Ponnarimangalam native woman was hacked with a sharp-edged weapon early on Monday by a distant relative of the woman during an attempted robbery. The woman was staying alone at her house and the accused, Suresh Sukumaran, 40, somehow managed to enter the house. The woman sustained injuries to her head in the attack. Mulavukadu police arrested the accused soon after from an abandoned house. The accused had stolen the woman’s gold chain and Rs 30,000 as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-city-witnesses-sudden-increase-in-violent-crimes/articleshow/88009268.cms||---

The earth station established at BITS Hyderabad will not only support data rates in the order of Mbps but also pave way for testing newer technologies in satellite communications. “India’s efforts in building space technology ecosystem have expedited the opening up of the sector to private players. Research and development is the need of the hour in ensuring efficiency and economically viable solutions for the increasing reliance on space resources,” said Krishna Teja, co-founder of Dhruva Space. The centre is expected to accelerate research into space technology. “The outcome of industry and academia working together will be to bring in new technologies and develop capabilities in creating space assets,” said professor G Sundar, director, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bits-hyd-establishes-sat-com-centre/articleshow/88016692.cms||---

Farmers demanded that monkeys should be declared “vermin as they are the main culprits who destroy their farms”. They also demanded permission for farmers to kill the monkeys who invade their crops and plantations. Farmers said that their demands have been pending for a few years and this has still not been accepted by the government. The memorandum stated that there should be a facility to renew firearm licences of farmers to make it possible to transfer licences from one name to another. They also want the process to be moved online. The farmers also demanded that licences should be issued to any farmer who own more than one acre land. Farmers also said that guns should not be taken away from them even during elections. They also demanded that the government should take the responsibility to ensure that wild animals do not enter fields and the wildlife buffer zone should be reduced to 1km. President of SSM Ashok Joshi said, “For the last several years farmers in Sattari as well as in other talukas of Goa have been troubled by wild animals and their livelihood has become unbearable.” Parab heard their grievances and assured them that he will look into their matter. Joshi also said that the fear of animals has made it dangerous for farmers to go to their own orchards. He demanded that the government must accept all their demands within 10 days, or else the farmers and cultivators will start an agitation as was decided at Sunday's meeting and the government would be held responsible for the consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/resolve-wildlife-issues-declare-monkeys-as-vermin-sattari-farmers/articleshow/88017981.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: After cleanest October, worst November air on record||NEW DELHI: After Delhi recorded the cleanest October, the city saw its worst November air this year since Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) started measuring the air quality index (AQI) in 2015. This November witnessed 11 “severe” air quality days, the highest since 2015. The average AQI was 376, beating the previous record of 374 in 2016. Experts said extended monsoon resulted in high stubble burning counts in the first two weeks of November and meteorological parameters, including low wind speed and low mixing layer height, caused trapping of pollutants from local and regional sources. CPCB’s data shows that before 2021, November in 2016 was the most polluted with an average AQI of 374 and 10 “severe” days. This November saw three periods when AQI stayed “severe” for three consecutive days each. However, the number of monitoring stations in 2021 is nearly four times more than 2016. In contrast to November, 2021 recorded the cleanest October, including a “good” air quality day, since 2015. Track the pollution level in your cityDipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory who analysed the AQI of November for the past few years, said, “November first half is historically critical in all years, but this year, it continued in the second half too. It may be due to depressions in east and western areas, which did not allow free air flow downwards.” TimesViewThe alarming level of pollution underlines the need for comprehensive measures to fight the health hazard. Both short-term measures for immediate relief and long-term planning are needed to make Delhi a liveable city. Unfortunately, every year authorities tend to wake up only when the winter approaches. This needs to change.Saha added, “The emission sources for any defined area more or less remains the same throughout the year. However, the concentration varies with the season. November being the transition phase, the air quality in north India is always problematic because of lowering of atmospheric boundary layer, wind speed, temperature and local action plans implementations.” Historically, he explained, the wind speed of 2m/s or below “creates dangerous situations as it causes accumulation of pollutants, and this year, the wind speed mostly remained below this mark”. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director research and advocacy of Centre for Science and Environment, said, “A combination of calm winter conditions, entrapment of local pollution in the region and the tipping over due to the spike in stubble burning post-Diwali has led to this prolonged severe smog episode.” She pointed out, “This is a grim reminder of the fact that the comprehensive plan for multi-sector action that was notified in 2018 has not been further revised and implemented at scale and speed across all districts of NCR. We cannot fix this problem only with temporary emergency measures.” Meteorological officials said no western disturbance impacted the region this November, which could have given some relief. “When a strong western disturbance affects the region, it causes rain, rise in temperature and wind speed. Usually, one or two western disturbances are recorded in November,” said an official. No rain day was seen this time. According to India Meteorological Department, the city recorded the lowest average monthly maximum temperature in the past eight years at 27.8 degrees Celsius. The normal maximum temperature for November is 28.2 degrees Celsius. The mean monthly minimum temperature was 12.3 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-cleanest-oct-worst-nov-air-on-record/articleshow/88017345.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

While most institutes have decided to continue temperature check at the entrance, many have arranged for doctors on the premises and setting up of isolation facilities. Some colleges have formed committees, comprising professors and HoDs, who will submit a daily health report of students. So far, most institutes had called only the outgoing batches and students with lab-based subjects to campuses. But they have now decided to call more students. At Jadavpur University, BEd and UG1 and PG1 of sociology will attend in-person classes from today. Several others will go to the campus latest by early January. As a precaution, JU authorities have appointed doctors on both its Jadavpur and Salt Lake campuses. One doctor will be available on the premises on weekends to help out boarders. The university has one ambulance and it is planning to procure two more, one of which will be for Salt Lake. “We are following all the government-recommended guidelines and incorporating some measures on our own so that when more students come i, there should not be any problem,” said an official. St Xavier’s College officials have arranged for doctors, along with para medical staff, to be present on the campus round the clock. An ambulance has been kept on standby. “Anyone entering the campus is scanned for temperature. It is mandatory for everyone to follow all the protocols,” said principal Fr Dominic Savio. At Maulana Azad College, physical classes for UG 1 and PG 1 of all subjects will start today. The college has set up a Covid cell, which students can approach if feeling unwell. “We have formed committees that are giving feedback on in-person class progress. We have tied up with doctors,” said principal Subhasis Dutta. At Scottish Church, doctors will be available on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. “We have issued a safety advisory for all,” said principal Madhumanjari Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-ambulances-kept-ready-as-more-students-set-to-return-to-campus/articleshow/88016718.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The accused, Rahul Chaudhary, 30, is a resident of Chachpur village near Baraut town of Baghpat. The arrest was made days after police arrested three Shamli-based men for allegedly selling the leaked papers to aspirants for a hefty price. The STF claimed that Chaudhary has confessed to “procuring the papers from those who were arrested in Shamli.” Circle officer of the Meerut-based field unit of UP STF, Brijesh Singh, said, “Rahul Chaudhary runs a shoe shop located in front of the Vedic College in Baraut. Following a tip-off, we detained him outside his shop and recovered one set of exam papers and six admit cards of UPTET exam, and five admit cards of UP police sub-inspector recruitment exam from him. During preliminary questioning, he named two of his accomplices, Mohd Suleman from Baghpat and Babloo Kumar from Muzaffarnagar. Efforts are on to nab the two.” STF sources informed that accused Rahul, Suleman and Babloo -- booked in Baghpat -- had also tried to hack the server of a Meerut-based examination centre where the UP police sub-inspector recruitment exam was being conducted online. They, however, failed in their attempt because of the presence of officials of the company entrusted with the task of conducting the online test. When asked about the kingpin of the gang and the main source of the paper leak, circle officer Brijesh Singh said, “We are still working to zero in on the real culprit who first got access to the examination papers.” Baghpat police have booked Rahul, Suleman and Babloo under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraud and dishonesty). As of now, the UP STF has arrested as many as 29 suspects from across the state in connection with the paper leak following which the exam was cancelled on Sunday. It has caused massive disappointment to 21,65,181 candidates who travelled considerable distances to reach their examination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/uptet-paper-leak-case-baghpat-man-arrested-2-others-booked/articleshow/88015795.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Nagpur||Leap of delayed faith: 21.16 lakh jabbed in 23 days, 36.25 lakh left unvaxxed in Vid||Nagpur: Set a target on November 7, to achieve over 57.40 lakh first dose coverage among eligible population by November 30, Vidarbha districts were able to achieve 21.16 lakh vaccination by the cut off day. A whopping 36.25 lakh eligible adults from the region failed to take their first dose despite the local authorities adopting a range of lucrative as well as stringent measures. Of these, nearly 25 lakh unvaccinated eligible persons are from Amravati division while 11 lakh are from Nagpur division.Yet, the stupendous performance, at an average of nearly a lakh per day in the region motivated the local administrations to continue with special measures for another fortnight. Though it was evident that the 11 districts, especially those with huge backlogs, would never achieve the herculean task of competing first dose coverage by November 30, the administration stood victorious by removing vaccine hesitancy to a great extent. A vaccination figure of 15 lakh in Amravati division and six lakh in Nagpur division indicates the administration was successful in wining people’s confidence.Now, Yavatmal has replaced Amravati with the highest unvaccinated eligible population at 6.76 lakh. At the start of the special drive three weeks back, Amravati had 10 lakh unvaccinated eligible population while Yavatmal had 9.74 lakh. Amravati division’s backlog stood at 40 lakh while it was over 17.40 lakh in Nagpur’s six districts. Bhandara has the lowest backlog at over 55,000 eligible people.Amravati district had the highest achievement of 4.48 lakh followed by Buldhana 3.92 lakh and Nagpur 3.71 lakh since November 7.Nagpur divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare Verma told TOI the division was able to provide first dose vaccine to over 79.84 lakh people against target of 91.2 lakh. “This is 87% and higher than the state average of 80.7%. All districts in our division, except Gadchiroli, which has its peculiar problems, are doing better than the state average.”She added the administration is aware that over 10 lakh people in the division are yet to get their first dose of vaccine. “We are rigorously implementing ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ drive, night vaccination camps and also trying to operationalise more and more vaccination centres. Along with this, we are also taking help from industry associations, religious leaders, NGOs and youth clubs to vaccinate more and more people. I appeal to people to get their first dose at the earliest.”Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh said, “We are still short of the target and I have asked all my district collectors to push the drive further to complete the first dose target by December 15. This is the target I have set for myself.”He added, “We are still below the state average. Amravati and Washim are close to state average in first dose and Washim is already above state average in the second dose.” Singh ruled out any coercive measures to force people to get vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leap-of-delayed-faith-21-16-lakh-jabbed-in-23-days-36-25-lakh-left-unvaxxed-in-vid/articleshow/88016713.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mamata in town to woo industrialists; meets Aaditya, to talk to Pawar today||Mumbai: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is on a visit to Mumbai, met Shiv Sena leaders, including state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday and is slated to meet NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday.  During her trip, Banerjee plans to meet several top industrialists to attract investments to West Bengal and to invite them to the upcoming Bengal Global Business Summit scheduled for April 2022.  "Jai Maratha, Jai Bangla," she announced after her visit to Siddhivinayak temple. Banerjee said she prayed for chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s recovery from spinal surgery.  “Since the (WB) chief minister is in a bio-bubble, I came to meet her. There is a special relation between chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Mamata didi. There has been coordination between them even during Covid,” said Aaditya Thackeray.  Raut tweeted, “Politics and Bengal-Maharashtra relations were discussed. Maharashtra and Bengal are warring states and will not bow down, she said. It’s always a great pleasure to meet the Tigress of Bengal.”  “Aadityaji welcomed her in Mumbai and discussed several issues from tourism to the film industry. She also inquired about the CM’s health. Mamataji has prayed at Siddhivinayak for UddhavJi’s health,” said Raut.  Banerjee has enjoyed a warm equation with the Sena, especially after it parted ways with the BJP to form the MVA government in Maharashtra. Soon after Banerjee’s TMC swept the West Bengal polls in May this year, Raut was one of the first leaders to congratulate her, calling her the ‘Tigress of Bengal’. Both parties have been very critical of the Modi government, including on issues like fuel price rise, and the farm laws controversy.  While Banerjee is trying to expand the TMC’s national footprint by contesting elections outside West Bengal, the Sena is also hoping to expand its base outside Maharashtra. The Sena got a shot in the arm when Kalaben Delkar won the by-election for the Dadra & Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat early in November. This was the party’s first Lok Sabha seat outside Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mamata-in-town-to-woo-industrialists-meets-aaditya-to-talk-to-pawar-today/articleshow/88018270.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The collective aims to gather children from all backgrounds, irrespective of which school they study in, in a safe and equal space and provide them with requisite facilities and training completely free of cost by experts. The first project under Kalithattu is aimed at promoting reading skills among students and the school has given free access to its knowledge centre library, which has more than 4,000 books, for all the children aged between 6-13 years in the locality. The project, held as a community outreach programme of the school, was launched by Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden at a function attended by Asoka World School CEO Adarsh Kavungal, corporation councillor Seena Gokulan and school principal Lekha Sivasankar on Saturday. Eden spoke to the children about the importance of reading and the role of books. He called the space a “café library”, where children can relax and read while sitting on bean bags. Kavungal said that Kalithattu aims to create new friendships of self-betterment in the neighbourhood. The children can come every working Saturday and borrow any book they want. Or they can use the library between 9.30am and 1.30pm. “The use of internet and other gadgets had deprived students of their passion for reading. Compared to students aged 13 in the 90s, those in 2021 have more quantifiable knowledge due to access to the internet but they lack in-depth knowledge. The current generation’s lack of depth in knowledge and attention span has created huge social issues impacting all spheres of life. This has to change and Kalithattu is designed for that,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-collective-to-nurture-skills-of-schoolchildren/articleshow/88009308.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Grandson slits grandma’s throat for asking him to wear a shirt||NAGPUR: Former government medical officer Devkabai Bobde (78) was allegedly murdered by her 22-year-old grandson Mitesh Pachbhai alias Mayank at her New Nandanvan house on November 27. He slit her throat after she chided him for coming down from his first floor residence to her ground floor house dressed only in a bermuda, without a banyan or shirt. Mitesh, who aspired to go to the US, was arrested by Nandanvan police on Monday. He broke down and confessed after three hours of tactical grilling by cops. After the spine-chilling murder, Mitesh had apparently even called up the US visa consultant, asking whether a Rs60 lakh shortfall in the budget would hamper his chances. Police said Mitesh, an engineering diploma holder, had several scratch marks on his body, suggesting the frail grandmother had tried to put up the feeblest resistance before the gym-trained grandson. He had easily overpowered her, and pushed her down to the floor. Mitesh had gagged Devkabai with a pyjama and tied her hands and legs with packing tape. He then fetched a knife from the kitchen and slit her throat. The scratch marks on Mitesh’s person helped police nail him during interrogation at Nandanvan police station. One of the motives behind the murder was that Mitesh required around Rs1 crore to go to the US to study at Indiana University. He had already arranged Rs40 lakh loan and was asking his grandmother for some money to make up the remaining amount. Police had started concentrating on Mitesh’s possible role after CP Amitesh Kumar came across his chats with a girlfriend on the cellphone, which reflected his deep hatred for the grandma. “The chats revealed he wasn’t happy with the grandma but had to tolerate her chiding. He had even expressed his wish to see her dead. The accused wanted to invite the girlfriend to his house but felt the grandma would tell him parents,” said the CP, adding the scratch marks played a crucial role in nailing the grandson, who had been misleading cops for two days before being outsmarted. It’s learnt Mitesh was also miffed with the grandma as she would repeatedly ask him to take his bed-ridden grandfather for a walk. Devkabai’s body had been discovered at her residence by her eldest daughter Kishori, who is Mitesh’s mother, when she went to meet her before leaving for the ayurvedic clinic she ran with her husband Sanjay. CP Kumar said police were working on four angles (involvement of eldest daughter and her family, role of younger daughter and her family, domestic maids and robbers) simultaneously. “Additional CP Navinchandra Reddy, Zonal DCP Noorul Hasan and DCP crime Chinmay Pandit were grilling the Pachbhai family members separately after we realized one of them could spill the beans,” said the CP, adding the angle of robbery and theft was ruled out as nothing was stolen. The CP had also spotted a video sent by Mitesh to his girlfriend about the murder of 11 persons in Delhi, with their hands tied in front. The CP also said the second line of investigation was also continued through technical evidence. “We had collected the nails of the victim (Devkabai) which had some flesh like material in it, that may have been due to her scratching the accused. Infra-red lights were also used to find blood stains invisible to the eyes on the floor,” said the CP adding Mitesh would also be counselled by experts. Nandanvan police have procured the custody remand of Mitesh till December 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/grandson-slit-grandmas-throat-for-asking-him-to-wear-a-shirt/articleshow/88016725.cms||Soumitra Bose

After the police intervention, the money that she lost from her account got credited back. Police said that the woman searched online for the customer care number of an e-commerce portal to ask about Diwali offers on smart TVs. However, she ended up finding a number of some scamsters posing as customer care staff. The fraudsters who took the call convinced her that there was a good deal on smart TVs. They sent her a link and asked her to fill the form embedded in it. The woman furnished details including her bank account number and UPI id in the form. Then she received a text message and the scamsters asked her to send it to another mobile number. After she complied, the fraudsters used the details that she provided to make three withdrawals of Rs. 25,000 each and another account transfer of Rs. 2,000. The woman soon realised that it was a scam and lodged a complaint with District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick. Rural Cyber police soon found out that the fraudsters had bought gift vouchers for Rs. 50,000 from e-commerce portals and made another purchase for Rs. 25,000 using the victim’s details. The officers then got the transactions frozen and the money got credited back to the victim’s account. Police said that a racket based in northern India was found to be behind the fraud. A team led by cybercrime police station inspector M Latheef, senior civil police officer PM Thalhath, and civil police officers Vikas Mani and PS Aineesh were part of the probe team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/online-fraud-victim-gets-money-back/articleshow/88009330.cms||---

Dr Rajesh Gopal, additional project director of Gujarat State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), said that the program aims at community-based screening, and reaching out to all PL-HIV through technical support. “We are also working on Sampoorna Suraksha Strategy to reach out to the population that doesn’t identify self as high-risk but fall under the category and need supportive services,” he said. How has the pandemic affected PL-HIV? Dr Sanket Mankad, infectious diseases specialist and AIDS consultant, said that the presentation in medical setting has surely got a bit delayed. “But most existing patients were on regular medication and despite their low-immunity status, low mortality rate is reported. However, need of the hour is awareness and timely screening .” tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-to-launch-disha-for-pl-hiv/articleshow/88016721.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||HC directs embassy in Dubai to serve NBW on man for dodging maintenance to wife, son||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued a non-bailable warrant against a man for avoiding regular payment of maintenance to his wife and son for more than six years even after a court order, and directed the Indian embassy in Dubai to serve the NBW on the man. The bench headed by Chief Justice Aravind Kumar issued the NBW after Ajit Nair was not found present in the courtroom and also because he had instructed his lawyer not to represent him in the case any more. In this case, a Dubai court had in 2006 ordered Nair to pay his wife Mini and minor son 1,900 UAE dirhams monthly maintenance. In 2011, as Nair filed a divorce suit, the wife sought interim maintenance claiming that despite the Dubai court’s order, he was not regularly paying the maintenance. The family court ordered Nair to pay Rs 12,000 monthly to his wife and Rs 10,000 to the son. The amount was to be adjusted against the payment made as ordered by the UAE court. The woman was not satisfied and approached the HC, which in 2015, increased the amount to Rs 25,000 for the wife while the amount for the son remained the same. As Nair was allegedly irregular in following the HC order in making payments, the woman sought contempt of court proceedings against him for not paying a total of Rs 6.92 lakh and ignoring court orders. Perusing the case details and the way the man decided to relieve his lawyer, the high court said that the behaviour clearly indicates that the contemnor (husband) was avoiding and evading the court. Even after 6.5 years, the non-compliance with the court order was prima facie a case of contempt and hence a fit case for framing of charges. After issuing the NBW, the CJ said, “It is made clear that in the event of non-execution of the warrant, they will have to issue a lookout notice. The choice is yours if you want to purge the contempt by bringing rokda (cash).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-directs-embassy-in-dubai-to-serve-nbw-on-man-for-dodging-maintenance-to-wife-son/articleshow/88016737.cms||---

The decision comes on the backdrop of the emergence of the new variant of Covid-19, Omicron. Superintendent of police (SP) Sachin Patil said all officers from the 40 police stations spread across the rural district have been instructed to spread awareness among people about the use of masks and maintaining social distancing in public places and also take action against people who are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Strict bandobast has also been maintained at the Ozar airport to keep a check on passengers arriving from other parts of the country. A senior officer from rural police said for more than a year they have been consistently taking action against people without mask all over the rural district. Since the rate of infection has dropped over the past few months, with exception of a few talukas, action against people without mask was slightly relaxed. “However, in view of the emergence of the new Covid-19 variant, it has been decided to intensify the action,” he said. Meanwhile, Patil said it was important that every citizen follows all Covid-related norms so that there is no spread of virus. Earlier this year when the second wave was at its peak, the rural police had maintained strict bandobast at tourist spots in the city to ensure that people were maintaining social distancing and wearing masks.

---||Kochi||Tamil Nadu opens Mullaperiyar shutters at night without warning||IDUKKI: Tamil Nadu has again opened the spillway shutters of Mullaperiyar dam during night without issuing prior warning to Idukki district administration, causing a flood-like situation downstream of the dam. Nine of 13 shutters of the dam were opened between 3am and 8.30am on Tuesday. Following the heavy rainfall in the catchment area the water level had risen to 141.90ft by 9pm on Monday and reached the upper rule level of 142ft at midnight. Soon, TN opened the shutters and released 5,961.16 cusecs of water to Periyar. The TN officials either closed some shutters or reduced the water release later by keeping open only two shutters. However, by 9pm they opened two more shutters as the water level touched the rule curve level. A KSEB dam safety official told TOI that water level reached its allowed level of 142ft at 3.55am. The spill from Mullaperiyar this season was a record of 5,961.16 cusecs on Tuesday. The previous worst surplus in this season was 3,949 cusecs on November 23. Sources said TN had opened the shutters after 10pm three times within a week. Puthenpurakal P N Sebastian, a resident of Vallakkadavu, said that it was an agenda of both the governments to evict the people living downstream areas of Mullaperiyar. “We didn’t get any warning from the officials. Most of us became aware of the issue after the water reached our homes. If more quantity of water was released, it would have caused large-scale damage to life and property,” he said. Sivan, a resident of Churakkualam Aatoram in Vandiperiyar, said that if proper warning was issued on time people could move to safe places. “But the officials failed to inform us on time. If more shutters were opened, my home would have washed away. We had a narrow escape,” he said. Idukki district collector Sheeba George said that the district administration didn’t get any prior information about the opening of Mullapperiyar shutters. “We issue alerts and warnings when Tamil Nadu issues any. The district administration has requested the TN officials several times to inform us about the opening of the dam in advance but to no avail,” she said. Water resources minister Roshy Augustine said that the government would apprise the central water commission, the chairman of Mullaperiyar high-level committee and Tamil Nadu government of the state’s concern over opening of Mullaperiyar dam at night. “TN should avoid water release at night. If the water level reaches 142ft they should release more water during the day time and we hope that the TN government will agree to our request. The opening of dam shutters during night is creating panic among people living downstream,” he said. Meanwhile, former power minister minister and Udumbanchola MLA M M Mani has said that Mullaperiyar dam was a water bomb and the only solution was to construct a new dam. Addressing the indefinite fast of farmers organized by the High Range Samrakshana Samithy at Nedumkandam on Tuesday, Mani said that he had raised the issue in the assembly also.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tamil-nadu-opens-mullaperiyar-shutters-at-night-without-warning/articleshow/88016818.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Delhi||SC: Don’t refuse registration of CNG vehicles in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said, “what have we come to in the name of environment... we are now monitoring registration of motorcycles”, its lament summing a 36-year-long tryst to give Delhi a better environment through numerous orders, including shifting out hazardous industries, fastening emission norms on vehicles and curing fouled waters of Yamuna river. The issue before the green bench comprising Justices L N Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna was a spate of applications by individuals and automobile dealers seeking court orders to register BS IV vehicles which were purchased/sold prior to March 31, 2020, but could not be uploaded on e-Vahan portal because of the Covid pandemic or other reasons. The SC had banned registration of BS IV vehicles in Delhi and NCR after April 1, 2020 when the BS VI norms had kicked in. Amicus curiae A D N Rao pointed out that the Delhi transport department has refused to register CNG-run BS IV vehicles after April 1, even though they met emission norms by running on clean fuel. He said the transport department’s misunderstanding can be gauged from the refusal to register a hearse vehicle bought by Gurudwara Singh Sabha and converted to a CNG-powered vehicle. The bench in its order said, “The registration of CNG vehicles cannot be refused by the authorities as emission from such vehicles are within the permissible limits. In spite of clear orders of the court, the transport authority, because of their inaction to register CNG vehicles, made the applicants approach the Supreme Court. The concerned authorities are directed to register the CNG vehicles.” The court also allowed registration of oxy-trucks, which were gifted by foreign countries to help ease woes regarding transportation of oxygen during the pandemic when patients were gasping for the life-saving gas, even though they met BS-III emission norms. The SC also clarified that vehicles which were sold prior to April 1, 2020 and sales details uploaded in e-Vahan portal must be registered by the transport authorities of all states. However, it directed the authorities to scrutinise documents to ascertain the genuineness of the sale prior to April 1 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-dont-refuse-registration-of-cng-vehicles/articleshow/88017396.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On Tuesday, justice Yashwant Varma posted the plea for December 6, after the petitioner did not appear initially when the case was called. “Please understand, the high court is not a playground and you should desist from using it as one,” the judge advised the petitioner, who appeared when the case was called for hearing once again in the end. The court also asked the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court if he was concerned with the capital’s air quality, as the apex court is already looking into the issue. However, the advocate submitted that he has sought health insurance for himself from the Centre and the AAP government on account of the air quality. In his petition, he has also sought Rs 15 lakh as compensation for “specific and exemplary damages” caused to him. The plea has also claimed that air pollution can also cause serious lung diseases and cancer. It said the SC already expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Constitution of India by holding the “Right to clean pollution-free environment” as a fundamental right.

A chartered account (CA) from Jhunjhunu and a businessman from Ajmer have been arrested in the case. Chartered accountant (CA) Ravindra Kumar, a resident of Jhunjhunu, and Omprakash, a resident of Ajmer, were produced in the court and sent to judicial custody on Monday. The two arrested persons were sent to judicial custody till December 9 and the bail plea of Kumar was rejected on Tuesday. The bail plea of the arrested businessman will be heard on Wednesday. According to officials, based on information received from a bank regarding foreign remittances made by certain firms registered in Jaipur against ‘non-physical imports’, matter was taken up for investigation. Investigations carried out indicated that the said firms are fraudulent and they had undertaken bogus transactions with the help of false certificates provided by the CA. Investigations further revealed that the remittances are likely to have been made against illicit imports of gold and diamonds. Searches were conducted at various premises located at Jaipur, Beawar, Vijaynagar, Surat, Mumbai, Visakhapatanam & Bhubneshwar and M/s Belstar Techno Solutions (OPC) Pvt. Ltd. & and many other firms were found non-existent. These goods were smuggled by businessmen from Gujarat and Mumbai and paid for in Hong Kong and UAE through IT companies existing only on paper in Rajasthan. Prima facie, officials suspect that the gang have made thousands of crores through this racket which involved gold and diamond smuggling. Kumar sent money abroad from 14 branches of 11 banks and had issued 310 remittance certificates. Based on these, payment for smuggled gold and diamonds was sent to Hong Kong and UAE. The two companies from whose accounts the amount of smuggled goods were sent are based in Jaipur. Both the companies have described themselves as IT companies. This payment was shown as those made for IT services. CA had issued remittance certificates to both of their banks. These firms remitted more than 80% of the amount in both the accounts. The firms had filed nil returns. Bank accounts were opened based on documents a senior official of one of the firms. Judicial sources claimed that it is a case of fraud as the accused did not pay tax for the actual goods purchased. Officials remained tight-lipped about further arrests as well as other details of the investigation. The jurisdiction of customs (preventive) commissionerate, Jodhpur (headquartered at Jaipur) extends over the entire state of Rajasthan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tax-evasion-jhunjhunu-cas-bail-petition-rejected/articleshow/88017402.cms||---

While the matter is pending before the high court (HC), Kopargaon MLA Ashutosh Kale, who was appointed chairman of the state’s temple panel, had moved Supreme Court against the HC order and the same was heard on Tuesday. “Until further orders, there shall be stay of the operation of the impugned order(s) passed by the High Court,” the apex court bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said. The SC bench said: “In the meantime, we make it clear that the Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Management Committee shall not take any major policy decisions or financial decisions except for routine expenses for managing day-to-day affairs of the committee.” “It is hereby clarified that pendency of the case would not come in the way of the High Court in disposal of the main matter,” the benche added. Somiran Sharma, who represented Kale in the apex court, told TOI, “The apex court’s stay order means that the state-appointed panel is allowed to take charge and manage the day-to-day affairs of the Sansthan.” In October, the high court, while hearing a couple of petitions, had appointed an ad hoc panel under the principal district and sessions judge of Ahmednagar for managing the affairs of the temple till the time when the state would place a fully appointed committee before the court for its approval. The ad hoc panel has since been working on extensions as the government has yet to give a full list of committee members. The HC had taken an exception to the fact that only 12 out of the 17 members were appointed on the temple panel, while categories of social and economically weaker sections and women were not adequately represented as mandated by the enactment governing the temple affairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sc-stays-hc-order-on-ad-hoc-panel-to-manage-shirdi-temple/articleshow/88015094.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Why new permits restricted to e-autos, SC seeks Delhi govt’s response||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought Delhi’s response to a plea by Bajaj Auto, India's largest three-wheeler manufacturer, challenging the Arvind Kejriwal government’s decision to issue 4,261 new permits only to e-autos allegedly in complete exclusion of CNG-run autorickshaws. The court’s green bench comprising Justices L N Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna sought Delhi’s response within two weeks to the validity of its decision to grant new TSR permits to e-autos even as Bajaj, through senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, said, “The decision tantamounts to an indirect ban on new CNG TSRs, and also amounts to restricting market opportunities to one class of vehicles over another, without rational basis or intelligible differentia (inasmuch as CNG has not been shown to have any environmentally worse profile than e-autos).” The SC, after getting inputs from amicus curiae A D N Rao, said if the issuance of permits had not been finalised, it should not be done till the next hearing. The number of CNG autos, which had served as important moving campaign platforms for AAP in the elections, was capped at one lakh in 2011 through orders of the apex court. It appears to struggle with its self-imposed task ameliorating the air pollution levels in Delhi, which continues to bother its residents. Bajaj said, “A conjoint reading of the SC orders shows that the court never intended to place a cap on numbers of TSRs running on clean fuels, such as CNG and electricity.” It added, “All the concerns expressed by the SC in 1997 with respect to polluting TSRs have come to be fully addressed by ensuring the adoption of clean fuel technologies in both the existing autorickshaws then plying on Delhi roads (through their mandatory conversion to CNG or other clean fuels) and also through new norms for subsequently-introduced autorickshaws (which only adopted CNG/LPG). Therefore, there was no bar against issuance of any number of new permits to TSRs running on CNG/other clean fuels.” The SC by its December 20, 2012 order had permitted registration of 5,000 new autos. “EPCA in its 34th report to the SC on October 27, 2010... had noted that a ‘financier’s mafia’ was artificially pushing up the operational cost of plying autorickshaws, by hoarding the available TSR permits (which had become a scarce commodity). Alarmingly, the report stated over 1,000 new private motor cars/vehicles were being registered in Delhi every day, owing principally to the absence of an integrated multi-modal public transport system and last-mile connectivity options,” it said. “Out of these permits capped at one lakh, around 4,200 to 5,000 permits still remain to be issued, and it is these permits that the Delhi government is now seeking to issue,” Bajaj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-new-permits-restricted-to-e-autos-sc-seeks-govts-response/articleshow/88017422.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Aluva JFCM court remanded Mohammed Suhail, his father Yousuf Said Muhammed and mother Rukhiya into CB custody for three days. Earlier, police had recorded the arrest of the three accused on various charges under IPC Sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). The probe was handed over to the district CB team led by DSP V Rajeev. CB filed a petition in court seeking custody of the accused as their interrogation and further evidence collection was required. “The accused will be interrogated during custody period and their statements will be recorded. We may have to take them to their home in Kothamangalam for evidence collection. Also, their digital gadgets like smartphones and laptops too must be inspected. The three-day custody will be enough to get details,” said sources. Suhail has already surrendered his phone and it may be subjected to forensic examination to retrieve deleted data. Police will also verify the documents, photographs related to Mofiya’s marriage with Suhail. Though the counsel appearing for the accused argued that Suhail’s mother was physically unfit for police custody as she had recently undergone a surgery, the court refused. The court inspected her medical reports and remanded her in custody. Mofiya Parveen (21), allegedly committed suicide in Aluva over the domestic violence and dowry abuse she faced at her husband’s home. The Edayapuram resident was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home on Nov 22. A suicide note recovered from her room said that she had to endure mental torture from her husband, Suhail, and his family. The note also accused inspector CL Sudheer for unprofessional behaviour and he was placed under suspension at a later date, following a departmental enquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mofiyas-hubby-in-laws-in-cb-custody/articleshow/88016837.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Deadline over, but govt hasn’t issued amnesty notification||2014-15 VAT ASSESSMENT Ludhiana: In a reprieve to the state taxation department officials and staff, the November 30 deadline for completing taxpayers’ formalities for assessment of VAT cases for 2014-15 is over. Now the department will start finalising tax and penalties due from the assessees and orders will be sent to them for payment. However, businessmen are furious with the state government for not issuing formal orders or notification about the amnesty scheme announced by chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, as without it they will have to pay full tax liability instead of the 30% announced by the CM. According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fastener Manufacturers’ Association, Ludhiana, “During his visit to Ludhiana on October 27, chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had announced to scrap 40,000 VAT assessment cases and had also said that a one-time settlement scheme (OTS) for 8,000 cases of remaining taxpayers will be rolled out under which they will need to deposit just 30% of the total outstanding tax liability and that too in instalments of 20% in the current year and the remaining next year. It is shocking that even after a month, the state government has failed to issue formal orders for the decisions taken by Channi.”Singla added, “Now with the time for submitting the papers for VAT assessments for 2014-15 over, the tax liabilities will be calculated by the state taxation department and in the absence of the orders about the OTS or the amnesty scheme, the taxpayers will be served notices to pay the full amount. Even the senior officers in the department are not aware when the orders will be issued by the government.” Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, said, “After promising to give us power at Rs 5 per unit and not fulfilling it, the Congress has again made false promises with businessmen on waiving VAT cases. Had the CM been serious about his promise, he would have by now got the department concerned to issue a notification.”Kulpreet Malhotra, executive member of the United Cycle and Parts’ Manufacturers’ Association, said, “As the November 30 deadline is over now, the state tax department will start raising demand for payment of taxes and penalties. The state government must issue an order or notification about the decision of the CM to charge only 30% of the total outstanding liability.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/deadline-over-but-govt-hasnt-issued-amnesty-notification/articleshow/88015913.cms||Mohit Behl

TAVR is the most modern technique which is done under local anesthesia on patients with narrowing of aortic heart valve. A 65-year-old had severe narrowing of the heart’s most important valve, the aortic valve. With TAVI, doctors operated upon the patient. “The patient reached the hospital’s emergency with shortness of breath and chest pain. When his 2D echo test was done, it was found that the pumping capacity of his heart was only 30 to 35 per cent and the valve was also contracted. The patient was suffering from severe aortic stenosis. First, the blockage of both the heat arteries were treated by angioplasty. The doctors decided to replace the valve with the TAVI technique,” said Dr Rudradev Pandey, senior intervention cardiologist at CK Birla Hospital. A 74-year-old housewife from Jodhpur was well till two years ago. Then gradually she started feeling out of breath while climbing stairs. “A 2D echocardiography showed severe aortic stenosis. We performed TAVR. After undergoing TAVR smoothly, she stayed in ICU for a day. In TAVR, the aortic valve is placed in place of defective valve under local anesthesia, said Dr Rao, chairman, RHL heart centre, Jaipur..SMS Hospital has also conducted TAVI recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tavi-alternative-to-open-heart-surgery-in-city-now/articleshow/88017415.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Killer neighbour had tried to take girl’s brother along too||DILROZE MURDERLudhiana: Two days after Neelam, a resident of Shimlapuri, killed her neighbour’s two-year-old daughter, the girl’s kin are yet to come to terms with the incident as both the families had close and cordial relations for years. In fact, victim Dilroze used to address Neelam as bua (father’s sister). On Tuesday, Dilroze’s family immersed her ashes at Kiratpur Sahib in Ropar.The girl’s family said on the fateful day, November 28, Neelam had also tried to take Dilroze’s elder brother Agampreet Singh, 5, along on the pretext of buying him candies, but he refused to accompany her. Thereafter, she took Dilroze along with her and killed her.Dilroze’s father constable Harpreet Singh said, “I am unable to believe that Neelam has brutally killed my daughter. Our families have had cordial relations for a long time. I don’t understand why she did this.”On if he had scolded Neelam’s children, Harpreet said, “There has never been an issue between us. I had once stopped her children from bursting crackers near my car. Now, I want justice and strict punishment for Neelam.”Dilroze’s grandfather Shaminder Singh said, “My grandson Agampreet told me that when he was standing outside the house, Neelam had asked him to come with her while promising to get him candies. As he refused, Neelam took Dilroze along. Neelam wanted to harm both our children.”“I have lost my granddaughter, who was so dear to me. I don’t know why Neelam did this. I can remember only two things that could have made her angry. One was the parking issue. The locality lanes are congested and Neelam used to park her scooter behind Harpreet’s car. Every morning when Harpreet used to go to work, Neelam had to remove her scooter to clear the way. The other was, a few months ago I had complained to Neelam’s father about her due to which she got angry. But I do not know if these were the reasons that made her kill Dilroze,” added Shaminder.He said, “About four months ago, when Neelam’s sister-in-law (brother’s wife) had an issue with the family and left the house, we stood by them. During kanjak puja, Neelam and her family used to take Dilroze for the puja by showering flowers on her. In fact, Neelam’s son used to stay at our house the whole day and play with us. Dilroze and Agampreet used to call Neelam bua.” ADCP-II Balwinder Singh Randhawa said, “Neelam is saying same thing that Dilroze’s family was not treating her and her children well. She says at times Dilroze and his brother would play with her and her sons and she would bring candies for them. However, for the past some time she had this perception that the family is targeting her. We are not convinced with her statement, but she said nothing else during interrogation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/killer-neighbour-had-tried-to-take-girls-brother-along-too/articleshow/88015928.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Kochi||Tribespeople want scientific study||Palakkad: The tribespeople of Attapadi have demanded the government for a scientific study into each infant death there to find the root cause and a lasting solution to the problem. Tribal activist KA Ramu said that the government never considered the views of the tribespeople over their problems and requirements. A retired health department official and tribal activist TR Chandran said that excluding the tribal community from decision-making processes on the health system resulted in a lack of belongingness. “Many studies were conducted on the health system, tribal infant deaths and the deaths due to sickle cell anaemia, a genetic disorder among tribespeople. But the recommendations of these studies were never considered” he said. A research study by Mathew Sunil George, Rachel Davey and others published in ‘International Journal for Equity in Health’ recently said, “Indigenous communities in Attapadi continue to experience poor access to healthcare in spite of both financial protection and adequate coverage of health services. The failure to provide culturally respectful care, the discrimination of the community at healthcare facilities, the centralization of delivery of services as well as lack of power on the part of indigenous community to negotiate with the health system for services that were less disruptive for their lives were identified as the barriers to improving health systems.” “Heathcare should be culturally safe, locally relevant and with the active involvement of the community at all stage of the intervention,” the study added. A six-member medical expert committee headed by Dr B Ekbal, public health activist and neurosurgeon, was constituted by CPM to study the infant deaths due to malnutrition in Attapadi. The report submitted to CPM on May 23, 2013, said, “Neglect of the critical health situation of tribal mothers and children over the years and the disinterest shown to it by society and the criminal neglect on the part of government authorities are evidence to show that the tribal population in Attappadi is facing a silent genocide that will wipe out their population in a few decades.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribespeople-want-scientific-study/articleshow/88016852.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Assault on lawyer: Court lets off former Delhi HC bar association president with Rs 40,000 fine||NEW DELHI: A city court on Tuesday let off former Delhi High Court Bar Association president Rajiv Khosla, convicted for assaulting a woman lawyer in 1994, while directing him to pay a fine of Rs 40,000 to the state and the victim. Khosla was convicted on October 29 for the offences punishable under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. Complainant Sujata Kohli, who was a lawyer then, had alleged that on July 29, 1994, Khosla asked her to join a seminar on proposed ‘family courts’ but she said she was busy. The complainant further claimed that she was threatened with withdrawal of all facilities provided by the Bar Association. A civil suit was filed by Kohli, who retired as district and sessions judge last year, seeking appropriate injunction but her table and chair were removed from the spot. She further alleged that on August 5, Khosla, along with a mob of lawyers, came and assaulted her. Chief metropolitan magistrate Gajender Singh Nagar said that the court was of the opinion, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of offence, that is simple hurt, and the fact that the convict is an old aged person who has never been convicted in any other case, it would be expedient that he be released after due admonition. “The convict who is aged about 65 years old has for the first time been convicted for an offence, which was committed by him 27 years ago, thus this is a mitigating factor to be considered at the time of deciding the punishment,” the court stated. The court further said that in the present matter, the convict, despite being a member of the bar association and an officer of the court, assaulted a lady bar member in the presence of a number of lawyers, which is definitely an aggravating factor. It directed him to pay a total fine of Rs 40,000, which was to be paid to the state and the complainant equally. It directed him to pay the fine within one month. “The frivolous and baseless imputations made on court by the convict, orally and in written arguments, do not deserve even an explanation or reply from the court,” the court said in the order. Before the order was pronounced, hundreds of lawyers thronged the courtroom, shouting slogans for Khosla. Kohli, who appeared through videoconferencing, claimed that the convict was repeatedly reflecting that he loves to abuse the court. Khosla’s lawyer denied the allegations and said that his client neither used unparliamentary language in the court nor threatened her or tampered with the witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/assault-on-lawyer-court-lets-off-former-hc-bar-association-prez-with-rs-40k-fine/articleshow/88017485.cms||---

Barely 50,687 have taken the first dose and 30,402 both. It means just 20% of 2.5 lakh people living on antiretroviral medicines have taken the first shot and 12% have taken both shots. An official from Maharashtra State Aids Control Society said the actual number could be higher as the vaccination status doesn’t get reported to antiretroviral centres in real time. “Some patients come to pick up their medicines once in three months and that’s when their status is updated,” said the official. National Aids Control Organisation experts had said said vaccines are safe for HIV patients. Many, though, still fear it. There are practical issues too. Eldred Tellis, who runs a programme for intravenous drug users, said out of 600 in their care, less than 50 have got the jabs. “The prime reason is lack of ID documents such as Aadhar,” he said, adding when his NGO approached the BMC, he was asked to bring 200 of them to Bandra. “That was not feasible.” Civic officials said they have facilitated jabs for 6,500 without ID.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/just-20-of-hiv-patients-have-taken-1st-shot-in-state/articleshow/88018655.cms||---
---||Kochi||Water Metro project runs into environmental hurdle||Kochi: Kochi Water Metro project has run into troubled waters with the Metro authorities failing to give satisfactory reply to Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) regarding the construction of its terminal near the High Court. The stand adopted by KCZMA has delayed the Water Metro project which is already running behind schedule. There were complaints that the Water Metro authorities reclaimed the backwaters in CRZ limits without permission to facilitate the constriction of the High Court jetty. After going through the complaints, the KCZMA had asked the Metro authorities to submit a report in this regard. “The report submitted by Kochi Water Metro Ltd general manager is not satisfactory and is silent on the compliance of conditions mentioned in the CRZ clearance and environmental clearance,” the KCZMA states in its minutes of the meeting held on November 8, 2021. According to the KZCMA, it had put certain conditions while granting environmental clearance for the Water Metro project. One of the conditions was that the proposed jetty at Elankunnapuzha lies in the vicinity of mangrove buffer zone (CRZ1A) and so it should be altered. Another condition was that the dumping of dredging materials in the CRZ area at Varapuzha will not be allowed. The third condition was that the height of the proposed building shall not exceed nine metre. But the compliance report of these conditions, which is mandatory, has not been submitted by the project proponent, i.e. Water Metro authorities, to KCZMA. K G Prathapa Simhan, a lawyer, who had moved the petition before the KCZMA said: “The KCZMA and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) hadn’t given nod for the Water Metro authorities to reclaim backwaters. These agencies gave the nod for constructing a boathouse. For constructing a boathouse, it doesn’t require reclamation of a large extent of the backwaters. We also moved the high court pleading that such a structure should not be allowed in the reclaimed land,” Simhan said. Though the high court ordered the MoEFCC to examine the allegation in the complaint, the petitioners moved the apex court praying that the structure should be demolished. “Now, we are waiting for the Supreme Court order,” Simhan said. According to the petitioners, the Metro authorities are constructing a multi-storeyed structure under the cover of the boathouse at High Court jetty. The Water Metro authorities told TOI that they had got the environmental clearance for the project in 2019. They also said that a petition filed regarding the same matter had already been disposed of by the KZCMA in favour of the Metro agency. They also said that they haven’t got the minutes of the latest meeting of the KCZMA. As per the original schedule, the first phase of the Rs 747 crore Water Metro project should have been commissioned in 2019. Later, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had inaugurated the first Water Metro terminal at Vyttila in February 2021. Still, no service has been started. The latest plan is to start the first phase connecting six terminals by December 2021. But, it is sure that the Water Metro would fail to meet yet another deadline due to multiple reasons, including the dispute over reclamation of backwaters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-metro-project-runs-into-environmental-hurdle/articleshow/88009551.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Locals say that major areas -- like Dilaram Chowk, Jakhan, several parts of the Rajpur Road, Defence Colony -- do not have proper street lighting. On Monday, several city councillors protested at the Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) office to highlight the issue of non-working streetlights. “We have been raising this concern for a while now but to no avail. Several accidents take place during nighttime due to the absence of streetlights. If the issue is not addressed soon, public safety will continue to remain at risk,” said Bhupendra Singh Kathait, a city councillor. Residents of the city claim that some of the streetlights don’t even have bulbs. “We have security cameras but they don’t even capture anything due to the defunct streetlights near our house. We have put in so many complaints over the years but there have never been any clear answers from the authorities,” said Rajendra Mathur, a senior citizen. Notably, the civic body has outsourced the maintenance and upkeep of the lights to a third-party company. When asked about the issue, Rohitash Sharma, deputy municipal commissioner, told TOI, “We have taken cognisance of the issue and have sent a notice to the company in this regard. They have been asked to put in at least 2,500 new lights across the city this week itself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/despite-complaints-defunct-streetlights-yet-to-be-repaired-in-doon/articleshow/88016002.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The plastic waste was removed after two-and-a-half-hour long surgery. A local non-governmental organisation had brought the sick cow to the veterinary hospital in Anand. “When we operated upon the cow, our team removed 77 kg of plastic waste. The waste included ice cream cups, spoons and other plastic waste that people simply dump on the roadside or throw away after consuming their meals,” Dr Pinesh Parikh, professor and head of the Department of Veterinary and Radiology at veterinary college affiliated to Kamdhenu University in Anand. The veterinary hospital gets 3 to 4 cases every week of stray cows which fall sick after consuming plastic waste from roadside garbage dumps or in the open. “Each time, the waste varies from 10 kg to even 55-60 kg. We have even come across cases where cows have accidentally consumed plastic ropes that people usually throw away or dump on the roadside,” he said. Parikh said that the stray cattle often accidentally consume plastic which enters their stomach because of which the cattle develops problem of indigestion. “Eventually, their digestion power reduces, and the animal becomes sick. It starts affecting their health and at times they also die because of the plastic waste,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/77kg-of-plastic-material-removed-from-cows-stomach/articleshow/88015837.cms||---

The event was organized in the wake of Aurangabad improving its ranking in Swachh Survekshan — annual cleanliness survey of cities carried out by the central government.

Their untiring services has led to Aurangabad improving its ranking in Swachh Survekshan,” he said. Responding to the felicitation, sanitation workers shared their experiences of segregation of waste at source by citizens and other aspects of garbage collection. “The citizens also have to pay a critical role in ensuring sustainable sold waste management system. At their end, citizens should segregate dry and wet garbage separately and avoid dumping of waste in the open,” Gajanan Landge, a sanitation worker, said. Aurangabad bettered its rank to 6th in the state and 22 in the country in Swachh Survekshan, the results for which were announced recently. The city also received Gold category for improved segregation and processing of the solid municipal waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/shiv-sena-felicitates-sanitation-staff-of-amc/articleshow/88015134.cms||---

Until now, more than 7,585 workers have been suspended by MSRTC across the state. “We are ready to face any situation. The state is playing the suspension and termination card to force people to get back to work and it is taking a mental and physical toll on many,” said an employee. “We have no information on today’s incident. Many are still on strike. The number of workers joining is slowly increasing, which is encouraging,” said a Pune division official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/msrtc-employee-on-strike-admitted-to-hosp-after-getting-suspension-notice/articleshow/88016853.cms||Joy Sengupta

The court also quashed the July 14 order of parole committee that said no to the permanent parole to the convict. A division bench comprising Justice Prakash Gupta and Justice Uma Shankar Vyas while granting the permanent parole said if during the permanent parole the convict involves in unwanted activities, he will be made to complete his life imprisonment again. Singh, who has been lodged in the jail for the past 15 years, claimed he never jumped parole when he was granted it during the first and second waves of Covid. Singh also maintained that he had never misused the parole. Earlier, the parole committee had rejected his plea saying he is a convict in the kidnapping case of Rajendra Mirdha and therefore can’t be granted permanent parole. It may be recalled that Rajendra Mirdha, son of former Union minister Ramniwas Mirdha, was kidnapped on February 17, 2005 from C-Scheme situated residence. At that time, the Khalistan Liberation Front had taken the responsibility and had asked for the release of their head Devendra Pal Bhullar. Thereafter, Singh was arrested by the Punjab police in 2004 and was handed over to Rajasthan police in 2007. On October 6, 2017 Harnek was awarded life imprisonment. Daya Singh Lahoria, Harnek Singh and Navneet Kadiya were among those who had hatched the conspiracy and executed it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mirdha-kidnap-convict-gets-permanent-parole/articleshow/88017435.cms||---

The Dighi police registered two separate cases against the arrested and the booked men. A case of rioting, voluntarily causing hurt and mischief was registered against them under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), while another case of dacoity was registered against them, too. Those arrested were identified as Sangramsingh Badha, Surjitsingh Badha, Gajalsingh Badha, and Ajaysingh Tak, all residents of Dighi, all of whom are part of one group. Police said the incident resulted out of a rivalry between two groups over the control of pigeonholes in their locality. The arrested men first set ablaze some pigeonholes in which some pigeons were killed and then damaged the several scooters and motorcycles parked on the road using sharp weapons, police said. The damaged vehicles belong to local residents and are not related to either of the groups. The vandalism was captured by CCTV cameras of private establishments. At the time of the incident, local resident Hrishikesh Walke (22), who runs a milk business in the same area, was at home. When he heard the nouse, he rushed out and attempted to stop the men. However, they charged at Walke and assaulted him with a weapon, leaving him with injuries on his hands. Later, Walke lodged a police complaint. The suspects further assaulted and robbed a motorcycle rider, Sandeep Uddhav Tigalpillai (35). Cops said Tigalpillai was returning home when the suspects were on their rampage. They grabbed him and hit him on his leg with a rod, and also robbed Rs2,800 in cash from his pocket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/15-two-wheelers-vandalised-police-arrest-4-book-8/articleshow/88016861.cms||---

Once the project is commissioned, it will recreate the tourism map of Kochi, thereby alluring more tourists to Kochi. Though Kochi has 1,100-km-long waterways in total, only 40-km is considered navigable due to various reasons. Once the Water Metro becomes a reality, around 78-km of backwaters will be the total length of its routes. As per plan, there will be 15 routes connecting 38 jetties. Ten isles surrounding Kochi will be connected to the mainland when the water metro project is operational. The plan is to ply boats at an interval of 10-15 minutes during peak hours. Besides, the Water Metro plans to provide feeder services, both in isles and on the mainland. This will ensure seamless connectivity for the islanders. Easy access to the mainland will provide them with better employment and other means of income. The Water Metro project envisages overall development of the islands. Well-lit streets, widening and development of roads in the islands, promoting property development around jetties, etc, are other plans to be carried out in the islands. Frequent and cheaper transport systems will enhance the footfall of tourists in the islands by many folds. The scenic beauty of the backwaters and the pristine islands would certainly attract tourists, especially foreigners. Presently, the tourism potential of the islands remains untapped, thanks to poor connectivity. As per a survey conducted by the metro authorities, around one lakh islanders are expected to benefit from the project, thus paving the way for an overall development of the islands. Decreasing pollution is another benefit of the Water Metro project. The metro authorities plan to introduce 78 hybrid electric boats. This would reduce the carbon emission and subsequent pollution. The metro authorities plan to select eco-friendly vehicles as feeder services too. Besides Water Metro’s fleet, four more vessels will also be inducted for rescue services and maintenance purposes. German funding agency KfW is expected to fund the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-metro-to-help-augment-infra-development-of-islands/articleshow/88009560.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Only 26,491 cases were detected in Maharashtra in November as opposed to 2.5 times this monthly tally detected on some single day in April at the peak of the second wave.  Cases dropped by 55% from October (58,750) to November. Exactly a year back, when the first wave had declined, the state had recorded 1.39 lakh cases in November 2020. A similar pattern was apparent in Mumbai: 6,827 cases were detected in November as against 12,842 in October.  “We can now clearly say that the first and second waves are over. The thinning of the ‘thick tail’ in Maharashtra and Mumbai is complete, and we are staring at endemicity or Covid-secure place provided there is no disruption caused by a new variant or people's lax behaviour or both,'' said Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government's task force on Covid-19.  Even mortality has been 30% low in November as compared to October (1129). The state recorded 781 deaths, including 89 in Mumbai, in November. “The vaccination drive has clearly shown an impact on morbidity and mortality trends in the city,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. On the last day of the month, the state registered 678 cases — a rise from 536 cases on Monday — and 35 deaths. The total tally in the state is now 66.35 lakh, which is higher than caseload in many countries (except eight).  In Mumbai, 180 cases were registered as against 110 on Monday. Only two deaths were registered on Monday, taking the overall toll to 16,336 in the city. The total caseload in Mumbai is 7.6 lakh so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-records-its-lowest-monthly-tally-in-19-months/articleshow/88017466.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Concrete road runs through mangrove patch in Malad||MUMBAI: A cement concrete road has come up right amid the mangroves behind Jankalyan Nagar in Malad West. Activists and local residents say massive cutting of mangroves has been underway at various places since early this month in Malad West, even as the BMC, police and the collector’s office refuse to act upon complaints. Advocate Godfrey Pimenta said the land mafia has destroyed large tracts of mangroves at Marve near INS Hamla. “Despite filing repeated complaints, the Malwani police, as well as the mangrove cell, has failed to take action against the offenders. We demand stringent application of MCOCA against those destroying the environment," he said. Virendra Tiwari, chief conservator at the mangrove conservation cell, said if the area is a reserved forest, the cell will immediately take action. “If it is not reserved forest then we shall have to inform the police and the collector’s office to initiate action to stop the dumping and destruction of mangroves,” he said. Tiwari said it is the responsibility of the BMC to remove all the dumped debris and then the conservation cell can restore the mangroves. “The Bombay high court order is clear that it is the BMC that has to remove the debris and the state government will pay for it. We have been holding discussions with the civic body on clearing of debris at numerous other sites so that restoration work can be carried out. If the BMC were to provide JCBs and dumpers we can provide the funds,” he said. A large slum, Ambujwadi, has come up in Malad West by land-filling in the mangrove areas. Local residents said, on condition of anonymity, that those carrying out the dumping enjoy political patronage. “The modus operandi is to reclaim land and settle slums on them. No amount of complaining is having any effect on the illegal work,” said a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-concrete-road-runs-through-mangrove-patch-in-malad/articleshow/88018668.cms||Clara Lewis

In contrast, crude oil output dipped with fertiliser barely seeing any rise, and steel & electricity being the other laggards. The core sector industries had witnessed a 0.5% fall in October 2020.  The numbers, however, point to a slowdown in sectors such as auto, as steel production has slowed to 0.9%, while a 14.5% growth in the cement sector indicates strong demand from construction. In recent months, the government is seeking to speed up capital spending to boost demand for these goods. But economists warned of a slowdown in the coming months. “With a mixed trend displayed by most early indicators that are available for November 2021, we expect the core sector growth to slip to under 5% for this month,” said ICRA chief economist Aditi Nayar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/8-core-sectors-post-7-5-growth-in-october/articleshow/88018603.cms||---

The collector held a meeting of the organising committee to decide on ways to ensure that the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan — being held between December 3 and 5 — went off without any adverse incident in terms of Covid-19 infection. “We have decided to have a separate entrance for those who have the full vaccination certificate with primary health checks. Those who have not taken any vaccine or are due for the second dose will be offered the same at the venue and allowed entry after health checks,” Mandhare said. The organiser will have a set-up to administer the vaccine shots to any unvaccinated person who comes to the venue — so that not having a vaccine shot does not become a reason for someone to miss the sammelan. “We will make sure that the person is administered the proper vaccine dose. Such visitors need to have their mobile phone and personal identity cards, which are required for registration on the CoWIN application for vaccination purposes, ready with them,” said Dr Prashant Bhutada, the head committee of the sammelan. As far as the delegates and visitors are concerned, health screening, including body temperature checks, will be carried out at the venue’s entry. They will also be checked for symptoms, and necessary steps would be taken accordingly. However, those who are participating in any of the events and who have to access the stage will compulsorily have to undergo the rapid antigen tests before going on the stage. The collector has requested people not to visit the sammelan if they are unwell. He said if such visitors test positive, they could be institutionally quarantined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-collector-for-separate-entry-for-fully-vaccinated-visitors-to-literary-fest/articleshow/88014226.cms||Abhilash Botekar

She was hospitalized and was under treatment from August 17 to December 16. She applied for special disability leave as per rules 97 and 98 of Kerala Service Rules (KSR). When her claim was rejected by the government, she approached the high court. A single bench asked the government to reconsider her application but the government rejected the plea again by stating that the injury suffered by the petitioner could not be seen as either caused in or in consequence of the due performance of her official duties. The division bench said it cannot accept the government’s contention and said the rules cannot be interpreted in a narrow and pedantic fashion so as to exclude a person who was admittedly an employee who was traveling from her residence to the place of work at the time when the accident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-govt-staff-eligible-for-special-leave/articleshow/88016875.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Institutional quarantine for flyers from at-risk nations||MUMBAI: In the backdrop of rising concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced stricter curbs on air travel for all international passengers, from both at-risk and other countries, arriving in the state and even domestic passengers flying in from other states. The curbs are over and above travel guidelines the Centre had issued a few days ago. According to the order, all international passengers arriving from at-risk countries (declared by the Centre) will have to undergo a mandatory seven-day institutional quarantine and they will be tested on the second, fourth and seventh day. If they are found to be positive, they will be shifted to a hospital and if negative, they will have to continue in home quarantine for the next seven days. The guidelines issued by the Centre had suggested a seven-day home quarantine for passengers from at-risk countries if they test negative on arrival and they were to take a retest on the eighth day. Passengers flying into Maharashtra from other states will have to carry a negative RT-PCR report with a validity of 48 hours, irrespective of their vaccination status. So far, domestic passengers who are fully vaccinated did not require an RT-PCR report. Passengers travelling within the state, though, will not need an RT-PCR negative report if fully vaccinated; if not, they will need one with a 48-hour validity.  Maharashtra has mandated international passengers from other countries to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR at the airport on arrival and on being found negative, to undergo 14 days of home quarantine. If found positive, they will be shifted to a hospital. “In case of an international passenger having a connecting flight to any other airport in India (without leaving the airport at all), the passenger shall undergo an RT-PCR test at the first arrival airport in Maharashtra and only on being found negative will he be allowed to board the connecting flight,” said the order by chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty. In case a passenger is entering the state via a connecting flight from any other airport in the country, he will be subject to quarantine rules as for other international passengers. The state has also issued guidelines for airport authorities. Passengers arriving from at-risk countries must be deplaned on priority and separate counters have to set up for their checking. DCP immigration and FRRO will draft a proforma of declaration for all arriving passengers on international flights to declare details of the countries visited in last 15 days. Incorrect information furnished by passengers will lead to action under sections of Disaster Management Act, 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-institutional-quarantine-for-flyers-from-at-risk-nations/articleshow/88017479.cms||---

The association sent 2.5 tonnes of pineapple in Delhi-bound Nizamuddin Express from Ernakulam Junction railway station on Wednesday. According to James George Thottumariyil, president of the association, the consignment is sent to Diem Agro LLP, an agri-business startup incubated at Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar and funded by RKVY-RAFTAAR scheme under the ministry of agriculture, Govt of India. The startup, co-promoted by Bibin Manuel, is developing online marketplace for fruit and vegetable farmers to market their produce to interstate buyers, especially for pineapple farmers in Kerala. Earlier on Wednesday, the first consignment was flagged off from All Kerala Pineapple Farmers’ headquarters at Vazhakulam to Kochi by Thottumariiyil, member of association director board Sunil George Kodamulli, association joint secretary Josekutty V M Vettiyankal, Diem Agro LLP managing partner Bibin Manuel and association vice-president Antony P P Vettiyankal. It was seen off by chief commercial inspector Arun Kumar R, deputy station master, Southern Railway, Ganesh Venkadachalam, and area manager Nithin Norbert. “Normally, pineapple is being sent to north India, one of the largest markets for the tropical fruit, by road in trucks, which take five days to reach Delhi while by rail, it will reach in 50 hours,” Thottumariyil said. “Thus, we can offer fresher fruits this time to the market and if the experiment succeeds, we have big plans to send bigger consignments regularly,” he said. He also said the association received tremendous support from state horticulture mission, Kerala, and the department of railways to make this happen. “Kisan Rail, which was launched on August 2020, was in touch with us for sending the fruits by rail and when the right time came, we took up the task,” he said. Thottumariyil said the GI-tagged Vazhakulam pineapple is always getting attractive trade queries from north India and state horticulture mission and the railways have offered attractive incentives to send bigger consignments. “In this background, if the first assignment which reaches the market earlier on Friday evinces good response, we expect to do more business via the rails,” he added. He also said they have used the same carton packing as used while sending the product by air while on trucks, they normally use bulk packing. “Carton packing is better for the fruit to reach fresher and with least damage,” he said. Presently, farmers in Kerala cultivate pineapple in around 18,000 hectares and produce 5.5 lakh tonnes of the fruit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pineapple-farmers-take-rail-route-to-delhi/articleshow/88009588.cms||---

Around 81% of the women in the age group have risk waist to hip ratio, meaning they have more fat around waist and are at higher risk of diseases like heart ailments or diabetes.As per the NFHS-5 report, the percentage of 15-49-year-old women in the district who are overweight with body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m2 is 45.1. The value puts Ludhiana at fifth spot in the state. SAS Nagar is at the top of the state chart with 48.9% obese women and Jalandhar is second (48.3). Muktsar district has the lowest percentage of 30.8%. In the previous report of 2015-16, Ludhiana’s percentage was 35.5. Therefore, there has been an increase of 9.6% in the past five years. The data shows that Jalandhar district recorded the highest increase of 21.4 in the percentage of obese women in the state; followed by Faridkot (14.9%) and Bathinda (13.7%).The report states that 80.8% of the women in Ludhiana had risk waist to hip ratio of >0.85% in 2020-21. The percentage puts Ludhiana at fourth spot in Punjab. Pathankot has the highest such percentage at 84.7, followed by Gurdaspur (82.6%). Fazilka has the lowest percentage of 63.3%.The health experts said the results of the survey were worrying. Dr Bimal Kanish, president elect of Ludhiana IMA, said, “Obesity was there in children, then it reached adults and now women. There is a saying in Punjab, dabb ke wa, raj ke kha (work hard and eat to heart’s content). Since the lifestyle has changed to sedentary, it is causing the problems of obesity, which is a precursor to diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. High waist to hip ratio is also because of similar reasons. As Ludhiana is an industrial hub, people are financially sound and so many have sedentary lifestyle and eat fast-food.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/about-half-of-district-women-in-15-49-age-group-are-obese/articleshow/88016054.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Nagpur||Maha decision to restore OBC quota in local bodies challenged in HC||Nagpur: The ordinances promulgated by Maharashtra government to restore reservation for other backward classes (OBCs) in zilla parishad and local body polls has been challenged in the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court. Petitioner Vikas Gawli, through counsel Akshay Naik, contended that the Supreme Court had already quashed OBC reservation in local bodies as it was exceeding the upper limit of 50%. This had led to bypolls as the apex court ruling had nullified the results of earlier polls held to elect members of many zilla parishad and panchayat samitis. A division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Anil Pansare on Tuesday issued notices to Maharashtra government and others asking them to file a reply by December 4. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had on September 23 and October 1 passed ordinances for restoring the reservation. Through these, the government had amended the Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act, 1965, Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959, Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1988, and Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, providing 27% reservation to the OBCs, subject to 50% ceiling. The petitioner contended that the reservation was not granted as per the apex court’s directives. The Supreme Court had directed that the reservation should be decided on the basis of its report by setting up a commission and based on empirical data. The state’s ordinances provide for reservation to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities based on their population in the particular local bodies. However, the OBCs were getting direct 27% reservation as their population data was unavailable and their last enumeration was conducted in 1931 by the British government. Therefore, there are many districts in the state where the combined reservation of all the communities exceeds the 50% ceiling, said the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/maha-decision-to-restore-obc-quota-in-local-bodies-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/88016876.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The woman, Priyavandana Kosambia’s father, Arvind Parmar found her hanging from the fan while her son Rishabh alias Rishu was lying on the floor. Parmar forced the door open when she did not respond despite him knocking several times at around 830am. They lived in Mindhora Apartment. Parmar immediately called 108 emergency services but the paramedical staff declared them dead. Preliminary investigation suggested that Privyavandana was living with her father for the past three to four years following an estranged relationship with her husband Satish. She had alleged that Satish had an extramarital affair and the quarrels over this took a huge mental toll on her, forcing her to take the drastic step. Police also found a suicide note from her room in which she mentioned about her husband's affair and also accused his mother of supporting him, Rander police station sources said. The woman also wrote a poignant letter apologizing to her son for killing him. “My hero died.. I strangled and killed him. My doll I love you so much Rishu. My hand was trembling... I cried a lot while killing my doll. Sorry son I killed you,” the note states. A similar incident had recently happened in Pandesara area when a man allegedly strangled his 25-year-old wife and then committed suicide by hanging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-strangles-3-yr-old-son-hangs-herself-to-death/articleshow/88016064.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Incensed over ‘arbitrary transfers’ over Corbett illegalities, U’khand IFS officers approach state IFS association, allege service rule book violated||Dehradun: After Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Dhami ordered the transfer of 30 forest officers — including the head of forest force, chief wildlife warden and principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) — over alleged illegalities in Corbett Tiger Reserve, the serving IFS officers of the hill state have approached the Uttarakhand IFS Officers’ Association, claiming the reshuffle was “completely arbitrary” and in violation of the service rule book. The complaints include the fact that while the Centre has 113 sanctioned posts of IFS officers in the Uttarakhand cadre, after the recent reshuffle, some of these posts have been filled by Provincial Forest Service (PFS) officers or ‘promotees’ (state-level forest staff who have risen through the ranks). IFS officers further said they are thrown into state deputation without their consent and PFS officers have been entrusted with important territorial forest divisions’ responsibilities in their place. They also allege that promotees with ‘questionable’ professional track records have been given important postings. Incidentally, the Kalagarh tiger division of Corbett, where several illegalities have been confirmed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), was previously under the jurisdiction of divisional officer Kisanchand, a ‘promotee’ officer, and now has been handed over to another non-IFS officer. Even the new PFS officer deployed at Kalagarh was issued a fine of Rs 8 lakh for felling trees in “non-compliance of approvals”. Besides, AK Gupta has been given charge of the Shivalik circle, known for its rich flora and fauna. This is despite Gupta being suspended on charges of “financial irregularity” after the findings of a probe conducted by whistleblower IFS officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi as reported by TOI in February 2020. Similarly, another official, D Thirugyansambadanam, has been given the charge of the crucial Haridwar division, overlooking the investigations against him. The IFS officers also say that transfers violate the Supreme Court’s 2013 order in the TSR Subramanian Vs Union of India case. The SC had then stated that IFS officers must get be given an assured minimum term in posting. President of the IFS Association of Uttarakhand, Kapil Lal said, “We have received a number of written complaints and expect to get more from aggrieved officers. We will collate these concerns and take up their grievances before the Civil Services Board.” When asked about the issue, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said, “In 2013, probably some wrong decision was given in the TSR case. There is nothing like cadre or non-cadre. How can a person be tagged as a non-cadre even after spending 20 years in service? How can his seniority and experience be discounted? I am not questioning the knowledge of new IFS officers, I am just saying experience has its own significance. Also, the state can transfer at its will. The civil service board recommends postings but ultimately it is the decision of the government.” On the question of giving ‘crucial’ postings to officials with ‘dented’ professional records, the minister said, “For us, all the divisions are sensitive and like anyone else, officials can continue working unless proven guilty. If we are paying them salaries, we will take their services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/incensed-over-arbitrary-transfers-over-corbett-illegalities-ukhand-ifs-officers-approach-state-ifs-association-allege-service-rule-book-violated/articleshow/88016057.cms||Shivani Azad

There must be an extensive discussion among the various stakeholders before it is presented and passed by the Parliament, they have demanded. “We had met the fisheries minister N Murukan and submitted a memorandum when he visited Kochi on Nov 22. We had discussions with him and explained our concerns,”said Charles George, president, Kerala matsyathozhilali union. He said that among the 26 bills that are being presented in the Parliament, the Indian Maritime Fisheries Bill is also listed. “It is strange that the bill’s name itself is misspelt,” he added. The state has also sought changes in the bill and a series of webinars have been organised since June involving politicians, academicians, retired officials and union leaders. Among the major concerns raised is that it is not in keeping with global best practices for marine fisheries regulations. The very term traditional fishers/small-scale fishers is not defined. Key fisheries terms are missing. In the memorandum submitted to the Centre based on the discussions, it was pointed out there are mismatches between policy statements in the national policy of marine fisheries-2017 and the proposed bill-2021. There is a major objection to the clause which define that coast guard will enforce the fisheries laws. It is agreeable that they are meant for surveillance, sea safety and defencerelated issues. “We are not in agreement with the introduction of ‘companies’ in marine fishing sector. We prefer larger investments through fishermen cooperatives,” said George. “If the Centre is not going to defer the bill until extensive discussions are held, we will take to protests,” George added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fishermen-against-centres-fisheries-bill-demand-talks/articleshow/88016880.cms||---

One of the two detained minor boys is the girl’s sibling, while the other is her cousin. The alleged rape came to fore only after the girl fell ill and was taken to the hospital, where the doctor found her to be six-month pregnant. Based on the complaint lodged by the girl’s parents, an offence for rape, under the relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, has been registered with the Beed rural police station. Police said the detained suspects include the victim’s 15-year-old brother and 16-year-old cousin. The arrested accused is a 20-year-old pursuing a veterinary course. The accused was produced before the court on Tuesday, following which he has been remanded in two-day police custody. Gevrai rural police station’s assistant inspector Yogesh Ubale said: “Both the minors will be produced before the child welfare committee for further action.” An officer privy to the probe said that the probe revealed the three suspects were allegedly used to watching pornography on their mobiles, and none of the trio was aware of the other exploiting the girl. The suspects, on different occasions, had threatened the victim.

---||Kochi||Eight injured as fire breaks out at multi-storey building||Kochi: A major fire broke out at a G plus three-floor building at Kunnumpuram in Edappally on Tuesday morning. While eight people suffered minor injuries, four others escaped unhurt. According to fire force officials in Eloor, they received a call from one Mithun at 7.39am alerting them about the fire at the building Amritha Avenue. The ground floor of the building was a textile shop and the rest of the floor was utilized as a lodging facility. Residents told the fire force team that some inmates suffered fractures on their legs after they leaped out of the building to escape billowing thick smoke from the fire. Fire authorities said the owner of the building failed to ensure fire safety measures in the structure. “Flex boards were piled up on a floor on top of the ground floor. Top two floors were covered with aluminium composite panels. Sliding glasses remained closed when the fire broke out. The width of the staircase is only 79cm. All these factors contributed to the gravity of the incident. A major tragedy was averted as the fire broke out in the morning and others noticed it. Otherwise, it would have resulted in many fatalities,” said assistant station officer of Eloor fire station Gopakumar T P. “When we reached there, a minor boy was lying unconscious. We rescued the boy and handed him over to his family who managed to get out of the building,” he said. All rooms in the lodging facility were air-conditioned and television sets were also present. Officials suspect a short-circuit from one of the electrical appliances as the reason for the fire. All items, including wooden furniture, inside the second floor, were gutted. “There was no opening in the building. It was difficult to enter each floor as thick smoke was billowing out and there was no ventilation to escape. The terrace of the building was also covered with truss sheets and they used the space for lodging purposes. If the terrace remained open, people could have gathered there to escape heat and smoke. We had to break open the glass panels to make ventilation,” said Gopakumar. Fire force from Eloor, Gandhinagar, Thrikkakara and Club Road reached the spot and took more than one-and-a-half hours to douse the fire.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/eight-injured-as-fire-breaks-out-at-multi-storey-building/articleshow/88016067.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||‘Use of aluminium panels as exteriors poses threat’||Kochi: The fire incidents exacerbated by aluminium composite panels, which are used to beautify the exterior of buildings, pose a serious threat to the safety of inmates. Despite repeated appeals by fire officials against using the panels and that too without ventilation, the requests always fell on deaf ears of the owners. Enclosing the roof of the terrace of buildings is another cause for worry. Officials say 90% of the buildings in Kochi are using the panels to cover the exterior and many others cover the terrace with truss sheets for utility purposes with no regard for safety provisions. “Though fire NOC is required only for the buildings, the built-up area of which is above 1,000 m sq, rest of the buildings should follow the safety parameters stipulated in the national building rules. But that was not followed in the building at Kunnumpuram. We could not even find a fire extinguisher there. The width of the staircase should have been at least 120cm. It was such a narrow one which we used to find in old houses, to reach the attic,” says A S Joji, district fire officer.Fire officials say the aluminium composite panels are highly inflammable as coating of paint is used in it. The fire can consume it in a nick of time. “If the fire had broken out at night, the inmates would have lost their lives inhaling smoke due to no ventilation. For using truss sheets on the terrace, many argue that it is for preventing leakage. But it prevents rescue operations. We faced the issue during the flood in 2018,” says Joji. Experts in the field of building materials say there are many eco-friendly methods to beautify their buildings instead of using the inflammable aluminium composite panels. “If they want to use aluminium composite panels, they should ensure that it is a fire retardant (FR) one, the cost of which is only 20% higher than the local ones. However, 99% of the panels used here are not FR ones. There are many fireproof clay panel products to beautify buildings. The clay panels are maintenance free and reduce the air conditioning cost,” said Abhay Kumar P K, managing director of Trium, a consulting company in the field of eco-friendly building materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/use-of-aluminium-panels-as-exteriors-poses-threat/articleshow/88016085.cms||---

While around 35,000 beneficiaries took the jab on Saturday in Nashik district, another 55,000 came in on Monday and by 7pm on Tuesday, the number of vaccinations had crossed 70,000-mark. “There has been a rise in the footfall at vaccination centres across the district suddenly. This may be because of the news about the Omicron variant. Similarly, the health department is also taking measures to increase the vaccination,” said Kailas Bhoye, the taluka health officer, who is in-charge of vaccination. By evening, 70,386 doses had been administered on Tuesday, of which, 37,096 were given to beneficiaries who received their second dose. As many as 33,290 people received their first dose. According to the officer, the average vaccination on the weekdays was around 45,000 till recently and the daily doses crossing 70,000 is very encouraging. “ZP chief executive officer Leena Bansod, who reviewed the vaccination status recently has asked the health authorities to draw up the list of the people who have not received any vaccine or are yet to get the second dose. Accordingly, the exercise has been carried out and the health authorities since Thursday began visiting every house and asking the people to get vaccinated,” the officer added. The health officials are now going house to house appealing to people to get vaccinated at the earliest. The officer further pointed out that the vaccine doses and syringes were available with the health department in ample numbers and hence there was no shortage of sorts. The need of the hour is the people take the doses at the earliest to ensure protection against infection.

What is the point of having a law when the so-called beneficiaries did not require it in the first place?” Sati said. Suresh Semwal, convener of the mahapanchayat, added, “Our forefathers escorted pilgrims from Haridwar to the Char Dham shrines and after completion of the yatra, brought them safely back. In those days, the pilgrimage was done on foot. We have followed the tradition of looking after the affairs of the temples and the pilgrims for generations. It was very irresponsible on the government’s part to leave us out of the loop while framing a law regarding the temples. We had vowed not to agree on anything less than repeal of the Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-anyones-benevolence-hard-fought-struggle-of-735-days-ensured-win-of-priests/articleshow/88016098.cms||Kautilya Singh

However, with 88% of the beneficiaries receiving the first dose, Kolhapur district is leading among the districts in the south Maharashtra region. Around 26.36 lakh beneficiaries across Kolhapur district have received their first dose against the target of 30 lakh. Also, as many as 43% of the beneficiaries have received both the doses. District collector Rahul Rekhawar claimed people will turn up in large numbers for vaccination due to fear caused by new variant. “We have a village-wise list of non-vaccinated beneficiaries. Those remaining are mainly those who have been advised by doctors not to take the vaccines for health reasons. Though, the population without second dose looks large, most of them have their second dose due after November 30.” Rekhawar also held a meeting with representatives of the traders association and claimed that they have showed their willingness to join the “No Mask, No Vaccination, No Entry” drive. “In the first two waves, we carried out No Mask, No Entry campaign effectively. Now we are adding the vaccination factor to it. The traders will put up boards outside displaying the message. People with no mask, no vaccination will not be given goods. People will have to carry vaccination certificate with them. Also, it is mandatory for the traders to have a vaccination certificate,” Rekhawar said. On the last day of the first-dose vaccination deadline, over 30,000 beneficiaries turned out to get jabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-dist-misses-nov-30-vax-deadline/articleshow/88014281.cms||---

The eight-day festival will begin on Wednesday. Many percussion artists were forced to do other jobs like driving autos, selling masks and masonry works during the pandemic and most of them now want to get back to drumming, their real occupation. So, instead of scheduling the melam with only chenda artist Peruvanam Kuttan Marar and his 120-member team for the eight-day performance, the temple authorities have decided to provide a chance for eight different teams which will enable at least 1,000 percussionists from all over the state to get a chance to perform here. “Unlike the previous years, this time many groups, headed by eight prominent artists will drum the Panchari Melam, a major percussion ensemble that has been performed here for many years,” said Prakash Iyer, president of Sree Poornathrayeesha Temple advisory committee. “We feel so happy to know about the new melam schedule in Vrischikolsavam,’’ said Cheranelloor Sankaran Kutti Marar, who will lead the melam on Wednesday. Peruvanam Kuttan Marar will lead the melam on December 4. “While scheduling other folk artforms like Kurathiyattam, Kolkali and Ottanthullal, we have given prominence to artists who suffered much during the pandemic,’’ said Krishnadasan Thampuran, a member of the temple advisory committee said. As a curtain raiser of the festival, ‘Anachamaya Pradarshanam’ was held at the ‘Aanakkottil’ of the temple on Tuesday. Meanwhile, there will be traffic curbs in Tripunithura from Wednesday. Vehicles coming from the municipal bus stand should enter the Layam Road instead of taking a left turn. No vehicles from the North Fort gate will be allowed to take a left turn. Three and four-wheelers will not be allowed through Kalikotta Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/around-1000-artists-to-perform-at-temple-fest/articleshow/88016099.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kochi city has nothing to cheer despite topping Niti Aayog index||Kochi: In the sustainable development goal (SDG) index by Niti Aayog for the year 2021, Kochi City has secured the top fifth position. Though it underlines the city’s potential for developing its facilities in a sustainable manner, authorities hardly take note of the fact and fail to plan projects to make mileage out of such achievements. It is certainly commendable that Kochi emerged fifth in the ranking where more than 60 cities across the country were evaluated. Still, going through the parameters of the SDG index will help us in having a reality check and also in exploring the potentials of improvements. No poverty, good health and well-being, gender equality, quality education, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, reducing inequality, climate action, peace and justice, etc. are the prominent among the 17 indices. “It is a fact that Kochi fared better in the Niti Aayog SDG index. Still, a lot has to be done for improving the standards. Now, powers regarding implementing projects in almost all sectors like health, education, climate change, etc. rest on the state or Union government. It is high time for the government to delegate more powers to the local self-governments. Then only, we will be able to achieve sustainable development in a fast mode,” said D Dhanuraj, chairman, Centre for Public Policy Research, a think tank. Kochi corporation lacks competency in designing and implementing various projects. As per the norms, there should be more than two medical practitioners to head the health department of the local body. But the government has allotted none. The civic body which owns and operates many vehicles doesn’t have a mechanical engineer. The local body in the financial capital of the state lacks a finance officer for several years. Another area where the city lags is regarding the essential data pertaining to the city. Kochi doesn’t have data on the buildings in the city. Though the corporation authorities tried to outsource the work of compiling online data regarding the buildings and other features of the city, it didn’t materialize due to objection from opposition councillors. “A proper and scientific study pertaining to various spheres in the city is needed. There are many colleges and even universities in and around Kochi. The local body authorities and the government should make use of the researchers and students in such educational institutions for preparing data regarding various aspects. They can contribute heavily on preparing various projects for the overall development of the city,” Dhanuraj said. Lack of proper data affects proper designing of various projects and delays their implementation. Almost all the projects designed in Kochi are lagging behind schedule. A classic example of this is the construction of the main office building of Kochi corporation. The work started in 2005-06 period is yet to be completed. The authorities are still unable to set up a proper waste management system even after more than two decades since designing projects in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kochi-city-has-nothing-to-cheer-despite-topping-niti-aayog-index/articleshow/88009669.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Mumbai||Six flyers from at-risk nations, South Africa in Maharashtra found Covid positive||MUMBAI: On the lookout for the new Omicron variant, state health authorities have found six travellers infected with Covid within a fortnight of their return from South Africa or other high-risk countries with the strain. One of these six patients, a male in his forties, is from Mumbai, but BMC officials are confident that he is unlikely to be affected by the Omicron variant. "We have tested his sample using a specialised RT-PCR test that checks for the 'S' gene. As his test showed the presence of the S gene, it is unlikely he has Omicron," said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. The remaining five patients are: one each from Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira Bhayander and Pune, and two from Pimpri-Chinchwad, said the state's surveillance officer Dr Pradip Awate. All the patients are asymptomatic and have been placed in quarantine. 26 contacts of Dombivli engr test negativeOn the lookout for the Omicron variant, state health authorities have found six travellers infected with Covid within a fortnight of their return from high-risk countries. “Their samples will be sent for whole genome sequencing to check for the Omicron variant either at BMC’s Kasturba Hospital lab or the NIV in Pune,” said Dr Pradip Awate, adding the results will take a minimum of five days. The Omicron variant doesn’t contain the S gene, and the Centre has directed that detection kits capable of finding it should be used to check patients at airports; its presence is an indirect way of ruling out Omicron. The Mumbai patient is asymptomatic and admitted to Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, as a precautionary measure, said a BMC official. “We have taken samples to run the whole genome sequencing on his sample,” said the official. Meanwhile, the KDMC tested 17 residents from the building in Dombivli where the merchant navy engineer, who tested positive for Covid while returning from Cape Town, lives. So far, the health team has tested 26 people, including the patient’s family, and all have tested negative. The health team on Tuesday also obtained details of 42 passengers from a private airline company that ferried the passenger from Delhi to Mumbai. KDMC officials also traced the cab driver who on November 24 ferried the patient from Mumbai airport to his residence in Dombivli and gave BMC officials his Ghatkopar address. The Dombivli man, who returned after six months from Cape Town via Dubai and Delhi on November 24, is in institutional quarantine, Art Gallery in Kalyan, since Sunday and is asymptomatic. KDMC health officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil said, “The test report for Omicron at Kasturba Hospital will take at least a week. In the meantime, we have got details of 42 passengers from six rows at the front and back of this passenger and shared details with respective corporations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-26-contacts-of-dombivli-engr-test-negative/articleshow/88017508.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Surat||Surat’s ‘highbeam’ festivities threaten to distract pilots||SURAT: When it comes to celebrations of any sort, lights that seem to be aimed at informing the stars about the earthly do, seems to be a must at Surat events. Mega beams criss-crossing the night sky may literally be throwing light on the organizers’ status, but how adversely it affects the pilots, navigating their huge aircraft in the air with hundreds of flyers aboard, seems to be of very little concern. Recently, the police control room received a few complaints from the airport after the issue was reported by pilots landing at Surat airport. These beams can distract a pilot and even for a fraction of second distraction can mislead them while landing the aircraft from their charted course. Airport authorities and police department in the city are a worried lot with the approaching season of marriages and year-end festivities as moving high beam lights around the airport cause a lot of tension. “A few police stations that cover pathways of airports have received messages from the control room to ensure that such high beam lights are not used. In such conditions police teams go for checking and ask to stop its use,” said a senior police official. Airport officials claim that use of any type of light that is visible from sky is prohibited to be used in landing pathways of aircraft and around airports. “Use of laser and high beam lights in the vicinity of Surat Airport at night can distract pilots of descending flights, which may lead to a major disasters. When an aircraft is descending at the airport, especially during night time, the pilot has to clearly see the runway so as to make a smooth landing,” said Aman Saini, director, Surat Airport. According to the Aircraft Rules 1937, Part VIII, rule no 66, false lights are any such light exhibited by reason of its glare to endanger the safety of an aircraft arriving at or departing from the aerodrome. “These lights may distract the pilot at this crucial juncture and lead to an aviation disaster. Due to these rules, even streetlights are covered from top,” Saini explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surtis-highbeam-celebrations-send-distracting-signals-to-airline-pilots/articleshow/88016113.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Pune||Surveillance, vaccination way ahead: Maharashtra health minister||PUNE: State health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday told TOI that increasing the surveillance, especially on those arriving from abroad, and vaccination were the ways ahead for the state in the wake of the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, and not lockdown. “We as a state will increase surveillance, testing and genome sequencing laboratories. Local authorities have been directed to strictly ensure Covid protective behaviour and take action against those not following the rules,” the minister said, adding that people arriving from countries listed by WHO for Omicron should be tested and samples must be sent for genome sequencing. “Currently, we as a government, are not thinking about lockdown. We even announced the reopening of schools. We are focussing on vaccination. The daily new cases in the state are in three digits for a little over one week. We want to ensure that there is no sudden spurt,” he said. On Monday, the daily cases in Maharashtra were at 536 and the active cases were at 7,854. The state health officials stated that a strict vigil was being maintained not just on international travellers but also on any rise in cases in any clusters. The testing has been increased to about 1 lakh in the state of late. “Our health authorities have been instructed to keep a check on testing and ensuring that screening is done properly of the affected passengers,” said the minister, as the state issued guidelines on the lines of the Centre. On Tuesday, the state health secretaries had a detailed interaction with the Centre. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas told TOI that the state had issued directions for strict monitoring and checking of all international travellers. “Strengthening of call centres for monitoring of cases under home isolation, capacity building of clinicians, refresher training and operationalisation of real-time dashboards are being done,” he said. Tope said the state government’s detailed order issued on Saturday called for strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and restriction on any mass gatherings. It put some curbs on activities, ensuring that the state’s economy was not affected. ‘The minister said the government order on implementing the Covid-appropriate behaviour directed the local authorities to impose fine on norms violators. Individual fine of Rs500 and establishment fine of Rs10,000-50,000 have been put in place. “Our cases are down but we cannot throw caution to the wind, especially with the new variant. We should not unnecessarily violate the norms and put pressure on the health system,” said a state Covid task force member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/surveillance-vax-way-ahead-tope/articleshow/88016907.cms||Nisha Nambiar

This comes days after 62 residents of the old age home tested positive. Dr Madhav Waghmare, Bhiwandi taluka health officer, told TOI, “Around 17 patients, including four elders, and 13 staff and their relatives, tested positive on Tuesday.” Dr Ashok Devre Patil of the home said the infected patients have been isolated at the facility. “We have already fumigated and sanitised the premises and have a back-up team to take care of the elders here. The district health department is also in touch with us and has already declared the area as a containment zone,” he said. Of the original lot, 15 who had earlier undergone antigen tests, tested positive again on RT-PCR kits.

---||Pune||Maha tells labs to use ‘S’ gene drop detecting kits for spotting Omicron||Pune: The Maharashtra government has directed RT-PCR laboratories testing samples of international passengers to use kits that will detect the ‘S’ gene dropout, an indirect way of knowing whether the Omicron variant of Covid is present in a person or not. Maharashtra additional chief secretary Dr Pradip Vyas on Tuesday in a letter to all district heads said the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines stated that diagnostic test kits with two confirmatory gene target, with at least one being the ‘S’ gene, should be used for early detection of the Omicron variant of Covid. “The kits should preferably contain RNaseP, Beta Actin or any human housekeeping gene as an internal control gene. As the ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF) is indicated for Omicron, it can be used as a marker for this variant. This may lead to efficient detection of the Omicron variant of Covid. Such kits can be used as proxy tests for the Omicron variant pending sequencing confirmation,” the letter stated. Dr Vyas said the laboratories should prioritize specimens with SGTF (no detection for the ‘S’ gene and detection for other gene targets) for genomic sequencing and confirmation of the Omicorn. “The use of SGTF will lead to a faster detection rate,” he said. Public health experts are of the view that the routine RT-PCR tests are not technically complete, as they often do not test for the ‘S’ gene, which is absent in the Omicron variant of the virus. WHO has stated that in the RT-PCR tests targeting three genes (‘N’, ‘S’ and ‘E’), the ‘S’ gene is not present in the Omicron variant. Therefore, the absence of the ‘S gene dropout’ or SGTF, can be used as the marker for the newest variant of Covid. The Maharashtra government’s directive stresses on the use of kits to test for the three target genes with higher specificity and better detection rate by the laboratories with superior access to airports in the state. State coordinator for genome sequencing Dr Rajesh Karyakate said the use of those kits would certainly hasten the process of identifying the Omicron variant. Many states, such as Tamil Nadu, have issued similar orders for the laboratories to use kits that will detect the ‘S’ gene dropout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-tells-labs-to-use-s-gene-drop-detecting-kits-for-spotting-omicron/articleshow/88016914.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Tomato, which has been the most priced vegetable for the past two weeks, is priced at Rs 100-110 per kilogram in several neighbourhood shops while larger markets sell the vegetable at a cost of around Rs 90-95. The price of drumsticks remained the same as last week (Rs 130). “The number of vegetable trucks coming into the markets is just a quarter of what used to come before. Since it is still raining in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, many of our regular sellers haven’t been able to come,” said Ernakulam market stall owners’ association president C J George, president. He said that some of the local farmers groups have been bringing their produce to the markets, but these are mostly native vegetables. Meanwhile, Horticorp said that there have begun steps for market intervention to reduce the prices of vegetables based on the decision taken at a high-level meeting convened by agriculture minister P Prasad. Around 41 tonnes of vegetables have been procured from markets like Tirunelveli and Mysuru for infusion into the state’s vegetable markets. “On the basis of the instructions given by the minister, we have begun procurement of vegetables and are supplying in the markets at 10-20% reduced prices compared to the current market prices,” he said. For example, one kilogram of tomato, which is priced at Rs 100 in the market, is being sold at Rs 80 through Horticorp and vegetables and fruits promotion council of Kerala (VFPCK),” said Horticorp managing director J Sajeev. He said the agriculture department plans to procure vegetables being grown by the farmers in the state and VFPCK has been given the charge of procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vegetable-prices-continue-to-pinch-pockets-of-public/articleshow/88009709.cms||---

After the second wave of coronavirus pandemic left many families struggling for survival after the death of breadwinners, TOI traced several Covid orphans and highlighted the difficulty they faced in getting government aid for their survival and education. Arjun Pandey, a Class 10 student, lost his father, Vinay Pandey, to suspected coronavirus . “After Vinay’s death, I didn’t know how I’ll take care of my children. With little savings, I wasn’t sure whether I should fund my children’s education or arrange the meal for the day. My younger son, Arjun, had to discontinue his studies for several weeks. I thank TOI for highlighting the plight of my family, and also of many others who lost their dear ones,” said Arjun’s mother, Shashi Pandey. On Tuesday, Arjun received Rs 7,500 (three-month amount). “We received the compensation after many months, but we are happy that the government kept its promise,” added Shashi Like Arjun, at least 1,300 non-Covid orphans from Uttar Pradesh didn’t have the Covid certificate to prove that their parents died of Covid-19. Such applicants were put under UP Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana (Samanya). Aditya Mehra, a student of Class 11, had submitted Covid death certificate of his father but did not receive aid for months. Finally, he got the first installment of Rs 12,000 on Tuesday. “We are thankful to TOI, ChildLine and Lucknow administration for helping us in getting the aid. I faced a lot of difficulties after my father’s death. The government aid has brought some relief,” said Aditya. District probation office, Lucknow, Vikas Singh said under non-Covid orphan category, 112 out of 200 applicants received aid while 580 applicants out of 600 got help in Covid category. “We also received applications for aid (Rs 500 per month) from 315 widowsin Lucknow,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-months-of-suffering-reprieve-for-covid-orphans/articleshow/88017513.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Bhavna Balmukund Keyal was suffering from this disease for many years. Four years ago, she had undergone a surgery too. On November 25, she became unresponsive and the family admitted her to city’s New Era Hospital. In spite of treatment for 4 days, the patient’s condition deteriorated and the team of doctors — Dr Nilesh Agrawal (neurosurgeon), Dr Parag Moon (neuro physician), Dr Amol Kokas (intensivist) and Dr Sahil Bansal (anaesthetist) — declared her dead on November 29. After counselled by Dr Ashwini Choudhary in New Era Hospital, Bhavna’s husband Balmukund, who works in a private company in Bhandara, her elder son Shubham and younger son Pranav agreed to donate her liver and kidneys. Allocated through Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC), Bhavna’s liver gave a new lease of life to a 56-year old man while one kidney was transplanted into a 54-year-old woman — both in New Era Hospital. Kidney committee chairperson and senior nephrologist Dr Viresh Gupta said second kidney was not medically suitable for transplant. Dr Anand Sancheti, director of New Era Hospital, said the family deserves appreciation for taking a decision in such challenging situation. “Both brothers have lost their mother at a very young age. But, they have shown a sense of responsibility towards the society. One of them said their mother will live through two other patients, which was very touchy reaction,” said Dr Sancheti. New Era Hospital provided free ambulance service as part of honor corridor. Dr Sanjay Kolte, ZTCC secretary said the organ donation will give hope to two patients of liver and kidney failure. “Unfortunately, consent for heart and lungs could not be obtained and thus could not be utilized,” he noted. Dr Vibhavari Dani, ZTCC president, said organ donation activity and awareness is growing after Covid nightmare. “Considering the demand for this life saving measure and availability of experts in the field, ZTCC will continue its work to spread awareness about organ donation,” she said.

---||Dehradun||Death sentence to murder convict: HC asks for all records of the case||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court on Tuesday heard the case of murder convict, Digar Singh, who was given death sentence by Additional Sessions Judge (ADJ), Preetu Sharma, last week. The ADJ court, after pronouncing its judgement, had transferred the case to the high court to confirm its order. During the hearing of the case in the high court on Tuesday, the division bench of senior justice Sanjay Kumar Mishra and justice NS Dhanik asked to submit all records of the lower court related to the case. Earlier on November 24, the 38-year-old Nainital resident was given death sentence for killing his mother in 2019. The accused was also awarded a life sentence for attempting to kill a neighbour on the same day he killed his mother. Further, a fine of Rs 10,000 was also levied on him. While pronouncing the judgment, ADJ Sharma said that the death sentence is awarded only in ‘rarest of the rare’ cases and this was one such crime. On October 7, 2019, accused Digar slit her mother’s throat over a minor property dispute and also injured neighbour Inderjit Singh with an axe. Subsequently, Digar’s father, Shobhan Singh, approached police with a complaint against his son. Digar was booked under sections 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code on the basis of the complaint. The accused was convicted after 12 people, including several members of his family, testified against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/death-sentence-to-murder-convict-hc-asks-for-all-records-of-the-case/articleshow/88016127.cms||---

Apart from the aesthetic objective, the initiative aims to increase the butterﬂy population on the campus and the park can serve as a natural habitat to butterﬂies. The activity was mooted as part of the CSR and development initiatives of Cusat. The saplings were of over 25 indigenous plant varieties that attract butterflies and they were planted in an area of nearly half-an-acre adjacent to the reservoir inside the Cusat campus. The butterfly park project is funded under the CSR initiatives of Nippon Motor Corporation Pvt Ltd, Kalamassery. Students of school of management studies (SMS), NSS unit 09 of Cusat, PhD scholars and other nature lovers took part in the planting initiative. Inauguration of the initiative was done by Cusat vice-chancellor K N Madhusoodhanan, and the function was attended by pro-vice chancellor P G Sankaran, registrar V Meera, internal quality assurance cell (IQAC) director K Girish Kumar, syndicate member Sunoj S M, SMS director Jagathy Raj, etc. P K Sureshkumar, chief environment officer of Toyota Motor Corporation Pvt Ltd, Kalamassery, and Sangeetha K Prathap, coordinator, CSR & development initiatives at Cusat too were present.

---||Goa||FC Goa develops Salvador do Mundo grounds for Rs 1 crore, panchayat shunts out club by ‘vandalising’ it||PANAJI: FC Goa has been forced out of their training base at Salvador do Mundo by the panchayat, which unilaterally decided to discontinue with an existing three-year agreement and dug up a concrete pitch for cricket in the middle of the two grounds. Goa’s representatives in the Indian Super League (ISL) will train at the Sesa FA ground in Sirsaim from Wednesday onwards. FC Goa had signed a threeyear memorandum of understanding with the village panchayat of Salvador do Mundo — represented by the then sarpanch Sandeep Salgaonkar — on May 29, 2020. According to the MoU, FC Goa were to develop the ground, while the panchayat would provide “exclusive access to the club to use the existing ground for its footballing activities”. The club spent almost Rs 1 crore on developing the two grounds — one for their own use and the other for locals — and trained at the venue last season from October till May. But now, with a change in sarpanch, things have spiralled out of control. “On Sunday afternoon, without any prior intimation and in an attempt to gain local political leverage, the football pitch was desecrated as the turf was dug up and later filled with concrete,” FC Goa said in a statement on Tuesday, calling the action acts of premeditated vandalism. “The actions have led to the damage of the drainage and watering facilities of the ground, making the place unfit for the footballing activities that were being carried out.” Club sources said that as part of the MoU, they were to develop only the main ground — referred to as ground 1 in the agreement — while the adjoining ground was to be developed by the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC). But since work had stalled, the club took it upon itself to develop the second ground as well, for exclusive use of the locals. The club said it spends Rs 2.2 lakh per month on maintaining the two grounds, while also looking to develop local talent in the region by imparting technical know-how through its under-14, under-18 and grassroots development programmes. Since FC Goa had made a “sizeable investment” in developing the ground, its right to use the facilities without payment only exists for the first three years of the partnership. “Once the three-year partnership ends, we would happily work on another contract and pay usage fees at market rates,” said the senior official, adding that they would have had to pay much less than Rs 1 crore for usage of any ground in the state for three years. “If the panchayat wants revenue, we are open to using any of the spaces that they have, on rent. We had made proposals in the past.” The club said that the panchayat’s actions of desecrating the ground are in breach of the agreement. “FC Goa refuses to be intimidated by these acts and will endeavour to explore all legal options available to mitigate the matter at the earliest,” the club said in the statement. Newly-elected sarpanch of Salvador do Mundo, Antonio Fernandes, said it was the gram sabha which met on Sunday that decided on the course of action. “The MoU has been cancelled, it’s not registered with the sub-registrar,” Fernandes told TOI on Tuesday. “They have only notarised it. They are training here for free. The panchayat does not get any revenue. They have invested (the money in developing the grounds) for their own good and not for the benefit of the panchayat.” Asked why a concrete cement pitch has been allowed to come up in the middle — and dangerously close to the first ground — when cricket is played on mats or hard surfaces, the sarpanch feigned ignorance. “It was the gram sabha that decided on a cricket pitch. I am not involved. They have done it the way they wanted. The village boys have done it,” said Fernandes. FC Goa’s renovation efforts are part of a pilot project called Field of Dreams, the club’s endeavour to provide better infrastructure to budding footballers. In the first phase, eight grounds have been identified for similar projects. There are 206 football grounds across the state, but most remain unused due to the poor conditions and the cost of maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-develops-salvador-do-mundo-grounds-for-rs-1cr-pyat-shunts-out-club-by-vandalising-it/articleshow/88017532.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Lucknow||Three main markets in Lucknow to be freed of rampant encroachment||LUCKNOW: With the culmination of traffic awareness month, Lucknow police have pledged to kick-start an anti-encroachment drive on priority from Alambagh, Bhootnath and Aminabad markets. In other areas, a similar drive will be jointly conducted by Lucknow Development Authority and Lucknow Municipal Corporation. Police commissioner DK Thakur said that police will soon start the anti-encroachment drive and to ensure that it is followed judiciously, residents and traders will be made custodians of the area cleared. “We have selected three priority areas: Alambagh, Bhoothnath and Aminabad,” said Thakur. He also said that intelligent traffic management system has become active in some parts of the city but Old City (west zone) requires more attention and improvement. Joint commissioner of police, law and order, Piyush Mordia, the nodal head of the drive, said that all trader associations of the city have been included in a committee which will select the areas and then conduct the drives. “With the help of media, we will also register FIRs against those who continue encroachment after we clear the area,” Mordia added. The officer also said that banquet and marriage halls, which organise functions, will also be scrutinised under the drive. “People come here to attend events but park their vehicles on the road, adding to congestion. Henceforth, all these owners will be instructed to arranged for a parking facility or face legal action,” he said. The officer also said that those responsible for regular encroachment will be photographed and those photos will also be published in media. Meanwhile, district administration officials present at the closing ceremony of traffic awareness month said that soon, a multinational company will be given the task to improve traffic in the city. The same company has worked in Maharashtra and Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/3-main-markets-to-be-freed-of-rampant-encroachment/articleshow/88017525.cms||---

---||Pune||Feasibility survey for lifts & ramp at Pune station||Pune: The Pune railway division is carrying out a feasibility survey at the city station before installing lifts and constructing a ramp for senior citizens and wheelchair-bound travellers, officials said. Based on the survey, work on the new facilities will begin. “The survey is looking for places where lifts can be installed. The lifts will be helpful for senior citizens and wheelchair-bound passengers. There’s also a plan to construct a new ramp connecting one of the foot over bridges,” said Manoj Jhawar, the public relations officer of the Pune rail division. At present, for senior citizens or anyone in a wheelchair, travelling from one platform to another is difficult. “The Pune station was almost empty without any trains or passengers because of the pandemic. The survey could have been done and completed last year and by now a lift could have been made functional. I recently had to carry my 90-year-old grandfather, who was in a wheelchair, through the stairs because the escalator was not working,” said Pune resident Pramod Sinha. Only one of the four foot over bridges at the station had a ramp. But according to officials that too has been shut down after it was deemed unsafe. “After the foot over bridge was shut down during the pandemic last year, the ramp too remained closed. Thus, a proposal to construct a ramp connecting the 12-metre-wide FOB has been sent to the railway board. The survey would assess the feasibility of installing lifts to the foot over bridges on the platforms,” Jhawar added. Passengers also said even the existing escalators were not dependable. “The escalators don’t work most of the time. This becomes a problem for passengers especially for the senior citizens and wheelchair-bound people,” said Srimant Bhosle, a regular commuter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/feasibility-survey-for-lifts-ramp-at-pune-station/articleshow/88016925.cms||Joy Sengupta

Hampiholi took over from Vice Admiral Anil Kumar Chawla, who retired from the Navy with nearly four decades of service. Hampiholi was the commandant of the Indian Naval Academy, Ezhimala, prior to taking over this appointment. A native of Dharwad in Karnataka, Hampiholi arrived in Kochi on Monday for taking over the new assignment. A ceremonial parade, comprising 16 platoons including four armed platoons and a 50-men ‘Guard of Honour’ was held at the Naval Base on the occasion, in which both the admirals were accorded general salutes. The parade concluded with a ‘March in Review Order’. Subsequently, both the flag officers carried out the formal handing over in the office of the flag officer commanding-in-chief.

---||Lucknow||Stray animals roam freely, causing mishaps as Lucknow Municipal Corporation remains a spectator||LUCKNOW: On an average, Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) receives about 20 complaints related to stray dogs every day. However, all of them seem to be falling on deaf ears as stray animals are present in every nook and cranny of the city, posing a major threat to the people. Despite LMC claiming to have carried out regular cattle catching drives and dog sterilisation campaigns, stray animals can be seen feeding on vegetable waste and garbage. People in many areas complain stray cattle and dogs even sleep on busy stretches making them unsafe for vehicle users, especially twowheeler riders. They claim that animal breeders and owners of illegal dairies let loose their cattle, mules and donkeys on the roads at night, leading to frequent accidents. According to the civic body’s records, there are an estimated 60,000 stray dogs in the city, of which around 50% have been sterilized to check their population. Officials also said around 18,000 stray dogs are sterilised every year. TimesViewStray cattle and dog menace are among chronic problems of the city. Shifting of stray cattle to shelter homes and sterilisation of dogs are both time-taking processes, hence LMC must ensure that at least every distress call of residents is addressed in a time-bound manner during winter when the threat of accidents is the most. It should also focus on those areas first where the problem is severe and take strict action against illegal dairy owners and breeders who leave animals in the open at night.With this rate of sterilisation, experts said it will take two more years to sterilise all stray canines, if the population remains the same. Transportnagar resident Udit Pandey (20) recalled how he was attacked by a pack of stray dogs near his residence. “I was returning home from coaching classes in the evening on November 16, when two stray dogs pounced on me and one of them sunk its teeth deep on my right leg. I lost balance and got injured,” he said. Other residents rued that even after complaining to LMC several times, no action has been taken to tackle stray dogs menace. Similarly, residents of Aishbagh complained that stray dogs have attacked several kids. Vidushi Agrawal said, “These dogs chase twowheeler drivers unnecessarily, resulting in accidents.” Morning walkers in Aliganj had the same complaint. Yashwant Singh, a resident of Sec-D, said, “All our complaints have fallen on deaf ears.” LMC records say there are 6,000 stray cattle and 2,000 bulls in the city. Of these, about 4,000 stray cattle and 900 bulls have been caught over several months and sent to shelter homes Kanha Upvan and Radha Upvan, and eight to kanji houses, said officials. However, as the pace of work is slow, people continue to suffer. Taareek Hussain, a resident of Kaiserbagh, said: “Narrow streets of the busy market get jam packed due to cattle left unattended.” Posh areas are no less affected. “A few days back, I was hit by a bull which was having a tussle with another bull on the middle of the road. Luckily, I did not sustain any severe injuries," said Tanya Hussain of Vishal Khand. LMC chief veterinary officer Arvind Rao said, “Drives to catch stray animals are being conducted on a regular basis and we are hopeful to complete the work soon.” (With inputs from Godhooli Sharma, Ayushi Mishra, Vertika Sonakia, Tarin Hussain)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/stray-animals-roam-freely-causing-mishaps-as-lmc-remains-a-spectator/articleshow/88017547.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

Wonderful to watch the amazing success of Indians in the technology world and a good reminder of the opportunity America offers to immigrants.(Congrats, Parag!)” In response, Tesla co-founder Elon Musk tweeted, “USA benefits greatly from Indian talent!” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said in a tweet, “Wishing you the very best ahead Jack, and congrats Parag and Bret — excited for Twitter’s future!” Jack is Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder who is stepping down as CEO. And Bret is Bret Taylor, COO of Salesforce who is coming in as an independent board member at Twitter. Taylor had served as group product manager at Google, where he cocreated Google Maps. IIT-Bombay congratulated its “alumnus Dr Parag Agrawal”. The institute said Agrawal obtained his BTech degree in computer science and engineering from IIT-B in 2005. Vedanta Resources executive chairman Anil Agarwal congratulated Agrawal and said, “Indian managers are the best in the world.

K M Mansia alias Suhana (22) of Edathala was killed when the hatchback crashed into the Metro rail pillar at Pathadipalam around 1.50am. The driver, Salmanul Fariz (24), and another passenger Jibin Johnson (28) survived the accident with minor injuries. Kalamassery police said that it was a case of drunken driving and all the three passengers had consumed alcohol. A case has been registered invoking IPC Section 304A (causing death by negligence) among others. Fariz, who drove the car, has been arrested after he sought treatment at the hospital. Police also took Johnson into custody as part of the probe. Police said the three had known each other for the last few months and they reportedly partied at Fariz’s house near HMT at Kalamassery. They consumed liquor at the party and after dinner, they went out for a night drive. The car was heading to Aluva direction on the national highway when the accident occurred. Police said that the car was speeding and it might have led to the accident. Meanwhile, reports of mystery, similar to Vyttila accident, were in the air initially based on the rumours that Johnson allegedly fled the scene immediately after the accident. But police said that Johnson did not flee but was taken to a nearby hospital by someone following the accident. “However, as he was severely drunk, he left the hospital without telling anyone and wandered in the nearby area. Later, he went to his home at Varapuzha. However, police took him into custody in the afternoon based on the statements collected from Fariz,” said a police officer. Police have launched further probe and started collecting the video footages from nearby CCTV cameras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-killed-two-injured-after-car-rams-metro-pillar/articleshow/88016167.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Priests wrest control of Char Dham, 46 temples from bureaucrats||DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday announced repealing of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board Act, which had brought over 50 temples, including Char Dham shrines of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath, under state control. The Act, which had led to constitution of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, on the lines of Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, headed by an IAS officer, was strongly opposed by the priests of the Char Dham shrines as they claimed it would deprive them of their “centuries-old rights of administering the temples.” Speaking about the move to repeal the Act, CM Pushkar Singh Dhami said, “The decision has been taken on the basis of reports of two committees formed by us, whose members spoke to stakeholders and recommended the law be repealed. Social organisations, priests and several sections of the society were consulted. In the future, if we do decide to take a call on the issue, we will make sure everyone’s opinion is taken into account.” The Act was scrapped months before the upcoming assembly polls scheduled early next year. Sources said the ruling party had feared severe backlash from several seats in the Garhwal region due to the mounting protests of priests. The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Bill, which was tabled in the state assembly in November 2019 and passed in a matter of days, had been mooted by then-chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat. The board was mandated to be responsible for management of funds received by the temples, take decisions related to pilgrimages and carry out developmental works in and around the four Char Dham shrines. Bureaucrats and public representatives were made members of the board while teerth purohits (priests) claimed they were not made part of the process. Before the Devasthanam board, the Badri-Kedar Temple Committee (BKTC) had control over the Badrinath and Kedarnath shrines while local trusts administered Yamunotri and Gangotri temples. The four shrines received a combined revenue of Rs 50 crore in 2019. The figure dipped considerably last year as well as this year due to the pandemic. Soon after the board was formed, protests, led by priests and Opposition Congress, started across the state. After Trivendra Rawat was replaced by Tirath Rawat as chief minister, the priest community celebrated, thinking the board would now be repealed. In April, Tirath announced that he would remove 51 small temples from the board’s purview. Priests were not too happy with that. In July, chief minister Dhami, who had replaced Tirath Rawat, said the Act could be reviewed and a committee was formed on August 15, headed by former Rajya Sabha member Manohar Kant Dhyani. Meanwhile, the protests continued. On November 1, Trivendra Singh Rawat was stopped from entering the Kedar shrine. Priests vowed to protest during the PM’s visit on November 5 too. In mid-November, when the PM announced that the three contentious farm laws would be repealed, the protests to have the Devasthanam Board scrapped intensified. Protesting priests held marches in state capital Dehradun and organised sit-ins outside ministers’ residences. On November 28, an 89-page final report was submitted by the Dhyani committee and reviewed by another committee headed by state tourism minister Satpal Maharaj. The committees suggested repealing the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-priests-wrest-control-of-char-dham-46-imp-temples-from-babus-after-2-yr-long-protests/articleshow/88016162.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Cancer treatment method kindles hope for AIDS cure||LUCKNOW: There’s a ray of hope for patients suffering from Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The ‘Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant’ (ABMT), used to treat blood cancer patients, combined with gene editing can lead to a cure for the life threatening condition, some experts told TOI on the eve of the World AIDS Awareness Day. “US scientists have successfully experimented with the method on mice. Now, this would be tried on other animals and later on humans. If the clinical trials prove successful, the treatment would be adopted worldwide for treatment of HIV cases. We in Lucknow are also waiting eagerly for the results of the trials and would implement as and when the method gets approval of all the statutory and regulatory bodies in the world and in the country,” said Prof AK Tripathi, head of haematology department, KGMU, who is also an HIV expert. Explaining the new treatment methodology, Prof Tripathi said, “In the ABMT, healthy stem cells in the bone marrow of a blood cancer patient are segregated from the damaged ones and then these healthy stem cells are transfused back into the person. These stem cells then grow in the blood and are effective in treating the cancer.” “In case of HIV infection, the stem cells can be taken out from the bone marrow. Then the virus in the stem cells is removed through gene editing. Thereafter, the treated stem cells are transfused back,” he added “This process was successfully carried out on mice by scientists of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, US, recently. The mice were first infected with the HIV. Thereafter, bone marrow of these infected mice was taken out. Then, using a new gene editing technology (known as CRISPR) scientists removed the HIV DNA from the stem cells in the bone marrow. Thereafter, the treated bone marrow was transfused back into these mice,” he said. Simultaneously the infected blood in the mice was replaced with healthy blood taken from other mice, which had no infection. Tests, thereafter, found that the mice on which experiment was being done had no longer HIV infection,” he added. Prof Tulika Chandra, head of transfusion medicine department, KGMU, said, “Though such treatment can potentially provide cure, it will be too costly initially. In government set ups, the bone marrow transplant costs Rs 5-6 lakh and in private Rs 8-10 lakh. Besides, there will be the cost of gene editing also, so there are questions about its viability in India.” Prof Tripathi said that the HIV attacks CD4 cells of the immune system and gets integrated. Often it stays in dormant state, but can trigger any time and destroy immune cells, posing a threat of AIDS. “At present, antiretroviral therapy is given to HIV positive people to prevent viruses from replicating and destroying immune cells. However, the therapy has to be taken for an entire life. The ABMT, coupled with gene editing, promises to completely cure the HIV infection,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cancer-treatment-method-kindles-hope-for-aids-cure/articleshow/88017562.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The firm, Prithiviram Infra, is a partnership engaged in infrastructure projects in industrial, residential and commercial concerns. The firm, represented by its partners Undavalli Raja Gopal and Boppudi Seshagiri Rao, had availed a secured overdraft facility of Rs 4 crore and letter of credit (LC) of Rs 2 crore, with a total limit of Rs 6 crore in October 2016 for business purposes from Union Bank of India’s Defence Colony Branch in Hyderabad. The company had offered primary securities of hypothecation of stocks procured against the LC and charge on all current assets. It had also offered a residential building in Kanchanbagh and non-agricultural open land in Gaganpahad, Rajendranagar, as collateral security.  After availing the loan, the company defaulted on repayment of loan as per agreements and the account became a non-performing asset (NPA) in November 2018. The ownership of the property offered as collateral is claimed by a third party. An audit revealed that the firm had diverted funds among others. The bank, in February 2019, communicated to Navega Enviro Engineers & Consultants and Loorven Green Energy Projects Private Limited that the borrower had transferred huge amounts to them but had failed to submit the relevant bills and invoices. The two companies, however, did not respond to the bank. The CBI said the accused had committed cheating, diverted and misappropriated the borrowed funds and caused wrongful loss to the bank to the extent of Rs 8.15 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-books-city-based-firm-for-rs-8-crore-fraud/articleshow/88017467.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The gang was involved in issuing fake registrations and insurance certificates in Warangal. Police seized around Rs 4.5 lakh cash, three laptops, two computers, four printers, five two-wheelers along with 433 licenses, stamps and fake insurance documents. The arrested were identified as Md Safi, SD Jahangir, P Rajesh, V Nikhil, M Raju, BN Shiva Kumar, A Rajesh, G Srikanth, K Raju Kumar and B Suman. Speaking to reporters, Warangal police commissioner Dr Tarun Joshi said the accused working as RTO agents got used to earning easy money and started issuing bogus registrations, insurance and driving licenses. The accused also created several apps and even started issuing insurance renewals . “Most vehicle owners confidently took services from these fake agents. The gang members would simply change the QR codes and scan the numbers printed on their fake certificates. They were using certificates of private insurance companies and collecting huge amounts for the vehicles,” the CP informed. In a recent check, one vehicle owner found out that his insurance renewal certificate was fake. He then lodged a complained following which task force DCP Vaibhav Raghunath Gaikwad and his team started an investigation and traced the gang. “Around Rs 90 lakh had been collected through 10,000 vehicles,” the CP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gang-pockets-rs-90l-in-bogus-registrations-insurance-held/articleshow/88017448.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Car business driving on fake RC & Aadhaar busted||HYDERABAD: Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths of Shamshabad have arrested seven persons indulging in fabricating fake registration certificate (RC) and Aadhaar cards to facilitate the ownership transfer of loan defaulter’s vehicles. The SOT of Shamshabad arrested the seven accused — Ch Sathish, 32, of Shamshabad, Sk Jahangir Basha, 50, Syed Hussain, 35, Sampath, 35, all RTA agents, K Chandrasekhar, 44, Ch Ramesh, 36, both vehicle finance agents, and M Ganesh, 29, a DTP operator. SOT sleuths seized 1,200 fake RCs, 79 fake Aadhaar cards, 29 fake stamps, printers and other incriminating evidence, Cyberabad commissioner M Stephen Ravindra said. Among the accused, Chandrasekhar and Ramesh used to purchase vehicle loan defaulter’s automobiles from various financial institutions. “As several owners do not give RC at the time of their vehicle seizure by bank or the staff of finance company, the accused had to buy the vehicles auctioned by such institutions without the original documents and to register the vehicles in the name of new owners, they have been resorting to the fraud,” DCP, SOT, G Sundeep said. As per the plan, RTA agents Syed Hussain and Sampath used to steal RCs from RTA offices in Kothagudem and Chandrayangutta. “The accused have access to RTA offices and they steal a few RCs which were returned to the offices due to wrong addresses,” the DCP said. Hussain sells the stolen RCs to Sathish each for Rs 200 and after erasing the original details on the RC using nail polish remover, Sathish gets the details of the original vehicle owner printed on RC using a card printer available with Ganesh, who also prints fake Aadhaar card with the same name. Sampath sells the stolen original RCs to Ramesh, who himself prepares a fake RC after erasing the original details. The accused then approach RTA offices with fake RC and fake ID proof and get the ownership of the vehicles transferred in the name of a new client, SOT Inspector K Venkat Reddy said. Two cases were registered against the accused at RGI Airport PS and Miyapur PS. The accused were produced before court for judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/car-biz-driving-on-fake-rc-aadhaar-busted/articleshow/88017434.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC dismisses Hetero pleas to quash CBI case||HYDERABAD: Justice Shameem Akther of the Telangana high court on Tuesday dismissed two petitions filed by Hetero Drugs and its director M Srinivas Reddy urging the court to quash a CBI case filed against them in a quid-pro-quo case. Making it clear that they have to put forward their case before the trial court, particularly in view of the prima-facie material provided by the probe agency with regard to criminal conspiracy and cheating, the judge paved the way for the trial court to proceed further in the matter by vacating the stay order issued in favour of the company and the director in the past. The YSR government in 2008 had accorded top priority to the Hetero group and allotted it space at Jadcherla Pharma SEZ. Stating that the state at that time accorded such benefits to Hetero only after its director invested in Jagan Mohan Reddy’s firms, CBI had made the company and its director as accused in the case. CBI counsel K Surender said that another company Lee Pharma too sought space at the same SEZ, but the APIIC at that time did not allot it the space. He also termed the investment made in Jagathi publications, a firm floated by Jagan in 2008, by M Srinivas Reddy, Hetero’s director, as a bribe for the benefit he availed. The judge said that it would be premature to quash the case under CrPC 482 at this stage and asked the company and its director to present their case before the trial court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-dismisses-hetero-pleas-to-quash-cbi-case/articleshow/88017516.cms||---

Accused Syed Mohsin of Borabanda was arrested for 24 burglaries and K Shanker Chowhan of Zaheerabad held for three offences. Mohsin, originally from Bidar in Karnataka, has been breaking into houses in the city since 2003. He has also been detained under the PD Act in 2015. Since 2017, Mohsin has committed 24 burglaries in the city and Sanga Reddy and disposed the stolen goods with the help of Shaik Mahmood in Bidar. As Mohsin always wore a mask, full-sleeve jacket, gloves and didn’t even carry a mobile, cops had little information to identify him. Cops then used CCTV footage to monitor his movements for over a month and he was finally arrested by Madhapur CCS police at Gopal Rao Nagar in Miyapur. Cops recovered 73 tola gold and 4 kg silver from him. While Chowhan was arrested based on CCTV footage and cops seized 12 tola gold and 3.5 kg silver from him for three offences in RC Puram and Narsingi.

The facility is expected to be fully operational by May 2022, Cargill said on Tuesday. However, it did not divulge any details of the previous owner of the refinery. The company said the acquisition will significantly expand its edible oil production capacity and footprint in southern India and strengthen its existing supply chain to meet growing customer demand. The newly acquired refinery will give Cargill the capability to supply refined palm oil, palm olein, vanaspati (hydrogenated vegetable oil) and sunflower oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country’s sunflower oil consumption and is currently being underserved, it said. "This facility also allows Cargill to produce and package its own edible oil brands for retailers and to better serve bakery and foodservice customers in the region. The refinery expands Cargill’s offerings into Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu,” Cargill said. Elaborating on the significance of the acquisition, Piyush Patnaik, managing director of Cargill’s edible oils business in India, said, “We have driven significant growth of our edible oils business in India over the last few years. This acquisition propels our expansion, specifically in southern India, and demonstrates our commitment to India...” “We are consistently working to modernize the business and investing in expanding our footprint while delivering distinctive value to our customers. This acquisition aligns with our tailored and localized market approach for Asia that will drive global growth in food and agriculture,” he added.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cargill-inc-acquires-oil-refinery-at-kpatnam-port/articleshow/88016951.cms||---

The patient – Dhansukh Chouhan – was admitted with convulsion and speech disturbance at the hospital.  Chouhan’s MRI had shown a tumour in his brain on the left side which has speech areas. “Surgery in this area carries a risk of damaging these areas leading to APHASIA - loss of speech and understanding. Hence, surgery of such tumours are done by a special technique called awake craniotomy with intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM),” said head of neurosurgery department Dr Amey Patankar.  “The patient was kept awake throughout the procedure. Local anaesthesia was given in the scalp and the skull was then opened,” said Patankar, who led the neurosurgeon’s team of Dr Yaksh Sompura, Dr Parth Modi and anaesthesia team of Dr Devyani Desai, Dr Swati Bhatt and Dr Jalpa Damor.  “Using IONM, the speech areas are identified by stimulating various areas of the brain and asking the patient to speak. In our surgery, 80% of the tumour was removed. During removal of the last 20 % the patient started developing speech disturbance. Hence, the surgery was stopped,” he said.  Chouhan is fully conscious and will be discharged soon. “Post-operative MRI has shown 80-85% tumour removal. This tumour can be treated further by radiotherapy. Our aim was to preservation of speech areas in which we have received success,” he said.  In a private set-up, such awake brain surgery costs nearly Rs 2.5 lakh. But in this case, the entire surgery was performed in around Rs 26,000. that could affect vision, movement or speech||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/doctors-excise-brain-tumour-from-a-fully-conscious-patient/articleshow/88015858.cms||---

With the latest move, ED has so far attached assets worth Rs 4,141 crore. On December 24, 2020, ED had attached assets worth Rs 4,109 crore. The present attachment was done on the identification of new properties during investigation. ED initiated money laundering investigation based on multiple FIRs registered in AP, Telangana and Karnataka. AgriGold Group, led by AvvaVenkata Rama Rao, allegedly ran a fraudulent collective investment scheme in the guise of real estate business for which over 130 companies were floated. AgriGold Group had collected deposits from the public with a promise of providing plots or withdrawal at a high rate of return on maturity or pre-term. “Commission agents lured people with schemes for hefty commission and collected Rs 6,380 crore from 3.2 lakh investor accounts. But the investors neither got plots nor could recover their deposits,” ED said. “The modus operandi of AgriGold Group was that they would lure the public to join as depositors in their schemes, under the pretext of real estate deals. But the deposit agreements did not mention the market value of the land, its location, boundaries or layout permissions. ,” ED alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-32cr-assets-in-agrigold-scam/articleshow/88016933.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Gupta said that by law there should be an audit of government departments’ accounts every three months. “Kejriwal government has not ordered a probe into DJB’s scams despite demands for it over a year now,” he said. “DJB has prepared no balance sheet since 2015,” the BJP member claimed, citing information obtained through RTI. “Delhiites need to know that the board owes a whopping Rs 60,000 crore as a loan,” Gupta asked. “DJB has shared the entire data from 2015-16 to 2020-21 during the court proceedings.

The devices are being given to students to equip them with gadgets so that they can use technology to study under the scheme announced by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in October. A dedicated portal named ‘DG Shakti’ has been created for facilitating the distribution of smartphones and tablets which will be soon launched by the CM, said a government spokesperson. “The students will not have to apply or register anywhere to get free smartphones and tablets. The entire process, from registration to smartphone and tablet delivery, is free,” the spokesperson said. The colleges are transferring details of their students directly to the university which is feeding the data on the portal. Till Monday, data of about 27 lakh students had been uploaded on the portal, said officials. The work order for distribution of phones and tablets will be issued by the first week of December and 5 lakh smartphones and 2.5 lakh tablets will be distributed in the first phase, he added. “The government floated the largest tender for smartphones and tablets worth Rs 4,700 crore on the GeM portal. Many wellknown companies have submitted their bids which are in the stage of finalisation. The companies include Vishtel (Iris), Samsung (Vision) and Acer (Celkon) for tablets and Lava, Samsung (Celcon) and Samsung (United) for smartphones,” the official added.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Using waste material to bring freedom fighters back to life||NEW DELHI: After the wonderful reception people have given to Waste to Wonder Park with its replicas of global architecture icons made from scrap metal and the completion of Bharat Darshan park, with emblematic Indian monuments similarly fabricated out of discarded materials, South Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided now to develop two other recreation facilities along the same lines. It has decided to put the eight-acre park near Jangpura to good use developing a Bollywood-themed ground revamping Shaheedi Park on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg into the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav Park by highlighting events related to the Independence movement. TimesViewNew parks are always a good idea. However, maintaining older ones is equally important. The signboard of Shaheedi Park has been barely visible for months. One of its main iron gates has long been pilfered. Proper replacement and repairs should be carried out.However, unlike the Waste to Wonder and Bharat Darshan parks, SDMC will not just use scrap metal, but all discarded materials to create figures of artists, freedom fighters, revolutionaries, etc. “We have prepared the detailed project report for the Bollywood park project that will be set up in Jangpura,” said an SDMC official. “The project will cost Rs 15-20 crore. There will be a presentation of the proposal at the next meeting of the civic body’s standing committee. The project is to be implemented on public-private partnership basis.” At the park, there will be replica sets of popular movies, statues of popular jodis, and villains, a gallery on how movies are made, plus a functioning backstage for the entertainment and information of the visitors. “Unlike Waster to Wonder and Bharat Darshan Park, at these recreational places we will be using scrap, fibre, construction and demolition and other kinds of waste material,” said the official. The park will also have a 3D museum with figures of popular movie stars accepting Filmfare Awards. “The museum will create an illusory third dimension and each photo or figure would be coloured with smart angles for taking pictures and also to make it a fun-filled and experiential activity for family, group, kids and teams. They can take real pictures with illusory photos/pictures of artists at this museum,” said the official. At Shaheedi Park on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, the cost of the project is expected to be Rs 15 crore and the civic body hopes to get corporate social responsibility funds for this. The park will have statues of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. “There is a plan to highlight important events of the freedom struggle and the various movements by creating figures and frames with waste material,” said the official. Shaheedi Park was inaugurated on August 9, 1998 by the late PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was leader of the Opposition in Parliament. Every year on August 9, the anniversary of Quit India Movement is celebrated at this spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/using-waste-material-to-bring-freedom-fighters-back-to-life/articleshow/88017574.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Poll fear forced BJP to take back Devasthanam Board law, says Harish Rawat||DEHRADUN: As the Uttarakhand government announced dissolving of the Char Dham Devasthanam Board, the state unit of Congress attacked the incumbent BJP saying the party acceded to its mistake only due to the fear of a crushing defeat in the upcoming assembly polls, scheduled in the early part of 2022. Following the state government's announcement of rolling back the contentious law, senior Congress leader and former state chief minister Harish Rawat said, “Fear of humiliating defeat in the 2022 assembly elections forced the BJP to take a politically-driven move to cover its failure in the last five years.” Referring to the recent U-turns on the three farm laws and the devasthanam board, he told TOI, “In the wake of assembly elections in Uttarakhand and Punjab, the BJP governments – at the Centre and the state – are desperately trying to make amends to hide their failure and anti-people policies.” Rawat pointed out that despite Congress raising the issue of the board on various platforms, it took two years for the BJP government to repeal it. “Everyone knew that the Act was against the sentiment and tradition of Uttarakhand since its introduction. I want to ask the government why such a law was passed in the first place. Secondly, if a mistake was made, then why did it take over 24 months for the BJP government to realise it. The BJP leaders were well aware that a humiliating poll defeat was imminent if they don't repeal the law. The decision has nothing to do with the interest of people. It is just an attempt to hide failures of a party, which changed three chief ministers in an election year,” said Rawat. Echoing a similar sentiment, Pritam Singh, leader of opposition, said, “We have opposed the bill right from the very first day. The issues we raised were genuine but the government overlooked them. No one was taken into confidence and the issue was not discussed with the stakeholders.” The five-time Chakrata MLA added, “The incumbent chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, who was a legislator when the bill was tabled in the House also didn't oppose it. Now, as a CM, he has overturned the decision. This shows that he does not have the courage nor the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. The BJP has been exposed before the people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/fear-of-poll-defeat-forced-bjp-to-take-back-devasthanam-board-law-harish-rawat/articleshow/88016171.cms||Kautilya Singh

The police had enhanced patrolling in the area after Monday’s back-to-back chain-snatching incidents, especially in Nigdi and Wakad areas. The police had formed several teams to nab the suspect. Constable Dhole then spotted Rathod, a criminal on record, moving around suspiciously on a scooter at Nigdi Pradhikaran area and asked him to stop. Rathod, instead, took out a sharp-edged weapon and tried to stab Dhole, the police claimed. Dhole, however, managed to save himself and overpowered Rathod with the help of two other policemen, who were patrolling with him. Rathod then took out a pepper spray and sprayed it on the faces of Dhole and the two others. He fled the spot leaving behind his scooter. Assistant inspector Amol Korde of Nigdi police told TOI, “As Rathod was on foot, we combed the entire area by calling additional teams and nabbed Rathod within an hour.” The police registered a case of attempt to murder and assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty against him. “He has been involved in 56 cases of chain snatching in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, and Pune rural areas. He does not have proper accommodation in Pune city. He comes to Pune in his scooter and targets elderly women out on morning walks and then flees to Latur,” Korde said. Meanwhile, another chain-snatching incident was reported at Wakad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/chain-snatcher-tries-to-stab-constable/articleshow/88016940.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Murder in Shivaji Park: Carpenter freed after 6 yrs||Mumbai: A sessions court on Tuesday acquitted a 31-year-old carpenter, six years after he was arrested for the brutal murder of a 57-year-old Shivaji Park housewife, Beleza Cardozo. Carpenter Manoj Verma, who was arrested, as robbery was believed to be the motive, was acquitted due to lack of evidence. The court said that the victim’s jewellery, a diamond ring, gold chain and currency notes of Rs 20,000, which were alleged to have been recovered at the instance of the accused, are to be returned to Cardoza’s legal representatives. She was survived by her husband and two children. Around 16 witnesses including the help who found the body lying in a pool of blood in the second floor flat deposed during the trial that commenced in July 2017. Charges were framed against Verma on July 5, 2017 and he pleaded not guilty. The reasoned order is yet to be made available. Beleza's husband Tom (60) was then a captain with the merchant navy while their children Boris (32) and Tina (35) were settled in the United Kingdom. On November 4 2015, the woman was found lying in the hall with her head profusely bleeding. Police believed robbery to be the motive and the carpenter Verma, who was working in her flat was arrested almost a week later. Verma, represented by advocate Ankush Dhokale always maintained he was falsely implicated. During his bail hearing his defence had submitted that there was renovation work going on at the flat and several labourers were frequenting it. In 2015, the police had said that the murder came to light only when the maid rang the door bell around 11.30am. When there was no response, she opened the door with a duplicate key, which relatives said, washer routine. She saw Beleza lying in the hall and immediately alerted neighbours who rushed her to a nearby hospital. Beleza was declared dead within half an hour of admission, police had said. It was alleged Varma had entered the house in the morning. He had done the work of the latches on the door. It is alleged that he hit the woman on her head with a tool.

---||Pune||Decision to reopen primary classes in dist after Dec 15||Pune: Schools in Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation areas and the rural parts of Pune district will remain shut till December 15, notifications issued by both civic bodies and the Pune zilla parishad said on Tuesday. The state education department had given approval for schools to reopen from December 1, but both the corporations have decided to wait before reopening classes physically from Stds I to VII. Classes from Stds VIII onwards will be allowed to function as they are. The need to contain the possible spread of the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus has been stated as the reason for this preventive measure in both notifications which also said that a revised decision on the reopening of schools after December 15 will be taken based on the Covid-19 situation. The same decision will also be applicable to Pune and Khadki cantonment board areas. Pune’s district collector Rajesh Deshmukh also issued an order on Tuesday evening stating that the rural schools will also not reopen from December 1 and that online education would continue till further orders. His order said, “All teaching and non-teaching staff will report to school in full capacity. The staff should work on preparing the schools for the reopening with all Covid protocol. The teachers should get fully vaccinated meanwhile so that 100% staff can report to school once the decision to reopen is taken.” Deshmukh also stated in his notification that residential schools should also be made ready for reopening while the school management committees must sensitise the school transport committees and inform them about the guidelines to be followed during this period. Many schools in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad, especially those affiliated to national education boards, had already decided not to start their schools online in December, instead postponing it to January. The Association of CISCE Schools in Maharashtra has written to the education department requesting them to let the ICSE schools take a call and open their schools from either December 21 or January 2022. The letter explains that ICSE schools will be conducting semester I board examinations till December 16 and then closing for the Christmas vacation from December 23 onwards. Markus Deshmukh, spokesperson for The Bishop’s School, said, “The board exams are being held now. We need to ensure that each student maintains a six-foot distance. Hence, more classrooms will be taken up which in turn means more number of teachers will be needed for invigilator duties. Moreover, immediately afterwards our winter vacation start. We have already informed the parents that the schools for Std VIII onwards will start physically from January 6 while the physical classes for Stds I to VII will start in March-April when the next academic year starts. Parents have conveyed this information and they have agreed to the continuation of online classes till then.” Rohit R, a parent of two girls studying in primary classes in a city-based CBSE school, said they too had received a notification stating that the schools will start for physical classes in January 2022. Other cities also wait to start The reopening of physical schools for the 10.5 lakh students from Stds I to VII in Mumbai has been deferred by two weeks to December 15.Most schools are likely to reopen in January as they will close for Christmas less than a week later. Across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Thane (including rural) and Navi Mumbai will reopen primary and upper primary classes from December 15. In Nashik, civic chief Kailas Jadhav on Monday put off the in-person classes in schools across the city to December 10, and district collector Suraj Mandhare on Tuesday said classes for Stds I to IV in rural areas would be deferred to the same date. In Aurangabad, schools will not start in urban areas, and a decision would follow on December 5, civic officials said. There are 740 primary schools with two lakh students. Institutions in the rural parts of the district are set to reopen. But, primary schools in Kolhapur will resume offline classes in the urban and rural areas from Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/decision-to-reopen-primary-classes-in-dist-after-dec-15/articleshow/88016964.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||State govt orders probe into BJP-ruled NMC’s TDR case||Nagpur: Ahead of municipal elections scheduled for next year, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has directed divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma to conduct an inquiry into a case of transferable development rights (TDR) related to BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and also allegedly linked to leaders of the saffron party. The TDR was issued 10 years ago. The state’s urban development department, in a letter sent to divisional commissioner on November 29, said, “Leader of opposition in the NMC Tanaji Wanve had submitted a memorandum to the urban development minister Eknath Shinde demanding inquiry. Therefore, an inquiry should be conducted followed by submission of report with relevant documents immediately.” Wanve, a senior Congress leader, had submitted the letter on March 4 and Shinde had ordered inquiry on June 29. However, the department has directed the divisional commissioner for the inquiry now. The timing of the probe has, however, raised a few eyebrows. If everything goes as per schedule, code of conduct for municipal elections will come into effect in January next year, followed by voting in February. Wanve told TOI, “The issue has nothing to do with elections. It is a clear case of irregularity. I have all relevant documents. Need is to initiate action against those who “misused” the TDR and the officials who approved it. Therefore, the government has directed probe and I hope, the divisional commissioner will bare all irregularities and names of those involved in her report.” Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe had raised the issue in NMC general body on October 6, 2012 and named BJP leaders linked to the case. TOI had carried a series of stories on irregularities and controversies related to 30 TDR cases, including the one under scrutiny now. Gudadhe said, “Even though I had raised the issue supported by all documents, the NMC did not cancel the TDR because of the pressure from BJP leaders. Finally, the MVA government has ordered probe, which will bring the truth before the public.” BJP city president Pravin Datke said, “The TDR was issued by head of the NMC’s town planning department, who is an officer of the state government sent on deputation. Also, the then municipal commissioner, who too was a state government officer, had conducted inquiry into all TDR cases and reported no irregularities. Congress was in the government in the state at that time. Therefore, the case has nothing to do with BJP and the government should initiate action against officials, if found guilty.” In the letter to Shinde, Wanve had claimed that 5,142.5 sq.mt (55,333.3 sq.ft) land situated in Wathoda was reserved for development of a fire station. “The government had declared this land as surplus under Urban Land Ceiling (ULC) Act on September 7, 2002. On July 31, 2006, Talegaon Dabhade scheme under ULC Act was approved on this land. While approving the scheme, it was clearly mentioned that lands reserved for public purposes, whether vacant or not, should be handed over to the concerned planning authority free of cost, after development. Thus, the land was handed over free of cost to the government. Despite this, the NMC officials in nexus with the developer issued TDR on the land,” he alleged. Though the land was acquired in 2011, the NMC is yet to develop fire station, he pointed out. ——————  —————————||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-govt-orders-probe-into-bjp-ruled-nmcs-tdr-case/articleshow/88016972.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Mangaluru||Mysuru photographer murdered over property issue: SP||Mangaluru: A photographer from Mysuru, who was found murdered, and whose body was exhumed on Wednesday last week, was killed with his head being smashed with a hammer, and stabbed in the neck and back with a knife, over a property issue, stated superintendent of police Rishikesh Sonawane, after an investigation was conducted. Photographer Jagadish Rai,58, from Subrahmanya Nagar in Mysuru, was reported missing on November 18. A special team of Dakshina Kannada police had arrested Balakrishna Rai,59, Prashanth,28, Jeevan Prasad,39, Jayalakshmi,58, from Padavannur village in Puttur, and Jayaraj Shetty,47, a resident of Badagannur in Puttur, in connection with the crime. Shashidhar, the older brother of the deceased, in a complaint filed at the Puttur Rural police station stated that his sibling had bought two acres of agriculture land in Kunjoor Panja of Aryapu village. The property was being looked after by Balakrishna Rai, a relative. On November 18, Jagadish had reportedly arrived from Mysuru to visit the property, and had roamed around with Balakrishna Rai. Shashidhar was told that his brother returned to Mysuru in a car. Since he did not reach Mysuru, a missing complaint was filed. The SP said that the accused hatched a plot on November 18, and took Jagadish Rai in a car on the Noojibailu Pernaje road. After bludgeoning Jagadish with a hammer and stabbing him with a knife, the accused buried the body in a forest at Muguli in Paduvannur village. Balakrishna Rai had allegedly registered an agreement related to Jagadish’s property in his name, without informing him. The accused had murdered him to hide this. The police team has seized two cars, the murder weapons and a gold chain belonging to Jagadish, which are approximately valued at Rs 6 lakh, from the accused. “The investigation spanned over Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Mysuru districts. Prompt and alert action by the IO and his team under guidance of the DSP Puttur, led to the arrest. The special team will be rewarded,” he said, adding that the accused are in judicial custody. Youth assaulted A youth was critically injured in a clash between two groups at Urwa police station limits in the city, late on Sunday. According to city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar, the injured is Shravan, who was attacked by eight members of the Alike gang. “It is a retaliation for the Indrajeeth murder case of 2020, that was reported in the Barke police station limits. Shravan is a friend of one Ankit, who is the brother of an accused in the Indrajeeth murder,” the commissioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mysuru-photographer-murdered-over-property-issue-sp/articleshow/88016197.cms||---
---||Lucknow||BJP ‘yatras’ across Uttar Pradesh to showcase achievements||LUCKNOW: Seeking to ramp up its campaign ahead of high-stake UP assembly elections, BJP will organise ‘yatras’ in all six organisational regions of the state to project achievements of its governments at the Centre and state. The decision was taken during a meeting by senior BJP leaders, including Union minister and state election in charge Dharmendra Pradhan, CM Yogi Adityanath and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, at the state party office on Tuesday. Both deputy CMs, Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, were also present at the meeting. While a formal date to flag off the ‘yatras’ has not been finalised, sources said, the party plans to organise them any time after second week of December. The six organisational regions which will be covered under the campaign include, Paschim, Braj, Awadh, Kanpur-Bundelkhand, Gorakhpur and Kashi. The campaign marks a throwback to 2017 UP assembly elections, when BJP’s ‘Parivartan Yatra’ lent traction to the saffron wave. The party seeks to go back to the strategy to take on an assertive opposition, ostensibly the Samajwadi Party, which has been positioning itself aggressively against BJP with its statewide ‘Vijay Rath Yatra’. Singh later tweeted the campaign will enable the party to win 300-plus seats in UP polls. The yatra that will pass through 403 assembly seats will be attended by various senior leaders, including ministers, MPs, MLAs and other organisational functionaries. BJP MLC Vidya Sagar Sonkar has been made state in charge of the scheduled yatras. Accusing previous regimes of orchestrating riots and patronising mafias, CM Yogi said, before 2017 assembly elections, objective of yatras was to point out shortcomings of the then state government. “This time, we are going to tell people about our achievements and seek their blessings,” he said, after the meeting. He said since independence, politics of nepotism, regionalism, casteism, vote and religion has undergone a “paradigm change” under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. “This yatra will break boundaries of politics of casteism, appeasement and dynasty,” he said. “The government and party stands for the village, the poor, farmers, youth and women to establish a new India,” he said, claiming the common man “was happy” with welfare schemes of the government. Yogi said, benefits of the schemes are reaching the last person of society without discrimination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-yatras-across-up-to-showcase-achievements/articleshow/88017593.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Goa||Congress, GFP form ‘Team Goa’ alliance to take fight to BJP||PANAJI: After months of uncertainty, Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) agreed to form an alliance for the 2022 assembly polls. While the decision was taken on Tuesday in the presence of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the modalities of ‘Team Goa’, as well as seat-sharing, will be decided at the state level, the parties said. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat, GFP president Vijai Sardesai and Congress’ Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao held a meeting with Gandhi, finalising the coming together of the two parties to defeat BJP in the elections, likely to be held in February. Sardesai, who propounded the idea of Team Goa over the past many months, said that in the coming weeks, more people would join the team, including some from the ruling party. Political observers said that this is a major development, as this has not only put an end to the speculation that there would be no alliance between the two parties, but will change the perception that a Congress-led opposition could defeat the ruling party. Sardesai said that “basically, the alliance has got the blessings of the Congress leadership”, and reiterated that Gandhi suggested that other nitty-gritty be decided at the state level. While GFP’s Siolim MLA Vinod Paliencar accompanied Sardesai, its other MLA, Jayesh Salgaonkar, was conspicuously absent. What’s significant was that a photograph shared by Sardesai on social media platforms showed Sanguem independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar in the group along with Gandhi, holding hands together signifying unity. “We agreed to fight resolutely, wholeheartedly and unitedly on behalf of the people of Goa to end the utterly corrupt, incompetent and undemocratic reign of BJP,” posted Sardesai, along with the photograph on his official Twitter handle. Rao also posted a tweet stating that Sardesai, Paliencar and Gaonkar, in their meeting with Gandhi, “expressed their complete support to take on the corrupt and inept BJP Goa government in the ensuing assembly polls. “The much awaited Team Goa that we were talking about has finally actualised,” Sardesai told reporters after the meeting. “This unity will liberate Goa from the corrupt and anti-people BJP government. The movement has begun.” Sardesai said that the meeting signified that they have agreed together to fight BJP under the leadership of Congress to form a “Goemkarwadi sarkar”. Kamat said that it has been decided to work together to ensure that the “undemocratic” BJP government doesn’t return to office. Stating that GFP and Gaonkar have come on board with Congress, talks were under way with “others”. Gaonkar, whose recent manoeuvers have been marked with topsy-turvy decisions, said that his latest move was aimed at “sending BJP home”. After parting ways with BJP, Gaonkar cozied up to Congress briefly before pledging his support to TMC, and has now teamed up with Sardesai to join hands with Congress. “There was some misunderstanding earlier. All like-minded parties should come together,” he said. Sardesai said that many forces were trying hard to see that the like-minded parties would not come together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-gfp-form-team-goa-alliance-to-take-fight-to-bjp/articleshow/88017589.cms||Govind Maad
---||Goa||Government nixes nod to controversial Old Goa project, panchayat issues stop order||PANAJI: The state government finally gave into public pressure on Tuesday and revoked the permission granted to the controversial project in Old Goa next to a world heritage site, and issued orders to stop construction work immediately. The town and country planning department revoked the technical clearance it had granted to the project in October 2016, on the grounds that the applicant had carried out construction in contravention of the conditions it had laid down while giving the clearance. The project was being built by a Mumbai-based fashion designer who is a BJP functionary. Deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavlekar, who is also town and country planning minister, told reporters that after the objections were raised, he had ordered an inquiry and it was found that when the technical clearance was sought, the title document was in the name of one party, but subsequently it was transferred to the name of another. In 2016, the technical clearance was sought by Jose Maria de Gouveia Pinto and Maria de Abreu e Gouveia Pinto. “While granting technical clearance, they were told to obtain permission from the National Monuments Authority (NMA) for any further construction, but the condition was violated,” Kavlekar said. Besides, the NOC granted by the directorate of archaeology, archives and museum in 2020 was limited to repairs of the existing structure. “But a ground-plus structure was built,” he said. “When it was brought to our notice, and all documents were examined, it was discovered that right from the beginning, the party was at fault. When the technical clearance was given in 2016, the property was held by the Pintos, thereafter, it changed ownership and the NOC was granted to Suvarna Suraj Lotlikar.” Kavlekar said that there has been an attempt to hide reality and that the NOC was obtained by presenting a different picture, that is, by availing it without there being a real owner. “After taking all the facts into consideration, we have revoked the technical clearance given to the project. This fraud has hurt religious sentiments,” he said. Earlier in the day, the Old Goa panchayat passed a resolution to issue a stop work order to the controversial project. The body swung into action after opposition to the bungalow intensified last week. Sarpanch Janita Madkaikar said that they have also decided to issue show cause notices as to why the renewal of licences, as well as the house number, should not be revoked. She said the notices would be issued immediately, and that replies would have to be filed within seven days. Panch Vishwas Kutikar said that they had sought legal advice from advocate Saish Mhambre on the project. The advocate raised two points — that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated that land should not be transferred, and that the permission was given for repairs and not reconstruction. The panch said that although the proponent has seven days to reply, the stop work order has come into effect immediately. Another panch said that the panchayat also discussed the issue of transfer of the property.“While the sale has taken place, we are not sure if the document has been notarised yet,” the member said. The Save Old Goa Committee has welcomed the TCP decision but said that the stir would continue until the bungalow is demolished. The committee has also demanded demarcation of buffer zone in the heritage area. Glen Cabral said the heritage structures need protection for which a “full proof solution” is needed. For this all the protected monuments should have buffer zones. The project faced opposition soon after its conception, but the protests only intensified recently, and over the past fortnight, several political parties extended support to the protests. AAP functionary Amit Palekar has also sat on a hunger strike on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-nixes-nod-to-controversial-old-goa-project-pyat-issues-stop-order/articleshow/88017582.cms||---

An official of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said that considering the rise in the number of second dose beneficiaries, the mega vaccination drives would play a pivotal role in December to accelerate the immunisation in the civic limits. Commenting on the initiative, Ajay Sathe, the CSR head of Bajaj Finserv Limited, said, “As a part of our ongoing CSR initiative, we have been conducting various vaccination drives around urban and rural Pune to support the state government authorities with their immunisation efforts. Now, our target is to assist the authorities in vaccinating the remaining urban population of Pune. The PMC team has been working tirelessly to vaccinate the citizens and we are happy that we have been able to accelerate that work together.” According to the company’s press statement, the group has so far donated over eight lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses and nine lakh syringes. It participated in mass mobilisation efforts and awareness campaigns for maximum inoculation of residents. This initiative is a part of the ongoing efforts by the government to achieve 100% first dose Covid-19 vaccination by the end of December 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-mega-inoculation-drives-in-pune-civic-limits-in-december/articleshow/88016982.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Hyderabad||File tariff hike proposals, TSERC tells power discoms||HYDERABAD: Telangana power distribution companies have declared that there is a gap of Rs 21,500 crore between their revenue earnings and revenue requirements in 2021-22 and 2022-23. To fill the revenue gap, the discoms have decided to revise power tariff which will be filed separately soon. Power tariff hike is likely to come into effect from April 2022 after conducting public hearings by the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC). Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) and Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSNPDCL) submitted their aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) proposals to the TSERC on Monday but did not submit power retail tariff revision details like the hiked amount and category. TSERC chairman T Sriranga Rao said the power utilities estimated their revenue requirement for 2022-23 at Rs 53,053 crore, while requirement for 2021-2022 was Rs 45,618 crore. The state government has been providing subsidy for various categories of consumers, especially for the agriculture sector at Rs 5,652 crore each year. “The revenue earning by the discoms was Rs 29,343 crore for 2021-2022 and is estimated at Rs 36,476 crore for 2022-23. Since there is a gap between the revenue and power generation or supply cost, the discoms sought to increase the tariff to overcome financial stress,” Sriranga Rao said. “The filings of TSSPDCL and TSNPDCL include revenue gap from the sales and also power generation costs, operational and financial performance, sales forecast, load forecast and power procurement plan for the current financial year. They also include expenditure projections and revenue projections, including revenue from cross subsidy and additional surcharge and estimated cost of service for various consumer categories,” Sriranga Rao said at a press conference after the discoms submitted their proposals. Since the discoms did not file the tariff proposals as per the provisions of the regulation, the TSERC has directed the discoms to file the tariff hike proposals immediately to proceed further with the petitions, he said. Official sources said the discoms could not give tariff revision proposals, especially hike in each category, which is yet to be finalised. “CM K Chandrasekhar Rao will take a call on this soon,” a senior official of energy department said. The TSERC chief said there was no electricity tariff hike in the state for the last couple of years even though there was a steep increase in the input costs such as clean energy cess, freight charges, etc., of thermal power stations, which are the main source to meet the electricity demand of the state. Interestingly, the discoms did not submit ARR for the two years 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. As there were no filings, the TSERC decided to take the accounts as true-up charges, which comes to about Rs 30,000 crore revenue gap. TSERC members — MD Manohar Raju and Bandaru Krishnaiah — were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/file-tariff-hike-proposals-tserc-tells-power-discoms/articleshow/88016980.cms||Koride Mahesh

The incident came to light after the girls told their parents about the incident. On Tuesday, over a dozen women gathered around the primary school that falls under the jurisdiction of the Bilaspur police station and demanded action against the accused. Police were informed and the accused was arrested. After speaking with the three girls and their parents, the police registered an FIR under section 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) of the IPC along with relevant sections of the POCSO Act. The mother of one of the children told TOI, “We send our girls to school thinking teachers are their guardians. However, in such circumstances, we can’t let our children get an education. We want all the teachers to be replaced immediately.” Another girl’s mother said, “My daughter told me that the teacher used to take her to another room and remove all her clothes and touch her private parts. My daughter is just eight and she can’t lie. We want strict action against him.” The station house officer of the Bilaspur police station, Tej Veer Singh, told TOI, “Three girls have made a complaint against the teacher. He has been teaching in this school for the past four years and is married. He was immediately arrested after we received the complaint. We are questioning him and he will be sent to jail on Wednesday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/three-minor-girls-sexually-abused-by-shiksha-mitra-at-govt-school-in-rampur/articleshow/88016203.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Goyal has written several letters to the chief minister, sports minister and Rishikesh civic body to provide players like her with such facilities, but all her pleas fell on deaf ears. “It is important for a para-badminton athlete to practise on wooden surfaces since our wheelchairs can be damaged on a concrete floor within a week. A wheelchair costs a player around Rs 3-4 lakh, even the cheapest model comes for more than Rs 1 lakh. I have no option, so I am practising on a cemented road using a normal wheelchair. Whenever I try to hit a smash, I lose balance and can even fall or injure myself. My numerous letters written to various state government authorities, including the CM, over the years have failed to yield the desired results,” said Goyal. “All I want is a badminton court with wooden flooring, which is used for wheelchair-bound players in Rishikesh. Currently, there are a few wooden courts in Dehradun, but it is not possible for us to travel daily from Rishikesh to Dehradun. State government should encourage such athletes after seeing their brilliant performances in the Tokyo Paralympics. In fact, it was para-badminton player Manoj Sarkar who got Uttarakhand its first medal this year” Goyal is a WH2 category player (a player who requires a wheelchair to play and has impairment in one or both lower limbs). Polio followed by a serious injury after a fall rendered the player wheelchair-bound at the age of 16. The 41-year-old para-athlete has won a bronze medal at the National Para-Badminton Championship in Varanasi in 2018, and has won gold medals at the Uttarakhand State Paralympic Games 2019 and Khelo India State-Level Games. She has even participated at the International Para-Badminton Championship at Thailand in October 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/para-badminton-players-pleas-for-court-with-wooden-flooring-go-unheard/articleshow/88016198.cms||Mohammad Anab

Now, when she has been called back to office, she struggles with waking up early enough to rush through her morning routine and reach her workplace in time. Like her, several employees being called back to their offices are finding it tough to shake off the habits they had acquired while working from home. Mangesh Abdule, a HR executive at company that provides business process services, said, “Factors such as not connecting with colleagues on a regular basis and being distracted during shifts and so on has resulted in overall lack of focus among the workforce. Just like it took employees some time to get used to working from home, it will take some time for them to readjust to working from office again. In the meantime, we are coming up with fun activities to keep them engaged and bring the environment back to normal.” Joshua O’Brien, an HR at a multinational company, said, “After alcohol shops were allowed to open in the city last year, many employees posted photographs on social media with drinks along with their company laptops as the perks of working from home.

---||Lucknow||For VHP, Dec 6 to be a ‘routine affair’ this year||Lucknow: Sidestepping the common trend followed by some of the right wing organisations to raise the bogey of Hindutva, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad has decided to keep the forthcoming December 6 — the day when Babri Mosque was pulled down by a frenzied mob of Kar Sewaks in Ayodhya 29 years ago — a “routine affair” with “no special programme” scheduled on the day. Confirming the development, VHP national working president Alok Kumar said the parishad has decided against holding any special programme to mark the occasion. "There are a few things which become a routine affair. There is no need to make the occasion an extra spectacle," Kumar told TOI. The move comes amid Mathura police clamping Section 144 in the west UP district following a purported threat on social media by Hindu Mahasabha activists of installing an idol of Lord Krishna in Shahi Idgah on December 6. The police had warned of strict action against people who try to disturb peace. The development attains political significance in UP where the BJP has been seeking to pitch construction of Ram Temple as “delivery of a promise” in the run-up state polls due in the next few months. In fact, Ayodhya had attained much focus after BJP came to power in 2017 with Yogi Adityanath government organising “Deepotsav” in the temple town. VHP sources said the idea was "not to foment" the minority community more than two years after the Supreme Court ruled in favour of construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town. After Babri Masjid demolition, Hindu organisations, including the VHP, had been observing the anniversary as "Shaurya Diwas", while Muslim organisations remembered the incident as the 'Yaum-E-Gham'. VHP spokesperson in Ayodhya, Sharad Sharma said that a "general appeal" will be made to the people to light earthen lamps to mark the occasion. “The sankalp (determination) has attained siddhi (accomplishment). It is now something in our heart and soul,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/for-vhp-dec-6-to-be-a-routine-affair-this-year/articleshow/88017602.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||State’s average first dose vaccination 81%||Pune: The state achieved an average of 81% first dose vaccination and 43% of the eligible population were fully vaccinated till November 29. Over four crore beneficiaries had been fully vaccinated in Maharashtra till Tuesday, said additional chief secretary Dr Pradip Vyas. On Tuesday, a total of 11.32 lakh doses of Covid vaccines were administered in the state one a single day. The state had earlier set the goal of completing the first dose vaccination of the eligible people by November 30, but the progress of immunisation in five districts was still below par. The average first dose vaccination there was 62-67%, while 22 districts continued to be below the state average on administering both the doses (See graphics). Officials of the districts concerned have been told to step up vaccination and intensify the home-to-home programme. The vaccination rate picked up in the state in the last two weeks, after being on the lower side in the initial part of the month. On November 29, nearly 11 lakh vaccinations were carried out. On November 28, a Sunday, it was 3.19 lakh. “We have enough vaccine supply. We just need to ensure that all adult beneficiaries take their first and second doses in the stipulated time frame,” said a senior official of the state health department amid the new variant scare. Thirteen districts in the state, led by Mumbai and Pune, have fared well in the first dose vaccination, according to the data. Aurangabad, earlier at the bottom of the chart, had achieved 73% first dose vaccination, said another official. Continuous information, education and communication, persuasion and incentives had been put forth by the local administrations to encourage people to go for vaccination, said the official. The Centre earlier directed all the states not to use coercive methods to inoculate people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/states-average-first-dose-vaccination-81/articleshow/88016989.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The state government on Friday had announced financial aid of Rs50,000 each to kin or immediate relatives of people who lost their lives to Covid-19 through a GR. Officials said that once applications have been received, they would be scrutinised, and the amount disbursed within 30 days. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents and disbursed through the Aadhaar-linked direct benefit transfer procedure. As many as 1,40,891 people have succumbed to Covid in the state, according to the latest figures issued on November 27. The order was expected earlier in the month as the National Disaster Management Authority had directed states to disburse the amount through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The government has also appointed committees in every district under the additional collector to take care of any grievance redressal. Applications can be submitted at any common facilitation centres or ward offices designated by the local authorities, stated officials. Kin of Covid victims need to submit their claims through a form issued by the state authorities along with specific documents certifying the cause of death. The district disaster management authorities would ensure that the process of claim, verification, sanction, and disbursal is simple, robust, and people-friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/web-portal-for-covid-aid-to-be-ready-in-next-few-days/articleshow/88016986.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Calling it the priests’ victory, AAP's CM candidate Col Ajay Kothiyal (retd) said that state government has “accepted its mistake by repealing the controversial board”. "Former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat forcibly formed the Devasthanam Board during his tenure. It was constantly opposed by the priests. The former CM even insulted the entire priest community by calling them selfish," said Kothiyal. He added that AAP has been vehemently opposing the formation of the Devasthanam Board and even promised to dissolve it if voted to power in the forthcoming elections. Party’s state in-charge Dinesh Mohaniya also congratulated the priest community in Uttarakhand, saying that sensing defeat in the elections, the BJP was forced to take the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-govt-should-apologise-to-priests-for-harassing-them-aap/articleshow/88016215.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Lack of proof: Two accused in northeast Delhi riots discharged||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has discharged two accused in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying that there was no sufficient evidence on record to frame charges of rioting and arson against them. Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat pointed out that there was only one witness in the case and as per law laid down by the Supreme Court in a judgement, it is mandatory that there should be at least two prosecution witnesses to identify the role and involvement of the accused in the incident in question. The court discharged Parvej and Ashraf in the case related to rioting, causing injuries to the public looting and setting ablaze of the houses/shops in Shiv Vihar area on February 24, 2020. It said as per the contentions of the prosecution itself contained in the chargesheet, the evidence produced against the two accused was the eyewitness account of Ajeet Kumar Tomar apart from their disclosure statements. “It is elementary that the disclosure statements of the two accused are not admissible in the evidence in view of the bar created by Section 25 of the Evidence Act as no incriminating fact has been discovered in pursuance to these statements,” it said in its order on November 29. It said that when an unlawful assembly or a large number of people take part in arson or in a clash between two groups, in order to convict a person, at least two prosecution witnesses have to support and identify the role and involvement of the person concerned. “There is only one witness i.e. the complainant and he too has not described the role of the accused in the incident. Charges cannot be framed against the accused upon taking into account the material annexed with the chargesheet on the basis of which there is no possibility of the conviction of the accused at the final stage. It would be a sheer wastage of judicial time if the charges are to be framed against the accused upon consideration of the evidence on record on the basis of which he has to be acquitted later on,” it further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lack-of-proof-two-accused-in-ne-riots-discharged/articleshow/88017604.cms||Usha Das

The FIR was registered after the management failed to clear Rs 387-crore pending dues to cane farmers, who had staged protests outside the mill on several occasions. “An FIR was registered under relevant IPC sections for cheating, criminal breach of trust, and criminal conspiracy, besides sections 3 and 7 of the Essential Commodities Act at the Palia police station based on the complaint of Palia's Cooperative Cane Development Committee secretary, Rajesh Kumar Singh, on the DM's directions," said an officer. The three officials who have been named in the FIR are the mill's finance manager, Manoj Kumar Mishra, general manager (cane), Sunil Kumar Dhingra, and an executive, Pradeep Salar, said the police. The DM told TOI, “The government's priority is to ensure that the dues are cleared on time. We spoke with the sugar mill officials on multiple occasions and requested them to clear the pending dues but they didn’t take it seriously so we ordered an FIR against three officials.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/fir-against-3-officials-of-sugar-mill-for-not-clearing-cane-dues/articleshow/88016218.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Association state president B R Jayalakshmi told TOI that the organisation with nearly 1.3 lakh members has already approached the State Legal Services Authority to seek legal recourse for their demands. Though anganwadi workers are appointed under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) through the department of women and child development, they are made to work for other departments too, Jayalakshmi said. “We have already held discussions with the Karnataka Legal Services Authority with regard to our problems. The association has already submitted all documents pertaining to the appointment of anganwadi workers and helpers to the authority. We do not get sufficient time to look after children in anganwadis, as we have been given additional jobs in other departments. During the pandemic, anganwadi workers walked the extra mile to implement government measures. Appointed under the ICDS, we are supposed to work in coordination with other departments. However, various departments have been making us work for them forcefully. Hence, our demand is that the jobs of other departments should not be given to us. In addition, pension benefits should be made available, and our honorarium should be increased based on the consumer price index,” she said. In Karnataka, there are more than 64,000 anganwadi centres, where nearly 1.3 lakh members are working. Currently, anganwadi workers get Rs 10,000 and helpers receive Rs 5,000 per month. Though the government has fixed 60 years as the retirement age for anganwadi workers and helpers in 2011, they get a lump sum of only Rs 50,000 and Rs 30,000, respectively, after retirement, and there are no pension benefits. The State Legal Services Authority has agreed to fight for our association’s cause , she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/overburdened-anganwadi-workers-mull-legal-recourse/articleshow/88016220.cms||---

The eight-day-old carcass was noticed by farmer Mahesh Kothiram Popatkar at Manora. Deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada said all the body parts of the decomposed carcass were intact, hence poaching is ruled out. “During the post-mortem, no signs of electrocution were found. The power line is 200 metres away from the spot where the tiger was found dead,” he said. Veterinarians, who conducted the post-mortem, were not sure about the exact cause of death. Ribs and bones on the left side were broken. The vets remained inconclusive and cited three reasons for death. “It may be a territorial fight, virus, or snake bite,” they said. However, wildlife experts say if ribs have been broken, it can also be a road-hit case. The tiger may have been hit by a speeding vehicle. It somehow managed to cross the road and died in the farm due to severe internal injuries, they say. The experts added, natural death mostly occurs in remote areas. In this case, the tiger was found in an agriculture field raising doubts. “Even in case of territorial fight, growling and roaring can be heard from a long distance. In fights, there are severe injuries on the face, neck, and shoulder,” the experts pointed out. However, ACF Narendra Chandewar said, “Till the forensic report of the samples is not received, it is difficult to conclude the cause of death.” “When a post-mortem fails to find the exact cause of death, and vets remain inconclusive, territorial fight is the reason put forward. Two days ago, a six-year-old tigress was found dead in Karwa in Ballarshah. As veterinarians failed to conclude the exact reason then also and it was termed as a territorial fight,” said wildlife conservationists. “The distance of the tiger that was found dead in Manora was told to be 2km from Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary. In the press note issued on Tuesday, the spot where the tiger died is said to be hardly 350 metres from the sanctuary. This indicates that the field staff doesn’t even know their boundaries,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/post-mortem-of-tiger-found-dead-in-farm-inconclusive/articleshow/88016995.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The FDA is motivating them to register for Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) certification, meant to ensure compliance with the hygiene criteria. FDA is also planning visits to schools and college campuses to check food safety standards at canteens after they reopen on December 1. As part of the drive, FDA collected 57 samples from Gokulpeth market last week. Samples will also be collected from Cotton Market and Kalamna Market. The sampling was done under one of the six components, ‘Clean fruit and vegetable market’, of the ‘Eat right campaign’. The other five components that would be focus in the coming month are ‘eat right campus’, ‘hygiene rating’, ‘clean street food hub’, ‘eat right schools’ and ‘Bhog’ (Blissful holy offerings before the God) at shrines. The deadline to ensure all these places meet the safety, hygienic and nutritious food standards is December 31. “FDA officials will also conduct training on how to get registered for FSSAI certification and also meet the hygiene, safety and nutrition standard for foods,” said assistant commissioner of FDA Abhay Deshpande. “The owners would need to register, self assess hygiene standard of his or her business, and send it to us for audit and scrutiny. We would provide them improvements and suggestions. Later, their assessment would also be examined by FSSAI empannelled food safety assessors,” he said, adding much focus would be laid on canteen food at schools and colleges where hygience and nutrition is of utmost importance. “Eat right campaign was started several months ago but discontinued due to Covid. It is part of the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ programme,” said Deshpande, who is working under the supervision of joint commissioner Suresh Annapure. FDA would work in coordination with NMC zones while working on the ‘Clean street food hub’ component. FDA has also cracked down upon pan kiosks near Nagpur railway station premises on November 26, and seized prohibited tobacco products worth over Rs9,000. The FDA has also registered six offences against pan kiosk owners at Sitabuldi police station for delivering poisonous food materials. “Similar checks on tobacco sellers, especially ‘kharra’ vendors, would also be conducted within 100 meters of schools and colleges,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/school-canteens-markets-under-fda-lens-in-eat-right-campaign/articleshow/88016859.cms||---

The single bench of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari directed the officer to file the report by December 21, when the case will next be heard. Earlier in 2018, the court had ordered to give licences to registered vendors in Pant Park and demarcate a 6X4 feet area for them to conduct business. However, the order was not followed and as a consequence, more and more unregistered vendors -- besides the 121 registered ones -- started operating from the area. This also led to road congestion. Therefore, advocate Nitin Karki filed a contempt petition against the Nainital district administration and municipality in the high court. On Tuesday, Nainital district magistrate submitted his response in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/was-the-order-on-registered-vendors-in-nainitals-pant-park-area-followed-hc-asks-nainital-nagar-palika-officer/articleshow/88016230.cms||---

On Monday, the Esplanade Court sent the accused, Shailendra Bharti (29), to judicial custody. Cyber police froze Bharti’s six bank accounts and found more than Rs1 crore that he had similarly swindled out of other job seekers over the past one-and-half years.

In her complaint, Vidya said: “He even arranged a telephonic interview for the job.” In order to avoid raising suspicions, he didn’t ask her to pay the money in lumpsum; he made her transfer instalments to different bank accounts over a long period between September 9, 2018, and October 10, 2020, on the pretext of processing the offer.

While 60 pregnant women had tested positive for HIV infection in 2007-08, the number has come down to only two this year, till October. Health officials attribute the contributions of 20 holistic counselling and testing centres, two integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) under PPP mode, two antiretroviral therapy centres (ART) and 13 link ART centres in the district, for a decline in cases. In addition, 93 Red Ribbon Clubs also have been made functional in colleges to create awareness on HIV/AIDS in the district. District health and family welfare officer Dr Kishore Kumar M said that HIV infection among pregnant women has come down to 0.04% in Karnataka and 0.01 % in Dakshina Kannada. “In Dakshina Kannada, 60 pregnant women had tested positive for HIV infection in 2007-08, which has come down to two this year, till date.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Love jihad, conversions on Hindu meet agenda||LUCKNOW: Though touted to be completely apolitical, the 12-point agenda of Hindu Ekta Mahakumbh, scheduled to be held in Chitrakoot on December 15-16, has all the ingredients which can give a political overtone to discussions. Among the issues that would come up for discussion are religious conversions and love jihad which may influence the political discourse in the state that would go to polls early next year. According to sources, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in the capacity of head priest of Gorakhnath Temple, will address a session of the Hindu Ekta Mahakumbh, which is being claimed to be the biggest conglomeration of Hindu saints and seers from across the country. The ‘mahakumbh’ is being organised by Padma Vibhushan Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya. Though it is being claimed that around 5 lakh saints and seers from across the country will be present in Chitrakoot on December 15, at least one lakh seers from all sects are expected to attend the programme. The theme of the event is “Chaahe panth anek ho, saare Hindu ek ho (All Hindus are one irrespective of different sects)”. The topics of discussions include ‘Shri Ram Temple – A symbol of national respect’, solution and problems related to administrative control on mutts and temples of Hindus, religious conversion – an international conspiracy, need for population control law, nationalism and uniform civil code, love jihad – deviation of youths and its solution, need for Indian philosophy-based education, deaddiction, cow protection, social harmony, demonization of Hindu religion through various means of publicity, and environment-oriented cultural rejuvenation. The RSS, the BJP and other Hindu organisations have been raising the issues of cow protection, love jihad, population control law, uniform civil code and religious conversions on various platforms. Since these issues have remained close to the RSS, the mahakumbh is likely to have political implications too in view of the participation of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and CM Yogi Adityanath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/love-jihad-conversions-on-hindu-meet-agenda/articleshow/88017620.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

A senior IPS officer said, prima facie, it appears that there was dereliction of duty, and a default report has been submitted to the Navi Mumbai police commissioner for appropriate action. The Navi Mumbai police have reportedly recorded their statements. It was found that the escort team did not warn Waze not to interact with Singh without permission of Justice Chandiwal or the court that had sent him to jail custody. Former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino and Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe had taken strong objection over the meeting, while Walse Patil too had said that it was wrong on the part of both Singh and Waze to meet without permission of the competent authority. Initially, the duo had claimed that they had permission, but when Waze was specifically asked as to who had given him the nod, he had no answer. On Tuesday, additional police personnel were deployed to ensure that witnesses do not interact with each other without permission of the competent authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/report-dereliction-of-duty-by-wazes-cop-escorts-allowed-him-to-meet-singh/articleshow/88017631.cms||---
---||Goa||Panchayat’s action of destroying ground is a blow to Goan football, says FC Goa TD Derrick Pereira||Panaji: The acts of ‘premeditated vandalism’ at Salvador do Mundo panchayat ground has sowed seeds of doubts in the minds of FC Goa, who were eager to develop similar grounds across the state. The developed ground at Salvador do Mundo – used by the club for its training since last season – was the first of ‘Field of Dreams’, an ambitious club project that aimed to provide better infrastructure to budding footballers. Eight such grounds were identified across the state. “When you invest so much to develop the ground and reach out to the community, look what you get in return,” Derrick Pereira, the club’s technical director and among the football greats in Goa, told TOI on Wednesday. “The panchayat has not just dug up the ground and done a disservice to its own community, they have delivered a huge blow to Goan football.” Goa had inked a three-year memorandum of understanding with the village panchayat of Salvador do Mundo on May 29, 2020. According to the MoU, The club was to develop the ground, while the panchayat would provide “exclusive access to the club to use the existing ground for its footballing activities.” Goa spent almost Rs 1 crore on developing the two grounds – one for their own use and the other for locals – and trained at the venue last season from October till May. But on Sunday, with a new sarpanch at the helm, “the football pitch was destroyed as the turf was dug up and later filled with concrete.” The panchayat has claimed that they do not get any revenue from Goa training there. The “local boys” – in the words of sarpanch Antonio Fernandes – dug up the ground to prepare a cricket pitch. “People need to understand that this ground belongs to the panchayat and not FC Goa. Once the three-year agreement ends, the ground goes back to the panchayat. The club is not paying rent only for the first three years because there was substantial cost involved in developing the two grounds, besides maintenance,” said Pereira. Pereira is among the rare footballers to win the biggest trophies in Indian football – I-League and Federation Cup – as player and coach. The lack of progress in Goan football – exit from the Santosh Trophy qualifiers against Gujarat, for example – is hurting everyone, and even plans for a secure future are being scuppered. “As a club, we are trying to improve infrastructure, trying to send our coaches to different villages to improve Goan football. This action of the panchayat creates a very negative image,” said Pereira. The club has now shifted their training base to the Sesa FA ground in Sirsaim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-action-of-destroying-ground-is-a-blow-to-goan-football-says-fc-goa-td-derrick-pereira/articleshow/88038046.cms||---

Her parents tried to get her treated for type 1 diabetes complications at public and private hospitals in the state, spending Rs 1.5 lakh in the process. By the time they reached PGI, over 300kms away from their home, the girl had gone into ketoacidosis, a diabetes complication which has severe neurological fallout later in life. Doctors here receive two to three such cases every year. Ironically, the condition could have been easily managed in any district hospital without resulting in such a complication. “We have been with our daughter here for one month now. She was unconscious when she was rushed to PGI but now she is recovering. No one could even detect that she had type 1 diabetes,” said Krishan Dev, father of the girl, who runs a tea stall. The family had to spend a lot and needlessly travel from one place to the other, during which time Kushi’s condition deteriorated and she had to be wheeled into the PGI emergency. “She still cannot walk without support. We have been told by doctors that sooner or later, her brain will be affected,” said Beena, the patient’s mother. Recounting their ordeal, Beena said, “When she started losing weight, we got her examined. She was advised to eat a good diet but nothing changed. We had to take her to the government hospital in Kathua, but since we had to run around a lot there, we went to a private hospital in Pathankot. Her type 1 diabetes was detected there and we were referred to PGI.” Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids. It can lead to swelling in the brain. “This complication is preventable. Had there been a trained doctor in any small set up, there was no need for the family to travel so far,” said Prof Devi Dayal, department of paediatrics, who examines endocrine disorders in children in PGI. “To manage this complication, one needs rigorous monitoring when fluids and intravenous insulin are given simultaneously,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/10-year-old-battles-serious-diabetic-complication-at-pgi/articleshow/88017022.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The percentage of men who believe that using condoms on a regular basis minimises their risk of contracting HIV has also dropped from 81% to 75% in the same period. Interestingly, 30.7% of Telangana women have become aware of the link between contraception and STDs in 2019-2020. In 2015-16, only 29.5% of women were aware of the issue. The data covering many aspects of awareness shows that the percentage of men with knowledge of the benefits of using contraceptive methods to prevent (HIV/AIDS), has decreased by 20% in the last five years. The percentage of men (75.3) between the ages of 15-49, who are aware that consistent condom use can reduce the chance of getting HIV/AIDS, has decreased by 6.2% in the last five years. However, 9.2% of women have become aware of the same issue during the period, at a percentage of 68.9. According to the data by National AIDS Control Organization (NACO)’s HIV Estimation of 2019, Telangana recorded 1.58 lakh cases, the 6th highest in the country preceded by Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh, and Meghalaya. Experts demand a public awareness campaign on this issue, as more women will face violence as a result of men’s lack of understanding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/risk-from-hiv/aids-high-but-awareness-among-t-men-dips/articleshow/88017015.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Jaipur||Raj’s 1st unicorn CarDekho bets on used car malls to drive growth||Recently, when GirnarSoft (better known as CarDekho) raised $235 million with a valuation of $1.2 billion, it became the first unicorn in Rajasthan. But when Amit and Anurag Jain, brothers who share the same date of birth and separated by two years, relocated to Jaipur in 2006, they had no idea of the dream journey. They came here to stay with the family and attend to their ailing father, leaving behind well-paid jobs in Bangalore. “After our father passed away in 2006, we tried to look after his gemstone trading business. After six month into it, we found that technology is where our heart is,” recalls Amit. Amit was working for Trilogy incubating new ideas before he came to Jaipur. He already had successes with portals like yourbillbuddy.com that matched customer’s phone bills and offered the best service pack from the operator. Anurag was a programmer at Sabre, a technology company that served airlines. They knew technology and had contacts. That’s how they came around to setting up GirnarSoft, initially doing projects for others. “Jaipur did not have a great IT talent pool as it has now. To overcome the handicap, we started training college students in different programming languages and inducted them in our operations,” recalls Anurag. In the first year of the operation they made some profits and wanted to gift a BMW car to their grandfather. “We searched online for information about cars, but could not find anything. So, Anurag and I went to the auto expo in Delhi. We collected brochures and coded them into a platform so that buyers can have information on the net. That’s how CarDekho was born in 2008,” says Amit. “The venture needed new product ideas for scaling as the IT services business could only scale on manpower. We were a technology company at heart and India was getting ready for online businesses. We started building products - online portals for various categories with our technology prowess. For CarDekho, it meant creating quality content related to information about cars, exact prices and specifications. We did reviews and comparisons as well. By 2010, the website had attracted a lot of traffic. That’s when people started noticing us. While advertising revenues started coming in, we monetized the customer leads by selling them to partner OEM and dealers,” says Anurag, also an IITian from Delhi like Amit. With prospects expanding for CarDekho, in 2013 it raised funding for the first time at a valuation of $50 million (today, it has a commission revenue of Rs 1,000 crore). In 2015, it acquired Zigwheels.com and Gaadi.com paving its entry into the used car market. “After acquiring Gaadi.com, we started meeting dealers. The issue of financing came up. Banks used to take 10-12 days to finance cars, while loan approval rate was 40%. We tied up with banks and did technology integration. As a result the loan approval rate improved to 75%, while turnaround time reduced to 4-5 days. That expanded the business. Now, we are the largest lender of used cars as a platform with Rs 300 crore a month,” says Amit. Today 4.4 million cars are sold in the country which is expected to hit 8 million by 2026. Amit says, “Only 20% cars get financed, leaving a huge scope for growth.” After selling cars and offering financing, the opportunity for providing insurance was a natural progression that they seized. “As a broker, InsuranceDekho has a premium collection of Rs 130 crore. We started with auto, but added health and life products later which constitute 8% of the business. Non-auto insurance is also poised to grow big. We expect InsuranceDekho to grow 10 fold, to Rs 1,000 crore in next 10 years,” says Amit. The current focus is to buy and sell used cars. “Earlier, we used to sell cars from/to dealers. A dealer would have around 15-20 variants. With used car malls, first of which came up in Jaipur, we give buyers options to choose from 400-500 cars. We will have 18 malls in the next nine months . We give warranty for six months and buyers can return in seven days if they don’t like,” says Amit. It’s an investment heavy business as the company has to keep stock of a large number of cars and also set up refurbishment centres. But Amit says they will go after the segment to reach a revenue milestone of about Rs 3,500 crore in the next three years. As to the IPO of the company, Amit says the company will hit the market in the next 12-18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajs-1st-unicorn-cardekho-bets-on-used-car-malls-to-drive-growth/articleshow/88000183.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Lucknow||Will parties on coalition course defy trends of past 3 polls?||Lucknow: Even as Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav is trying to cobble together a coalition of smaller parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party, political experts point to the trends in the past three elections which say that people of UP have voted for a majority government since 2007. Although SP has tried to disturb caste equations which were favourable for the BJP by aligning with the latter's ex-ally Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party and eyeing a pre-poll pact with the RLD in west UP, the recent records of coalitions in the state must be giving some solace to the saffron party, experts believe. According to political analysts, people’s clear choice is only because of the failure of governments before 2007 to complete a five-year term as a coalition government. Unsuccessful government coalitions began in the state in 1967 when Chaudhary Charan Singh, after leaving the Congress, formed the Bharatiya Kranti Dal (BKD) and formed his government. Interestingly, the government had both Jan Sangh and Communist Party as coalition partners. However, it fell in less than one year. Again a few MLAs, who left Congress, formed a government led by Tribhuvan Narain Singh. This government was also supported by Jan Sangh. However, the government could hardly run for six months. Another coalition experiment was carried out in 1977 but it also failed. In yet another experiment, those Opposing Congress first formed a coalition under Janmorcha and later Janta Dal. In UP, a coalition government led by Mulayam Singh Yadav was formed in 1989. However, even that government was short-lived. Such coalition experiments went on until 2007, but none could complete five-year terms. This also included Mulayam joining hands with Kanshiram-led BSP and BSP joining hands with the BJP. Fed up with coalition governments’ failures, people went for a clear mandate in the 2007 Assembly elections and Mayawati-led BSP was able to form a majority government. The government completed five years in office before losing to the Samajwadi Party, which also formed a majority government under Akhilesh Yadav in 2012 and completed a five-year term. It was replaced by Yogi Adityanath-led BJP in 2017. Interestingly, the BJP also had forged an alliance with Om Prakash Rajbhar-led SBSP in 2017 assembly elections. Even though the BJP managed to get a majority on its own, the alliance broke midway with Rajbhar resigning as cabinet minister and has since then pledged to uproot the BJP government in UP. To defeat the BJP, Akhilesh has again decided to forge alliances with smaller parties, including Rajbhar's SBSP. His experiment would be put to test against the trends in the past three elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-parties-on-coalition-course-defy-trends-of-past-3-polls/articleshow/88017635.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Nagpur||Private vehicles pose safety threat at ZP school in Wadi||Nagpur: Students of a zilla parishad (ZP) school in Wadi find themselves at risk due to entry of private vehicles on the open ground they share with other government offices. An education official, on the condition of anonymity, shared videos and photos with TOI that show free movement of bikes and cars right in front of the ZP school. The official said the office of patwari, Aadhar enrolment and health department are located on this campus. “Due to this there is constant movement of vehicles which are driven haphazardly. Kids are known to be erratic while walking or running on the open ground, and this poses a serious threat to their safety,” he added. The official said that apart from physical injury, there could be bigger dangers looming. “How do we know that only genuine people are coming here. There could be paedophiles, anti-social elements etc doing the rounds and keeping an eye on students. It could lead to a very serious situation,” he said. ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar said he will look into the issue. “I will go through the videos, photos and also ask my officials to look into this on priority,” said Kumbhejkar. The employee who shared the video and photos with TOI said the crowd menace is increasing day by day. “As the virus threat has declined, rush at these centres has increased. They are littering the area and sometimes using bad words on phone, which parents and children hear while walking by,” the official said. In rural area, school reopening has got a good response due to which attendance is high. “As more students keep coming back to campus, the authorities must shift all these offices out of here,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/private-vehicles-pose-safety-threat-at-zp-school-in-wadi/articleshow/88017018.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||NIA custody most traumatic time of my life, forced to sign documents: Sachin Waze||MUMBAI: Dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze on Tuesday told the Justice K U Chandiwal Commission that while he was in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), it was the most traumatic time of his life. During cross-examination by former home minister Anil Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino, Waze said he was arrested by the NIA on March 13, and there was pressure and an uncomfortable situation for him in the NIA custody. “During the said traumatic period, several central agencies recorded my statement. In those 28 days, NIA was causing harassment, humiliation and I say, the trauma is still there,” Waze claimed. The state government set up the commission to probe into former Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh’s ‘letter bomb’ of March 20 to the chief minister. Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Waze to mobilise every month Rs 100 crore from restaurants and bars in Mumbai for him. Singh’s lawyer Abhinav Chandrachud has already told the commission that the letter is based on hearsay, and based on information given by his colleagues and subordinates. Waze informed the commission that he does not have documents and evidence to substantiate his affidavit. However, on March 3, he had requested the NIA court to furnish him copies of documents and the panchanama, which were not supplied. “I volunteer, I was forced to sign various documents under duress by the NIA authority,” Waze said. His cross-examination will continue on Wednesday. Earlier, during the cross-examination by Shekhar Jagtap, counsel for Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande, Waze had told the commission that Palande had never asked him for money for any reason. Soon after the commission resumed for the day, Waze sought the permission of Justice Chandiwal for an interaction with Deshmukh. In view of the row over the closed-door Singh-Waze meeting on Monday, Justice Chandiwal asked both Deshmukh and Waze to submit an application in writing. Deshmukh then told the commission that he is not interested in interacting with Waze, following which even Waze did not submit an application. Meanwhile, the Chandiwal commission imposed a cost of Rs 15,000 on Deshmukh for seeking an adjournment on Tuesday. The panel asked Deshmukh to deposit the amount in the CM’s relief fund for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-custody-most-traumatic-time-of-my-life-forced-to-sign-docus-in-mumbai-waze/articleshow/88018730.cms||---
---||Delhi||Same-sex marriages: Plea for live-streaming of case proceedings||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the Centre to respond to a plea by LGBTQ couples seeking live-streaming of proceedings on a batch of petitions to recognise same-sex marriages on the ground that the matter is of great national and Constitutional importance. The high court also issued notices on three more fresh petitions by same-sex couples seeking recognition of their marriages under the special, Hindu and foreign marriage laws. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh granted the Centre time to take instructions on the matter and file replies on the three fresh petitions and the application for live-streaming of proceedings. It listed the matter for further hearing on February 3. One of the two petitions was filed by a lesbian couple who claimed to have already solemnised their marriage at Varanasi in February 2018 and sought legal recognition of the union. The other one was filed by a transgender person who has undergone gender reassignment surgery and entered into a civil union with her husband in South Africa and seeks recognition of the marriage. The application for live-streaming of proceedings was filed in the pending petition of Abhijit Iyer Mitra by Akhilesh Godi, Prasad Raj Dandekar and Shripad Ranade, residents of Karnataka and Mumbai. It sought direction to the high court registry to make arrangements to live-stream the final arguments of this case via YouTube or any other platform. Senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, representing the applicants, submitted that in view of the rights involved, live-streaming of proceedings is essential as it concerns 7-8% of the total population of the country. The senior lawyer submitted that his clients represent a large section of the public who are eagerly looking forward to the outcome of these cases and are unable to do so due to limitations of technical platforms. He said millions of citizens would be keen to watch these proceedings from different corners of the globe. Providing sufficient links during virtual hearings may not be feasible, and bandwidth constraints will most certainly arise. Appearing for another set of petitioners, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi contended that when the law has recognised transgender and LGBTQ people, the next logical step is to recognise their union. Petitions contend that marriages between same-sex couples are not possible despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts and sought a declaration to recognise same-sex marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Special Marriage Act (SMA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/same-sex-marriages-plea-for-live-streaming-of-case-proceedings/articleshow/88017639.cms||---
---||Nagpur||BJP MP raises Vid statehood issue in Lok Sabha||Nagpur: The government on Tuesday laid to rest all speculations on long-pending demand of Vidarbha protagonists to grant statehood to the region.A query in this regard was raised by BJP MP in Lok Sabha Ashok Nete through an unstarred question. He asked the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government on steps taken to carve separate Vidarbha state from Maharashtra. He also sought answers from the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on details of any such proposal received and reasons if it was declined.In reply, minister of state for home Nityanad Rai categorically made it clear that “no such proposal is under consideration with the government”.“Demands and representations are received from time to time from various individuals and organizations for creation of new states. Creation of a new state has wide ramifications and has a direct bearing on the federal polity of our country. The government takes any such decision after taking into consideration all relevant factors, and only when there is a broad consensus on the issue,” he added.The Vidarbha protagonists flayed the BJP government for misleading the parliament. Former advocate general Shreehari Aney pointed out that three MPs had earlier tabled private member bills for demanding separation of Vidarbha from Maharashtra.“If misleading statements are made at the floor of the house, it amounts to breach of trust as per law. The minister must explain why he did not reveal the truth when three bills were tabled in the past. At least it was not expected from the BJP MP since his party had passed a resolution for Vidarbha state in their executive committee meeting in Bhubaneswar in 1998. The topic was also included in their manifesto of LS polls in the same year,” Aney said.Maha Vidarbha Janjagaran convenor Nitin Ronghe condemned the minister’s statement stating that people here believed their leaders Union minister Nitin Gadkari and opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, both favourites of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), would have raised the topic with BJP’s top brass. “Both used this issue to gain power. Vidarbha is a cursed land of selfish leaders who use the statehood demand for their vested interests,” he said.Aney said the first private bill was tabled by MPCC chief Nana Patole when he was BJP MP from Bhandara-Gondia. The second was tabled by former Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Darda and the third was by Nete. The Gadchiroli MP had introduced the ‘Commission for the Formation of the State of Vidarbha Bill, 2014’ that sought setting up of a commission for formation of separate Vidarbha by re-organisation of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjp-mp-raises-vid-statehood-issue-in-lok-sabha/articleshow/88017042.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

However, these places/activities will continue to remain barred in rural parts of the district.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Tuesday issued an order for implementation of the new guidelines issued by the state government on November 27. In the new guidelines, the government had allowed timings and activities prevailed before the commencement of the Covid-19 pandemic, and made fully vaccination mandatory.NMC deputy commissioner Nirbhay Jain told TOI, “The government order clearly stated that new guidelines would supersede all earlier diktats related to imposition of restrictions for preventing the transmission of the virus. Thus, the government has discontinued orders imposing restrictions on coaching classes, swimming pools, water parks etc and hence these are allowed in the city with immediate effect.”Considering the spike in cases and announcing beginning of the second wave, guardian minister Nitin Raut had on February 22 took a decision to close down schools, colleges, coaching classes, training institutes and weekly vegetable markets from February 23. Majority of the activities were allowed to resume in May. Schools for Std-8 to 12 had restarted in the city and from Std-5 to 12 in rural areas, but coaching classes were not allowed to reopen.The civic chief had allowed coaching classes on August 8, but closed them on August 15 citing no orders from the government.Collector R Vimala issued order on November 29 for implementation of the new guidelines in rural parts of the district. “There are no instructions from the government for reopening of coaching classes, swimming pools and water parks in rural and hence not allowed,” she said.As per directives of the government, the civic chief and collector along with police department will start levying penalty on those using handkerchief as mask instead of a proper one.President of association of coaching institutes Rajnikant Bondre said, “We are thankful to mayor and municipal commissioner. Almost all other states had allowed coaching classes to reopen long back. Closure of coaching classes for a long period resulted in setback for students. Now, we should be able to cover lost ground from now onwards. I request the collector to also allow coaching classes in rural areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/coaching-classes-swimming-pools-allowed-in-city-not-in-rural-areas/articleshow/88016706.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Jaipur||Boy who failed in Class 8th becomes founder of bank with `40,000cr m-cap||For the founder of AU Small Bank Sanjay Agarwal, enjoying the game is more important than the result. He has no regrets about having missed playing cricket at higher levels. What he counts is the life lessons the dynamic game has taught him. Born into a family that prized education, Sanjay was an outlier. His father, who passed away recently, retired as chief engineer of Rajasthan State Electricity Board. His uncle was a doctor. When he failed in Class 8, it did not come as a surprise given his obsession with cricket. “English was my undoing. It affected my confidence and other subjects. After I changed to Hindi medium in Class 9, I gained back the mojo, becoming school captain for badminton and cricket. Games taught me fighting spirit, discipline, hard work, calmness, and respect for rules (umpires) and molded me to what I am today,” explains Sanjay. Opting for commerce in college might have felt a lazy choice initially, but he discovered an interest in accounting, statistics and business planning. He passed out with a 66% marks but his happiness dissipated fast. He found himself at the crossroads, whether to play or do anything else. “My father told me I cannot be a Tendulkar and sent me to a CA firm, a son of his close friend was running,” says Sanjay. The next morning, he picked up the cricket kit and went to the SMS stadium where he used to play. “At one corner of the stadium some boys were doing net practice. I went there, left my cricket kit and came home. From that day I stopped playing. But till today, I live the game as I intuitively draw cricket analogies to every situation and find answers to complex issues, be it in life or business,” says Sanjay. At CA firm Anil Bafna & Co, Sanjay found his true calling. He was a loyal, diligent and blue-eyed boy of ‘Anil sir’. “I liked the practical knowledge of preparing financial statements, audits, compliances, etc. Then the idea of becoming CA and doing business got seeded,” says Sanjay. Clearing CA was tough as he failed twice. He even had a nervous breakdown. “I still cannot believe how I secured a place in the merit list. After CA, I got selected for a job in Mumbai but decided to stay in Jaipur and start something of my own,” says Sanjay. He had no capital. He approached businessmen in the city who had money to invest but not avenues. “In 1996, I was 25. I knew people wouldn’t give me money. So, I convinced five people, including my uncle, and set up NBFCs in their names. I guaranteed them return and they were required to invest as per my suggestions. I used to get a small fee,” recalls Sanjay. It went on for 5-6 years when he would finance people for buying trucks, jeeps and later cars. He even owned a truck company, ventured into garment exporting and had set up a granite factory in 1996. “It was maddening, a bit like being overpowered with some force, scattering myself over too many businesses. In 2000, I went to London as my sister Aruna was being treated there for cancer. Away from the businesses, I realized that I should focus on finance. Though we could not save her, I came back as a reformed man. I exited from all businesses and stuck to finance,” recalls Sanjay. Around 2002, the real estate was witnessing a boom. The investors in the NBFCs wanted him to pay higher returns but finance is a long-term play. “I paid them back and exited from all the finance companies but my uncle offered me his company L N Finco Gems Pvt Ltd which would become Au Financiers in 2005,” he says. By then Sanjay had built a reputation as a financer. In 2002, the defining moment arrived when HDFC Bank partnered with him. “It was a turning point in our journey. We got funds from them for priority sector lending. From Rajasthan, we expanded to other states,” says Sanjay. The success had created ambitions in him to grow big. But he needed capital. “I had the option to remain small with 100% ownership or have less stake and grow bigger. I chose the later. That’s how we hit another milestone, raising Rs 30 crore from Motilal Oswal Private Equity in 2009. That has been the AU story,” says Sanjay. For Sanjay, the deal was a defining moment not only for the funds, but for Raamdeo Agrawal, co-founder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. “He still remains my guiding angel. When he invested, in a hall packed with investors, he declared that Sanjay Agarwal will become the first citizen of the state in 10 years.” After vehicles, AU came across the same customers who wanted insurance and later loans for their houses. He ventured into both segments with Au Insurance Broking Services and Au Housing Finance Ltd. But he had to sell the companies after AU got the Small Finance Bank (SFB) licence. The big moment for him remains the listing of AU. “Listing means public acceptance of your acumen, governance, best practices, integrity, etc. During the roadshows leading up to the IPO, I felt like marrying off my company. I wish I could do it again. I learnt so much. I went to San Francisco, New York, Houston, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and spoke in Gujarati in Ahmedabad. I wish I could have taken other pillars of my company like Uttam Tibrewal and Deepak Jain during the roadshows,” he says. And the rest is history as the stock closed on the first day of the trading with a bang, rising from Rs 358 a share to Rs 541. “Today, we are the number one bank by a huge margin among the 10 SFBs. But in a breathtaking journey like this, the sacrifices my wife has made cannot be measured and explained,” says Sanjay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/boy-who-failed-in-class-8th-becomes-founder-of-bank-with-40000cr-m-cap/articleshow/88000233.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

---||Delhi||Open-book tests for DU 5th semester begin as glitches largely ironed out||New Delhi: Open-book examinations for students of the fifth semester at Delhi University (DU) began on Tuesday. This is the fifth phase of this format of exams being conducted by the university since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. The first OBE was held in August last year. The first couple of times when OBE was implemented, being a new system, the students faced some issues like technical glitches while writing papers and submitting answer scripts. In the OBE held this June, around 350 students were also hauled for using “unfair means” while taking the examinations. According to senior officials of the university, around 1.49 lakh students were warned of the consequences of resorting to unfair means before the exams. “A system is in place to detect copying or use of unfair means in the examination. Over 350 students caught using unfair means in June had their paper or whole semester cancelled,” the communication from DU's examination department read. While most of the technical glitches have now been ironed out, university professors remain uncertain over the learning patterns and assessment outcomes of this mode of examinations for students. Many argue that the OBE has taken a toll on the “essence of examinations”, with students not having the proper approach. Kumar Ashutosh, professor at the department of tourism at the College of Vocational Studies, said, “Usually students are worried before examinations are held, but now that factor has vanished as they know that they’ll be able to manage somehow. Recently, when we held a doubt-clearing class, only 25 out of 120 students attended. They are now relaxed knowing they can refer to their books at any point.” Ashutosh, who teaches tourism management, further added that in the long run, students might also face difficulties during placements as their domain knowledge might not be up to the mark. “We recently conducted campus placements, and only four students out of around 30 got selected. The feedback we got from the hiring company was that the candidates were falling short on basic domain knowledge. This might get reflected for other technical subjects as well once everything normalises,” Ashutosh explained. Even in science streams, professors pointed out that successive batches of students are clearing practical examinations without having conducted a single experiment in the laboratory. Sanjay Batra, professor of chemistry at the Sri Venkateswara College said, “How will students even conduct further research in future without carrying out any practical experiments?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-book-tests-for-du-5th-semester-begin-as-glitches-largely-ironed-out/articleshow/88017664.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt orders probe into use of official car by Param Bir Singh; suspension process on, says minister Dilip Walse Patil||MUMBAI: Days after former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who faces a slew of extortion charges, appeared for questioning before the police in his official vehicle, an embarrassed Maharashtra government has ordered a probe. Singh, who spent months in hiding after accusing former home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption, also visited the office of the Home Guards, where he was posted as director general after being shunted as police commissioner. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil said a probe has been ordered into Singh’s use of the official car. “This was wrong. He was not on duty and there is an absconding warrant against him. He should not have used a government vehicle or machinery. We have asked for an inquiry,” he said. When asked why the state is dragging its feet on Singh’s suspension, he said, “The process is on and the result will soon be out.” He further said that Singh had visited the office of the Home Guards, but not assumed charge. “He sat outside in the waiting room,” Walse Patil said. By now, Singh has cocked a snook at the government multiple times. He succeeded in getting protection from arrest from the Supreme Court, with the state failing to file a caveat which would have allowed them to plead their case. He also managed to have a one-hour meeting with dismissed API Sachin Waze in a room next to the courtroom of the K U Chandiwal commission, a matter which is being probed by the police. When asked about the Waze-Parambir meeting, Walse-Patil said, “This was wrong. Any accused in judicial custody cannot meet someone from outside without the permission of the court.” Many are now questioning whether the police or officialdom is shielding Singh. However, Walse Patil denied this. “There is no question of pressure. Since Singh has protection from arrest through the SC, he is meeting with police authorities and responding to their queries,” he said. Five FIRs have been registered against Singh on charges of extortion. He also faces two inquiries by the anti-corruption bureau. The Chandiwal panel is probing Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-orders-probe-into-use-of-official-car-by-param-bir-suspension-process-on-says-min/articleshow/88017678.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Upadhyay was responsible for conducting the exam and lapses that occurred. The government has also instituted a disciplinary inquiry against him. UPTET is the minimum qualification to be eligible for appointment as teacher in government schools. The suspension order issued by basic education secretary Anamika Singh stated that Upadhyay is prima facie guilty for not maintaining the sanctity of examination, and failing to adhere to the high standards of confidentiality. According to the order, calling off the exam due to the leak even before it could start has brought a bad name to the government. The leak shows that Upadhyay failed to conduct the exam smoothly and hence is suspended after approval of governor Anandiben Patel, Singh’s order read. During his suspension tenure, Upadhay has been attached to the basic education directorate in Lucknow. Over 20 lakh aspirants had registered for UPTET scheduled on November 28. It was called off after reports of the question paper being leaked. UP STF has arrested 29 accused and put 20 more individuals from different districts under the scanner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-suspends-exam-regulatory-secretary/articleshow/88017679.cms||Isha Jain
---||Delhi||Swanky liquor dream yet to take off: Delhi can’t get high as shelves bare||NEW DELHI: Delhiites were willing to undergo a month’s wait to be able to pick a bottle of wine or a spirit of choice from a promised ‘swanky’ outlet. The new excise policy would transform the alcohol buying experience in the city, and everyone waited patiently for November 17 for an experience akin to being at an airport duty-free store with a spacious area and an array of alcoholic offerings. Roughly a fortnight into the implementation of the policy, it is clear that tipplers will have to wait at least a couple of weeks before they can raise a toast. At present, the shops are not fully finished or premium spirit brands are unavailable. Instead of shining bottles on display, one sees cartons lying around and people still crowding the counters. Barely a third of the sanctioned 850 shops have opened till date. While trying to get their shops going, the new liquor store owners cited lack of supply, unavailability of brands and the ban on construction due to pollution for the delay in readying their stores. Most stores told TOI they would be ready and fully operational in two-three weeks. Till then customers would have to do with whatever is available. A couple of women shoppers expressed happiness at the well-lit and less crowded stores, but rued the lack of crowd control at the cash counters. Restaurateur Rahul Singh of The Beer Café said that only 250 of roughly 1,000 brands had been registered till now under the new excise policy. He also disclosed that only 350-odd shops had been approved with the excise department still to inspect the rest. He also explained that the ban on the entry of trucks into the city has hurt the flow of liquor to Delhi. A banquet owner revealed that hosts at the in-season weddings and parties weren’t able to serve the liquor of their choice. He said if the situation wasn’t resolved soon, people would be forced to hold their events in Noida or Gurugram. In fact, many of those holding house parties have had to source their required brands from the neighbouring cities because they were unavailable in Delhi. Siddharth Banerji, managing director of Kyndal Group, which markets Cutty Sark, The Macallan, The Famous Grouse and Bootz Dark Jamaica Rum, blamed shops for taking time to open and brands for taking time to register. With a limited number of shops functioning and that too without being fully stocked, the prices have shot up. “The consumer was promised a premium shopping experience justifying higher pricing. It will be interesting to see how things work out in near future,” said Banerji. Things are improving with spirits brands Pernod Ricard and Diageo having registered their international brands as has UB. Singh assured that Delhi would soon have the cheapest liquor in NCR and the widest options to choose from. He added that restaurateurs would meet excise department officials soon to apprise them of their and consumer’s concerns and expects things to be streamlined over the next three to four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/swanky-liquor-dream-yet-to-take-off-delhi-cant-get-high-as-shelves-bare/articleshow/88017681.cms||Amin Ali
---||Chandigarh||Omicron alert: Chandigarh PGI doctors advise Covid test in case of flu-like symptoms||CHANDIGARH: Cautioning people against the new Covid variant, Omicron, PGI doctors have advised people suffering from flu-like symptoms to get themselves tested for Covid-19. The PGI is getting around 300 samples for RTPCR tests from Chandigarh every day. The number of RTPCR tests was negligible till a few days back. Prof Mini P Singh, nodal officer, Covid testing at PGI, said that the existing diagnostic tests, including real-time PCR as well as rapid antigen tests, can pick up this new variant. “Residents are advised to continue following Covid appropriate behaviour of masking, social distancing, hand hygiene and vaccination of all eligible individuals. Mass gatherings and non-essential travel should be strictly avoided. Patients with respiratory symptoms should get themselves tested for Covid-19 and isolate themselves till reports are available,” said Prof P V M Lakshmi of the community medicine and school of public health, PGI. She added, “Enhanced surveillance will be important to detect early warning signs and prompt initiation of public health and social measures. There is no need to panic as, so far, no case of this new variant has been reported in India. Test-track-treatvaccinate-Covid appropriate behaviour’ should continue to be followed.” Omicron (B.1.1.529), a new variant of concern of SARSCoV-2, is characterised by multiple mutations in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins, which outnumber the mutations seen in the Delta variant. The spike protein is the key protein that binds with human receptors to gain entry into cells. PGI doctors said as of now there is uncertainty related to transmissibility of the new variant, immune escape potential from infection, vaccine-induced immunity, severity of the disease and response to counter-measures (such as diagsnostics, vaccines, therapeutics). Also, there is no evidence of importation and transmission of Omicron in the Indian subcontinent for now, experts have stated as news of the new variant causes widespread concern. “However, given its immune escape potential and possible transmissibility advantage as compared to Delta, likelihood of potential introduction and subsequent transmission of the Omicron variant is high and we need to be on the alert,” said Prof Singh. 1 dies, 3 test positive in Mohali:After a span of 10 days, Mohali recorded a Covid death on Tuesday. Three persons tested positive and three recovered. This took the active case count to 38 and total deaths to 1,072, said DC Isha Kalia.

---||Delhi||Plea in Delhi high court against new excise policy, claims ‘pauvva’ has its own benefits||NEW DELHI: The humble “pauvva” or “quarter” as it is commonly known among liquor enthusiasts, figured before the Delhi high court on Tuesday as a ground for challenging Delhi government’s new excise policy. Several unsuccessful bidders and former retailers have moved the court challenging the government’s excise policy. They allege it is illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009. While arguments have largely ranged on cartelisation and monopoly of a select few manufacturers or agents, one of the pleas claimed the new policy will pinch the poor badly, as it does away with the need for an outlet to keep “quarter” or 180 ml bottles of various types of alcohol. “A pauvva or quarter has its own benefits for the public, especially the urban poor. It can be consumed quickly, can be kept hidden from family and it is cheap. But now, the liquor outlets will have only profit as the motive and would have no motivation to keep the quarter available for a poor rickshawpuller when they can sell a more expensive full bottle. Both are competing for the same storage space in a shop, but now with privatisation, there will be no reason for an outlet to keep the quarter,” the petitioner’s advocate contended before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh. For the record, Delhi government has clarified that liquor will be available in every size and shape as it was available earlier. Earlier, the government had defended its New Excise Policy 2021, saying that the new regime would generate optimum revenue and ensure ease of doing business while eliminating cartelisation, proxy players and monopoly. In July, the court had refused to stay the new excise policy on one of the petitions, which contended that the new regime would lead to complete monopoly of the few big players. It will continue hearing arguments in the matter later this week. Recently, the government had informed the court that the new policy has increased the revenue from about Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-high-court-against-new-excise-policy-claims-pauvva-has-its-own-benefits/articleshow/88017693.cms||Abhinav Garg

The state had been expecting Rs 600 crore additional annual income from the cess for two years, but the government was able to collect an additional Rs 918 crore. The latest edition of ‘Kerala Economy’ journal published by Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), a state government-funded think tank, said the state collected a total of Rs 2,118 crore in place of the anticipated Rs 1,200 crore through the flood cess. The cess was introduced on August 1, 2019, for two years with the concurrence of the GST council and the central government. Finance minister K N Balagopal had informed the assembly in August that the cess collection as on June 30 this year was Rs 1,929.78 crore. The figures regarding the cess collection were placed in the House in reply to an unstarred question by MLA DK Murali when the house met last. The minister had mentioned that the government was expecting only Rs 600 crore annually from the cess. The flood cess was introduced for additional resource mobilization to address the loss caused by the successive floods. The article in Kerala Economy, of which Balagopal is the editorial chairman, said the overachievement through cess collection was a big accomplishment for the state that is under severe financial stress due to the natural calamities and pandemic. Prices of around 100 consumer items under various tax slabs had gone up due to the flood cess. The tenure of flood cess ended on July 31 this year. The GST council had conceded to former state finance minister T M Thomas Isaac’s demand for permission to impose flood cess after elaborate discussions. There were deliberations on the propriety of collecting additional cess from people who were already devastated by the floods. The council had constituted a seven-member group of ministers to look into Kerala’s demand, including the constitutionality of imposing cess under the GST regime. Based on the report prepared by the group of ministers led by Union minister Sushil Kumar Modi, the GST council had on January 10, 2019, permitted the state government to levy 1% flood cess for two years, applicable only on retail transactions within the state. The state government introduced flood cess on all goods and services under 12-28% bracket. It exempted items drawing up to 5% of tax to insulate essential commodities from price hike.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-collected-total-of-rs-2118cr-through-flood-cess-in-two-years/articleshow/88016308.cms||B S Anilkumar

---||Goa||CoP wants to take up desilting of add’l stretch of Sal tributary||Panaji: After the Captain of Ports (CoP) proposed desilting of an additional stretch of a tributary of the Sal to make navigation easier for local fishermen, the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) has decided to seek an opinion from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). “The authority, after detailed discussion, decided to seek a letter from the NIO, Goa, stating that the Sal tributary is included in Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report submitted by NIO,” the GCZMA said. River Sal is being desilted in phases. It is considered the lifeline of Salcete, but due to neglect, it is one of the most polluted rivers in the country today falling in category III due to its condition. “River Sal is polluted as well as silted due to residential and commercial activities in the catchment area. The proposal was to desilt the river in phases. Accordingly, GCZMA had granted NOC after a detailed study of ElA is submitted,” CoP said. Also, mangroves have grown and spread branches within the river channel, CoP has said. “CoP has obtained the NOC from the Goa State Pollution Control Board as well as applied permission for mangrove pruning with state forest department. Desilting the rivulet is necessary for navigation of local fishermen. Desilting should be confined to the centre of the channel, without causing damage to the bund,” states the CoP proposal to the GCZMA. River Sal originates from the Verna plateau and flows through the urban areas of Verna, Nuvem, Margao, Navelim and Benaulim before emptying into the Arabian Sea at Betul near Mobor Beach. The urban areas discharge large quantity of sewerage waste in the river, besides dumping solid waste, which left the river polluted. The National Green Tribunal had issued directions to take up the desilting work on a urgent basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cop-wants-to-take-up-desilting-of-addl-stretch-of-sal-tributary/articleshow/88017747.cms||---

---||Delhi||Rent a cloth bag in south Delhi markets to curb plastic use||New Delhi: To discourage use of plastic bags, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) will provide cloth bags on rent at prominent markets through Vikalp stalls. Under the project, initiated as part of Swachh Survekshan 2022, the first such stall has been set up in collaboration with a restaurant in Green Park’s main market in south Delhi. SDMC has tied up with Why Waste Wednesdays Foundation, an NGO, and local shop owners to implement the project. Vikalp is aimed at reducing single-use plastic and providing a vikalp (alternative) to people. Now, a shopper can rent cloth bags at this store for Rs 20, do his shopping, can even take the bag home and get the refund after returning it. “We have been working in this field of reducing plastic waste for many years and have observed that people are aware of the dangers of plastic waste, but still use it as the alternative was difficult for them to follow,” said Ruby Makhija, founder of the NGO. “Many drives and awareness campaigns have been conducted, but with minimal impact. Through this project, a good, pocket- and environment-friendly alternative has been provided to people right at the source,” added Makhija, who is also the Swacch ambassador of SDMC. Cloth bag stalls will be set up in five more markets. The foundation provides the cotton bags and maintains the store. To push the project further, stickers with quick response codes will be pasted at other shops in the markets so that a person can scan the code and locate the nearest cloth bag store. In case a user goes to a different market than the one from where he has rented the cloth bag, there is the provision of returning it at another cloth bag store with ease. “Earlier, there have been cloth bag banks, but the cost of those bags were on the higher side, making them out of reach for the majority of people. With the south corporation providing it at a low cost, there is hope that this will take off rapidly,” added Makhija. “I volunteered for this because stopping the usage of plastic will make the future of our generations safe. We, as an individual, have to take steps, only then change will happen,” said S Vijay Purushotam, owner of Madras Cafe where the first Vikalp stall has been made operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rent-a-cloth-bag-in-south-delhi-markets-to-curb-plastic-use/articleshow/88017722.cms||---

A police officer identified the convicts as 39-year-old M S Gurusamy and 35-year-old M Giri Murugan, both residents of Perundurai in Erode. The duo had floated G1 Emu Zone India Pvt Ltd in 2011 by introducing two ponzi schemes. “At least 37 people had invested Rs 1,02,07,500 in the firm, but none of them received returns as promised,” the officer said. In March 2012, he said, one of the investors - L Gunasekaran from Coimbatore – had lodged a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing in Erode. Initially, the case was registered against four people. “While one of them - Lingasamy - died during the trial, another one - Susila - was acquitted of all charges,” the officer said. On Tuesday, he said, judge A S Ravi pronounced the verdict. “While Girimurugan was sent to prison after the conviction, the judge has issued a warrant to Gurusamy, who did not appear before the court.

Besides, six ‘rath yatras’ will also traverse the state to seek blessings of people for achieving the target of winning over 300 seats in the election. Following party’s mega show with Union home minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the occasion of foundation-laying of state university in Azamgarh on November 13, the BJP state chief reached the district on Tuesday to intensify the party’s bid to dent this stronghold of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

We will achieve this target with the blessings of people, who will vote for development. The party will soon hold a show of strength with alliance partners in Ballia in this regard while a ‘rath yatra’ will also be rolling in the state to mobilse the people.” Singh said that people are feeling relieved as the Yogi government has cracked down on the empire of mafia and criminals. Apart from improving law and order, the government has performed honestly for the welfare of the poor. He also mentioned that no guilty person in the cases of killings of Dalits in Prayagraaj and Azamgarh are going to be spared.

---||Coimbatore||Town planning officials give nod for building on disputed plot||Coimbatore: The city corporation’s town planning officials have given a two-year extension for building approval for a residential house on a plot at Krishna Colony in the east zone after the intervention of the Madras high court. The town planning approved the extension through an order dated October 6, 2021. However, the building approval, which was given in 2016, was cancelled by the then corporation commissioner in 2019 after learning that the approval was obtained by fabricating documents. The 2,796 square feet plot at Krishna Colony was part of the 30 feet road as per the layout approved by the DTCP. The worth of the plot is more than one crore rupee. The layout owned by the National Workers House Building and Benefit Society was approved by DTCP in 1977. Subsequently, 131 plots were earmarked and sold on the 13.4 acres. D Robinson Selvam, who claims ownership of the disputed plot, is also the owner of plot numbers 62 and 63 located next to the disputed plot. He allegedly named the disputed plot as 62A and forged documents to get building approval, despite knowing that it was part of a road. He soon started constructing a building. He approached the Madras high court in March 2021 complaining that officials had cancelled the building approval without giving him an opportunity to explain his position and to extend the building plan approval so that he could finish the construction activity. According to activist S P Thiyagarajan, the high court in its order on August 16, 2021, directed officials to provide an opportunity for Robinson to explain his side and take a call based on legal standings. But the town planning officials had acted in favour of the applicant in haste instead of going by documents available, Thiyagarajan alleged. He urged the corporation officials to take action against the town planning officials responsible for acting in favour of the violator and to demolish the under-construction building. When contacted, deputy commissioner of city corporation Dr M Sharmila said that she has instructed officials to check the genuineness of documents submitted by the applicant. Appropriation decision will be taken on the issue, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/town-planning-officials-give-nod-for-building-on-disputed-plot/articleshow/88017104.cms||V Devanathan

A team has been formed to track the accused with the help of CCTV footage they have collected on the route that motorcycle-borne thieves have taken to speed away. The incident has shaken Dutta who took to social media and posted the trauma. She posted: “Sharing a torrid experience I had yesterday which was very dramatic and has given me a rough 24 hours. I was walking on the 14th road in Bandra around 7:45 pm. Two men came on a bike from behind, tapped me on my head which suddenly disoriented me for a moment and the pillion rider snatched my phone from my hand. They were on the move when they did this. Before I could react they fled away. For almost 3-4 seconds I was in absolute shock as I didn’t register what just happened.”  She concluded her post, “I hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else and no one has to experience losing their hard-earned money like this without any fault of theirs.” Watch 'Kabir Singh' actress Nikita Dutta shares a ‘horrific’ encounter with thieves, says two bikers snatched her phone||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-actress-phone-snatched-by-2-on-motorcycle-in-bandra/articleshow/88018425.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Delhi||Delhi: Slum fire robs dwellers of meagre belongings and hope||NEW DELHI: “We lost everything in the fire,” said Pushpa, who was desperately searching for her belongings on Tuesday afternoon in a pile of ashes left after her hut was gutted late on Monday. Other residents of the JJ cluster in Neb Sarai were also seen sifting through the remains of their shanties destroyed in the massive blaze.Several people, including children, had to sleep in the open. Pushpa had kept money in an almirah for building a house, but even that had turned into ashes. “My husband and I had decided to build a house in our native place Aligarh and we were saving money for it. Now, all I’m left with is one pair of clothes,” she said. Her husband, Rajendra, is a ragpicker, while she works as a household helper. They have three children. The fire started near the hut of 20-year-old Vishnu, a vegetable vendor. “I saw something burning near my house and tried to douse it with water, but the fire started to spread. I then left my shanty with my wife and child. I lost everything, including money, in the fire,” he said. His brother, Sanjay, who lived next door, somehow managed to save his hut. The residents, mostly ragpickers, said their future seemed bleak as they had lost all their savings. Razibul Haque, a 13-year-old boy, said, “We didn’t have money to eat, so my brother, Babu Ali, had gone to the market to sell some scrap so that we could buy some food. The natives of Guwahati were living in Neb Sarai for several years. Meanwhile, a few good Samaritans distributed blankets and food to the slum dwellers. Jitu, a 29-year-old godown owner, said they spent the night on the street. “Till morning, not a single tent had been erected for us. A few children went inside the gutted huts at night to save themselves from the winter cold. Our work was severely affected during the pandemic. Just when things were starting to return to normal, we were dealt a cruel blow in the form of a fire,” he added. Delhi Police has registered a case under IPC Section 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others). “Our probe revealed that the blaze started from a hut where the residents had lit a fire to keep themselves warm,” said an officer. A government official said the place was private land rented out to contractors, who had further given it to the slum dwellers. A lot of combustible scrap acted as a catalyst for fire and about 40 families were affected. “We have made arrangements for food and shelter. We had asked the authorities to remove encroachments from the approach road,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/slum-fire-robs-dwellers-of-meagre-belongings-hope/articleshow/88017755.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Goa||Panchayat’s action of destroying ground is a blow to Goan football, says FC Goa TD Derrick Pereira||PANAJI: The acts of ‘premeditated vandalism’ at Salvador do Mundo panchayat ground has sowed seeds of doubts in the minds of FC Goa, who were eager to develop similar grounds across the state. The developed ground at Salvador do Mundo – used by the club for its training since last season – was the first of ‘Field of Dreams’, an ambitious club project that aimed to provide better infrastructure to budding footballers. Eight such grounds were identified across the state. “When you invest so much to develop the ground and reach out to the community, look what you get in return,” Derrick Pereira, the club’s technical director and among the football greats in Goa, told TOI on Wednesday. “The panchayat has not just dug up the ground and done a disservice to its own community, they have delivered a huge blow to Goan football.” Goa had inked a three-year memorandum of understanding with the village panchayat of Salvador do Mundo on May 29, 2020. According to the MoU, The club was to develop the ground, while the panchayat would provide “exclusive access to the club to use the existing ground for its footballing activities.” Goa spent almost Rs 1 crore on developing the two grounds – one for their own use and the other for locals – and trained at the venue last season from October till May. But on Sunday, with a new sarpanch at the helm, “the football pitch was destroyed as the turf was dug up and later filled with concrete.” The panchayat has claimed that they do not get any revenue from Goa training there. The “local boys” – in the words of sarpanch Antonio Fernandes – dug up the ground to prepare a cricket pitch. “People need to understand that this ground belongs to the panchayat and not FC Goa. Once the three-year agreement ends, the ground goes back to the panchayat. The club is not paying rent only for the first three years because there was substantial cost involved in developing the two grounds, besides maintenance,” said Pereira. Pereira is among the rare footballers to win the biggest trophies in Indian football – I-League and Federation Cup – as player and coach. The lack of progress in Goan football – exit from the Santosh Trophy qualifiers against Gujarat, for example – is hurting everyone, and even plans for a secure future are being scuppered. “As a club, we are trying to improve infrastructure, trying to send our coaches to different villages to improve Goan football. This action of the panchayat creates a very negative image,” said Pereira. The club has now shifted their training base to the Sesa FA ground in Sirsaim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/panchayats-action-of-destroying-ground-is-a-blow-to-goan-football-says-fc-goa-td-derrick-pereira/articleshow/88038161.cms||---

While she added this is “a risky area” which does not have a complete regulatory framework, the FM also said that the government is studying the guidelines of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) on misleading advertisements so that it can take a position on complaints regarding deceptive crypto ads. BJP MP Sushil Kumar Modi raised the question of shutting crypto advertisements while mentioning that during the recent Cricket World Cup, over Rs 50 crore was spent by crypto exchanges in advertisements that ran without any disclaimer. “These ads are misleading and can lead to heavy losses,” he said. Responding to this, the FM said, “About misleading ads and banning ads, guidelines of ASCI are being studied and regulations that they have are all being looked into so that, if necessary, we can take some kind of decision to say how we are going to handle this.” Earlier in the House, several MPs wanted to know whether the government was considering outright ban of crypto currency or to regulate them. Responding to whether there would be a separate legal framework for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and how many people have paid income tax on crypto income, Sitharaman said she did not have the ready information on how much tax has been collected on crypto or how much has been paid on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/will-move-crypto-bill-in-this-session-sitharaman/articleshow/88018750.cms||Dipak K Dash

He also demanded resumption of sustainable and legal mining, as well as immediate recovery of Rs 35,000 crore lost due to illegal mining in the state. Issues of Mhadei water diversion was also raised in his speech. Speaking about the three controversial infrastructure projects running through the protected Mollem forest, Faleiro said that the doubling of railway tracks, expansion of the national highway and the Tanmar power transmission project, have all led to the destruction of the fragile ecosystem in Goa. “The government has signed for transportation of 13 million tonnes of coal through Goa to Karnataka. Goa is an international tourist destination, not a coal destination. It is a health hazard and Goans are suffering due to this,” he said. Stating that mining sector was the backbone of Goa’s economy, Faleiro urged the government to restart sustainable and legal mining. He also slammed the BJP government for the illegal and controversial construction at a heritage site in Old Goa. He said that the state government was destroying historical, heritage sites which had been recognised by Unesco.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/faleiro-raises-linear-projects-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/88017779.cms||---
---||Bareilly||UP: Slain dacoit Dadua’s pet jumbo rescued, gets new lease of life||BAREILLY: ‘Jai Singh’, once the pet elephant of Bundelkhand’s notorious dacoit Dadua, has got a new lease of life after it was rescued by forest officials in Satna (Madhya Pradesh) on October 19 this year while it was being taken to Gujarat for illegal sale. The elephant, which was frail and weak, was handed over to Uttar Pradesh police, which then gave it to the forest department the next day. It was eventually brought to the Dudhwa elephant camp. Forest authorities now hope that Jai will soon be part of the forest patrolling team in the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve after its training is over in January 2022. Jai is currently undergoing treatment and being cared for at the centre. The elephant's health is improving, much to the joy of foresters who said it has also adapted well to the new environment and is no longer branded as rogue. Nor is it chained. Jai had earlier often gone on the rampage in Chitrakoot, destroying houses and properties. Dudhwa field director Sanjay Pathak told TOI, “Jai Singh is about 25 years old. He was unwell when he was brought here in October. We have completed all the required tests and started treatment. The tusker is now behaving well.” Pathak added, “After Dadua’s death, his son Veer Singh, a former MLA, was in possession of the elephant. The jumbo was rescued while it was being transported to Gujarat. Veer Singh had failed to produce documents proving ownership of the elephant following which the Madhya Pradesh forest department seized the animal and sent it here for upkeep. Jai is being given a good diet and two mahouts have started spending time with it. Now, it is one the most-friendly male elephants here at the camp at Dudhwa. It allows mahouts to climb on its back, but the real test would be how he responds after encountering rhinos and tigers in the forest.” Shivkumar Patel, alias Dadua, had bought Jai from a fair in 2002. He was one of UP's most wanted criminals. After Dadua was killed in an encounter with UP STF in July 2007, his son Veer started looking after the elephant. There were several cases against Dadua and the police had announced a reward of over Rs 7 lakh on his head. Dadua was popular among locals in Bundelkhand region, and some of them had even placed his statue in a temple in Fatehpur in 2016. His son had won the assembly elections in 2012 from Chitrakoot constituency on Samajwadi Party’s ticket but lost in the 2017 state elections. Shivmangal Agrahari, a resident of Chitrakoot, told TOI, “Dadua had bought this elephant but he never sat on its back. He used to take good care of it though. After Dadua's death, we always saw Jai tied with chains. In the past three years, Jai attacked a few people and injured them, entered agricultural fields and destroyed crops, damaged many vehicles and huts in Chitrakoot. In 2020, a team was called from Mathura to control it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/dreaded-dacoit-daduas-pet-jumbo-rescued-gets-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/88014622.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Officer assumes chief secy’s post as interim step||Mumbai: Veteran bureaucrat Debashish Chakrabarty, who is additional chief secretary (planning), has been given additional charge as chief secretary following the retirement of Sitaram Kunte. An IAS officer of the 1985 batch, Kunte has been appointed as principal advisor to the CM. A fortnight ago, the state government had submitted a proposal to the Centre for a six-month extension for Kunte. It appears that the NDA government did not consider it. This is being viewed as a major setback for Kunte, who is the first chief secretary in recent years to be denied extension. His predecessor, Sanjay Kumar, did not ask for an extension; but immediately after his retirement, was appointed chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, a post earlier held by former chief secretary Ajoy Mehta. Kunte has been summoned by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate for recording his statement in cases filed against former home minister Anil Deshmukh, who is under investigation in a money laundering case and row over the transfer of IPS officers. Kunte has not responded to the summons. Chakrabarty belongs to the 1986 batch and will retire on February 28, 2022. Chakrabarty was recently in news for completing the crucial probe against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Chakrabarty had found that there was blatant violation of rules, when Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister against Anil Deshmukh. According to reports, owing to a lack of consensus, the MVA leadership was unable to take a decision on the chief secretary. As per the seniority list, Kunte is followed by Shyamlal Goyal (1985 batch, currently on central deputation), education secretary Vandana Krishna (1985 batch), Chakrabarty, home secretary Manukumar Srivastava, Jayashree Mukherjee (1986 batch), Sujata Saunik, Ashwani Kumar and Manoj Saunik (1987 batch).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-officer-assumes-chief-secys-post-as-interim-step/articleshow/88018434.cms||---

According to data available with the city police, 774 accidents have taken place till Monday this year. Among them, 91 were fatal accidents, which claimed 93 lives. In the remaining 683 non-fatal accidents, 711 people were injured. Though the number of deaths and accidents in 2021 is less than 2019, there is an increase when compared to 2020. To bring down number of accidents, the recently-appointed city police commissioner Pradip Kumar sought reports from traffic inspectors about accident spots, and suggestions to improve road safety in such spots. Based on the reports, two workable plans – one for the first three months and the other one for the next six months - will be prepared and executed, the commissioner said. “We are planning to improve road safety slowly but steadily by preventing accidents. It will be a sustained campaign. Whenever there is an accident police teams will visit the spot. They will get in touch with the other stakeholders such as the city corporation and highways to improve safety in the particular area,” he said. Apart from improving road safety, awareness activities will also being carried out. Police teams armed with pamphlets are approaching people to sensitise them on road safety. Following traffic rules is utmost important in preventing accidents, violations will be viewed seriously, he said. “Along with other traffic rule violations, I have instructed police personnel to increase drunk and drive checking. Although there is no target fixed on the number of cases, intensive checking will be conducted. There is an increase in such cases in the recent days,” the commissioner said Earlier, following an instruction from the commissioner to traffic police personnel to do their part in improving road safety, several traffic officials have started filling potholes across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-aim-to-bring-down-accidents/articleshow/88017162.cms||V Devanathan

---||Hyderabad||‘Need more guards at city parks’||Enhance surveillance Some places in Hyderabad are certainly not safe. Why else will something like the Disha incident take place? When I think of it, it makes me worried. At a time when the city is expanding every day, the increase in crime rate has become a major issue. People have lost the trust they had in the past about commuting in the city safely, especially at night. There are so many new roads that it is difficult to find one’s way through them without proper guidance. And that’s added to the fear. The most vulnerable areas, according to me, are the ones adjoining the ORR, biodiversity park, Inorbit mall etc. Police patrolling in these areas isn’t sufficient and it must be enhanced. Given that so many women work and live in these areas, it is important that they are brought under proper surveillance. And this should be done along other remote stretches, under-construction sites, deserted roads and even parks. Authorities must put up more light posts along each corridor, remove bushes along the routes so as to minimise the chances for goons to dodge the police, set up more police outposts, sensitise girls about the situation and finally ensure strict punishment for offenders. – Dr V Taramathi Increase cameras, manpower The recent incident of the attack on an actress, while walking around KBR Park, raised a serious question on the security situation of Hyderabad. It was noted that the CCTV was not functioning thus encouraging culprits to attack a citizen. Should people then refrain from stepping out of their homes post 6pm? That is not a solution. It is, therefore, important that security is tightened around parks and public spaces – both with the help of cameras and manpower. We are all looking forward to more greenery and a healthy environment which will cater to a serene living. Though I have experienced a comfortable situation, the fear of unseen predators is a cause for concern. -- Anand Menon Fix more streetlights As the city has grown at an exponential rate, lack of proper lighting or no streetlights on many roads and streets has become risky for one to move out at night. In fact, I dread to venture out in the street leading from Bhoiguda to Padmarao Nagar at nights due to fear of any untoward incident happening because the road not only lacks streetlights but is also isolated making it a hub of anti-social activities. Further, as lighting and security are essential in and around public parks and gardens to induce a feeling of security to the visitors, lack of adequate lighting and absence of security has made it easy for chain-snatchers to commit theft post sunset and flee under the cover of darkness. As women walking alone or in small groups have been the potential targets of anti-social elements, it gives jitters not only to them but even to the rest of the residents. Until the authorities take concrete steps to address the issue, it is unsafe to go for a walk during evenings in parks and gardens. – Srinivasan Ramaswamy Take strict action People from various places visit the Indira Park in lower Tank Bund either for sightseeing or walking. But because of poor security management, walkers feel insecure. Some hooligans in the area are often seen abusing or passing inappropriate comments to walkers. Cases of chain stanching have also occurred here. Though complaints have been lodged against these miscreants with the park security office, it appears that they are too scared of those men to take any action. I think senior police officials must look at it. It is also important to strengthen the security management here so that people who walk can be protected. -- Syed Shamuddin Maghrabi Deploy more manpower Hyderabad is regarded as one of the safest cities among the others. Several people, especially women, consider the city comfortable to travel even during the night because of the hope and confidence in the law and order, particularly the big achievements and the efforts made by the SHE team. But the two incidents reported recently from around the KBR Park were truly disappointing and again women have started feeling unsafe. This clearly indicates poor security in the city. No installation of proper CCTV’s camera at the site and absence of adequate streetlights in the night. The place being situated right at the heart of the city should be safe for everyone. It can get better if the government takes up the responsibility to appoint proper security guards at such places at night to make commuters feel safe and secure in and around the parks. Police signs of frequent patrolling near the park can be done so that miscreants think several times before committing such a crime. – Khulood Zaheer Pay attention to service roads The service road from TSPA to Aparna township/NCC Urban in Narsingi is unsafe, especially post dark. The entire road should be well lit. Police should keep patrolling that place to keep anti-social activities at bay here. Secondly, the approach road to PBEL City, Peeram Cheruvu should also be well lit as it becomes unsafe at night when the road is deserted. Thirdly, parks too should have guards to watch over the safety of walkers in case there is not much rush. -- Nidhi Lohumi Basic infrastructure must It is very sad to see how basic infrastructure is missing in this ever-growing part of the city -- Alwal and Bolarum. Leave alone world class infrastructure, like most residents of these areas, even I cry for my area and my city. Come to Bolarum, Old Alwal, Alwal and one will be appalled to see no proper roads, not a single traffic signal, lack of pavements and footpaths for pedestrians, no dividers, no markings, horrible parking spaces and above all encroachments all over. Safety is not concerned to women and kids alone, it is and should be for all who travel by road, walk or cycle to reach their destinations. Lack of proper bus stops, parks and improper placement of streetlights are some more lesser discussed issues but equally important and concerning issues. Alwal and Bolarum are the oldest residential areas that are inhabited by people from across the nation and the way the area has sprawled needs immediate attention towards basic infra and development work. – Sapna Jain Don’t let your guard down As a fitness lover, I always go to the nearest park – often the Kondapur walking park -- as part of my evening exercise regime. At times, it gets quite late in the evening as I need to wait to pick up my kids from their classes, before heading for the walk. The crowd in the evening times tend to fade as night sets in. Yes, there have been instances where I was hesitant about the crowd out there, but I always made it a point not to let my face mirror my emotions. Fortunately, there have been no unpleasant incidents that I have encountered or witnessed. But having said that, it is not advisable to let the guard down and ensure that we surround ourselves with people. I, at any given point in time, never take a secluded path or route even if it means reaching home five or 10 minutes late. When it gets late or I am stuck somewhere, I don’t hesitate a minute to reach out for help. I always have my pepper spray handy even when I go for a walk as it gives me a lot of confidence as an immediate saviour. We all must welcome the fact that women today are more aware of the safety precautions to be taken on travel and report incidents of crime without any fear. The only advice I can offer is to step out without fear as we women deserve to be safe. – Sarvani Vallabhajosyula||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/need-more-guards-at-city-parks/articleshow/88017125.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Mould, engineering clusters to benefit small units in dist||Coimbatore: The mould and engineering clusters that the state government has announced for the district at an estimated cost of Rs 9 crore are expected to boost up the production of moulds and engineering components by speeding up the testing process. Small mould makers and those doing engineering works could make use of the two common production facilities, which would be set up by the Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation with the funding from the state government. The mould cluster would come up at Vellalore at an estimated cost of Rs 4.76 crore in another two months. It would house five injection moulding machines and a vertical machining centre. The requirement for plastic containers, industrialists said, differs for various industries in terms of shape and size. “Such works are outsourced to small units doing job works. While they would get the model from the company, they have to approach injecting moulding shops to check the accuracy of their mould. They have to wait for more than a month to validate their moulds sometimes, since there are only a few people doing the testing.” R Siva Ganesh, proprietor of SMS Tech Tools at Irugur, said the mould cluster would benefit small units on Malumachampatti-Ganapathy belt and at Saravanampatti, Ganapathy and adjoining areas. Similarly, the engineering cluster at Seerapalayam near Madukkarai would help the small units that are into the production of various components for the automobile and valve making industries. To be set up at Rs 3.61 crore, this common facility would house a gear hobbing machine, turn mills centre and coordinate measuring machine. “The cluster will benefit more than 40 small units around Madukkarai where they can make small components of gear box and assemble them,” said M Tamil Selvan, proprietor, Deta CNC unit. Pointing out that the automobile industry was slowly bouncing back into the business, A Karthigaivasan, general manager, district industries centre, said the cluster would help speed up the production and meet the deadline for component manufacturing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mould-engineering-clusters-to-benefit-small-units-in-dist/articleshow/88017124.cms||Sampath Kumar

UPSCPCR members, Ashok Yadav and Nirmala Patel said the school authorities did not cooperate in commissions inspection. At the second floor of the school, where classroom of the girl exists, no girls toilet was present and it was being constructed now. We will send the findings of our inspection to the commission in details for further action, they added. Both the UPSCPCR members reached the school with the chairman of child welfare committee Sneha Upadhyaya, its members- Akhilesh Mishra and Sheel Chandra Kishore, district child protection officer Nirupama Singh and policemen on Tuesday morning. Yadav said on entering the school premises, school coordinator, academic head and class teacher of girl informed them that the director of school, principal, dean and other senior officials had gone to appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by police for investigation in this episode. They expressed their inability in telling anything about the incident by mentioning that they had not been authorized to tell anything to anyone by the higher authorities of school, said Yadav. Yadav said despite the non-cooperation of school staff, they were given a format to provide details related to inhuman act committed with minor girl students in written, both in hard and soft copies, to the commission within three days. In case of not providing these information in given time, the commission will initiate necessary legal action, he added. The DCPO said irregularities in school were evident during the inspection as the girls toilet, which should exist at each floor as per the prescribed guidelines, was not available at the floor where the girl studied. Construction of toilet was found in progress at such floor, she added. Meanwhile, amidst the progress in SIT probe, the commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh convened a meeting with the authorities of all principals and managers of all schools of city and asked them to ensure total compliance of the prescribed guidelines of CBSE and other boards to avoid recurrence of untoward incident with any student and provide a safe and healthy atmosphere to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/large-scale-irregularities-found-at-private-school-says-upscpcr/articleshow/88017777.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Ahmedabad||AMC drops Corona action plan even as Omicron emerges||AHMEDABAD: Just as the threat of the new Omicron variant of Covid looms ahead, civic officials in Ahmedabad are caught in a bind. About three months ago, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) had dropped plans to set up major Covid care facilities, that had been announced and planned soon after the second wave of Covid cases, when the huge deficit in our health facilities was laid bare, and citizens were left scrambling for ambulances, ICU beds and oxygen cylinders. A senior official in the estate department of the AMC told TOI that just two weeks after the second wave began showing a downward trend, the state government and Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) promised that 75 to 110 facilities, depending on requirements, including AMC’s community halls, private hotels and exhibition centres, would be converted into Covid care centres with oxygen facilities, to thwart a possible third wave. Some 75 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants of varying capacity were to be installed across the city and expressions of interest for these had been called. It now turns out that the plans were put in abeyance. “We sincerely wish that a third wave does not hit us. There were plans to convert 75 facilities, including AMC-run community halls, exhibition centres and hotel rooms into oxygen facilities with adequate supply. All these plans have been put in abeyance,” said a senior AMC official in the estate department. Surveys of 110 facilities that were to be converted to Covid facilities were carried out. On existing PSA plants, the official said: “As of now we are installing nine PSA plants of 500 litres per minute (LPM) capacity. Six 2,000 LPM plants are coming up at SVP Hospital, while four plants of 1,000 LPM are coming up at Shardaben and LG Hospitals and Samras hostel. “One PSA plant each is beings set up at VS and LG Hospitals,” the AMC official said. There are no public facilities that are being converted to special Covid care centres, the AMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-drops-corona-action-plan-even-as-omicron-emerges/articleshow/88016400.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Covid fight strategy: Focus on S-gene to identify Omicron in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Labs across the city that conducts Covid-19 tests are set to be more stringent in taking down the travel history of the person whose samples will undergo the test. This stricter vigil comes in the wake of the Omicron threat. The latest variant of SARS-CoV2 has already been detected in at least 15 countries. No case, however, has been detected in India so far. “Taking down the travel history has become all the more important now that the Omicron threat looms. If we get a sample testing positive and the sample belongs to a person who has had a recent travel history to any of those countries where Omicron has surfaced, we can send those samples for genome sequencing,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri, who is attached with the lab at Peerless Hospital. Since the mutation in Omicron has happened in the S-gene, a sample positive for this variant will have the S-gene missing. WHO had suggested that countries using PCR test containing the S-gene could utilise the S-gene target failure, an indicator for infection by Omicron subject to confirmation by genome sequencing. But the ICMR-approved RT-PCR kits that most labs across the country, including those in Kolkata, are using currently do not include the S-gene. These kits mostly target two genes – N and ORF — and not the S-gene. But doctors said that these kits are capable of detecting all variants of SARS-Cov2, including Omicron. “The RT-PCR kits that we are using currently will pick up the Covid-19 infection even if it has been caused by Omicron. The only thing is that since these RT-PCR kits do not target the S-gene, it will not throw any indication of which variant has caused the infection. Detecting the variant is all about sequencing, which is significant epidemiologically. But the treatment, isolation and other protocols remain same for all variants. We should be alert but not get panicked,” said microbiologist Shelly Sharma Ganguly attached with AMRI Hospitals. “Omicron comes with more than 30 mutations in the spike. So its almost a different spike that it uses to engage ACE2. Does this increase transmission? We'll have to wait and see. Definitely, RT-PCR tests targeting the original spike sequence may show negative results, although usually these are paired with another gene of the virus. I feel in cases with discrepancies between the two targets should warrant sequencing in the index case, that means the discernible contact for each cluster of infection,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. Labs across the city admitted that if RT-PCR kits had targeted more genes, including the S-gene, it could have been useful in indirectly picking out possible infection by Omicron. But such kits are at least three times costlier than the ones currently being used. And since there is a capping on RT-PCR test rate, no private lab is likely to procure the more advanced kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-fight-strategy-focus-on-s-gene-to-identify-omicron/articleshow/88016394.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Rai is presently lodged in Naini Central Jail. Commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh on Tuesday said, “Taking note of the chargesheet filed by the police in a case registered under Section 66E of IT Act and 120B of IPC against Rai, the MP-MLA court, Prayagraj issued a warrant against Rai on November 27. The order’s copy was received by the police here on Tuesday.” “Rai, who is lodged in Naini Central Jail of Prayagraj, has been summoned by the court on December 14 for further proceedings in this case,” he added. Rai is in jail since June 22, 2019 when he surrendered before the court after winning Lok Sabha election as an absconder as a girl had lodged an FIR against him on April 26, 2019 with the Lanka police in Varanasi accusing him of raping her repeatedly and threatening to make video of the act viral on social media. The complainant girl, who had died after committing self-immolation along with the prime witness in her case near the Supreme Court in New Delhi on August 17 after levelling serious allegations on the police and other authorities, had lodged another FIR against Rai and four others alleging that on Rai’s diktat, his close aide Sudhir Singh was defaming her through his social media account. This case was lodged under Section 66E of IT Act and Section 120B of IPC with Lanka police in December 2020, said police. Rai’s troubles are increasing continuously after he landed in jail in the rape case as police had booked him under Gangster Act for one more time in October. As per police records, 21 criminal cases are lodged against Rai, who has already been booked under the Gangster Act twice in 2009 and again two times in 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/warrant-against-jailed-bsp-mp-in-case-under-it-act/articleshow/88017803.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Police aim to bring down accidents||Coimbatore: The city police are planning to reduce accidents and improve road safety by identifying various issues in spots where accidents occur often. According to data available with the city police, 774 accidents have taken place till Monday this year. Among them, 91 were fatal accidents, which claimed 93 lives. In the remaining 683 non-fatal accidents, 711 people were injured. Though the number of deaths and accidents in 2021 is less than 2019, there is an increase when compared to 2020. To bring down number of accidents, the recently-appointed city police commissioner Pradip Kumar sought reports from traffic inspectors about accident spots, and suggestions to improve road safety in such spots. Based on the reports, two workable plans – one for the first three months and the other one for the next six months - will be prepared and executed, the commissioner said. “We are planning to improve road safety slowly but steadily by preventing accidents. It will be a sustained campaign. Whenever there is an accident police teams will visit the spot. They will get in touch with the other stakeholders such as the city corporation and highways to improve safety in the particular area,” he said. Apart from improving road safety, awareness activities will also being carried out. Police teams armed with pamphlets are approaching people to sensitise them on road safety. Following traffic rules is utmost important in preventing accidents, violations will be viewed seriously, he said. “Along with other traffic rule violations, I have instructed police personnel to increase drunk and drive checking. Although there is no target fixed on the number of cases, intensive checking will be conducted. There is an increase in such cases in the recent days,” the commissioner said Earlier, following an instruction from the commissioner to traffic police personnel to do their part in improving road safety, several traffic officials have started filling potholes across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-aim-to-bring-down-accidents/articleshow/88017161.cms||V Devanathan

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Thorough Covid scan of international fliers at SVPI Airport||AHMEDABAD: In line with the guidelines of the Centre and the state for screening Covid-19 passengers, the authorities of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad have begun preparing for the thorough screening of international passengers. A separate space has been earmarked at the arrivals area of the international terminal, Terminal-II, to screen, test, and isolate passengers from ‘At Risk Countries’. Taking an RT-PCR test upon arrival is mandatory for all international passengers at SVPI airport and other airports in Gujarat. However, if the passenger is not travelling from the countries classified as at risk, he or she may leave the airport after giving the Covid test sample. The Government of India has released a list of 11 countries which have been classified as ‘At Risk’. They are South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Israel. “We have designated a separate zone at the arrivals area of the international terminal for screening passengers from At Risk Countries, soon after their customs clearance is done,” said a well-placed source. “Passengers will take the test for Covid-19 and remain on the airport premises till their reports are out.” Airport authorities have arranged at least 200 chairs in this separate area to isolate passengers from the At Risk Countries. “Each passenger will have the option of taking either an RT-PCR test or an RT-LAMP test, which is equivalent to the RT-PCR test approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/thorough-covid-scan-of-intl-fliers-at-svpi/articleshow/88016408.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cycle ban back after pandemic break, 71 Kolkata roads on cop list||KOLKATA: With traffic volume swelling, Kolkata Police has reintroduced its pre-Covid bicycle ban on several city roads. A recent notification by Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra orders full or partial banning of cycling on 71 thoroughfares and bridges in the city. Major thoroughfares, including EM Bypass and Alipore Road, have seen a complete ban on cycling except for cross movement. Among the roads that are included in the 24-hour ban are AJC Bose flyover, BBD Bag, Camac Street, Casuarina Avenue, EM Bypass, Gariahat flyover, Lord Sinha Road and Maa flyover, among others. A few roads will see cycle restriction for the better part of the day, effectively lifting the ban only late in the night. For example, there will be a ban on cycling on Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road and Prince Anwar Shah connector from 7am to 11pm. Diamond Harbour Road will see a restriction on cyclists between 9am and 1pm and again from 5pm to 9pm. On other roads like MG Road, specific stretches have been kept open for cycle vans while it is banned on other stretches. For cyclists though, it is an effective ban given no cycles can ply here between 7am and 11pm. “This is an official notification. The concessions that were provided during lockdown last year have long been withdrawn but cyclists seemed not to have any clue about it. However, we are still allowing certain concessions based on local requirements and availability of public transport at certain times of the day,” said a senior police officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said a detailed list of roads where cycling is banned has been sent to individual guards. “Restrictions will continue on the main arterial roads, flyovers and any other area as notified from time to time. The bicyclists should obey one-way restrictions and other traffic rules and regulations,” the order stated. Police said that no concessions will be provided to those cyclists breaking traffic rules blatantly. A number of cycle accidents this year has led to the decision, claimed an officer. Even breathalyzer tests on cyclists were started after about two dozen cycle accidents got reported this year. Across 25 guards, around 50 bicyclists were made to take the breathalyzer test in the past one week. “There are certain corridors used by cyclists, especially those cycling out of central Kolkata late in the night. We have identified those and similar checks will continue," said an officer. Bicyclists, however, opposed the move. Satanjib Gupta, a bicycle enthusiast and the bicycle mayor of Kolkata, termed the move "anti-people”. “A lot of people depend on bicycles to travel short distances to sustain their livelihood. The restriction will inconvenience them. Moreover, bicycles are being promoted worldwide as the cleanest mode of transport. Bicycles are the most climate resilient mode of transport. I think there is a vast knowledge gap that is leading to such a decision,” he said. Vijay Jaju, a bicycle enthusiast and founder of SwicthON Foundation, stated that the move will defeat the enthusiasm noticed for cycling in the past few months. "The reimposition of the bicycle ban on so many city roads will deeply affect the livelihood of many people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-ban-back-after-pandemic-break-71-city-roads-on-cop-list/articleshow/88016403.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Construction row at Subhas Sarobar||Kolkata: A concrete structure is being erected at Subhas Sarobar, triggering protests from morning walkers and green activists. According to them, Subhas Sarobar’s green has successively been encroached upon first by Metro construction and now a concrete structure, apparently to develop a rowing club for city police force. Morning walkers said they welcome a sporting initiative in the lake but instead of erecting a new structure, they could use or reconstruct an abandoned shed that existed only a yard away. “The erection of a new structure is also in blatant violation of the Calcutta High Court division bench order that categorically said in 2010 that no structure can be erected there without the environment impact assessment (EIA) and without the following the provisions of town and country planning (planning and development) act, 1979,” said Naba Dutta, general secretary of Sabuj Mancha, an umbrella organisation for environmental movements. Subhas Sarobar is one of the two major lake premises of the city. It is an ecologically sensitive zone and a biodiversity hot spot. It attracts migratory birds in winter and has a huge variety of flora and fauna. Any new encroachment will cause irreversible damage to the ecosystem, added Dutta. A senior officer of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of the lake premises, said: “The city police is developing a sporting utility there. It is not for commercial activity. The presence of Kolkata Police would also ensure a better law-and-order situation in the complex. Being a responsible organisation, they will take into account all legal aspects.” However, Dipankar Basu, a morning walker, said: “Huge pits have been dug and construction is being carried out behind the veil of a white cloth on a land measuring 50ftX20ft. The labourers have made a makeshift kitchen. All these activities could have been avoided if they had chosen the shed that is bigger in size. It would have suited their purpose.” Gagan Bose, a local resident and morning walker, added: “Our breathing spaces have already shrunk a lot. This is the only surviving breathing space for the entire north-eastern part. Metro Rail has already gobbled up a major chunk of green space. We had no say as it was a major public interest project. But why new construction when there are so many abandoned structures that could be converted into a rowing clubhouse?” Subhas Sarobar has multifarious features for sports, recreational and cultural activities, including swimming and jogging. Two islands have a number of trees of different species. The lake ecosystem is maintaining a crucial oxygen balance and acting as a natural sink of pollutants from the adjacent environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/construction-row-at-subhas-sarobar/articleshow/88016406.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Deported gangster gets clean chit in passport case||MUMBAI: In a setback to the city police, the additional metropolitan magistrate’s court on Tuesday acquitted deported gangster Santosh Pandurang Shetty of cheating and preparing a forged passport after the police failed to prove the charges. Shetty, a former member of the Chhota Rajan gang who had seven cases of kidnapping, threatening, and extortion against him, was deported from Bangkok in August 2011. He was nabbed in Bangkok on Interpol’s notice and was found having two passports with assumed names – Nicholas Madan Sharma and Nikhil Sharma. Shetty was granted bail in 2015. The 37th Metropolitan Magistrate SB Bhajipale acquitted Shetty of cheating, forgery, breach of trust, and charges under the Indian Passport Act and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs 15,000. It is unlikely that police will appeal, sources said. In the past, police did not challenge the acquittal of Chhota Rajan gang member Balu Dokre. “My client was framed in a false passport case, and he was caught from Mumbai itself and this was an argument before the court,” Ajay Umapati Dubey, Shetty’s advocate, said. Sources said that the court acquitted Shetty as the police failed to produce the original copies of the fake passport of Shetty which police claimed to have found on his person when he was arrested in Bangkok in 2011. “When Shetty was arrested in Bangkok, the authorities there refused to hand over the original copies of his fake passports. The police failed to produce the emergency certificate, immigration papers, nor did they produce boarding passes of the police team which went to Bangkok to get Shetty. Besides, there were also some other shortcomings,” said a source. Shetty has already been discharged in three cases, including the murder of advocate Shahid Azmi, the killing of a security guard at Ocean bar in Gamdevi and an attempt to murder and help another gangster Devendra Jagtap flee from police custody. Police said that there are two more cases pending against him – the kidnapping of a Vile Parle businessman and a kidnapping and extortion case in Surat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-deported-gangster-gets-clean-chit-in-passport-case/articleshow/88018481.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||How Gujarat’s Goan coach plotted Goa’s ouster in the Santosh Trophy||Panaji: When the Gujarat State Football Association (GSFA) appointed Marcelino Pereira as their head coach for the senior team, the brief was simple. Don’t concede too many goals in the Santosh Trophy qualifiers, like they did in the past, particularly against strong teams like Goa. In the previous edition, which was disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Gujarat finished bottom of their group and conceded 13 goals in four games. When a new committee took charge of the GSFA, they started the hunt for an outstation coach. They asked around, got recommendations and among those who suggested Marcelino was India U-16 head coach Bibiano Fernandes. The choice was spot on. Pereira got a free hand to select the players he wanted. Most of them were amateur footballers who were groomed for a month. What followed stunned Indian football. Pereira’s Gujarat team knocked five-time champions Goa out of the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy. The 1-0 victory in Bhavnagar helped Gujarat qualify for the main draw of the tournament after 36 years. Not surprisingly, Gujarat celebrated, and Goa mourned. “Gujarat is not like what it was before,” Marcelino told TOI on Wednesday. “Gujarat will be one of the powerful sporting states because of the facilities here. As Goans say, we are giants of football. We have come up to that level and are slipping now, I think. Other states are quickly catching up.” Gujarat topped group A with seven points and conceded only a goal, that too in their comeback 2-1 win over Daman and Diu in the second match after a disappointing goalless draw against Dadra and Nagar Haveli. “In the first game we flopped because Dadra & Nagar Haveli were not playing football. It was more physical. Second match we were down and went on to win the game 2-1. There I got little confidence. And we used it against Goa,” said Marcelino. Marcelino believes Gujarat is moving in the right direction. They had appointed a Spanish women’s coach for their under-17 residential academy, and it is now showing results. Wingers Rudrarajsinh Jadeja and Anirudhsinh Takor are products of the academy and Marcelino has no doubt about their potential. Gujarat are delighted but will have a herculean task in the final round against 32-time champions West Bengal, Services and others. “This team will perform, and I want to work hard with the team, especially in the finishing,” said Marcelino. While Marcelino has enjoyed the limelight, many fingers have been pointed at Goa’s dismal performance and the role of head coach Anthony Pereira. “When a team wins, everybody is there with the team, but when they lose, they point out fingers at coaches which is not right. I was surprised when sports personalities remarked that this result is not acceptable. How can you say this? On a given day anybody can play well, and a good team can play worse,” said Marcelino.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/how-gujarats-goan-coach-plotted-goas-ouster-in-the-santosh-trophy/articleshow/88038225.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

If any teacher is having health issues then they should produce medical certificates issued by government doctors before a medical board. He said necessary direction has been given to collect district-wise statistics of teachers who are yet to take the vaccines. Medical boards will be constituted to examine the unvaccinated teachers. If the teachers are not cleared by the medical board then they will have to take the vaccination with immediate effect. Teachers unwilling to take the vaccines will not be allowed to come to school and their absence will be considered as leave. However, various teachers’ associations have come out against the government’s decision to act against unvaccinated teachers. They have urged the government to first publish the list of teachers who are not vaccinated. The associations are of the view that the government’s figures of 5,000 unvaccinated teachers cannot be believed. The associations have also asked the government to convene a discussion on this before taking decisions to act against the teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/medical-boards-to-take-final-call-on-unvaxxed-teachers/articleshow/88016412.cms||---

The government of India approved the repatriation of Kumar at the request of the Gujarat government. Kumar said, “I got relieved from GOI duties today (Tuesday) and will join the state government in four or five days.” The unexpected repatriation of Raj Kumar had most bureaucrats assuming that the state government would almost immediately issue his appointment orders. However, he has been relieved by GOI a fortnight after the repatriation order. There is still a strong buzz in the state bureaucracy that Kumar may replace present chief secretary Pankaj Kumar as chief secretary before Kumar’s superannuation in May 2022. However, a key source close to the development said Raj Kumar will be appointed additional chief secretary (ACS) in the state government for a few months before he is elevated as the next chief secretary after Pankaj Kumar’s superannuation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/centre-relieves-raj-kumar-hell-join-state-govt-this-week/articleshow/88016414.cms||---

Besides seeking protection from eviction, they are demanding alternative accommodation. The residents moved the high court a couple of days after the AMC tried to bulldoze houses in the slum. During the hearing, advocate Anand Yagnik appeared for the petitioners and submitted that the families living on the premises of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust have been offered handsome amounts in compensation for their proposed displacement. For the redevelopment project, the slum dwellers will also be removed from the place, but the authorities have not come out with any scheme for either compensation or alternative accommodation for these poor people. These hutments are situated behind a water tank adjoining the ashram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-issues-notices-over-bid-to-raze-slums-near-ashram/articleshow/88016418.cms||---

The villagers said they have been receiving exorbitant water bills for the last few months despite the fact that chief minister Pramod Sawant has made an announcement of free water supply to every household up to 16,000 litres per month. Suresh Malik, a resident of Cudnem, said no responsible officer was present in the office when they approached the department and hence nobody present could give a satisfactory reply. “Government should not give hollow assurances to people like that of providing free water,” another resident said. Nalita Naik, another local, said metre readers are not able to give satisfactory reply over the rising amount of water bills.

---||Delhi||Delhi on toes: Close to 64,000 beds, better oxygen infrastructure||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal assured Delhi on Tuesday that his government was fully prepared to tackle any resurgence in Covid-19 cases following anxieties fuelled by Omicron, the latest coronavirus variant. After a high-level multi-departmental meeting to review the pandemic situation, Kejriwal assured that 30,000 oxygen-equipped beds, including 10,000 ICU beds, were ready and an additional 6,800 ICU beds would be in place by February for an over 63,800 Covid beds. At a press conference, Kejriwal disclosed that the government had ordered buffer stocks of 32 medicines to prevent any shortage while home isolation arrangements were also being strengthened. The oxygen supply and storage infrastructure are being bolstered and telemetry devices to provide real-time oxygen tracking will be installed at all oxygen facilities. The CM claimed to be personally monitoring the situation and appealed to all eligible people to get vaccinated, including those whose second dose was due. At present, 93% of Delhiites have received the first dose, of whom now 57% are fully vaccinated. Besides the arrangements for oxygen beds, Kejriwal said that the preparations include the capacity to set up 100 oxygen beds in every municipal ward at two-weeks’ notice. Altogether, the 270 wards could get 27,000 oxygen beds at short notice, bringing the total of Covid beds in Delhi to 63,800 beds. “All the manpower that will be needed for this is currently being trained,” said the CM. He also said that the 32 medicines required to treat Covid patients would be stocked to last at least for two months to avoid a shortfall. “Home isolation arrangements are also being made so that in the off chance that a third wave of coronavirus does hit, or that the Omicron variant spreads in India, Delhi is well prepared to protect its citizens,” Kejriwal said. The CM pointed out that the biggest setback in the last wave of infection was the haphazard distribution of oxygen. It is estimated that Delhi hospitals now have a combined capacity of 750 million tonnes. “To deal with storage and distribution of oxygen, we have created additional storage for 442 MT. Delhi has also constructed PSA plants to produce oxygen within the state, with 121 MT oxygen already being produced in the city,” Kejriwal claimed. He added that there were now three private oxygen refilling plants that could handle 1,500 cylinders a day. “In addition to this, we have built two bottling plants with an approximate capacity of 1,400 cylinders,” said the CM. “Delhi’s refilling capacity has increased now to 2,900 cylinders per day. To avoid the other major problem of transportation of the gas, we have bought 15 oxygen tankers, which will be with us within a month to avoid this problem.” Delhi government is also working on adequate manpower for Covid management. It has trained 15,370 healthcare workers to manage the infection, including 4,673 doctors, 1,707 medical students, 6,265 nurses and 2,726 paramedics. Around 5,000 health assistants have also been roped in. From December 1, the state government will activate protocols for testing, isolation and quarantine of passengers coming from countries that have reported Omicron cases. DDMA issued an order on Tuesday specifying that travellers from Europe, including UK, South Africa, Bangladesh, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel, will have to follow new testing and isolation measures at Delhi airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-on-toes-close-to-64k-beds-better-o2-infra/articleshow/88017172.cms||AlokKNMishra

The case diary is in six bounded booklets. Additional district government counsel Ashish Tiwari informed that the case would be tried in the anti-dacoity court in Kanpur Dehat. As per provisions of Cr PC, the photocopy of case diary was provided to the defence counsel. The court has fixed December 3 as the next date of hearing of the case. Earlier, the court had recorded the statement of the accused through video conferencing. In Bikru case which took place on July 2, 2020, gangster Vikas Dubey and his gang had killed as many as 8 cops, including a circle officer and injured others when they raided the village to arrest them in Bikru village under Chaubeypur police station. Main culprit Vikas Dubey was later killed in an encounter by the police. According to sources, the apex court has rejected the petition of Richa Dubey, wife of gangster Vikas Dubey. Richa had filed a petition in the Supreme Court in which she pleaded the court to quash the FIR lodged against her in which she had been charged by the SIT for using the SIM card issued in the name of some other person. The Supreme Court while rejecting her petition had directed her to surrender before the trial court and then file her bail application. The SIT had identified some persons in the Bikaroo case who were using the SIM cards issued in the name of other persons without taking their permission. Richa Dubey, wife of Vikas Dubey too was using a SM issued in the name of some another person and the SIT had charged her for cheating. Richa was using the SIM of her servant Mahesh. She had filed a petition in Allahabad high court for quashing the FIR against her but the high court also had rejected her plea. Aggrieved with the high court’s order, Richa had moved the Apex court and had challenged its order.. The apex court division bench of Justice Sanjeev Khanna and Justice BM Trivedi heard her petition and the arguments of her counsel Salman Khurshid. The court observed that when the chargesheet had been filed in this case then there was no logic to hear the petition seeking the quashing of the FIR. The apex court directed Richa to surrender before the trial court within seven days and file her bail application as per law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/anti-dacoity-court-of-kanpur-dehat-dist-to-hear-bikru-case/articleshow/88017825.cms||Anant Shekher Misra

After a detailed discussion, the proposal was found to be feasible, a review meeting to carry forward the proposal was held by a committee comprising divisional commissioner, police commissioner, DM, MD Kesco, vice-chairman KDA, municipal commissioner, UPSIDA and PWD officers. A field visit was also conducted after the meeting. Commissioner Raj Shekhar said that in the proposed 28 km Ganga Link expressway (Elevated Internal Ring Road) project, 6 km of the existing road has to be widened into 4 lanes and the remaining 22 km has to be elevated into 4 lane road. “As of now, the administration has requested the Union ministry of road transport and highways to approve the project in principle and sanction necessary funds for appointing a consultant and for preparing the detailed project report (DPR)”, the commissioner said. He said the 28-km road will have 6 intersections with entry and exit points and added in future this project will also help to boost potential of the UPSIDA project of Trans-Ganga-KDA project of New Kanpur City. The team visited three sites of the proposed project. Important issues like land acquisition, alignment, entry and exit points, airport, bus station connectivity, provisions of transit-oriented development (TOD), re-designing of existing chaurahas etc. have to be considered in coming days, he said. “We will now send a request letter in the next 15 days to Union ministry of road transport and highways, Government of India for preparation of DPR”, the commissioner further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/ganga-link-e-way-proposal-to-be-sent-to-union-min-of-transport/articleshow/88017835.cms||---
---||Delhi||Special ward at Delhi’s Lok Nayak Hospital to treat Omicron patients||NEW DELHI: A special ward has been created at Delhi’s Lok Nayak Hospital to treat patients suspected or confirmed positive for Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The 40-bedded ward has restricted access, Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of the hospital, said. “Right now, we don’t have any suspected or confirmed cases of Omicron variant. But we are readying infrastructure needed to handle any such cases with special focus on ensuring minimum contact and disease spread,” he added. Lok Nayak Hospital, which is run by the Delhi government, has treated nearly 25,000 Covid-19 patients since the beginning of the pandemic. Dr Kumar said that even earlier, they were running a special ward for isolating travellers from foreign nations as and when reports of newer variants, for example the Beta, Delta, and Delta Plus variants, emerged. “Our doctors and nurses are fully trained for the job. We are still holding regular training programmes to keep them updated on the newer variants, their threat perception and treatment protocols,” the hospital director explained. Initial reports from South Africa, where the Omicron was detected first, suggest that the new variant is more transmissible. However, it causes milder symptoms, doctors say. “We need more evidence to assess the immune escape properties and risk of severe disease due to the variant,” said a senior doctor. AIIMS Trauma Centre, which served as a Covid hospital during the pandemic and resumed trauma services recently, has kept a floor equipped with all necessary equipment and ICU facility reserved for Covid patients. However, doctors said, the number of beds for Covid patients can be scaled up if the need arises. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalisation in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron. “There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants,” the UN health body says. In a recent statement, the WHO added: “Initial reported infections were among university students — younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease — but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of Covid-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/special-ward-at-lok-nayak-to-treat-omicron-patients/articleshow/88017186.cms||---

Other areas of south Bengal may receive heavy to very heavy showers, say weathermen. From Friday, the showers may start in coastal districts of East and West Midnapore, South and North 24 Parganas and Jhargram, which may receive very heavy rain on Saturday even as the cyclonic storm hits the north Andhra and Odisha coasts on December 4. According to a bulletin released by the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), a low pressure hovers over south Thailand and neighbourhood on Tuesday morning. It is likely to emerge into Andaman Sea by Tuesday night and then move west-northwestwards and turn into a depression over southeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal by December 2. The system is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over central parts of the Bay of Bengal during the subsequent 24 hours. “Then, it is likely to move northwestwards, intensify further and reach north Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coasts on December 4 morning. The system has started forming on Tuesday, so it’s still too early to predict the exact course that it will take. But the chances of its turning into a cyclone are high,” said an RMC official. Weather in Kolkata and the rest of south Bengal will remain dry and sunny till Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-spies-weekend-rain-in-kolkata/articleshow/88016478.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

People coming from South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong will be allowed to leave IGIA only if they test negative for Covid. Else, they have to go to designated Covid centres. Other people arriving from countries at risk of the Omicron variant will be allowed to take connecting domestic flights only after a negative result on testing at the airport. “Delhi airport has made seating arrangements with social distancing and required facilities for 1,200-1,400 passengers and this can be expanded if there is a bigger demand,” said an airport source. “The laboratory at the airport can process 500-600 samples in an hour. This means we anticipate a wait of four to six hours for the RT-PCR test, which will cost Rs 500.” Since arrivals from at-risk countries need a negative Covid report to take connecting flights, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has advised travellers to “plan their onward journey keeping in mind the stay at the airport to obtain the test results”. Currently, the Union health ministry’s list of at-risk countries include Europe, including the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. While everyone coming from these places or after transiting from there, will be tested on arrival except asymptomatic children under five years of age, 5% of other arrivals will be tested randomly. The DGCA order said, “Announcements about the seat numbers selected through the randomisation process for tests may be made in the flight itself so that the passengers are prepared.” However, an airline official responded, “No announcements will be made on board the aircraft. The randomly selected passengers will be escorted to the test area, where IGIA has made robust arrangements to handle all exigencies.” The regulator has asked airport operators to install signages at prominent places and place volunteers to guide the passengers to prevent any chaos. Airlines are apprehensive about passenger confusion and anger in complying with these rules. “Flyers know venting ire during flights invites strict action. At the airport, however, even a small irritant leads to arguments. The constantly changing rules about Covid worldwide has made this more pronounced,” said a pilot of an Indian carrier. A spokesperson for GMR Group, operator of the Delhi and Hyderabad airports, said on Monday, “We will be ready with all necessary arrangements keeping in mind the fresh guidelines and passenger convenience. We will ensure adherence to Covid-19 protocols during the stay of passengers in the terminal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-rules-on-arrival-rt-pcr-test-report-to-take-up-to-6-hours-at-igi/articleshow/88017198.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Kolkata||Students, techies & seniors take lead in rally to spread awareness on cyber safety||Kolkata: A first-of-its-kind cyber crime awareness rally was taken out on the streets of Sector V in Salt Lake with 400-odd students, techies, senior citizens and distinguished personalities who highlighted the need of mass awareness on cyber security on Tuesday — National Computer Security Day. The city has witnessed a five-fold rise in cyber crime cases in the past two years. While only 32 FIRs pertaining to cyber crime were registered in 2018, the number stood at 172 in 2020. Though the spike in Kolkata is significant, the number is miniscule when compared to Bengaluru (8,892) and Hyderabad (2,553). According to the police, the sharp rise in cyber crime is a result of the fact that many people are spending more time online these days to work, transact and interact. While the rise in online bank transactions led to more cases of cyber fraud, increased social interaction online resulted in more cases of cheating and obscenity. “The Digital India campaign was launched in 2015. But it came into reality only after the pandemic in 2020. While people were forced to stay indoors, digital medium became the only way to order food, book a cab, buy medicines, speak to friends, work from home, connect to clients, get entertained. With the majority of Indians being not ready for this situation, it resulted in bank fraud, data breaches, defaced websites and disruptions in online classes. Here comes the need for cyber security awareness and skilled ethical hackers — cybersecurity professionals who can keep the digital world safe,” said Sandeep Sengupta, director of Indian School of Ethical Hacking (ISOEH). “Digital India can only be adopted if it is secure and safe,” he added. The rally was flagged off from SDF Building in Sector V in the presence of Debashis Sen, managing director, WBHIDCO, Saikat Maitra, vice-chancellor, MAKAUT, West Bengal, painter Suvaprasanna Bhattachharjee, actress and former Mrs India International Richa Sharma and chess Grand Master Dibyendu Barua along with many young management and IT students. “Cyber security awareness is the need of the hour and so was the walk. Our entire team of Nabadiganta officials will undergo a cyber security awareness training shortly as well,” said Sen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-techies-seniors-take-lead-in-rally-to-spread-awareness-on-cyber-safety/articleshow/88016466.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Ahmedabad||After Arvind, Ashima moves high court||Ahmedabad: After Arvind Ltd, another textile major from the city, Ashima Ltd, on Tuesday approached the Gujarat high court after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) snapped its drainage connection in Khokhra during its drive to curb discharge of trade effluent into city’s sewerage network to stop it going further to the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). On Tuesday, senior advocate Mihir Thakore mentioned before the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati the issue of disconnection and urged the court to hear the case, which has been put up for the hearing on December 3, which the court is scheduled to hear. Before the court, advocate Thakore said “There was one more unit for which we wanted circulation of application and we mentioned about it yesterday. The unit was not closed till yesterday, but it has been closed today.” The civic authorities confirmed that Ashima Ltd’s drainage connection was severed as part of its crackdown on illegal connections with sewage lines by industrial units to discharge effluent in sewage and the industrial mix with sewage damage STPs and reduce their capacity to treat water. This drive has been undertaken at the behest of the high court, which has undertaken proceedings to stop discharge of improperly treated water from STPs into the Sabarmati river saying that the efforts should be made to rejuvenate the river. Meanwhile, another company, Omega Elevators in Rakhial, has also approached the high court after the civic officials severed its drainage connection. The company has claimed that the drainage connection was used for the washroom facility for its 800-odd employees. The company, however, could not reply to the court’s query whether it had obtained AMC’s permission for the connection two decades ago or it was an unauthorised connection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-arvind-ashima-moves-high-court/articleshow/88017239.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Ensure bail pleas of foreigners have all details, lower courts told||PANAJI: In view of foreign nationals in conflict with law giving fake identities, claiming that their identity documents are not available, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Tuesday directed both the sessions courts in Goa to ensure that applications for bail/anticipatory bail filed by foreign nationals contain their full and correct names as stated in their passport. They are also asked to ensure that they provide full details of their passport and visa, including type of visa and point of entry in India, funds available, its source and bank account details among other details. The court stated that is a “matter of concern” that the bail applicant in the present case has “given his name as Robert Obidike and it is later found that he is actually a convicted accused for an offence in 2014, wherein he stood convicted in another name i.e. Collins Dom”. ‘If proper directions are not given and appropriate steps are not taken in this context, there is every possibility of the situation going out of control,” Justice Mahesh Pitale stated. It was submitted to the high court that there is a raging problem of drug abuse and that a number of foreign nationals enter India on tourist visas and thereafter indulge in such activities, overstay, in violation of the periods and conditions of visa granted to them and deliberately suppress or destroy their passports so that when apprehended for criminal activities, there is no document to ascertain their identity. “There appears to be substance in the contention raised by the public prosecutor (S G Bhobe) on behalf of the state that in a number of cases involving foreign nationals, particularly pertaining to offences under the NDPS Act, when such persons are apprehended, they give fictitious names,” the court stated, adding that it is not possible for investigating authorities to ascertain whether names given are correct. “Such persons do not even have valid visas when they are apprehended. Thus, when such persons are released on bail, it is obviously difficult for the state to ascertain their identities and to continue to monitor their activities for ensuring their cooperation with the investigation and the trial proceedings,” the court observed. “It is perhaps for this reason, that officials from the High Commission of Nigeria had visited jails in the state in February 2021, to undertake biometric analysis to verify the actual identities of Nigerian accused of various offences,”the court stated. After the biometric analysis and verification of identities of the accused persons, fresh passports were issued to them. “The apprehensions expressed on behalf of the state are real and it is necessary that the contentions raised on behalf of the state are taken into consideration for issuing appropriate directions,” the high court stated. The court took into consideration the detailed submissions and “serious issues” highlighted by public prosecutor S G Bhobe and who pressed for conditions and directions to be issued for sessions courts to call for appropriate information from accused persons applying for bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ensure-bail-pleas-of-foreigners-have-all-details-lower-courts-told/articleshow/88017873.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Hyderabad||In a 1st after BJP’s rise in Centre, TRS at opposition meet||HYDERABAD: In a first in the last seven years, TRS attended a meeting of opposition parties in Parliament on Tuesday. The meeting was organised by Congress’ Mallikarjun Kharge, who is also the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha , to chalk out a combined strategy over suspension of 12 opposition MPs from RS, including six from the Congress, on Monday for the entire session. From the TRS, party RS floor leader K Keshava Rao took part in the meeting which was also attended by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and held at Kharge’s office. All these years since the BJP-led NDA came to power at the Centre in 2014, the TRS has supported the central government — both in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha — on various Bills and even elections to the post of President and vice-president. But the strain on relations between the TRS and BJP began to show soon after the pink party lost the Dubbak bypoll to the saffron outfit. Since the loss in Huzurabad bypoll to BJP, TRS president and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has changed tack, launching into a fierce attack against the BJP government at the Centre and PM on various issues, including the paddy row. There’s also no love lost between TRS and Congress at the state-level either, with many MLAs from the grand old party abandoning it for the former soon after winning in the assembly polls. On Tuesday, however, TRS leaders said that they attended the meeting of opposition parties — organised by Congress — to show solidarity and demand lifting of suspension of 12 MPs. “The suspended MPs are from TMC, Shiv Sena, CPI, CPM too and not just Congress,” a TRS MP said, explaining the party’s appearance at the meeting. Meanwhile, the TRS MPs continued their protest for the second day on Tuesday over the paddy procurement issue. MPs demanded that Centre bring a Bill for MSP, come up with uniform procurement policy and also pay Rs 25 lakh compensation to the kin of nearly 750 farmers who died in the past one year during the stir against the three farm laws (now repealed).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/in-a-1st-after-bjps-rise-incentre-trs-at-oppn-meet/articleshow/88016458.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||State-run schools in Telangana not sanitised even once since they opened||HYDERABAD: State-run schools in Telangana have not been sanitised even once since they opened for physical classes in August, raising fears of rapid spread of the coronavirus. So far, 212 students have already tested positive in 14 separate outbreaks and teachers working in government schools demanded on Tuesday that the government must immediately sanction additional funds for sanitisation of most government institutes if they want to ensure a Covid-free environment. They said that schools were sanitised once with the help of municipal and gram panchayat workers in the last week of August 2021, before resuming physical classes. Complaining about the situation, M Ravinder, vice-president, Telangana Private Teachers Federation, said, ““At ground level, workers are not cleaning schools.” There are some 27,000 government schools in Telangana. Every year, Rs 63 crore is sanctioned from Samagra Shiksha as a budget to hire the sanitation staff for all government schools in the state. During the pandemic, no budget was sanctioned. Instead, the state directed the municipal/gram panchayat workers to take care of sanitation. “About 80% of the schools have not been sanitized after physical classes resumed. Time and again we have requested officials to release funds to hire sanitation workers, but nothing has been done yet. We are forced to function in an unhygienic environment, especially amid the pandemic,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, Telangana State United Teachers Federation. Teachers said it would cost about Rs 2,500 per month to hire a sanitation worker and added depending on strength, a school used to have one to five sanitation workers. In a few schools, gram panchayat officials have offered to pay for a sanitation worker instead of sending their staff. An official from the education department said, “We were informed sanitisation is not being carried out regularly. We will look into it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-run-schools-not-sanitised-even-once-since-they-opened/articleshow/88016490.cms||---

Revanth stated that CM must leave Hyderabad and begin his protest in national capital. “Unlike Congress, KCR will never be able to take BJP head-on. He is terrified of Modi government, thus he remains a covert ally,” he said. Revanth claimed that when opposition parties, demanded a debate on farmers’ issue during repeal of three agriculture laws they were denied. “TRS MPs rushed to Union government’s rescue by prolonging proceedings so that repeal of the laws could be done without debate,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-dareskcr-to-hold-afast-unto-death/articleshow/88016481.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CBI opposes relief to Nimmagadda||Hyderabad: Stating that the projected public purposes like development and employment generation from Vanpic port and industrial corridor had never been achieved, the CBI on Tuesday alleged that the accused in the Vanpic chargesheet, however, could implement their hidden agenda under the garb of raising the project. Without laying a single brick for the proposed project, project developer Nimmagadda Prasad got 12,000 acres and he invested Rs 850 crore in Jagan’s (AP CM Jagan Mohan Reddy) firms in a quid pro quo arrangement, CBI counsel K Surender said. He was arguing the case of the CBI before Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of Telangana high court. The judge was hearing a plea filed by Prasad urging the court to quash the CBI case against him. Opposing any relief to Prasad, the CBI counsel appealed to the court to take a macro view of the scheme of things. “Then, the larger conspiracy would be visible. What they are doing now is that each accused is filing separate pleas seeking freedom from the case saying that they have no role in the alleged scam,” he said. “If each of them seeks freedom from the case citing their roles as negligible, none would look culpable. But, a bird’s eye view of the whole thing would unravel the conspiracy,” Surender said, urging the court to take such a holistic view of the issue. Earlier in the day, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy appeared for Prasad and said that Vanpic was a government-to-government project signed between AP and Ras Al Khaima (RAK). “Neither AP nor RAK suffered or complained of any loss in the project and hence they did not raise any objection. But, the CBI has seen a scam and filed a chargesheet without any substance or evidence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-opposes-relief-to-nimmagadda/articleshow/88016494.cms||---

Some units have been habitual offenders,” said a senior GPCB official. The official also explained that GPCB does not inspect a facility unless the AMC cuts the drainage connection of the unit. There are, according to AMC’s engineering department, some 550 units that are dumping effluent into the civic body’s sewerage. The AMC has disconnected 56 drains since November 25. These were mostly in industrial estates located in the Behrampura, Nikol, Shahpur, Danilimda, Lambha, Asarwa, Ramol-Hathijan and India Colony areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/40-units-already-had-gpcb-notices/articleshow/88017237.cms||---

This is the second time in the past three months that the master plan draft has been rejected due to various flaws. The master plan was proposed to be implemented in March 2021. Rajendra Pensiya, ADA vice-chairman, along with other officials had tabled the revised draft before the committee on Monday. Sources said after going through the draft, the committee raised several objections and returned it for improvement. ADA officials were directed to study the urban planning followed by Chandigarh and make required changes in the master plan. According to sources, the committee has raised objections on change of land use around river Yamuna and inclusion of an industrial area, in violation of the norms, in the master plan. Besides, technical flaws in the proposed plan to develop marketplaces and residential areas were pointed out. Pensiya said, “We are addressing the objections related to the change of land use, conceptual layout and other technical issues raised by the committee. The final draft will be presented soon.” The ADA has been working on the master plan for the city for the last two years. A Ghaziabad-based private consultancy firm was given the contract to develop the city development plan for the next 10 years. Under the AMRUT scheme of the central government, the development authorities in 63 cities of UP, including Agra, are working on the master plan, 2031, using the geographic information system (GIS) technology. Earlier in September, the ADA’s draft of the master plan was rejected following lack of required details. A master plan provides a conceptual layout to guide future growth and development of a site. It involves analysis, recommendations, and proposals for a site’s population, economy, housing, transportation, community facilities and land use. It is based on public input, surveys, planning initiatives, existing development, physical characteristics, and social and economic conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/state-govt-panel-rejects-agra-master-plan-2031-for-2nd-time-in-3-months/articleshow/88015608.cms||Deepak Lavania

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Park Street flyover to remain shut for load test||KOLKATA: The busy Park Street Flyover on JL Nehru Road will remain shut this weekend for 56 hours in order to allow a necessary load test of the structure. The shut down — effective between 10pm on December 3 (Friday) to 6am on December 6 (Monday) — received the necessary go ahead from the Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra’s office on Tuesday. The shutdown will mean both northbound and southbound traffic (Esplanade-bound and Exide-bound ) will have to use the JL Nehru Road and cross the Park Street crossing for their movement. “We might face a little pressure on Saturday morning. Otherwise, we don’t think there will be any major road block in the vicinity as a number of alternate routes are available,” said a senior police officer. He, however, insisted that they have informed HRBC (Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners) to complete work before Monday peak hour traffic. Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey said that other alternate roads will be kept ready in case of emergency. “In case of any emergency, a part of the Esplanade-bound traffic may be diverted down Red Road from the Park Street crossing. Similarly, if required, the Exide-bound traffic may be diverted down Dufferin Road and Mayo road via RR Avenue,” said an officer. Senior officials of the agency responsible for the maintenance of the flyover has informed police that personnel and machinery will move in from December 3 morning and the test will begin at night. Police, though, stated that they cannot effect a shutdown till Friday evening traffic is cleared. On December 4 and 5, engineers will conduct a series of tests on the 1.3-km flyover on JL Nehru Road before it is opened on December 6. Apart from Park Street flyover, Gariahat flyover, AJC Bose Road flyover, Lockgate flyover in Khidderpore and Nagerbazar flyover will undergo similar tests next year. “The steel and concrete structure needs immediate assessment about its wear and tear,” said a senior engineer of the HRBC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/park-st-flyover-to-remain-shut-for-load-test/articleshow/88016488.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||5,000 apply for ex gratia in Telangana, many more sans Covid death documents||HYDERABAD: Around 5,000 people have so far applied for Covid compensation in Telangana, as per health authorities. With many more returning from Meeseva centres each day, hoping to get proper certificates so they can apply for the compensation. The compensation for family members of Covid victims was announced by the Centre a month ago. The Telangana government released guidelines for payment of the ex gratia recently. So far, 6.75 lakh people in Telangana have been infected by Covid-19, of which 3,992 succumebd to the virus, as per official figures. However, these figures have taken into account only deaths of patients who did not have any other ailment and deaths recorded in hospitals. Authorities say, deaths in patients having other complications were not labelled as Covid deaths, making it tough for their kin to seek compensation. Elaborating on other situations where the kin would not have required certificates, an official from the health department, said, “several patients who died on the way to hospitals, in ambulances, during the first and second wave might have gone unrecorded. Many died in remote villages with or without treatment. Some underwent Covid tests, but there were no death certificates. Others do not have reports of supportive tests like CT Scan, RTPCR etc.” “Besides this, in case of hospitalised patients, some families did not even take the bodies home during the first wave due to the associated stigma. The government itself conducted the cremation. Such family members have no evidence that the patient died due to Covid-19,” added the official. Despite the fact that the state has formed a district-level ‘Covid-19 death ascertaining’ committee (CDAC) a fortnight ago, many are unable to get the necessary documents. “There are many people turning up saying that the patient had tested positive, but had died at home while undergoing treatment or had suddenly deteriorated and died. As a result, the families do not have the required reports. Their death certificates do not mention Covid as cause of death and they are now unable to apply for compensation,” said a meeseva employee from Ameenpur area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/5000-apply-for-ex-gratia-many-more-sans-covid-death-docus/articleshow/88016515.cms||Amrita Didyala

The hospital said Sastry had died of lung cancer-related complications at 4.07 pm. His body will be kept at the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce at Filmnagar from 7am on Wednesday for people to pay their respects. It was through the film ‘Sirivennela’ directed by K Vishwanath that Sastry had carved a name for himself in Telugu film world and the song that he penned ‘Vidhatha talapuna’ was well received. The film’s name stuck to his original name since then. Sastry had penned more than 3,000 songs for 800 films. Some of the songs that he wrote lyrics for, which brought him laurels include ‘Nammaku nammaku ee reyini’ from ‘Rudraveena’ film and ‘Akasamlo harivillu’ in ‘Swanakamalam’. His lyrics for songs in films like ‘Kshana Kshanam’, ‘Shubhalagnam’, ‘Bommarillu’ and ‘Ala Vaikuntapuram Lo’ also won him a lot of appreciation. Sastry won the Nandi award for best lyricist several times for his songs, including for ‘Vidhatha talapuna’ in 1986. He also won five Filmfare awards, including for films ‘Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana’ and ‘Kanche’. He made his debut as a song writer in the film ‘Janani Janmabhoomi’ in 1984. Condolences poured in. Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said when he came to know that Sastry was unwell, he called up KIMS and spoke to doctors about his health condition and wished that he recover soon.

Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, the minister for tourism, culture and north-east states development took at the dig at the CM and said, “The only condition is that the debate be held in a civilised manner without the use of abusive language because I am not skilled at it and will lose as I cannot match him.” The minister further said, “I believe the CM’s insulting comments on PM Narendra Modi and me have only served to diminish the status of the position he holds. I’ll leave it to the people of Telangana to decide, but we’re prepared to take any insults for the cause of the people, and I’ll continue to work for the welfare and development of the state.”  Union minister claimed that all he said was that Centre was willing to buy every grain of paddy this season to boost farmers’ trust and that the CM was ‘insecure’ after the Huzurabad bypoll loss, prompting him to criticise the Centre. He expressed his dismay that neither the CM nor the chief secretary sought his assistance or attempted to contact him during their visits to Delhi. “I never got an appointment with CM and was unable to speak with him on the phone when I became a central minister. I come from a farming background and had to work my way up. Perhaps, he thinks I’m small,” Kishan claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ready-for-debate-with-kcrminus-abuses-kishan-reddy/articleshow/88016512.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Aware of the long-drawn battle for justice, the victim’s brother said, “We have full faith in the judiciary and hope to get justice for my sister soon.” Even after a year, the family is confined to their home and doing nothing, owing to security concerns. “Our lives have come to a standstill. Neither do we have jobs nor can we do take up farming as CRPF personnel escort us everywhere,” he said. His niece, who had been sent to their maternal grandparents’ house in Firozabad district for studies, had to return after dengue spread in the district. Recently, the victim’s family had reiterated its request to the high court to relocate them to Noida from Hathras village. But the state government has offered to relocate the family in Hathras only and has allotted them a house. The next date of hearing is December 16. On Thursday, Yadav had tweeted: "It is an appeal to residents of Uttar Pradesh, the SP and its allies to observe ‘Hathras Ki Beti Memorial Day’ on the 30th of every month and recall the inhumane manner in which the BJP government in the state got the body of the victim burnt on November 30 last year. The ‘anti-Dalit’ stance of the BJP government should be exposed,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/sp-observes-hathras-ki-beti-memorial-day-even-as-kin-await-justice/articleshow/88015616.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat second highest in lock-up deaths||AHMEDABAD: Figures from the Union home ministry on custodial violence shows a sorry state of Gujarat, which stood second in the entire country in terms of deaths in police custody this year. Gujarat with 21 deaths in police custody is next only to Maharashtra, which reported 26 such deaths till November 15 this year. According to figures from the Union home ministry, the country reported 151 deaths in police custody and Gujarat accounted for nearly 14%. Bihar. which reported 18 deaths in police custody, and Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with 11 deaths each, are better off than Gujarat. Figures tabled before the Lok Sabha on Tuesday indicated that Gujarat is still witnessing incidents of custodial torture. In January this year, Kutch police drew flak over two men, suspects in a housebreak case, being beaten to death. A judicial inquiry was ordered after this. In September, a youth who was picked up by Aravalli police for questioning in connection with a grenade blast inquiry, was found hanging from a tree. His family alleged that the youth committed suicide as he could not bear the police torture. The same month, another custodial death was reported in Godhra, Panchmahal district. Qasim Hayat, who was arrested for selling beef, was found hanging himself from a piece of cloth in Godhra police station. Apart from incidents of torture in lock-ups, the state also does not have a good picture in terms of deaths in judicial custody or in jails. Between the financial years 2018-19 and 2020-21, Gujarat reported 202 deaths in various jails across the state. Crime in India in 2020, a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), also revealed that the number of custodial deaths in Gujarat was the highest in 2020. Fifteen persons, who were in police custody without remand, died in various districts of the state in 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-second-highest-in-lock-up-deaths/articleshow/88017264.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Naming inmates? No ostrich approach here||NEW DELHI: A three-year-old beautiful ostrich was reunited with his brother at National Zoological Park in September this year. While one ostrich had arrived from Punjab’s Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park in October 2020, his brother reached Delhi almost a year later. The siblings were recently named “Ram-Lakhan” after the selected names garnered the maximum votes in an online poll. As Delhi zoo has received many new species since August and a few old inmates do not have a name, the staff has been busy searching for the best names for the animals. The authorities first request for probable names from keepers, caretakers and people who spend time with the animals and birds. The suggestions are given mostly according to their behaviour. After getting four options, the names are posted on social media platforms, Twitter and Instagram. The voting continues for two days and the name with the maximum votes is finalised. For instance, the staff initially suggested names like Jatayu, Jwala and Vayu for the endangered Egyptian vulture considering its appearance and mythological aspects. The vulture was finally named Jatayu after it received 64% votes in an online poll. Similarly, a pair of sloth bears was named Ballu and Maira in the same manner. The zoo keepers had recommended “Begum” as the name for the female sloth bear owing to her tantrums. Sonali Ghosh, director, Delhi zoo, said, “Giving a name to an animal is a part of positive reinforcement exercise. When we call an animal by its name, it gets familiar with it and starts reacting to the commands of the caretakers. It helps in reinforcing the bond of animals with humans. If we have to capture a bear for vaccination, it will be convenient to call the animal, rather than run after him. People can also identify animals and birds easily through their names.” Hyenas and gharials are next in line to get names. A male and female gharial aged 12 years were brought to National Zoological Park from Jaipur’s Nahargarh Biological Park in 2019. Two female hyenas came from there last year. The polling for choosing their names will begin soon. “We ask people to help us select the names of animals and birds to give them ownership rights on how the zoo is being run. The zoo has 92 species,” said Ghosh. However, some animals got their names for other reasons too. Union MoS for forest and environment Ashwini Kumar Choubey named two Royal Bengal tigers Riddhi and Aditi and three lions Maheshwar, Shailja and Mahagauri during Navaratra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/naming-inmates-no-ostrich-approach-here/articleshow/88017206.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Patna||Empty liquor bottles in Bihar assembly building, probe ordered||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar ordered a high-level inquiry after empty liquor bottles were found on the south-eastern end of the state legislature building on the second day of the winter session on Tuesday. Liquor is banned in Bihar. Even on Monday, the NDA legislators had taken the pledge again in support of the prohibition law enforced in the state. The state government has been facing embarrassment following the recent hooch tragedies in which more than 60 people died in several districts and the complaints about the easy availability of liquor despite ban on its consumption and sale since April 5, 2016. CM Nitish personally reviewed the implementation of the prohibition law a fortnight ago, which resulted in the police action and arrest of several people found consuming or smuggling liquor in Patna and other parts of the state. Responding to the leader of opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, on the floor of the state legislative assembly after his persistently raising the matter related to the detection of empty liquor bottles and the remains of spicy edibles (called ‘chakhna’ in local parlance) beside the annexe building on the state legislature campus, the CM announced that chief secretary Tripurari Sharan and DGP S K Singhal will conduct an inquiry into the incident. “Kharab, bahut hi kharab hua hai (what has happened is not only bad, but very bad). How can it be tolerated?” Nitish said and added: “It is not a simple matter. It could be that someone has been trying to play mischief. How did it (liquor bottles) reach there and who brought it; everything will be looked into. The persons found guilty will not be spared.” The CM said he was not even aware of what had happened on the assembly campus, as he was busy elsewhere in some work. “But what has happened is shocking, rather intolerable, and high-level inquiry will be made,” he said. Earlier, Tejashwi, accompanied by a few other MLAs, rushed to the site where empty liquor bottles were found. “Things have come to this; liquor bottles have been found on the campus of the temple of democracy in the state. Nitish has no moral right to continue in his office, because he is also the state’s home minister,” he said. When the House met to carry on the proceedings to pass the Bills as part of the government’s legislative business, Tejashwi raised the matter and also repeated his demand regarding the CM’s resignation. Both the Speaker, Vijay Kumar Sinha, and parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary handled the matter and praised Tejashwi for having brought the incident into the notice of the government. The Speaker even warned Tejashwi that someone could also play the mischief of putting empty liquor bottles on the premises of his official residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/empty-liquor-bottles-found-on-state-assembly-premises-cm-orders-probe/articleshow/88016518.cms||Abhay Singh
