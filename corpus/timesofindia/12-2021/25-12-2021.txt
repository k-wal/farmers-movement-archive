The term of the assembly can be extended during an emergency and the emergency can be declared only for two reasons -- first, a war and secondly, huge internal disturbance (law and order situation). Pandemic cannot be the reason for the postponement of the election,” Qureshi told TOI. He further said, “Election rallies can be banned to avoid spread of the virus and campaigns can be done via print, TV and social media. Even a door-to-door and bicycle campaign in small groups following the Covid protocol can be done.” Meanwhile, Balraj Chauhan, constitutional expert and former vice-chancellor of three national law universities, including Ram Manohar Lohia Law University Lucknow, told TOI: “Before declaring the dates of the election, the EC can consult the government to maintain constitutional morality, commitment and requirements. Once the date of election is announced, then all the decisions will be taken by the EC according to the Constitution.” Responding to the apprehension of a third wave impacting the election, he said, “The EC has to take steps to save the people’s life which is more important than anything else. Even PM Narendra Modi said ‘Jaan hain to Jahan hai’ during the first lockdown. But during the second lockdown he changed it to ‘Jaan bhi jaroori hai aur jahan bhi’. According to EC sources, stringent steps will be taken to ensure strict adherence of Covid protocol during polling. “There will be more polling booths and social distancing will be followed. Every booth will have sanitation kits along with masks. For all above 80 years of age or those who are ill and unable to come to the polling station, the EC is likely to reach their doorstep. The polling timings too would be increased.” Meanwhile, responding to the Allahabad HC concerns ‘if rallies are not stopped, results will be worse than the second wave’, CEC Sushil Chandra said, “Next week we will go to Uttar Pradesh, review the situation there and then take an appropriate decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/postponement-of-polls-unlikely-ec-may-ban-rallies-say-experts/articleshow/88481785.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The government’s order came after earlier in the day the Delhi high court termed overcrowding at the market a scary situation, Covid or no Covid. A viral video of massive overcrowding at the market was played before the court. The order for odd-even operation issued by the office of the sub divisional magistrate, Vasant Vihar on Friday evening states that ‘increasing footfalls are seen in Sarojini Nagar market during last few days; and therefore with the need to control the same in light of the rapid spike in daily cases and positivity; it was decided unanimously by all Market Trade Associations in the meeting held on 24th December 2021, to follow odd-even operations for weekend of 25th & 26th December 2021’. With the market witnessing overcrowding in the last few days, a meeting of all the stakeholder of market was convened at 7 pm on Friday by the Tehsildar (Vasant Vihar) regarding maintenance of Covid appropriate behaviour. It was decided in the meeting that the Director (Enforcement) New Delhi Municipal Council and SHO, Sarojini Market shall ensure that no unauthorised vendor or street vendor is operating in the market and there shall be no encroachment in the entire market. Shop owners will not be allowed to encroach upon the public path or permit space in front of shops for any unauthorised use. Violations of these norms would result in the shop getting sealed and FIR will be registered against the owner by NDMC. Entry to the market would only be from gate numbers 1,3 and 5 and the exit would be from gate numbers 2, 2A and 4. All the shopkeepers will have to ensure 100% vaccination of their staff and helpers in a vaccination camp set up within the market. The minutes of the meeting mention that it was assured by the representatives of all market associations that they take full responsibility for ensuring Covid appropriate behaviour and in implementing the direction of Delhi Disaster Management Authority orders in letter & spirit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-orders-sarojini-nagar-market-to-operate-on-odd-even-basis-on-december-25-26/articleshow/88481778.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad after Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan chaired a meeting of PTI’s senior leaders, information minister Fawad Chaudhry said that Khan has expressed serious dissatisfaction over the party’s performance in KP’s local bodies polls. “Since party tickets were distributed on the basis of nepotism as against the principles of fairness and merit, PM Khan is very upset. PTI does not believe in dynastic politics,” said Chaudhry, adding that in the light of the situation, the party has decided to dissolve its organisational structure across Pakistan. The meeting, the minister said, has decided to form a new constitutional committee to devise a strategy for the second phase of the polls in KP. Khan’s party has been in power in KP for over eight years. In 2018 general elections, the PTI had won more than two-third of seats to national and provincial assemblies. PTI’s former government in KP had played a crucial role in Khan’s dramatic rise to power. The entire provincial government machinery was used for agitation against the government of former PM Nawaz Sharif. Khan had fully used the first chance given to his party to rule a province in 2013 for his campaign against Nawaz Sharif and former president Asif Ali Zardari. PTI’s defeat in KP’s recent election, however, came at the hands of the right-wing Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), Imran and his party’s biggest political rival. The second phase of polls in the province will be held next month in Hazara and Malakand divisions, the former strongholds of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which was ruled out by PTI in 2018 elections. The defeat in KP has alarmed Khan about the situation in Sharif’s stronghold of Punjab, where local bodies election will be held in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/imran-dissolves-ptis-organisational-set-up-after-shock-defeat-in-kp/articleshow/88481880.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

A departmental inquiry has been initiated against Patil based on the non-cognizable offence (NC) under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code that has been filed against him with Vakola police station where he was in charge of the anti-terror cell (ATC). The hotel staff said they would have even served food to Patil if he had been polite, instead he barged inside illegally through the back door from the kitchen side and created ruckus. Patil’s act was captured in the closed-circuit television (CCTV) when he assaulted cashier Ramdas Patil (41) when he was allegedly denied free food and alcohol. An assistant commissioner of police (ACP) rank officer is going to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP S Chaitanya confirmed TOI Patil has been suspended from the force. “A departmental inquiry has been initiated against him based on the NC that was filed against him,” he said. Patil, whose duty was to keep a check on anti-social elements in the locality and gather information of visitors in hotels and lodges, was in plaint clothes when he committed the offence. The incident occurred at around 12.30 pm when Patil furiously walked to the hotel, which is located a few metres away from Vakola police station when the hotel staff informed him over the phone that the kitchen had been closed. “I have started the hotel business at the age of 24 and this was the first time in my 24 years’ experience such an incident has occurred in my hotel premise. The cop is known to me and it is surprising why he had committed such an act. My hotel staff would have given me food if I had been polite. Instead, he created ruckus, assaulted my staff, and even kicked the cash box,” hotel owner Mahesh Shetty told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-officer-suspended-for-assaulting-hotel-cashier-over-free-food-and-alcohol-denial/articleshow/88481939.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||India||Punjab farm groups likely to announce a political front today||BATHINDA: Nearly two dozen Punjab farm groups are expected to form a political front, or even a party, on Saturday and join electoral politics. According to reliable sources, the new political entity is likely to carry the word “Sanyukt” in its name just as the Haryana-based BKU, led by Gurnam Singh Charuni, named its political wing the Sanyukt Sangharsh Party. Farm leaders ready to participate directly in electoral politics have been asked to be in Chandigarh, where an announcement is expected to be made, on Saturday. Anywhere between 20 and 25 farm groups are expected to be part of this political entity. Senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal is likely to be entrusted with leading the campaign. Sources said at a later stage this political front may ally with AAP. Farmer leaders Ruldu Singh Mansa and Sukhdarshan Natt confirmed that farm leaders interested in electoral politics had been asked to reach Chandigarh on Saturday. They said nothing could be said for sure but nearly two dozen farmer groups are expected to participate. They added that the name of the entity might include the word “Sanyukt”. A number of farm groups has been keen on participating in the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab by forming an outfit. Most of them were not in favour of a tie-up with traditional parties such as Shiromani Akali Dal, Congress and BJP. A large number of people and many organisations, including a front comprising former IAS, IPS, Army, and provincial services officers, have been urging farm groups to join active politics. However, BKU (Krantikari) leader Surjit Singh Phool and seven other groups from among 32 farm unions are opposed to the political ambitions of the other Punjab farm leaders. “We have declined to be part of electoral politics and have made it clear that any front or party expected to be formed must not use the name of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha for electoral gain. If it is done, it will be a violation of the SKM’s rules and we will take note of it,” Phool said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-farm-groups-likely-to-announce-a-political-front-today/articleshow/88482086.cms||Neel Kamal

The Centre also cautioned against lowering of guard and said the world is witnessing the fourth surge and and the overall positivity is 6.1% globally.  "India has seen two surges so far, one in September 2020 and another in May 2021. Presently, the cases are on decline, so are the daily new deaths," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.  "For last four weeks, India has been reporting less than 10,000 cases every 24 hours and if we look at the average new cases for the last two weeks, it has been less than 7,000. The numbers are low. However, as I have submitted earlier we must keep our guard on and be vigilant," he added, underlining the need for following Covid-appropriate behaviour, including proper use of mask, hand hygiene and physical distancing measures.  The government also emphasised on the need for effective containment at the district level and imposition of local restrictions by states wherever required, particularly during the festive season and in the wake of increasing Omicron cases.  Bhushan pointed out that certain states reporting high positivity rate are not doing adequate RT-PCR tests.  "Ideally, RT-PCR should be in the region of 60-70% of the total tests that are being conducted. However, there are certain states where this percentage is significantly lower," Bhushan said.  In last two weeks, a total of 97,882 new Covid-19 cases were recorded from across the country. Of this Kerala alone recorded 45,225 cases followed by Maharashtra with 11,668 cases. Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Karnataka were among the other states reporting large numbers of cases.  However, in terms of weekly positivity, 20 districts, mostly from Kerala (9) and Mizoram (8), recorded positivity between 5-10%. Two districts in Mizoram also recorded positivity above 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-concerned-over-high-positivity-rate-in-kerala-mizoram/articleshow/88482116.cms||Sushmi Dey

In March this year, the Delhi government announced that the legal drinking age in Delhi will be reduced from 25 to 21 years. Following the footsteps of Delhi, Haryana, too, has taken a step that will not just help restaurants and bars across NCR boost business but is a relief for partygoers as well. On passing the amendment to lower the legal drinking age in Haryana, the government reportedly said that the age may be brought down “as many of the other states have prescribed lower age limits.” The spokesperson was also quoted as saying, “The socio-economic of the day have changed drastically from the time when the above provisions were incorporated in the Excise Act. The people now are more educated and also take rational decisions when it comes to responsible drinking.” ‘It’s a progressive step and need of the hour’Citing the development as a progressive move, restaurateurs say that a uniform drinking age across NCR is something that they have been waiting for too long now. Commenting on the same, restaurateur Rahul Singh, who has outlets across NCR, says, “Reducing the legal drinking age to international norms for the capital of the country is imperative. The legal drinking age in neighbouring states of UP (at 21) and Rajasthan (at 18) has made Haryana realise the importance of responsible drinking and reducing illegal consumption. While the Delhi government has already made the provision to bring down the age to 21, a petition in the High Court has hindered it from being notified.” Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra adds, “It’s a good development and in tune with many parts of the country and the rest of the world. If one can vote at 18 and get married at 21 then consuming beer should be allowed at 21. It will also prevent illicit consumption by the youth. A uniform drinking age for NCR will stop people from having to cross state borders just to have a drink.” Sahil Sambhi, who has multiple restaurants in Gurgaon, adds, “It’s a very progressive and welcome move by the Haryana administration and makes absolute logical sense. Age criteria was a big challenge for restaurants and bars. It is the younger crowd that we can target now, and they are the regular ones who step out to party.” Read AlsoHaryana lowers legal drinking age from 25 to 21CHANDIGARH: Haryana on Wednesday reduced the minimum age for liquor consumption, its purchase or sale from 25 years to 21 years by making an amendment to its excise law. The Haryana Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed by the assembly with changes in Sections 27, 29, 30 and 62 of the Haryana‘Hoping that the change is implemented soon, both in Delhi and Gurgaon’Many youngsters often drive down from Delhi and Gurgaon to Noida to get a drink, especially on weekends and other occasions. “Whenever it was about celebrating with friends, we would always choose a restaurant or a bar in Noida, even though my friends and I are in Delhi and Gurgaon. All of us are around 22-24 years old, and still, we would be breaking the law if we were to drink in Delhi or Gurgaon! So, it was better to drive down to Noida, but commuting for almost two hours is a big hassle, and as adults, it is very annoying that you have to drive so much to get beer,” says 24-year-old Sugandha Bhatia, an HR professional from Gurgaon. Some say that though the announcement (of the change in the legal drinking age in Delhi and now Haryana) is a positive step, its implementation is awaited. “In Delhi, it was announced a few months ago and still on the ground, nothing has changed. Let’s just hope that now that Haryana has announced it, the implementation doesn’t take long. If not Delhi, at least we will have an option to go to Gurgaon to get a drink,” says Pratibha Mishra, a 21-year-old student from Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/legal-drinking-age-in-haryana-to-be-lowered-from-25-to-21-partygoers-and-restaurateurs-welcome-the-step/articleshow/88479048.cms||Divya Kaushik

---||Delhi||No party in NCR: After Uttar Pradesh, it’s night curfew in Haryana||NEW DELHI: There were ominous signs of a fresh wave of Covid cases in the capital and its neighbourhood as both Delhi and Gurgaon on Friday reported their highest single-day increase in infections in six months. The spike came on a day restrictions on movement returned in the NCR. Both Haryana and UP governments ordered a night curfew (11pm-5am) effective Saturday, close on the heels of Christmas and New Year gatherings being banned in Delhi. UP lifted its last night curfew on October 20 when it was 11pm-6am and there have been no restrictions since. Haryana has not had a night curfew since August 9. The renewed restrictions mean there will no be no late-night Christmas and New Year parties across Delhi-NCR this time, abruptly cutting short the yearend bonanza for the hospitality industry that has been on the upswing since the festive season this year after being battered by the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Delhi on Friday recorded 180 new Covid cases, the most in a day since June 16. In Gurgaon, daily new infections touched 48, the highest since June 6. Three new cases of Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant were also confirmed in Delhi, taking the tally in the capital to 67. After Maharashtra, Delhi has now recorded most cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is suspected to be driving the spike in viral infections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-party-in-ncr-after-uttar-pradesh-its-night-curfew-in-haryana/articleshow/88482177.cms||---
---||India||Stop passing the buck when you see files, cabinet secretary tells officers||NEW DELHI: For years, government officials have taken refuge in phrases such as “may also see” or “may kindly see” on files that move from one desk to another just because no one wants to take a call on the matter mentioned in them — a case of passing hot potatoes around in circles. The “syndrome” has caught the attention and drawn criticism from the country’s top bureaucrat at a time when the government is seeking to speed up decision-making and reduce red tape, with cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba urging senior officers to consciously avoid taking recourse to such phraseology and encourage other colleagues not to succumb to risk-averse behaviour. Seeking a change in the way the government works, the cabinet secretary said at a workshop on ‘Increasing Efficiency in Decision Making’ that unless government departments change their culture and take timely decisions, even big-ticket announcements made by the government will not take off. “Several levels don’t make any value addition; they don’t make any significant contribution to decision-making and also these don’t mean qualitatively better scrutiny. What they certainly mean is more time consumed and diffused responsibility so that they can say that so many other people also looked at that issue and so there is abdication of responsibility,” he said, referring to file submissions at multiple levels while speaking at the event which was part of the Good Governance Week. Gauba’s comments came after coal secretary Anil Kumar Jain flagged how many officers were simply putting their signatures on files without adding any value. Road transport secretary Giridhar Aramane also cited how there was huge delay in issuing toll fee notification for highway stretches as the files had to pass through several layers of officials, which has now been drastically reduced. The cabinet secretary said that in the government system, there is a culture of marking papers to the higher-ups even when the decisions can be taken at the junior level. “We are familiar with the syndrome of ‘may also see’ or ‘may kindly see’ so that you feel safe that it has been seen by somebody else or somebody above. I think this has to do with risk avoidance. The DoPT and DAPRG (administrative reform and grievances redressal department) should look at the root cause of why this syndrome has developed and what needs to be done,” he said. Referring to presentations made by different secretaries highlighting how the current practice of processing files through different levels only makes things worse, Gauba said that in such cases there are more people who can stop decisions by deciding to have a discussion or raise questions. The government has pushed the reforms to reduce the levels for file submission up to four against the earlier practice of such submission at 7-8 levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/stop-passing-the-buck-when-you-see-files-cabinet-secretary-tells-officers/articleshow/88482284.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Dehradun||Harish Rawat gets his way, to lead Congress’s Uttarakhand campaign||NEW DELHI: After his public rumblings of discontent, Congress on Friday said veteran Harish Rawat will lead the party campaign in poll-bound Uttarakhand, capping a fire-fighting session summoned urgently after Rawat voiced his unhappiness over non-cooperation and hurdles from the leadership’s appointees and hinted he is mulling quitting. After a meeting that involved Rahul Gandhi and senior leaders of the state, Rawat said it has been decided that he will lead the Congress campaign as the chairman of the campaign committee. He clarified that the CM will be decided by the legislature party after the polls but the pointed iteration of his pole position in the campaign and his ex-CM tab should make him a front-runner if the party wins. Importantly, the role was also spelt out by AICC state in-charge Devender Yadav, who has had an uneasy equation with the Rawat camp. However, state Congress president Ganesh Godiyal, who is close to Rawat, was less nuanced, as he told reporters that the party will fight the elections under Rawat. After the meeting, Rawat was quick to bury his recent tantrum and praise Congress. While leaders belonging to the Rawat group demanded he be declared the CM candidate, they were told by the leadership that “it is not the party tradition”. Rahul held one on one discussions with Rawat, Godiyal, Yadav, legislature party chief Pritam Singh, former state chief Kishore Upadhyay, MP Pradeep Tamta, MLA Karan Mahara. There is nothing new in Congress’s announcement about Rawat heading the campaign, as he was named the chairman of the campaign committee in July. But Rawat’s grievance was that he was not being given the primacy that the position conveys. On Friday, Rawat scored by having the leadership, through AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal, convey to the gathering that the leader was leading the campaign and all should cooperate with him. It implies that Rawat will be above other poll panels. To assert his “first among equal” status, it is learnt that Rawat is likely to hold on Sunday a meeting of all the chairmen of various election committees. Additionally, Godiyal too extracted the assurance that he will have the freedom to run the state organisation, after he lodged a complaint mirroring that of Rawat. Sources said some “course correction” in the state unit is likely to be effected in coming days, with likely changes in district presidents and appointments of new persons. The ire of Rawat and Godiyal both was directed at the AICC in-charge Yadav, who they claim is aligned with Rawat’s rivals and is micromanaging the campaign and the state unit. Importantly, the leadership did not call the four working presidents, who are seen to belong to the anti-Rawat camp, for the brainstorming. The problem, brewing for a while, flared up after Rahul Gandhi’s rally in Dehradun on December 16 when Rawat felt he was sidelined in planning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rawat-gets-his-way-to-lead-congs-uttarakhand-campaign/articleshow/88482487.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

So it has to be evidence-driven and remember India’s science is very strong,” Niti Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul said. ICMR director general Balram Bhargava said experts are studying data on hospitalisation and re-infection, and a decision will be taken based on the evaluation.

The EC is, however, not leaving anything to chance and has called health secretary Rajesh Bhushan for a meeting on December 27 to discuss the Centre’s assessment of the Covid situation in the wake of emerging Omicron cases and containment plans. At a press conference on Friday, Bhushan said district and state administrations have been issued detailed guidelines on how cases are to be monitored and actions to be taken on basis of parameters like bed occupancy and positivity rates. He said it will not be appropriate for the health ministry press conference to touch on the high court comments or the EC’s likely course of action. The health secretary’s inputs, along with a visit by the full Commission to Uttar Pradesh next week to assess all aspects of poll preparedness, is expected to help the EC take an informed decision on whether it needs to revisit its Covid guidelines for the poll campaign in the upcoming five state elections. The issue had cropped up in the Bihar elections in October, 2020. Opposition parties had objected to suggestions that rallies be curtailed, saying virtual or digital campaigning will benefit larger and better-funded parties like BJP. In the last round of state elections in March-April, rallies in the concluding phases in West Bengal were called off following concerns over rising Covid cases. During its tour of UP from December 28 to December 30, the EC will assess, in consultation with the state administration, the Covid situation in the state, including the threat of the Omicron variant, and accordingly finetune its norms for Covid-safe polling and campaigning. Meanwhile, what has intrigued officials is how a bail order by the Allahabad HC judge ended up commenting on whether the polls be deferred. Interestingly, it not only requested the EC to do so but also made a similar appeal to the Prime Minister, who has no role in deciding on scheduling of elections as Article 324 entrusts that mandate solely to the EC. Sources said the Commission intends to stick to its constitutional mandate of holding polls in a state before the life of its existing assembly expires. The term of the Goa assembly expires on March 15 and as per the EC’s constitutional mandate, it must complete polls before that date, with enough time to spare for formation of the government. Since all the five state polls will be clubbed for logistical ease, as is the convention, the polling for all will have to be completed before March 15. A senior EC functionary said the Commission has already factored in Covid concerns while preparing for the upcoming polls, having reduced the number of voters per polling station to 1,200 instead of the usual 1,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/election-commission-calls-health-secretary-for-covid-inputs/articleshow/88482617.cms||Bharti Jain

The state government will pressure the Centre to allow booster doses, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said. Besides, the state government is contemplating on making Covid-19 vaccination mandatory. “Prepare list of people who are refusing vaccination. They will be removed from the beneficiary list,” said Gehlot. “We have to make vaccination mandatory, only after that people will come forward and understand the importance of vaccination,” the chief minister said. Gehlot also felt the need for booster doses. “ If not for all, it should be given to 60+, people having comorbidities, frontline workers and healthcare workers,” said Gehlot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajasthan-mulls-making-vaccination-mandatory/articleshow/88482681.cms||---

Two were partially vaccinated, seven people were unvaccinated while 16 were ineligible to receive vaccine doses in the country’s national vaccination programme. The vaccination status of 73 is still unknown, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference. Bhushan said 121 cases had foreign travel history, while in 44 cases the infected had come in contact with foreign travellers. Information about 18 people was still not available. ICMR director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said, “The predominant strain in India continues to be Delta, including the recently identified clusters. Therefore, we need to continue with the same strategy of following Covid-appropriate behaviour and ramping up vaccination.” Infection due to Omicron variant “does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic clinical disease”. In India, about a third of all the detected cases were mildly symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic, he underlined. “Therefore, I want to emphasise that the treatment for Omicron infected symptomatic individuals remains the same. It does not change from that for Delta, Alpha or the Beta variant,” he added. The government on Friday cautioned people against lowering their guard, particularly during year-end festivities, even as it underlined that infection due to Omicron does not necessarily lead to severe symptomatic disease.

The amendments in the licences were issued on December 21 and extended to other forms of telecom permits on December 22. “The licensee shall maintain all commercial records/call detail record/exchange detail record/IP detail record with record to the communications exchanged on the network. Such records shall be archived for at least two years for scrutiny by the licensor for security reasons...,” the DoT circular said. Telecom companies may destroy the data stored thereafter if there is no direction from the DoT thereafter. The circular said the amendment is necessary in “public interest or in the interest of the security of the state or for the proper conduct of the telegraphs”. The amendment mandates telecom companies to maintain internet data records of subscribers, including login and logout details of all subscribers for services provided such as internet access, e-mail, internet telephony services like calls made from mobile applications or wifi calling for at least two years.  Earlier, the rules of the telecom department mandated the archival of call data and internet usage records for at least 1 year. The order was issued because of security reasons.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi used the context of the hate speeches to reassert that Hindutva was synonymous with spreading hatred. In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said all religions pay the price for the violence propagated by ‘Hindutvavadis’. His sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also backed action against the “hatemongers”. TMC spokesperson Saket Gokhle submitted a representation to the Election Commission on Friday asking it to order the transfer of all police officers, from SP-Haridwar to IGP-Garhwal, if speakers and organisers of the “Haridwar hate assembly” are not arrested by date of notification of assembly elections.

---||India||Opposition clueless about their role: BJP||NEW DELHI: In a sharp riposte to the allegations that no debate was allowed in Parliament during the just concluded winter session, BJP on Friday said the opposition parties are going through “Rahu Kaal” and have lost control over their actions. At a press conference, BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said the role of the opposition can be best summarised as “one step forward, two steps backward and situation awkward” as they are clueless about their role. Trivedi said the government was ready to hold discussion on all crucial issue including those about farmers but the opposition showed least respect to the House decorum and disrupted the proceedings. “In the business advisory committee meetings, the opposition parties say something else and they change their stance once they come out. It seems the opposition parties are going through Rahu Kaal,” Trivedi said. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said it is “both astonishing and saddening” that members of the opposition, especially senior members of Congress, deviated from the well-known truth of what transpired during the session. “The public of our country and even history is witness to the level of noise and indiscipline the opposition has made a kind of practice to bring to the House sittings. In fact the opposition appears to use every means to not let the House proceedings carry on. It was painful, when some members of the opposition reduced the temple of democracy to a theatre of street fight,” he said. Reacting to Joshi’s statement, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh said, “I hope the mention of my name in Pralhad Joshi's statement defending an unconstitutonal and illegal suspension of 12 MPs is not a prelude to my suspension for the forthcoming Budget session. This regime is capable of anything and most of all is simply not interested in any meaningful discussion on pressing national issues.” Trivedi was joined by Urban Development Minister Hardeep Puri as both hit out at the Opposition for House disruptions. “BJP is the largest party that may have the biggest responsibility to run Parliament but no party can say it has no responsibility,” he said. The BJP leader countered the opposition’s criticism that the government got several bills passed in the din and without any discussion, saying many legislations were passed during the Congress-led UPA government in a matter of minutes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-clueless-about-their-role-bjp/articleshow/88483130.cms||---
---||World||‘A ray of light’ in dark Omicron times: World rings in Christmas amid curbs & cancellations||NEW DELHI: World is celebrating yet another pandemic-tinged Christmas, this time all the more amid the rising cases of highly infectious Omicron variant of the Covid-19, with curbs on mass gatherings and cancellations of flights. In the Vatican’s St Peter's Basilica, a mask-less Pope Francis celebrated the Christmas eve mass before an estimated 2,000 people on Friday — far more than last year's 200 when Italy was in a full lockdown despite having less weekly cases than this year. Francis processed down the central aisle as the Sistine Chapel choir sang ``Noel'', kicking off the Vatican's Christmas holiday that commemorates the birth of Jesus in a manger in Bethlehem. In his homily, Francis urged the faithful to focus on the ``littleness'' of Jesus, and remember that he came into the world poor, without even a proper crib. ``That is where God is, in littleness,'' Francis said. ``This is the message: God does not rise up in grandeur, but lowers himself into littleness. Littleness is the path that he chose to draw near to us, to touch our hearts, to save us and to bring us back to what really matters.'' This year due to the resurgence in Covid-19 cases, prompting a new vaccine mandate for Vatican employees, attendance on Friday was limited to about 2,000 people, way less than the 20,000 seating capacity of St Peter's. The 85-year-old pope began the “Midnight Mass'' at 7.30 pm, a hold-over from last year, when the service had to end before Italy's nationwide Covid-19 curfew. No curfew, however, is in place this year, but cases this week have surged even beyond 2020 levels. For the second day in a row, Italy on Friday set a new pandemic daily record with 50,599 new cases. Another 141 people died, bringing Italy's official death toll to 136,386. Francis is believed to have received the third booster shot, as has emeritus Pope Benedict XVI. Bethlehem hoteliers disappointedIn Bethlehem, the Palestinian town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank that Christians believe is Jesus' birthplace, hoteliers have been disappointed. After a near-total lockdown last year, Israel has again closed its borders. Celebrations on Friday were subdued as just a few hundred huddled in the city's Manger Square to watch the Palestinian scouts and bagpipers parade past. This year, like last, Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve will be reserved for just a small circle of people by invitation only. For some it was “surreal". "There is a selfish part where it's like 'Oh I get to see this place so empty' but on the other hand you feel for the shops, all the money they are losing, it's really quite tragic," American student Hudson Harder told AFP. US first lady takes unexpected guest to children's hospitalAcross the Atlantic, US First Lady Jill Biden took an unexpected guest to a children's hospital in Washington: her husband Joe who is the first sitting president to accompany his spouse for the traditional Christmas book-reading. The couple chatted with patients and doctors, showing one boy a photo of "Commander", their new puppy, before settling into chairs beside a Christmas tree and reading a book inspired by the Disney movie "Frozen". The Bidens have planned to spend the Christmas at the White House, an uncommon practice for recent American presidents. The family normally rings in the New Year in the sunny US Virgin Islands but will instead go to their home in chilly Delaware, a few hours northeast of Washington. Santa not deterred from doing his roundsSanta was not deterred from doing his rounds, even as over 2,000 flights were cancelled on the Christmas eve globally. The bearded spreader of holiday cheer had reportedly been cleared for travel in Canada's airspace after showing proof of vaccination and a pre-flight negative Covid test, Ottawa's transport minister said. Santa's flight crew — including reindeer Rudolph, whose "nose shone red and bright (but) made sure he had no Covid-19 symptoms before taking off" — had also been given the all clear. Australian authorities said they were working round the clock to ensure "Operation Present Drop" goes smoothly. "Our air traffic controllers will be guiding Santa safely through Australian airspace," said aviation safety authority Airservices. "He's cleared to fly at 500 feet so he can skim the rooftops and deliver his presents quickly and quietly." The joint US-Canadian command, NORAD, on a specialised website offered the public the chance to track Father Christmas' sleigh as it flies around the globe. Celebrations amid restrictions in EuropeIn Europe, governments are re-imposing safety measures that are draining the fun from Christmas for many. The Netherlands is back in lockdown, while Spain and Italy have made wearing masks compulsory outdoors. With Britain hitting a record high number of Covid-19 infections again on Friday for a third day in a row, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested getting a vaccine booster shot as a Christmas gift for relatives. France notched up record positive cases for the second day in a row and its health authorities urged people to get booster shots just three months after initial jabs, down from the current five. On the other hand, most Australians are allowed to travel interstate over the festive break for the first time in two years, with Sydney's Catholic Archbishop Anthony Fisher saying that Christmas was "a ray of light" in dark times.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/a-ray-of-light-in-dark-omicron-times-world-rings-in-christmas-amid-curbs-cancellations/articleshow/88483025.cms||---

Data up to December 2020 shows the number of ongoing cases under the law is 3,158. The number of medical licences that have been suspended or cancelled stands at 145. These facts are highlighted as part of the observations and recommendations made by the parliamentary committee on empowerment of women in its report on the Centre’s “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao” scheme. The committee observed with concern that , “18 out of 36 States/UTs have neither got any case registered or have any convictions so far”. The 31 member committee led by BJP MP Heena Vijaykumar Gavit states that “it has every reason to believe that the delay in arriving at final decision in the pending cases has a tendency to dilute the spirit of PC&PNDT Act”. The report was tabled in the recently concluded winter session of Parliament. Among various aspects of the scheme and related efforts to deal with declining sex ratio at birth, the committee recommended that the ministry must make all out efforts to ensure that finality is reached in such pending cases within six months. The Committee has sought state/UT-wise data of the cases registered, their pendency and nature of conclusion and the conviction within six months from the presentation of this report. The committee noted that states have been directed to develop online mechanism for registrations, record maintenance under the PC&PNDT Act to ensure accountability, transparency and effective monitoring. Observing that 18 states/UTs have developed the online mechanism, the committee has recommended that all states may be directed to develop the same and get it rolling within six months. The report highlighted that 71,096, diagnostic facilities including genetic counselling centre, genetic laboratory, genetic clinic, ultrasound clinic and imaging centres are registered under the PC&PNDT Act. “However, it has been observed that several clinics and practitioners are indulging in determination and disclosure of the sex of the foetus. Hence, the committee recommend that ultrasound machines should be compulsorily registered by the importers/sellers/users clearly stating their purpose,” it is recommended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/just-617-convictions-in-25-yrs-under-pndt-act-parliament-report/articleshow/88483156.cms||Ambika Pandit

The National Company Law Tribunal has appointed a liquidator to auction the properties. The ED has already released some of these properties and is in the process of giving possession of the rest, which includes a solar power plant in Ahmednagar district, to the bank for the auction. The agency has also handed over to PNB around Rs 6 crore it had recovered earlier after auctioning cars, paintings and other expensive items owned by the Modis. Modi had allegedly defaulted Rs 6,500 crore PNB loan through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoU) and the ED had confiscated assets worth Rs 2,600 crore in a money laundering case it is investigating against him.

It has said that jurisdictional engineers have to immediately take suo motu action or act on the basis of complaints against such constructions and added that departmental probe should be initiated against officers showing lackadaisical attitude in performing their duty to check the growth of such illegal constructions in their jurisdiction. "Silence or ignorance, turning a blind eye or a deaf ear of the authorities towards the cry of certain citizens who bring to light the alleged illegal constructions will have to be forthwith addressed by the powers that be, of such corporations, municipal councils and panchayats, as all power is a trust that is bestowed upon the servants of the government or officers of the statutory bodies, which the state or the statutory bodies cannot afford to erode," Justice M Nagaprasanna has observed while imposing Rs 50,000 cost upon KS Eashwarappa, a resident of Shivamogga city, while dismissing his petition challenging the demolition notice issued by the city corporation . Quoting the Supreme Court's dictum in the Dipak Kumar Mukherjee vKolkata Municipal Corporation case that illegal and unauthorized constructions not only violate the municipal laws and the concept of planned development of a particular area, but also affect various fundamental and constitutional rights of other persons, the judge has said that it is ultimately the common man who bears the brunt, feels cheated when he finds those making illegal and unauthorised constructions are getting support, sometimes, either tacit or direct, by the wings of the state. The allegation against Eashwarappa was that he has encroached and constructed the building at Gavipura ward on a raja kaluve. Though a request for survey was made by the city corporation on February 3, 2021, the state government immediately replied saying that they (city corporation) have to undertake the same from their own resources. Despite this reply, the city corporation did not take any steps to conduct a survey or determine encroachment. The application for building licence submitted on November 13, 2020 by the petitioner was rejected only on June 30, 2021. Prior to rejection of this application, the city corporation had issued series of notices for stopping the ongoing construction, based on a complaint by one Choodamani Rao Pawar. On his part, Eashwarappa contended that since the application for building licence was not considered within 14 days, he felt that it is deemed to have been granted. After going through the records, Justice Nagaprasanna has pointed out that if the city corporation had issued notices directing to stop the construction it ought to have rejected the application for permission. The judge further noted that the officers of the city corporation have also displayed laxity in passing orders or taking timely action and the petitioner has abused the law in undertaking construction without permission, which is now completely constructed without even a building license. The Shivamogga city corporation has now been told to take to logical conclusion, the November 9, 2021 demolition notice issued against the petitioner's property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/punish-officers-allowing-illegal-buildings-hc/articleshow/88483246.cms||Vasantha Kumar

The order, which will be in force till the next hearing likely after the court's winter vacation, was passed on Wednesday by Justice Krishna S Dixit after petitioner Esthela Louies gave an undertaking through her counsel. In her petition, Esthela said she's involved in community-service activities and has been conducting prayers at her residence in Devalkanda in Kundapura taluk of the district on Fridays and Sundays for the past 11 years. She had challenged the October 26 notice issued by the station house officer of Kundapura Rural police station, claiming it violated her fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. In her undertaking to the court, the petitioner said she would ensure there would be no huge congregations to avoid the possible risk of Covid-19 spreading and no disturbance or nuisance in the neighbourhood. She also said she would not give any scope to level allegations of conversion activities. The petitioner said any violation of the conditions would result in the rescinding of the interim order, and police and other jurisdictional authorities may take appropriate action against the concerned. The petitioner has agreed that police are free to make audio or video recording of the activities of the meetings. "The above conditions are imposed to dispel the vehement submission of the additional government advocate that the area being communally sensitive, the congregation is likely to endanger peace and harmony and endanger law and order," Justice Dixit has observed in his order, directing the matter to be posted after the winter vacation. The Kundapura police, in their notice, had said she was holding meetings without licence from police and it was a violation of the law. Therefore, they had asked her to submit documents at the police station. According to Esthela, she had submitted response stating she doesn't require police permission for conducting prayers as it comes under her religious right. After the notice was issued, she said, she was not being allowed to offer prayers at her house and police have warned her that her friends and relatives would be arrested if they came to visit her for prayers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-gets-hc-nod-for-home-prayer-meets/articleshow/88483261.cms||Vasantha Kumar

Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto told reporters that a ministry drug panel authorised Merck's molnupiravir under a fast-track process and the drug will be shipped to hospitals and pharmacies beginning next week. It's one of two medications for treating Covid-19 that Japan has secured. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the country is procuring 1.6 million doses from Merck. Japan has also arranged for a shipment of 2 million doses of a COVID-19 pill made by Pfizer that hasn't yet received approval for use in the country. Until recently, Japan largely kept out coronavirus infections involving the new omicron variant by enforcing stringent border controls. The first known locally transmitted cases were reported in Osaka on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/japan-approves-merck-covid-pill-for-use-beginning-next-week/articleshow/88481394.cms||---

Bengaluru shivered at 9.7 degrees Celsius early Friday as minimum temperatures continued to dip in the city. As per the forecast for the next week, the minimum temperature in various parts of the state is likely to dip by 3-4 degrees Celsius. Normal temperatures in several districts, especially in the North Karnataka region, might drop below 10 degrees Celsius. Some parts of the state have already recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 8-10 degrees Celsius on Thursday and Friday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a warning for Bidar, Kalaburagi, Vijayapura, Belagavi and Dharwad districts and parts of Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga, Chitradurga and Uttara Kannada districts. "This is happening due to the passage of western disturbance over entire north and north-west India which are reeling under cold wave conditions. Moreover, due to the prevailing north-westerly winds, central and southern India regions also are facing cold day-like conditions for the past 3-4 days,'' said Manoj Rajan, commissioner, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre. According to hobli-level weather observational data, the maximum and minimum temperatures started dipping by 2-3 degrees Celsius starting from December 20. According to the IMD, long-range predictions for minimum temperature outlook from December 2021 to February next year indicate below-normal temperatures likely over north-interior Karnataka districts and normal temperatures over remaining districts of the state. Similarly, the extended range forecast by IMD indicates that for the next one week (till December 30), the minimum and maximum temperature anomalies are below normal by 1-3 degrees Celsius over the state. In contrast, isolated places over coastal districts are likely to have positive anomalies by up to 2 degrees Celsius. KN Girish, a weather expert, said IMD characterises a cold wave as a rapid fall in temperature within 24 hours accompanied by "a marked cooling of the air". He pointed out that a colder-than-usual winter this year can be put down to the La Nina phenomenon for the second year in a row. "It has got to do with oceans and their impact on global weather," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cold-wave-grips-ktaka-bluru-shivers-at-9-7c/articleshow/88483297.cms||Manu Aiyappa

SIT chief and deputy police commissioner Parminder Singh Bhandal said on Friday that the unidentified youth had gone inside the sacred place two times and once on December 16 and 15 respectively. The CCTV footage of December 17 showed that the accused standing in the line of devotees for almost an hour before entering the sanctum sanctorum. After taking ‘prasad’ when he came out, he returned to the queue for the sanctum sanctorum. “He did this eight times on December 18 but he did not talk to anyone,” said Bandhal. The night before, he slept on mats at Dharam Singh market near the Golden Temple, where a guest house owner and a watchman talked to him but he did not reply. “Even the granthis inside the sanctum sanctorum said that after the sacrilege, he just cried and did not say anything,” the officer added. A person who slept on dog mats, repeatedly went inside the sanctum sanctorum after waiting for nearly an hour, could be either mentally ill or had ill intentions, the DCP pointed out. “But we are still investigating and closely looking at each and every angle,” he said, adding that no one had come forward to identify the youth. When asked whether police would take action against those who beat him to death, Bhandal replied, “We can’t say anything for now. We are still waiting for the viscera report to ascertain the exact cause of death.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/golden-temple-accused-entered-sanctum-sanctorum-15-times-before-sacrilege/articleshow/88483301.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||World||Russian court fines Alphabet's Google and Meta||MOSCOW : A Moscow court on Friday said it was fining Alphabet's Google 7.2 billion roubles ($98 million) for what it said was a repeated failure to delete content Russia deems illegal, the first revenue-based fine of its kind in the country.  Moscow has increased pressure on big tech this year in a campaign that critics characterise as an attempt by the Russian authorities to exert tighter control over the internet, something they say threatens individual and corporate freedom.  Google said in an email it would study the court ruling before deciding on further steps.  Later on Friday, the court fined Meta Platforms 2 billion roubles ($27.15 million) on the same grounds. Russia's communication watchdog Roskomnadzor said that Facebook and Instagram failed to remove two thousand pieces that violate Russian laws whereas Google keeps 2,600 pieces of banned content.  Meta Platforms did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Russia has imposed small fines on foreign technology companies throughout this year, but Friday's penalties mark the first time it has exacted a percentage of companies' annual Russian turnover, greatly increasing the sum of the fine.  It did not specify the percentages, although Reuters calculations show Google's fine equates to just over 8%.  Russia has ordered companies to delete posts promoting drug abuse and dangerous pastimes, information about homemade weapons and explosives, as well as ones by groups it designates as extremist or terrorist.  Google, which has paid more than 32 million roubles in fines over content violations this year, is at odds with Moscow on a number of issues.  Russia has demanded it restore access to state-backed broadcaster RT's German-language channels.  Last week, a sanctioned Russian businessman claimed victory over Google in a court case that could see the tech giant hit with another heavy fine.  Moscow has also demanded that 13 foreign and mostly U.S. technology companies, which include Google and Meta Platforms, be officially represented on Russian soil by Jan. 1 or face possible restrictions or outright bans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/russian-court-fines-alphabets-google-and-meta/articleshow/88483321.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru cops nab 5 for cheating 2 businessmen of Rs 5.8 crore||BENGALURU: Five men were arrested by Suddaguntepalya police on Thursday for allegedly cheating two businessmen of Rs 5.8cr on the pretext of getting them loans from a financial firm on Nov 16. Probe revealed that the gang had purchased 11.5kg of gold from two jewellery firms and a used BMW car from the funds they had collected from the businessmen. One of the accused had spent Rs 10 lakh from the money he had fraudulently gained to refurbish the BMW car. tnn TOI had reported the fraud perpetrated by the gang on November 22. The accused are Syed Ibrahim alias Daniel Armstrong alias Amaran from Kerala; Vivekananda alias Vicky alias Viveka alias Vivekananda Kumar; Christopher alias Raghavan; Raghuvaran and Shivaraman alias Nagaraj, all four from Tamil Nadu. Police have seized 8.2kg of gold, the BMW worth Rs 35 lakh, a Maruti Suzuki Ertiga worth Rs 10 lakh, Rs 36.6 lakh in cash and frozen the company's bank account which had Rs 1.8 lakh balance. The Ertiga was seized as it was used to commit the crime. Police estimated that the suspects had spent Rs 45 lakh from the money they earned by cheating two businessmen. They said they are yet to recover some more gold purchased by the accused. Police said that there is one more suspect at large and efforts are on to trace and nab him. "The victims and the accused persons discussed their business deal on phone, messages and mails. They met in person in Bengaluru just a day prior to the suspects going missing on November 16 soon after the two victims transferred Rs 5.8 crore to bank accounts of the suspects," Srinath M Joshi, deputy superintendent of police (southeast) said. According to police, Girish P, 48, of Ashokanagar, and Taram, a resident of Subansiri district in Arunachal Pradesh, have filed complaints against the gang. According to the two FIRs, Girish lost Rs 2.2 crore and Taram lost Rs 3.6 crore. Police named Daniel Armstrong, Vivekananda Kumar and Ravi Raghavan as the accused based on the information provided by the victim duo. Girish has a real-estate firm in Bengaluru and he was about to take up a new project. He was looking for a loan at a lower interest. One of the miscreants called Girish and asked him to contact Armstrong, who runs a finance firm in Krishna Nagar, near BTM Layout. Vivekananda and Raghavan met him and he received an email on November 8, in which they agreed to sanction Rs 150 crore as loan. They were supposed to disburse the loan by November 16, but they didn't do so. Similarly, Taram alleged the trio had cheated him of Rs 3.6 crore. Taram wanted a loan for his project and the gang approached him over phone. The gang arranged a flight ticket for him from Arunachal Pradesh to Bengaluru on October 25. He met them in their office and they agreed to sanction him Rs 240 crore. They sent him an email on November 8. Taram met Armstrong at his office on November 14. The next day, he transferred Rs 3.6 crore as a commitment amount, expecting the money by evening. When he did not get it, he visited Armstrong's office and realised that he had been cheated. Police investigation reveals that Ibrahim opened a fake frim – ‘Ace Ventures Capital, MOU Group of Companies' -- in the first week of November. He took office furniture on rent as he set up an office on a temporary basis to lure his victims. He opened a bank account in his fake company's name. The gang diverted Rs 2.2 crore transferred by Girish to a jewellery shop and purchased 4kg of gold from its Bengaluru branch shop. They diverted Rs 3.6 crore transferred by Taram to another jewellery shop and purchased 7.2kg of gold. They paid Rs 33 lakh as GST/CST against their payment for gold purchase. The gang took all the gold to a hotel in Salem, where they divided their shares there. Two victims: According to police sources, Girish had mentioned in his complaint that one more businessman by name Panitara too had lost Rs 3.6 crore to the same gang. Police initially thought that the gang cheated three businessmen of over Rs 9.5 crore. Later, police learnt that the person Girish had named as Panitara was actually Taram. Police clarified that the gang cheated only two victims. A Hyderabad businessman who allegedly introduced the victims to the accused was found dead in mysterious circumstances on railway tracks in Yelahanka on November 24. Police had questioned him the previous day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-cops-nab-5-for-cheating-2-bizmen-of-5-8cr/articleshow/88483319.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Session ends sans Panchamasali quota debate||BENGALURU: The issue of Panchamasalis’ demand for reservation under 2A category was conspicuous by its absence in the Belagavi session. The development is being seen as an indication of the movement losing steam in the wake of the government reaching out to the community leaders. Representatives of Panchamasalis, the dominant subsect of Lingayats, are seeking to reclassify the community from 3B category, which has 5% reservation, to 2A category, which has 15%, in the other backward classes (OBC) list. Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swamy of Kudalasangama Peeta took out a 450km padayatra from Kudalasangama to Bengaluru earlier this year. The movement assumed political significance since Panchamasalis account for about 65% of Veerashaiva-Lingayats, who constitute around 14% of Karnataka’s total votes. The issue dogged three previous sessions of the legislature as legislators representing Panchamasalis like Basanagouda Patil Yatnal were vocal in pursuing the demand. Political reasons to blameObservers attribute the development to political reasons. Industries minister Murugesh Nirani spearheaded the movement before he became minister and BJP MLA Yatnal, who was antagonising then chief BS Yediyurappa, was in the forefront. Congress functionary Vijayananda Kashappanavar had also joined hands with others in leading it.  While Nirani chose to distance himself from the movement after being inducted into the cabinet, Yatnal has adopted a soft stand towards the government after Yediyurappa was replaced by Basavaraj Bommai in July. Kashappanavar became the national president of Akhila Bharatha Panchamasali Mahasabha, that led to division in the unity, and Nirani even attempted to float a separate Panchamasali peeta. “This is an example of a movement fizzling out due to the intervention of political interests. What we need is a united fight to obtain a separate religion status for the entire Lingayat community instead of splitting it by seeking 2A category reservation for Panchamasalis alone,” said GB Patil, a Panchamasali leader and general secretary of Jagathik Lingayat Mahasabha. Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami, however, clarified that the 2A category movement has not been weakened, but they are waiting since CM Bommai has sought time till March to fulfil their demand. Bommai met Panchamasali leaders in Belagavi on December 16 and told them Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission is conducting a survey and the government is awaiting its report. He also reached out to the community leaders when he unveiled the statue of Kittur Chennamma, a icon appropriated by Panchamasalis, in his home constituency in Shiggaon on December 19. “I think Panchamasalis are convinced that we are conducting a genuine survey and that may be the reason for the issue not being raised in the Belagavi legislature session,” said Karnataka State Backward Classes Commission chairman Jayaprakash Hegde. Other stakeholders want leaders to set aside politics and strive for the welfare of the entire Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/session-ends-sans-panchamasali-quota-debate/articleshow/88483328.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: 9 months on, Byappanahalli railway terminal yet to open||BENGALURU: Nine months after its completion, Sir M Visvesvaraya Terminal at Byappanahalli is yet to be opened for passengers. While the railway terminal was sanctioned in 2015-16 and was supposed to be completed in December 2018, it missed several deadlines and construction was completed only in March this year. It is the city’s third railway coaching terminal which will operate more long-distance trains. Sources said assembly elections in four states (Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal) in March-April and the second wave of Covid-19 delayed inauguration of the Rs 314-crore terminal. Back in September, railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said it would be opened after resolution of connectivity issues. In November, an 810m-long rail overbridge (ROB) at Byappanahalli, which was proposed in 2010-11 to ensure connectivity between Sir MV Terminal and Swami Vivekananda Metro station on Old Madras Road, was completed. In fact, many motorists have been using it now. BBMP has proposed another two-lane ROB along with this bridge and an elevated rotary flyover at Maruthi Sevanagar-IOC junction. Even if the work starts now, it will take at least 2-3 years to be completed. “The Prime Minister is expected to inaugurate Byappanahalli terminal and was also supposed to lay the foundation stone for the suburban rail project, but we haven’t received confirmation on the date,” a senior SWR official said. The PM’s Bengaluru visit scheduled this month was postponed on account of the model code of conduct for the legislative council elections. With Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, and Punjab going to the polls and the threat of Omicron and a third wave of Covid-19 looming, many passengers in the city are worried the terminal’s launch will be delayed further. Sir MV Terminal, spread over 4,200sqm, is expected to cater to a daily footfall of 50,000. It has seven platforms, eight stabling lines and three pit lines. Every day, 50 trains can operate from the terminal. Its facade is designed on the lines of Bengaluru airport and it also has a centralised AC system. In fact, two other revamped stations — Habibganj (Rani Kamlapati) in Madhya Pradesh and Gandhinagar in Gujarat — which offer airport-like facilities, have been inaugurated even though work on those stations was completed after Byappanahalli terminal. Abhilash S, a regular rail passenger, said: “This is a criminal waste of taxpayers’ money. The inauguration can be done virtually. This is a crucial project as it will decongest two existing terminals like KSR Bengaluru City and Yeshwantpur.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/9-months-on-3rd-rail-terminal-yet-to-open/articleshow/88483330.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: CMH staffer made to clean sewer is in ICU||BENGALURU: Daivadeenam, 53, the employee of Chinmaya Mission Hospital (CMH) who was forced to clean a manhole, has been admitted to the ICU of the same hospital after experiencing breathing difficulties, unstable blood pressure and other complications. The chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karamcharis visited the hospital on Thursday — two days after TOI reported the story — to take stock of the situation. Police, who registered a criminal case against the hospital and two of its personnel, are investigating the case. Assistant commissioner of police, Ulsoor, Kumar, said it would be inappropriate to disclose details of an ongoing probe. “...There has been progress but that can only be revealed after the entire process is complete,” he told TOI. Gopal B Hosur, chief executive officer, Chinmaya Mission Hospital, refused to comment or elaborate on the incident pending inquiry. He, however, said: “The hospital will cooperate with statutory authorities to help them arrive at just conclusions.” CMH sources said that Daivadeenam, who is still undergoing treatment, saw his health deteriorate soon after he was forced to clean the hospital sewer. M Shivanna, chairperson, Karnataka State Commission for Safai Karamcharis, said: “I’ve instructed the ACP and assistant commissioner, who is also divisional magistrate of the area, to take strict action.” Sanitation workers pay huge priceSafai karamcharis and activists TOI spoke to reiterated that while death is the ultimate price sanitation workers pay, respiratory disorders and other serious health issues are consistently resulting in their hospitalisation. “My medical bills are so high and there is no end to it. I have a debt of more than Rs 4 lakh because of this,” said Satish JR, a contracted sanitation worker with BWSSB. Workers said they mostly suffer from pneumoconiosis, silicosis, various skin and eye infections due to the dangerous and physically damaging nature of their work. “Some deaths occur while they are on the job, but most of these workers die early because of severe health complications that are caused and aggravated by this illegal practice,” said S Balan, an advocate representing contracted sanitation workers with the water board. Other activists said the average life expectancy of sanitation workers who engage in manual scavenging is estimated to be 40-50 years. BWSSB workers have been told not to clean septic tanks connected to people’s private toilets. The reason: hydro-jetting machines cannot be used inside the walls of a house because that could damage the machine. “However, people call uncontracted individuals or private businesses to clean their tanks and these workers are the ones who die in most cases,” Balan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cmh-staffer-made-to-clean-sewer-is-in-icu/articleshow/88483333.cms||Sanika Athavale

---||Bengaluru||Buyers, tenants move towards bigger houses||Bengaluru: Bigger houses and independent houses are becoming more popular. Bengaluru’s preference for 4BHKs has gone up. Mumbai and Bengaluru had the highest percentages of people looking for property priced above Rs 1 crore. And Vaastu remains a big ask among buyers and tenants.These are among the findings of a report by property portal NoBroker for 2021, a report based on data on its platform, and a survey of 21,000 of its users. The pandemic had started – in some cases accelerated – the trend towards bigger houses and independent houses among both buyers and tenants. With more of the family working/ studying from home, larger houses have become important. The desire to avoid crowds is prompting a slight reversal of the trend towards large apartment complexes.The report finds that those looking to buy 3 BHKs rose to 33% this year, compared with 29% last year. Among tenants, there are more takers for independent houses this year (27%) as compared to last year (19%). Those preferring independent floors rose to 24%, from 15% last year. Takers for co-living have dropped. Prior to the pandemic, some cities, including Bengaluru, were seeing a trend towards smaller flats, because of rising property prices.In what could be a sign of Bengaluru’s growing prosperity, the city has the maximum buyers seeking a 4BHK house (14%, compared to 10% last year). It also had, together with Mumbai, the highest percentage of buyers (22%) looking to purchase property over Rs 1 crore. Bengaluru, the report said, stands out more in this respect considering the cost of property in Mumbai is relatively high compared to other cities.Given how expensive Mumbai is, 51% in the city prefer 1BHK houses, the highest among all cities. Delhi-NCR had the maximum buyers interested in 3BHK units (56%); this is significantly higher than last year (41%). Pan-India, 63% of buyers are looking to buy a property below Rs 60 lakh, 11% between Rs 60-80 lakh, and 11% between Rs 80 lakh and Rs 1 crore. Continuing last year’s trend, there was a further increase by 4 percentage points (to 15%) in those looking to purchase property for over Rs 1 crore.Nearly three-quarters of buyers and more than 50% of tenants check the Vaastu of a house. Among buyers, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad, and Mumbai have the highest percentages checking Vaastu. Delhi-NCR has the highest number (41%) of Vaastu-agnostic buyers (41%) and tenants (60%).

---||Bengaluru||Covid leaves trail of anxiety among kids, adults||BENGALURU: Since the onslaught of Covid-19, people are struggling to adjust to an unprecedented stay-at-home lifestyle. Doctors and health specialists are reporting an increase in the number of mental health issues, especially sleeping disorders, in working adults and children. Doctors say professionals, aged between 25-55 years, were the most affected during the first wave, but of late, they are seeing children, adolescents and senior citizens suffering from insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome and so on. “Psychiatric conditions are closely related to sleep disorders,” said Dr Hirennappa Udnur, a pulmonologist and sleep specialist. “After a few months of relief from the Covid-19 scare, people have again started worrying about their health, earning capacities and lifestyle,” he added. Dr Satish Ramaiah, a psychiatrist, said he observed an abnormal pattern in psychiatric conditions affecting children since the pandemic. After reopening of schools, disturbed sleep pattern, behavioural issues and a rise in gadget addiction are being seen in children. “This is a worrying trend. Last week I admitted two 14-year-olds in the psychiatric ward. One of them had attempted suicide and the other was afflicted with psychosis. It is very unusual to see psychosis in a 14-year-old, but the times have been damaging for them,” he said. Doctors confirmed there has been an sharp rise in psychiatric cases since 2020. Dr Udnur noted that Covid-19 survivors too have had a tough time getting a good night’s rest. “Since Covid-19 affects the lungs, post-Covid patients are regulars at sleep clinics,” he added. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is also being increasingly noticed among Covid-19 survivors. Anxiety caused by anticipation of more restrictions and lockdowns and the overall fear of catching the new Omicron variant have propelled many down the path of sleeplessness. “The underlying issue is depression. That coupled with anxiety has been causing sleep disorders among adults. Insomnia is now more common than before, but there is a subset of post-Covid patients who are suffering from it due to PTSD and emotional difficulties,” said Dr Vivek Padegal, pulmonologist and sleep disorder specialist. Dr Padegal said he has referred more patients to psychiatrists in the past 1.5 years, than he did in the previous five years. However, Dr MJ Thomas, a psychiatrist, argued that there is need to make a proper distinction between reactive psychiatric illnesses and inherited psychiatric illnesses. “Many people are affected due to external changes and the pandemic is one of them. A lot of people are frightened and anxious, but we need a controlled study to confirm if the current settings are really causing people to lose their mental stability,” he pointed out. In his opinion, any viral infection like Covid-19 can precipitate psychiatric illness in a pre-disposed person and to establish if Covid-19 and mental health illnesses have a direct cause-and-effect relationship will need more time and study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covid-leaves-trail-of-anxiety-among-kids-adults/articleshow/88483338.cms||Sanika Athavale

Fifty-three vehicles, worth Rs 77 lakh, have been recovered. The accused policeman is Honnappa Duradappa Malagi alias Ravi, 28, a constable attached with Vidyaranyapura police station and working at the office of DCP (northeast) on deputation. The other arrested are Ramesh, 26, and two 17-year-olds. Police said Ravi got to know the two minors, who were working at a two-wheeler service station in Vidyaranyapura. To earn a quick buck, he allegedly hatched a plan to have them steal vehicles. He gave them shelter at his rental house in Vidyaranyapura. Ravi sought help from Ramesh, a man from Rajasthan who worked with an apparel shop in Chickpet area, to sell the stolen vehicles. Together, they disposed of at least 16 two-wheelers. The minors allegedly stole vehicles from Nandini Layout, Vijayanagar, Yeshwantpur, HMT Layout, Jalahalli Cross, Gangamma Circle, Hebbal, Jnanabharati, Peenya and other areas. They rode the vehicles to Ravi’s residence, where they replaced defective parts. Sold with fake RC books Ravi trawled through online advertising platforms to find details of two-wheelers available for sale. He wrote down their registration numbers and fixed them on the stolen vehicles. He also created fake RC books and sold the vehicles in North Karnataka districts. “We’ve learnt the gang sold vehicles at Ranebennur and Haveri...,” said Sanjeev M Patil, DCP (west). According to police, the minors allegedly stole a bike belonging to businessman Prasanna Kumar MD from outside his Rajajinagar Industrial Town residence on October 29. Magadi Road police registered a case. Patil formed a special team to investigate, identified the suspects as minors and learnt about Ravi’s role later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/constable-2-minors-among-4-arrested-for-vehicle-thefts/articleshow/88483339.cms||---

In November, Bharat Biotech had said Covaxin vials have proven stability beyond six months and could be used for up to 12 months from the time of manufacturing. The company had also issued a communication to private hospitals that new expiry dates of Covaxin doses — which were earlier slated to expire between September 2021 and June 2022 — would now be between March 2022 and September 2022. Coronavirus live updatesHowever, in its response to the Karnataka government’s queries pertaining to open-vial policy and shelf-life extension of the drug for six more months, the Union health ministry on December 23 said it isn’t possible to ensure quality implementation of open vial in the absence of vaccine vial monitor. The Centre’s reply further said, “...All vaccines, including Covid-19 vaccines, should not be utilised beyond the expiry date as mentioned on the label of each of the vaccine vials.” The recent developments have created confusion among private hospitals in Bengaluru, which have in stock nearly 5.5 lakh doses of Covaxin, which expired in November-December, going by the label attached to the vial and six-month shelf life of the vaccine. While private hospitals want to stick to the manufacturer’s recent statement, they have sought a change of label to clear the confusion, but the same hasn’t happened. Read AlsoMixed-vaccine dose trial results likely in February, says virologist KangPUNE: The effectiveness of heterologous vaccine doses against new Covid variants is likely to emerge in two months, after the trial in the Christian Medical College, Vellore, ends. Leading virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor at the Christian Medical College (CMC), said the institution wasPrivate Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association president Dr HM Prasanna told TOI the matter is between the manufacturer and the hospitals. “What the Centre tells the state government is binding on us too. Private hospitals have invested in vaccine doses and they can’t be wasted. We will go by what the manufacturer says,” he said. Responding to TOI’s query, the head of a corporate hospital chain that has nearly 4 lakh Covaxin doses said that most of the vials have been sent to Hyderabad for change of label or for exchange with fresh supplies. “The recent communication from the Centre to the state has added to the confusion. We have kept some stock with us here and are explaining the extended expiry date to vaccine-seekers. There is very little demand though... However, we have not yet heard from the company about the labelling of vaccine vials,” said the doctor, requesting anonymity. At Sparsh hospital there are nearly 12,000 doses of Covaxin, which expired in November. “Going by the previous communication of Bharat Boitech, these drugs expire by May 2022 and not November 2021. With the central government yet to take a decision on booster doses and vaccination for children, we are in a quandary. The company can take these doses and use them elsewhere,” said hospital chairman Dr Sharan Patil. Read AlsoTime for govt to act is now: Virologists on booster doseMUMBAI: To stay ahead of the Omicron threat, health experts want the government to urgently decide on booster shots, especially for the immunocompromised and elderly. While India has detected 38 Omicron cases so far, it is predicted to replace Delta as the dominant variant in the months to come.“If the same situation continues, we may have to discard vaccine doses like how farmers in the state recently dumped tomatoes. Hope some sense prevails,” Dr Patil added. Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka said the state government did not have any stock of expired Covaxin vials. “Private hospitals too shouldn’t be using expired vials and must go by the label on them. We will discuss the matter further,” she added. TOI’s queries to Bharat Biotech elicited no response till the time of going to print.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/confusion-continues-over-extension-of-covaxin-shelf-life-private-hosps-in-a-fix/articleshow/88483340.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday said the cheques will be given to families during an event on Monday at the National College Grounds, Basavanagudi, at 11am. Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Rajeev Chandrasekhar and state ministers will be present.

According to the revenue department, statewide distribution has already begun with local MLAs giving out the relief amount. “It was only Bengaluru BJP MLAs who wanted to launch the distribution drive in a big way and hence had to be accommodated,” said a revenue department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/kin-of-covid-19-victims-to-get-1l-relief-on-monday/articleshow/88483341.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Smart City work drags, no cheer for Avenue Road this festive season too||BENGALURU: Civil work on Avenue Road that commenced under Bengaluru Smart City Limited in January has missed several deadlines and traders from the shopping hub are despairing over dull returns during another festive season. The work was originally supposed to be wrapped up in June. On failing to complete it in six months, the former chief engineer for Bengaluru Smart City Limited had said it would be over in mid-August. After BSCL fell short of the August deadline too, managing director Rajendra Cholan had told TOI the work would be completed in the first week of September. Although the year is coming to an end, the work is far from completion. Sajjan Raj Mehta, a trade activist from Avenue Road, said, “It is December and another festival season is slipping away. The state of the road is miserable with debris and sewage everywhere, making it difficult for shoppers. India is a country of festivals. Every month there is at least one festival and if the civic agency takes one year to complete a project they were to complete in six months, how will traders earn their bread?” The traders were assured work would be completed in six months before monsoon sets in and hence, they would not be inconvenienced much. “Citizens, traders and activists raised the issue several times that the main reason for delay in completion of work is the lack of coordination between civic agencies. If the agencies have still not learnt to coordinate and work with one another, what will become of this city?” Mehta lamented. Traders pointed out that the state of Avenue Road has also impacted markets like Tharagupet and Mamulpete in the vicinity. Uttam M Jain, owner of a confectionery on Avenue Road said, “We have been reaching out to Cholan. Every time he assures us he will look into it and have it completed at the earliest, but we see no progress on the ground. The road has been completed but pavements are still in a mess. Shoppers find it very difficult to access shops, especially with all the sewage overflowing on to the road.” Traders are worried the work will extend for longer and afraid they might not see an increase in footfall during upcoming festivals of Sankranti, Mahashivaratri and Holi. Mehta added: “At this point there should be government intervention and contractors and officials who are in charge must be penalised for the delay and inconvenience caused to the public.” Prakash Pirgal, president of The Bangalore Wholesale Cloth Merchants Association, said, “We recently found there were some mistakes regarding drains. They are being rectified. If that is the case, we, the traders and most importantly, citizens are bearing the brunt of their errors.” ‘Work happens at night’The AEE concerned from BSCL, Chandrashekhar MR, said, “The work is mostly being carried out at night due to dense population on the street during business hours. They are giving drainage connections to the cross roads and some small rectifications regarding the same are being made. However, the work that is mostly pending is to do with the pavement and installation of lights. We are trying out best to complete it by January-end or early February.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/smart-city-work-drags-no-cheer-for-avenue-road-this-festive-season-too/articleshow/88483342.cms||---
---||Chennai||TN CM M K Stalin to inaugurate Tambaram, Avadi police commissionerates on January 1||CHENNAI: Chief minister M K Stalin will inaugurate newly created Tambaram and Avadi commisssionerates on January 1. The commissionerates are finalised after several rounds of discussions with a high-level committee comprising senior police officers including DGP C Sylendra Babu, chief secretary, home secretary, finance secretary. As per the tentatively finalised structure, each commissioner will be in the rank of additional director-general of police (ADGP). Apart from him, two joint commissioners of police (JCoPs), and five deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) will also be there. Each commissionerate will have two police districts within its jurisdiction. For instance, Tambaram commissionerate will have Pallikaranai and Tambaram police districts headed by DCPs. The armed reserve and motor transport will have a DCP, central crime branch will have a separate DCP, and the city intelligence unit will be manned by one DCP. Likewise, in Avadi commissionerate, Red Hills and Avadi will be have separate DCPs. There will also be three other DCPs for armed reserve wing and motor transport, central crime branch (CCB), and city intelligence unit. In the two commissionerates, there will be at least nine new police stations and six new sub-divisions. The Tambaram commissionerate is set up at a four-storey private building near the Sholinganallur traffic junction. Special officer-cum-commissioner of police M Ravi has identified a five-acre government land near Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Tambaram. The new building for the commissionerate will come up there soon. The Avadi commissionerate is set up at a four-storey building belonging to the state disaster rescue force opposite near Avadi bus terminus. Special officer-cum-commissioner of police Sandeep Rai Rathore has also identified another piece of government land closer to the ORR to build a permanent structure for the commissionerate. On September 13, Stalin in the state assembly announced two new commissionerates would be created. Later on October 1, the government issued a separate order notifying M Ravi as the special officer for the Tambaram commissionerate and Sandeep Rai Rathore as the special officer for the Avadi commissionerate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chief-minister-to-inaugurate-tambaram-avadi-police-commissionerates-on-jan-1/articleshow/88483343.cms||A Selvaraj

The trains will be suspended till Sunday as repairs to the British-era bridge built in 1865 across Ponnai River are likely to take more time. The disruption has come at a time when the services were fully booked for weekend travel. More than 20,000 passengers are likely to be affected because of the disruption. As people searched for alternative options, air fare touched 9,000 to 11,000 to Kochi, 8,200 to Thiruvananthapuram, 3,500 to 9,000 to Bengaluru and 3,500 to 9,500 to Coimbatore for travel today (December 25). Railways had sent out messages of cancellations and diversions to those who booked tickets online. "The recent cyclones that hit Tamil Nadu in November 2021 and the resultant floods caused havoc to the bridge. A technical expert team from Structural Engineering Research Center (SERC-CSIR) along with railway engineers inspected the bridge to find ways to repair it at the earliest", said an official release. On Friday, there was a huge rush to board trains at MGR Chennai Central. People were seen asking for guidance from a help desk staff at MGR Chennai Central. "Several people have asked for details of trains diverted and cancelled. There is no alternative to suggest because the bridge needs to be repaired for services to resume," said a railway official. As several trains got cancelled, the demand for buses to Coimbatore and Bengaluru increased on Friday. State Express Transport Corporation (SETC), which operates long-distance government buses, usually deploys eight buses to Coimbatore from Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) in Koyambedu. But on Friday, SETC had operated eight additional buses along this route as seats were filling up fast, said a senior transport department official. Besides this, two buses (reserve) were diverted to Sabarimala in addition to the 10 routine services. Private omni bus operators once again increased the ticket fares. One had to pay at least 1,500 to travel in an air-conditioned bus to Coimbatore on Friday evening. Despite government warnings, this trend continued unabated in Chennai. Many had opted to travel by cabs, particularly families. "To avoid crowds at bus stands, people were ready to pay even 10,000 for a one-way trip to Bengaluru," said Anbalagan from Chennai Taxi Drivers' Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/train-cancellations-trip-travel-plans-of-many/articleshow/88483347.cms||---

---||Chennai||TN: Multi-cornered polls likely in February to urban local bodies||CHENNAI: The stage is set for a multi-cornered contest for urban local bodies, which is likely to be held in February. The state election commission is likely to make the announcement soon after Pongal festivities and the ongoing delimitation exercise for the newly created and expanded urban local bodies. The commission is scheduled to hold a public hearing on December 27 for Kumbakonam corporation, the last of new six corporations announced by the DMK, for which the government promulgated an ordinance on Monday. The state has decided to have 48 wards in Kumbakonam. In all, the parties will contest in 21 corporations, 138 municipalities and 490 town panchayats, the election for which comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s deadline to complete them in four months. “Elections to the urban local bodies are scheduled to take place in the first week of February and the notification would be issued immediately after Pongal,” said a source. The state is expected to shortly announce the date of distribution of free Pongal gift hampers of 20 items -- including rice, jaggery and sugarcane to 2.15 crore PDS cardholders and Sri Lankan Tamils staying in rehabilitation centres. This would cost the exchequer Rs1,088 crore. Unlike the AIADMK regime, the DMK government has still not announced any cash support for Pongal given that Centre’s flood assistance is still not forthcoming. The DMK may have swept the rural local body elections in all nine newly formed district0s, but the party faces a huge challenge in the urban local bodies with the opposition accusing the government of not fulfilling its poll promises. “Anti-incumbency has already set in with the government failing in maintenance of law and order, lack of basic infrastructure and poor handling of floods. The AIADMK will take to the masses its achievements,” said former minister D Jayakumar, who has moved the Madras high court seeking a free and fair elections, while alleging that the commission failed to comply with the orders of the court during polls to rural local bodies. The contest will be fierce given that the party with majority of the wards will also get to win the mayors of corporations and chairmen of municipalities and town panchayats in indirect elections. With the BJP confirming its alliance with the AIADMK for the civic polls as well, the contest will be interesting in the western belt.  The erstwhile allies of the AIADMK, the PMK and the DMDK have announced contesting on their own, while Kamal Haasan’s MNM and Seeman’s NTK will try hard to record some minor victories. The DMK is confident of registering a massive win with its formidable alliance intact. “The performance of the chief minister is so well received all over the state. We will also attract the voters who did not vote for us in assembly polls. Our target is 100% victory and we will achieve,” said DMK MP TKS Elangovan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/multi-cornered-polls-likely-in-feb-to-urban-local-bodies/articleshow/88483349.cms||Julie Mariappan

Some of my neighbours who paid 800 as EB bill had paid only 20 as GST. When asked for an explanation, the bill collectors were unable to explain the disparit, he said. A senior Tangedco official clarified that the GST was imposed on service charges (for shifting EB metres, poles in the past) and not on current consumption charges. In some cases, GST has been levied on application fees, testing fees (after installing metres) and metre rents. This method has been in practice since 2017 and the amount has been collected retrospectively in few areas now, the official said, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/power-shocker-as-tangedco-silently-adds-gst-to-bills/articleshow/88483354.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Nelson Manickam Road subway closed till Monday||CHENNAI: Commuting via Nelson Manickam Road subway and Duraisamy subway is not just cumbersome but also dangerous due to the big potholes and water seeping from the ground. Post floods, roads and subways have not just developed potholes but also a unique problem of groundwater seeping from cracks in aquifers onto the roads. And since most of these subways are 5m below sea level, Metrowater and the corporation have been unable to arrest this water seepage. The corporation plans to close the Nelson Manickam Road subway from Friday night till Monday to repair it and will take up the Duraisamy subway next. “The water from the ground is overflowing onto the streets. This year, water overflowing from the groundwater table is a major issue. It is not just these two subways. Several resident apartments and commercial establishments that have basements and areas below the sea level also complain about this,” said a corporation official. An engineer explained that the underpass of the Nelson Manickam subway and the Duraisamy subway was patched up using concrete. “But the concrete didn’t stick as the velocity of water seeping was very high. We tried a chemical coating material but that didn’t work. Regular concrete curing time takes about 14 days. We cannot close traffic during the festive season for so long. We have now switched to micro concrete which takes just a day to cure, and we can reopen the subways within two days. We will use this in other subways and roads as well,” said an official from the Bridges department. The Chennai Corporation has patched up more than 6,000 of the 11,000 that had potholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nelson-manickam-road-subway-closed-till-monday/articleshow/88483355.cms||---

The expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala, who was denied police permission to visit the memorial, paid tributes to MGR's portrait at her T Nagar residence.  In T Nagar, Sasikala and supporters pledged to strive hard to protect the glory of MGR and his principles, the bylaws evolved by him, by remaining true loyalists and warriors “to destroy the betrayers”. AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran said he and his supporters paid floral tributes to the portrait of MGR at the party office in Royapettah due to Covid protocols.  “Panneerselvam has to apologise. He joined hands with the DMK and voted against the AIADMK government. Who is he referring to? Only they (OPS and EPS group) have to regret and return to us and say sorry, we (him and Sasikala) don’t need to,” Dhinakaran said, when asked about the recent statement of Panneerselvam in a Christmas event that “anyone who returned expressing regret should be accepted (forgiven).”  On the Marina beachfront, former minister Vaigai Chelvan administered the oath to the AIADMK cadres from a make-shift platform near the memorial. “Let us walk on the path shown by MGR and defeat the DMK. MGR founded the party to suppress the anarchy of the DMK, to destroy the corrupt practices of the DMK and he won,” the leaders said and repeated by the cadres. The members took a pledge to restore the AIADMK rule, reclaiming the state from the hands of DMK, “which came to power by making false poll promises to the people”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mgr-remembered-aiadmk-vows-to-defeat-dmk-in-polls/articleshow/88483358.cms||---

According to the police, the house owner Meganathan was an auditor and his brother a government servant. Menganathan’s wife was alone with her cousin. The two had left their house open and the main gate unlocked. Masked men entered the house when the two were watching TV. The gang tied them up at knifepoint, demanded to know the almirah keys, and escaped with valuables. Police said that the burglars might have targeted the house as it was on a deserted stretch, further adding that the women were watching the TV at a high volume. On checking the CCTV footage, cops found out that the gang came on bikes. While two of them guarded the gate, two others carried out the robbery.

---||Chennai||TN: Anna University gets nod for PG engineering counselling||CHENNAI: The higher education department has, following a Supreme Court order, allowed Anna University to conduct counselling for ME, M Tech, M Arch and M Plan. The schedule for Tamil Nadu Common Admissions 2021 (TANCA) will be out next week. “We will conduct counselling in a few days,” vice-chancellor R Velraj told TOI. As many as 3085 applications were received till October 11 and counselling was to be held from November 6 to December 2. However, following a Madras high court order quashing 10.5% special reservation for vanniyars, counselling for ME, M Tech, MBBS, BVSc and AH was postponed. Hearing a batch of appeals filed by TN, PMK and a few others, the Supreme Court declined to stay the Madras high court order and also barred the state from making further appointments or admissions under the quota. Appointments/admissions already done will hinge on the outcome of the case, it said and posted hearing to February 15. While counselling for PG engineering admissions has been allowed, there is still no clarity on when MBBS counselling for 2021-22 will start. “There is a case pending before the SC on following 10% EWS quota for All India quota seats. After the conclusion of the case, all India counselling will be conducted. TN will conduct MBBS counselling only after first round of all India counselling.” Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University vice-chancellor K N Selvakumar said they were awaiting orders to start counselling for BVSc and BTech. Higher education department sources said the second round counselling to fill up vacant seats in top engineering c colleges may not be held this year due to delay in medical counselling. After NEET results were out on November 1, more than 400 students who selected Anna University campuses did not join and the government planned a second round to fill these seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anna-univ-gets-nod-for-pg-engg-counselling/articleshow/88483364.cms||A Ragu Raman

---||Chennai||Used car cos in top gear, 3 unicorns in 2021||CHENNAI: 2021 has been good year for used car platforms with 3 startups — Droom, CarDekho and Spinny — joining the unicorn club (over $1 billion) this year. Investors are pouring money due to strong growth in the business, ranging from 2x in 3 years to 8x in 10. When Spinny raised $283 million earlier this month, it had more than doubled its valuation to $1.8 billion in just 6 months. Similarly, Cars24 saw its valuation jump 60% to $3.3 billion in just 3 months in December. CarDekho raised $250 million in October, including $200-million series-E equity and $50-million debt in its pre-IPO round, while Droom closed the first leg of its ongoing pre-IPO growth funding round of up to $200 million. According to a recent OLX Auto-Crisil study, the country’s used car sales will nearly double its tally to 7 million units in 4 years from just under 4 million units in FY21. According to estimates, the segment should end FY22 at just under 4.4 million units. “The used car market will hit 10 million vehicles by FY30 at a 14% CAGR — how many segments can promise that kind of growth?” Given that only 6-8% of this is currently digital, “much of the funds will go into digitising a larger share of the ecosystem,” said OLX Autos CEO Amit Kumar. Unicorn startups are already adding manpower and markets as they scale up tech infrastructure. Spinny founder & CEO Niraj Singh said, “We’re present in 13 cities and will expand to 25 cities in two quarters and we’ve gone from a 40-strong headcount in our tech and products team to 200. We’re investing in scale-up.” “We’re scaling up our presence in Australia, Thailand and Middle East and we will use these funds for further international expansion,” said Cars24 founder & CEO Vikram Chopra. The funding floodgates and aggression of the unicorns means that market leaders are also stepping on the gas. Mahindra First Choice Wheels, which has 50% share in the organised used car market. Its CEO Ashutosh Pandey said, “We are planning a fund-raise to increase our lead in the retail side.” Auto experts say the investment optimism in used cars is more with an eye on the future. “Investments in used cars is like FOMO — people feel they will be left out of the next bull run,” said Pandey. “What happened with mobile phones in last 10 years will happen in pre-owned cars too. The pandemic and chip shortage are tail winds for new cars but the long wait-list has prompted consumers to turn to used cars. This is a growing category globally, where the used to new ratio is 3:1 whereas in India it is 1.5:1 and growing fast,” added Vikram Chopra of Cars24. That means for investors, used cars have the potential to be the ‘next Zomato’. “Even at these numbers, unicorn valuations in auto tech will hit $7-8 billion dollars. It’s too big to let go,” added an angel investor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/used-car-cos-in-top-gear-3-unicorns-in-2021/articleshow/88483368.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The Nasdaq-listed customer relationship management software firm Freshworks said on Thursday that it has resolved the litigation filed by Zoho Corporation in March of 2020 in a federal court in California for trade secret misappropriation against the company. The short statement by the company noted that Freshworks had determined that a now-former Freshworks sales employee, ‘using his spouse’s computer without her knowledge, wrongfully accessed and used Zoho confidential information relating to sales leads.’ Freshworks said that these actions of the employee were not taken at the direction of the company, and are contrary to its policies. The company did not specify the details of the said employee. “Freshworks has taken steps to remediate any harm caused and agreed to take steps to make sure that nothing like this happens again. Freshworks and Zoho have settled the litigation, and Zoho has now dismissed the lawsuit, bringing it to an end,” the statement read. As of Friday, Freshworks stock was trading at around $27.94 up around 2.53% on Nasdaq. Zoho refused to comment on the development of settling the issue. In 2020, Zoho had filed a lawsuit against Freshworks accusing the latter of attempting to poach customers, steal and misuse confidential information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/saas-majors-freshworks-and-zoho-end-legal-battle/articleshow/88483371.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The MiG-21 crashed near Sudasiri village near the India-Pakistan border around 8.30 pm. Some eyewitnesses said the jet caught fire in the air and crashed with a major explosion, with the debris being spread over a one km area. The pilot, identified as Wing Commander Harshit Sinha, did not get a chance to eject from the plane. The IAF has ordered a court of inquiry to establish the exact reason behind the crash, said an official. Five MiG-21s have crashed this year, with three pilots being killed in them. On March 17, a highly-experienced pilot, Group Captain Ashish Gupta, posted at IAF’s ‘Top-Gun’ school Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment at Gwalior, was killed when his MiG-21 crashed soon after taking off from the Gwalior airbase. Another pilot, Squadron Leader Abhinav Choudhary (28), was killed when his MiG-21 ‘Bison’, which had taken off from the Suratgarh airbase in Rajasthan for a “routine night combat training sortie”, crashed on May 20. The old Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the first truly supersonic fighters to be inducted by the IAF in 1963, have had a high crash rate over the years. Of the 872 MiG-21s progressively inducted by IAF, over 400 have been lost in accidents since 1971-72, killing over 200 pilots and almost 50 civilians on the ground, as was earlier reported by TOI. The MiG-21s should have been retired long ago. But the huge delays in induction of new fighters, especially the indigenous Tejas light combat aircraft (LCA), has meant the IAF still operates four MiG-21 squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) after upgrading them to ‘Bison’ standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pilot-killed-as-mig-21-goes-down-3rd-death-in-5th-crash-this-year/articleshow/88483337.cms||---

Even lunches on trains have not been reinstated in long-distance trains thus far. Talking to this reporter on Tuesday, several passengers expressed their frustration and claimed that it had become increasingly difficult for them to carry their bedrolls, which include blankets, bedsheets, and pillows, along with their luggage, on train journeys throughout the winter season. “At a time when the railways has nearly resumed operation on all mail and express passenger trains, there is no reason for it to withhold blankets from passengers travelling by AC coaches,” said N K Srivastava, a resident of Patliputra Colony. P B Lall, a senior citizen and resident of Buddha Colony in Patna, expressed similar sentiments, stating that he had encountered some difficulty last week due to a lack of linen on a Howrah-bound train from Rajendra Nagar Terminal. “Additionally, the use-and-throw bedroll supply, which was being offered at a minimum price of Rs 150, was unavailable at the kiosk at the Rajendra Nagar Terminal,” he recalled. Puja and Akansha, who recently travelled by the Patna-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, suggested that the railways restart the provision of blankets and meals in AC coaches for the comfort of passengers during the winter season. “The sick and old who travel by AC coaches suffer the most, as they are not permitted to bring blankets and other winter protective gear on train journeys,” rued R K Sinha, a Gardanigabh resident. According to an IRCTC official, the railways has decided to reinstate lunch service on all mail and express trains beginning in January 2022. However, each division of the ECR will decide on linen supply for AC coaches. Meanwhile, the Bihar Daily Passengers’ Association recently sent a memorandum to ECR’s general manager (GM), Anup Sharma, and Danapur DRM, Prabhat Kumar, requesting that blankets and lunches be restored to passengers on operating trains, but to no effect. Shoaib Quraishi, the association’s secretary, claimed, “We had also submitted a charter of genuine demands to the GM, which included the extension of the Patna-Howrah Jan Shatabdi Express (12023/12024) and Patna-Kolkata Express (12359/12360) up to Danapur station because the only direct train from Danapur to Howrah was shifted to Rajendra Nagar Terminal long ago.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/many-urge-railways-to-resume-offering-blankets-on-trains/articleshow/88480688.cms||Kumod Verma

They completed preparations for holding mass prayers and other rituals on Saturday morning. The illuminations, carol singing, and Santa Claus were the highlights of the churches’ midnight celebrations. According to Father Juno Sebi, around 200 devotees attended the midnight prayers at the 117-year-old Catholic Church in Khagaul. “The New Year’s message is one of peace and prosperity for the country and people worldwide,” Father Juno told this reporter on Friday, adding that the church’s main Christmas celebration would take place in the most traditional manner on Saturday morning. Talking about the pandemic, the father said, “The church is strictly adhering to the safety protocols, including social distancing.” The 124-year-old Protestant Church in Khagaul, dubbed ‘Church of England’, was decked out for midnight celebrations. A large number of Anglo-Indians from Khagaul and other locations are expected to visit the church on Saturday morning. St Luke’s Church, which has been in existence for 191 years, and St Stephen’s Church, which has been there for 174 years, were also fully decked out for Christmas celebrations at Danapur cantonment. Army personnel commemorated the occasion by lighting and festooning these two churches. Rev Longjam Bipin Angomcha of St Luke’s Church said, “Nearly 300 devotees, mostly from Army families, will attend a special morning service on Saturday.” The Baptist Church in Khagaul and the Catholic Church in Phulwarisharif were also illuminated with lights. Reminiscing about the past, a devotee, N K Das, stated that Khagaul served as a focal point for Christmas celebrations during the pre and post-independence eras. He added, “The mass migration of Christian families took the lustre off Christmas celebrations in Khagaul.” Devotees, on the other hand, were seen thronging makeshift stalls throughout the city to purchase candles and Christmas décor on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/xmas-today-patna-soaked-in-festive-spirit-churches-hold-mass-prayers/articleshow/88480897.cms||Kumod Verma

Many of the 35,000 unvaccinated adults did not take their shots either out of fear or because of disease. The zilla panchayat, which ran the letter campaign for 45 days, collected the data from the schools and officials have zeroed in on these households to convince the unvaccinated to take their shots. The responses were collected from 1.75 lakh children in government schools in rural areas. Zilla panchayat CEO Kumar said that the letter campaign was launched through schools in the district with the support of the district administration. “We sent letters to the students through schools seeking details regarding the vaccine status of their family members and others. The children were asked to give details of those who had received the vaccine and those who hadn’t in their homes. The children were also asked to provide reasons --- why the family member or relative had not taken the vaccine. We have received the details, including the names and addresses of 35,000 eligible beneficiaries who have not taken the vaccine,” he said. The heads of all the schools collected information and submitted the details to their respective BEOs. The list has been forwarded to the public health centres (PHC) of the respective areas, he said. “According to the information provided by the children, nearly 80% of the eligible 35,000 beneficiaries did not take the vaccine because of fear or illness. The medical officers of the respective PHCs along with a team of health officers have started visiting their homes. Awareness is being created and the vaccine is being administered,” he added. Initially, there was a reluctance to vaccinate, but the situation is better now, said deputy commissioner Dr K V Rajendra. “While we have a target population of 17.15 lakh in the district, 16.01 lakh (93%) have received the first dose. We are creating awareness through religious leaders. We have set the goal of administering the first dose to at least 75,000 of those who are not yet covered in a week,” the DC said. In total, 1.15 lakh eligible beneficiaries in the district are yet to be brought under the vaccine coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/mluru-zps-school-letter-campaign-finds-35k-unvaccinated-people/articleshow/88480916.cms||---

Sinha, who has been officiating as VKSU’s VC ever since its regular VC was sent on forced leave by the chancellor in September this year, said the decision to start job-oriented courses of short duration was taken in pursuance of the demand of the local youths. “Six-month certificate and one-year diploma courses in organic farming, digital marketing, office management, graphic art, hospital management, interior decoration, translations and GIS and remote sensing will be introduced in colleges which have sufficient infrastructure for running such courses. All these useful courses will be run in self-financing mode,” he said. The VC admitted that the university has not made its mark in the academic world even after three decades of its establishment. The university which has got its administrative control over 21 post-graduate departments, 17 constituent colleges and 57 affiliated colleges besides one government college spread in the districts of Bhojpur, Rohtas, Buxar and Kaimur has so far failed to start any new branch of study. Sinha said he was striving hard to create a sound academic atmosphere in the university by plugging all the loopholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vksu-to-start-short-term-skill-development-courses/articleshow/88481076.cms||B K Mishra

Under the project named ‘Man Learning machine’, the trio have developed a dustbin with sensor, which is aimed at developing a habit among people to put the garbage in the dustbin only instead of throwing here and there. The students who are working on the project are Aditya Kumar, Anurag Kumar and Sunny Kumar. The project has been developed at Atal Tinkering lab of the Zila School. Lab in-charge Devendra Singh said, “Man Learning Machine is the project, where censor installed dustbin has been developed. If someone throws garbage outside instead of putting it in the dustbin, a sound sensor will alert the person to put the garbage in the dustbin only. In case, the person concerned ignores the message for three consecutive days, a hidden camera installed in the dustbin will take a photograph of that person and post it on social media. The photograph will be also sent to civic body authorities for necessary action.” Singh added: “An online presentation of the project was made on December 21, where mentors, educators and representatives of Niti Aayog were present. The final presentation of the project will be made on January 5. After the project is approved, it will be sent for patent. A US-based company is assisting to complete the project with the active support from mentors Pahup Pilana and Saffin Matthew and educator Garima Babbar. Out of total 300 project proposals from across the country, the US firm is assisting 50 including the Zila School project.” Earlier also, students of Zila school have developed another project titled ‘Air water generator’, aimed at ensuring cost effective availability of drinking water in dry zone like Gaya and the hilly areas. Under the project, water would be made from the moisture available in the air. This project has already been made patent and the controller general of patent has issued intellectual property certificate in the name of Zila School, Gaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/students-of-gaya-school-develop-sensored-bin-for-garbage-disposal/articleshow/88481123.cms||---

Locals have also demanded complete closure of the project. A day back, TOI reported how mixture of fly-ash and water, coming from 16km long pipes from Khaparkheda Thermal Power Station (KTPS), has become a threat to the lives of villagers residing in Nandgaon and Bakhari. The ash waste is being disposed of unscientifically in a 750-acre pond, right in the middle of agricultural fields. As per the latest complaint filed by Nagpur-based NGO Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD), the state power generation company Mahagenco has started releasing the coal ash slurry at Nandgaon pond without taking the mandatory No Objection Certificate (NOC) from locals. Highlighting other violations, the complaint letter said, “The pitching of the ash bund is not complete, which is a big threat to the villagers. Also, harmful ash is being released from 8-9 discharge points without the HDPE lining in the bund.” Nandgaon villagers have demanded complete closure and cancellation of the ash bund. “They can foresee huge environmental, health and livelihood impact that the ash pond will have in the near future. The ash water is already entering their fields and destroying crops. It has already started contaminating the groundwater,” CFSD wrote to Thackeray. The organization further demanded that Mahagenco should submit a concrete plan for 100% fly ash utilization. “They should follow the norms and avoid an environmental catastrophe like what happened at fly-ash ponds in Waregaon-Khairi and other villages,” the letter stated, adding that strict action should be taken against violations by Mahagenco. As reported by TOI, data shows that till 2018-19, the fly-ash utilization at Khaparkheda plant was hardly 14%, which, experts said, has not increased significantly. Latest research by environmental organization Manthan Adhyayan Kendra reveals that none of the ash ponds at Koradi and Khaparkheda plants have liners, which is leading to leakage. A site visit by regional officer of the Union environment ministry on January 30, 2019, also found presence of very high levels of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and other elements in these areas. Also, mandatory monitoring of ground water quality was not being done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ngo-files-complaint-villagers-demand-closure-of-ash-pond/articleshow/88481635.cms||Manka Behl
---||Visakhapatnam||GVMC prepares for handing over TIDCO housing units||Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is making preparations to distribute the nearly 4,050 housing units that have been constructed by the Andhra Pradesh Township and Infrastructure Development Corporation (APTIDCO) in the first phase. The distribution is likely to begin in the next few weeks. About 56,000 housing units were sanctioned to Vizag city under the ‘affordable housing in partnership category’ of PMAY. But nearly four years after Vizag city got these housing units, it has still remained a work-in-progress as construction works on only half of the sanctioned units have been launched. The state government recently directed officials to initiate APTIDCO housing allocation. Nearly 24,000 TIDCO housing units, measuring 300 square feet, 365 square feet and 430 square feet, are under construction in various parts of Visakhapatnam district. The 300 square feet housing units will be given to beneficiaries for just one rupee. While 22,936 houses are being constructed in the suburbs, 1,256 houses are coming up in various slums in the city. These include 5,776 units measuring 300 square feet each, 5,200 units spread in 365 square feet each, and 13,216 units that are built on 430 square feet space each. Of the 4,050 housing units being readied for the first phase of the distribution, 1,856 units measure 300 square feet each. This means that these 1,856 units will be allotted to the beneficiaries at one rupee. Banks have been roped in to extend loans to the beneficiaries of 365 and 430 square feet flats. In all, the GVMC received about 3.4 lakh applications for the housing project. After thorough scrutiny, the GVMC identified about 2.4 lakh people as the eligible beneficiaries. The remaining beneficiaries have got one-cent plots in YSR Jagananna Colonies. Finding suitable land pockets for the mega project had delayed the APTIDCO housing project in the initial days. The sand scarcity also affected the progress. Noted construction companies have bagged the tenders for construction of these housing units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gvmc-prepares-for-handing-over-tidco-housing-units/articleshow/88481223.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Investors are pouring money due to strong growth in the business, ranging from 2x in 3 years to 8x in 10. When Spinny raised $283 million earlier this month, it had more than doubled its valuation to $1.8 billion in just 6 months. Similarly, Cars24 saw its valuation jump 60% to $3.3 billion in just 3 months in December. CarDekho raised $250 million in October, including $200-million series-E equity and $50-million debt in its pre-IPO round, while Droom closed the first leg of its ongoing pre-IPO growth funding round of up to $200 million. According to a recent OLX Auto-Crisil study, the country’s used car sales will nearly double its tally to 7 million units in 4 years from just under 4 million units in FY21. According to estimates, the segment should end FY22 at just under 4.4 million units. “The used car market will hit 10 million vehicles by FY30 at a 14% CAGR — how many segments can promise that kind of growth?” Given that only 6-8% of this is currently digital, “much of the funds will go into digitising a larger share of the ecosystem,” said OLX Autos CEO Amit Kumar. Unicorn startups are already adding manpower and markets as they scale up tech infrastructure. Spinny founder & CEO Niraj Singh said, “We’re present in 13 cities and will expand to 25 cities in two quarters and we’ve gone from a 40-strong headcount in our tech and products team to 200. We’re investing in scale-up.” “We’re scaling up our presence in Australia, Thailand and Middle East and we will use these funds for further international expansion,” said Cars24 founder & CEO Vikram Chopra. The funding floodgates and aggression of the unicorns means that market leaders are also stepping on the gas. Mahindra First Choice Wheels, which has 50% share in the organised used car market. Its CEO Ashutosh Pandey said, “We are planning a fund-raise to increase our lead in the retail side.” Auto experts say the investment optimism in used cars is more with an eye on the future. “Investments in used cars is like FOMO — people feel they will be left out of the next bull run,” said Pandey. “What happened with mobile phones in last 10 years will happen in pre-owned cars too. The pandemic and chip shortage are tail winds for new cars but the long wait-list has prompted consumers to turn to used cars. This is a growing category globally, where the used to new ratio is 3:1 whereas in India it is 1.5:1 and growing fast,” added Vikram Chopra of Cars24. That means for investors, used cars have the potential to be the ‘next Zomato’. “Even at these numbers, unicorn valuations in auto tech will hit $7-8 billion dollars. It’s too big to let go,” added an angel investor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/used-car-cos-in-top-gear-3-unicorns-in-2021/articleshow/88481769.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The Nasdaq-listed customer relationship management software firm Freshworks said on Thursday that it has resolved the litigation filed by Zoho Corporation in March of 2020 in a federal court in California for trade secret misappropriation against the company. The short statement by the company noted that Freshworks had determined that a now-former Freshworks sales employee, ‘using his spouse’s computer without her knowledge, wrongfully accessed and used Zoho confidential information relating to sales leads.’ Freshworks said that these actions of the employee were not taken at the direction of the company, and are contrary to its policies. The company did not specify the details of the said employee. “Freshworks has taken steps to remediate any harm caused and agreed to take steps to make sure that nothing like this happens again. Freshworks and Zoho have settled the litigation, and Zoho has now dismissed the lawsuit, bringing it to an end,” the statement read. As of Friday, Freshworks stock was trading at around $27.94 up around 2.53% on Nasdaq. Zoho refused to comment on the development of settling the issue. In 2020, Zoho had filed a lawsuit against Freshworks accusing the latter of attempting to poach customers, steal and misuse confidential information. Zoho had contended in the suit that, founded by two former Zoho employees, Girish Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy, Freshworks secured its initial funding based on non-public financial information pertaining to Zoho, engaged in a systematic practise of poaching Zoho's employees, and also accessed Zoho’s customer information, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/saas-majors-freshworks-and-zoho-end-legal-battle/articleshow/88481664.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||Financial inclusion to aid price stability: RBI||MUMBAI: The RBI has said that deeper financial inclusion, which helps shape monetary policy, will give the central bank more headroom to focus on reducing inflation volatility. RBI deputy governor Michael Patra said on Friday that the financial inclusion, as measured by RBI’s FI-Index — has only recently crossed the halfway mark of the RBI’s goal of 100 or full financial inclusion. The index measures inclusion using 97 indicators that represent access, usage and quality of various financial services. “We have passed the halfway mark, doing best in access or the supply of the financial infrastructure, and lagging the most in usage or demand to be financially included,” said Patra. He was speaking on how financial inclusion empowers monetary policy at an IIM-Ahmedabad event. “Financial inclusion in the sense of access to the formal financial system for basic financial services at a reasonable cost is now positioned as a policy objective in more than 60 countries. Financially included economic agents appear to be able to ride out interest rate cycles pro-cyclically instead of being impacted counter-cyclically,” said Patra. According to Patra, an economy with all consumers financially included would expect to experience less output volatility due to lower consumption volatility. “In an economy with financially excluded consumers, monetary policy has to assign a greater weight to stabilise output,” said Patra. Incidentally, Patra, who is a monetary policy committee (MPC) member, in a recent paper had indicated that policymakers would have room to tolerate inflation and keep money easy as long as the output gap remains negative. Patra said that the RBI’s response to the pandemic was to reach out in the form of unconventional measures to afflicted sections of society, keeping finance flowing, and financial institutions and markets functional, especially when personal incomes were lost and the future was highly uncertain. “In the final analysis, financial inclusion fosters societal intolerance to inflation, a social preference for macroeconomic stability and a sense of the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates. This makes it possible for smaller monetary policy actions to achieve the same goals in a shorter period,” said Patra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/financial-inclusion-to-aid-price-stability-rbi/articleshow/88482210.cms||---

Four criminals were also arrested. The incident caused outrage among local traders as the loot was committed in the morning hours from a house situated hardly 100 metres away from the Begusarai Town police station. The criminals also stabbed Rajiv Mandal, son of Kapileshwar Mandal, when the former tried to raise an alarm. Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar on Friday said on getting information that criminals involved in the case were assembling at a place here on Thursday to share the cash which they got after selling the booty, a raid was conducted by a team of police and four criminals involved in the crime were arrested. “The police team recovered Rs7.52 lakh cash, 79gm gold and 1kg silver from the possession of the arrested criminals. Besides, three pistols, one country-made pistol and 20 live cartridges were also recovered,” the SP said. He added that the SUV used by the criminals in the case besides one motorcycle has also been seized by the police. Those arrested are Gopal Choudhary, Avinash Kumar, Mohd. Kalim and Ranjit Kumar. Giving further detail, the SP said that he had constituted a special investigating team headed by Begusarai sadar SDPO Amit Kumar to crack the case. “Police came across a similar crime that took place in the town area in May. Police had arrested all the criminals barring two, involved in the case. This gave us the clue that the remaining ones might have formed a new gang to commit the loot,” the SP said, adding, “Technical inputs and CCTV footage helped us to nab the gang and carry out raids on their suspected hideouts. The arrested criminals during police interrogation revealed that the looted jewellery was melted and sold to a shop in Patna, from where they got Rs18 lakh cash.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/begusarai-jewellery-loot-case-cracked-four-held/articleshow/88481107.cms||---

Light to moderate rainfall is expected to occur at most places in the state from December 27 to 30. An all-India weather bulletin issued by India Meteorological Department on Friday evening stated that isolated to scattered rainfall would occur in Bihar between December 27 and 29. The expected inclement weather has been attributed to a western disturbance. A special bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre said a western disturbance was expected to affect the weather conditions in Bihar from December 27 to 30. It further stated that cloudy skies are expected at most places during the same period and the day temperature may hover in the range of 18-20 degrees Celsius. According to the weathermen, cloud cover and rain may lead to cold day conditions followed by cold wave in the state. Cold day condition is declared at a place when minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days. Cold wave condition, on the other hand, is declared at a place when the actual minimum temperature is 10 degrees C or lower along with departure of 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C from the normal. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said the cold day condition is expected if the western disturbance influencing the weather in northwest India from December 26 directly impacts Bihar. “The cloud cover leads to drop in day temperature, which, in turn, leads to cold day condition. The departure of the cloud cover leads to sharp plunge in night temperature and cold wave conditions,” he said. Zeeshan Ansari, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre, said average minimum temperature in the state on Friday was in the range of 10-11 degrees C and maximum temperature in the range of 23-24 degrees C. Gaya was the coldest place in the state on Friday morning with a minimum temperature of 7.1 degrees C.

Sipai in the FIR said that the incident took place on Wednesday afternoon near Pritamnagar in Ellisbridge. “At around 2pm on Thursday, I stopped my scooter near Pritamnagar and was reading a message on my phone.

To avoid him, Sipai drove his scooter further away and again stopped to read the message. The man, along with two other men of around 25, came there and one of them held him, put a knife to his neck and began demanding money. “One of them asked me how much money I had. I said I had just Rs 6,000 in my account. One of the three gave a phone number and made me transfer Rs 6,000 through Google Pay,” said Sipai.

The land sizing about four acres is situated in Jinsi area, the very heart of the city, and is valued at over Rs 100 crore. As per the records, this land has allegedly been sold off for Rs 21.75 crore. The decision to sell the prime property was taken during the monthly general body meeting of APMC held on May 17, 2019. The state government, in its communication dated December 13, to Pune-based Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board, has asked its director to carry out a probe into the land sale at below market rate and submit a report. Urban development department’s additional secretary Veena More on December 14 also shot a communication to Aurangabad municipal administrator Astik Kumar Pandey, asking him to immediately carried out a probe and submit a report to the government. This has been followed by state revenue department on December 17 issuing directives to Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan to check on the alleged transaction of land, how it was done and also to file its conclusion. The probe order to the district collector cites that APMC’s term ended in July this year and was given a conditional extension till October 23, 2021, while asking the body to abstain from taking any policy or major financial decisions. The communication also cites that in violation of the existing norms, a layout has been marked even on the portions of the land that were reserved for various purposes and the plots from this layout have been illegally given out to the members, who were part of the tendering process. The letter cites a complaint filed by minister of state for revenue that despite the court issuing orders to complete the transaction of the land unless the complete amount of property is not received, the APMC completed the transaction immediately after receiving first instalment, eventually causing a loss of about Rs 50 crore. The letter also cites a series of violations in demarcation of the land and carrying out their registrations, while asking district collector to file reply at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rs-100cr-land-sold-at-rs-22cr-state-govt-orders-probe/articleshow/88480358.cms||Mohammed Akhef

One Dr Guntupalli Srinivas moved the high court arguing that not conducting government business in Telugu is against the spirit of the Constitution and participative democracy. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, Karumanchi Indraneel Babu said that more than 80 per cent of people in the state cannot understand government orders in English. He said that to bring parity, the state government enacted Official Languages Act 1966 to introduce Telugu language in a phased manner in all governmental communications and orders.  Various orders were issued in this regard but none of them have been implemented yet, he said. To bring transparency and accountability in governance, it is essential that people of the state should understand what is there in various orders. Considering the arguments of the petitioner, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice A V Sesha Sai issued notices to the state government to file an affidavit and posted the matter for further hearing after six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/use-of-telugu-hc-issues-notice-to-govt/articleshow/88481030.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Patna||Munger bridge inauguration postponed: Gadkari||PATNA/BEGUSARAI: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday announced that the work on road deck of Munger rail-cum-road bridge has been completed and it would be dedicated to the nation soon. The minister expressed happiness over the completion of the bridge over the Ganga ahead of the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Saturday. Road construction minister Nitin Nabin on Friday said January 16 has been fixed as the new date of the inauguration of the bridge. Incidentally, the bridge was supposed to be inaugurated on Saturday. Even invitation cards were printed for the inaugural event to mark the birth anniversary of former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who had laid the foundation for the project in 2002. However, Gadkari tweeted on Friday that the inauguration of the bridge was postponed due to unavoidable reasons. “The state-of-the-art bridge will be dedicated to the nation soon,” he tweeted. “The 3.8km-long bridge over the Ganga has been constructed with an expenditure of Rs 2,776 crore. The 14.5km-approach road has been constructed with an expense of Rs 696 crore. The bridge has been named Shrikrishna Setu in memory of freedom fighter and first chief minister of Bihar Shri Krishna Sinha,” Gadkari said in a video message. Meanwhile, state road construction department (RCD) minister Nabin attributed the delay in the bridge’s inauguration to inauspicious month of ‘kharmas’. “People generally consider ‘kharmas’ inauspicious for starting any important work,” the minister said, adding some portion of the approach road is also required to be given finishing touches. Nabin and Pratyaya Amrit, additional chief secretary (road construction) had visited the site in Munger district a few days ago to ensure that all construction work is completed so that the bridge could be inaugurated on Saturday. However, it kicked off a political controversy as Union minister and Begusarai MP Giriraj Singh’s name was missing from the list of dignitaries invited to grace the occasion. In fact, one end of the bridge as well as the entire stretch of the approach road falls under Begusarai district. Denying it as a major issue, the RCD minister said, “Giriraj's name was excluded only due to some confusion as the officials concerned were not aware of the fact that the bridge and the approach road also fall in Begusarai district. It had nothing to do with the postponement of the event.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/munger-bridge-inauguration-postponed-gadkari/articleshow/88481060.cms||---

The CM was speaking during an event organized by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Foundation . “Atalji was always a popular leader, whether he was in the ruling party or in the opposition,” said CM. He said his humbleness can be best defined by quoting his first swearing-in ceremony as the PM when during his speech he said, “Mere Prabhu! Mujhe itni unchai kabhi mat dena, gaero ko gale na laga sakoon (My lord, don’t bless me with a stature where I have to stop myself from embracing people).” The CM also reminded another famous quote of Atal ji, “Chhote mann se koi bada nahi hota, aur toote mann se koi khada nahi hota ) to motivate people not to give up. “Strong lines written by him makes us conclude that no one is, was and will ever be like him,” the CM added. Law minister Brajesh Pathak also paid tribute to the former PM and said “His popularity was such when people in the city got to know that Atal ji is holding some event at Kaiserbagh, no matter from whichever ideology they were they came and joined his event.” Others present on the occasion included poet Sarvesh Asthana, Urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and others||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/atalji-was-a-stalwart-who-was-popular-across-ideologies-cm/articleshow/88482688.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Now, the department has sought permission from the standing committee to scrap these vehicles, including six fire tenders, two water tankers and one foam tender. It has also urged the panel to make a provision of Rs2.99 crore for purchasing three fire tenders with 5,000 litre water capacity. Currently, the department has a fleet of 66 vehicles — 15 fire tenders, water browsers 2, water tankers 2 and water mist vehicles 2, one quick response vehicle and four firefighting bikes. Of the 27 fire tenders and tankers, two are 30 years old, while seven fire tenders including one foam tender have completed 16 and 18 years, respectively. Even as per Central Motor Vehicle Act’s scrappage policy, vehicles completing 15 years should be scrapped. According to sources, the civic administration has also given its nod to scrap these vehicles following which the department submitted the proposal to the standing committee, which is scheduled to meet on December 28. “As the civic body is facing financial crisis, it is not in a position to replace all the nine firefighting vehicles at one go,” pointed out a senior official from the department. So, it will replace the vehicles in a phase-wise manner. “In the first phase, we have decided to replace three fire tenders and the remaining six in the next two phases,” he said. Senior fire official told TOI that for a population of 50,000, the department should have one fire tender. Despite the odds, the fire department is doing a marvellous job, the officer claimed. Nagpur Metro Region Development Authority, which is a planning authority for areas up to 10km from the municipal limits, has proposed a fire station in Jamtha. As it is yet to come up, the NMC’s fire department is providing emergency services there too, besides attending to emergency calls in the entire district, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-plans-to-scrap-nine-15-year-old-fire-tenders/articleshow/88481654.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The chief minister said that around 3,500 foreigners are in Goa and we are trying to keep in touch with these foreigners, but some of them cannot be contacted as their phones have been switched off. He also said that the public health department and the tourism department will issue an advisory for the general public and hotels on Monday. “We want to say that those foreigners staying in hotels and houses should compulsorily get themselves tested for Covid after eight days and they should go to nearby primary health centre for the test. If they do not conduct tests, then hoteliers and people who have come in contact with them should insist on conducting the test,” the chief minister said. Sawant said that if any foreigner tests positive for Covid then they should go to GMC to conduct genome sequencing. He said that as the positivity rate has gone up, the public and tourists should take precautions. The CM said that people should not go to crowded places and hold restricted functions in AC halls. He said that precautions are being taken in view of tourists from high risk countries like the UK and Russia visiting the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-fresh-curbs-for-this-festive-season-says-cm/articleshow/88482043.cms||---

Vaishali sought bail by submitting that she has very young children and her presence is required at home. She also submitted that she had done what her husband, Machvaram Sudhakar, asked her to do for the management of the company, Ashi Trading, which imported consignments of talc powder from Afghanistan to Mundra port in June and September. From the containers carrying talc powder, officials of the directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) found heroin. Special prosecutor for the National Investigation Agency, Amit Nair, vehemently opposed Vaishali’s bail plea and submitted that the company had ordered consignments twice. He argued that importing and distributing drugs was an act part of a larger conspiracy to break the backbone of India and the accused acted as part of an international drug cartel. The court reserved its verdict till December 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-accused-seeks-bail/articleshow/88482218.cms||---

The directives in this regard have been issued by MSEDCL joint managing director Mangesh Gondavale. Authorities said that the MSEDCL is facing fanincial crunch since the imposition lockdown in 2020. “If the situation does not improve, the state will be compelled to hand over MSEDCL, which is the country’s largest power supply utility, to private players,” said a senior MSEDCL official. As per the official figures, MSEDCL’s pending arrears for non-payment of power bills has crossed over Rs 73, 000 crore in the state. Authorities said of the 28 lakh consumers from Marathwada, only 10 lakh have paid bills in the current pay cycle. “As only 36% consumers are paying power bills regularly, while almost 64 % are defaulting on power bills, this is making it almost impossible for the company to operate,” said the official. As per the given target, each lineman will have to make at least 20 consumers pay power bills. A list of consumers with outstanding power bills is being provided to the linemen with their addresses so that the linemen can go door-to-door and carry out the recovery drive. Authorities said if things don’t work out even after deploying linemen to collect power bills, there will be an all-out power disconnection drive. In addition to this dedicated teams are being deployed to bring a check on power thefts through various means. These teams can register offences against any residential, commercial or industrial consumer found stealing electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msedcl-linemen-to-go-door-to-door-to-recover-bills/articleshow/88480360.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Addressing an event ‘Atal Ram Sankalp, Apne Apne Ram’ at Atal Bihari Vajpayee convention centre, Vishwas said that Atal Ji took inspiration from Lord Ram and so does Mahatma Gandhi. “Atal Ji aur Ram ji mai Samajas hai,” said Vishwas who later mesmerized the audience with the compositions on the character of Ram. He also sang a song, ‘Manvata ki khuli aankh ki sabse Sunder sapney Ram’. The performance won the hearts of the jam-packed hall of the convention centre. From remembering Atal Ji through his musical magic to taking a jibe on upcoming elections and political parties, Vishwas won the hearts of the audience. Addressing Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, in a tongue-in-a-cheek manner, Vishwas said,” I know poetry does not interest you much but one chief minister had listened to my poetry in 2007 in Gujarat and now he is...(referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi).” Vishwas also spoke about the speculation about him joining the Samajwadi Party after he attended a book release function recently. “Media have been speculating about me joining the Samajwadi Party just because of my presence in a book release function held recently. But speculations lasted only for three days. Now, when today I am at a function organized by the ruling party, there will be speculation again. But since it is about the party in power, they are likely to last for a week,” he said in a lighter vein.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kumar-vishwas-pays-tribute-to-atal-in-his-inimitable-style/articleshow/88482699.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ludhiana||A subdued Christmas celebration this time too||Ludhiana: In the wake of Omicron threat and deteriorating law and order situation, the Christian community has decided to keep Christmas celebrations a low-key affair. Instead of holding night prayers on Friday, these were held in the evening and on Saturday, there will be three-hour prayer in churches. Some of the organisers have kept the event at other open places instead of the Church premises to avoid congestion. Most of the people have decided to celebrate the festival with their families and near ones at their houses. United Christian Federation president Albert Dua said, “Already there is concern over rising cases of Omicron and now a blast in district courts complex has increased tension of the public. We do not want to increase the problems of the administration. Therefore, Christmas Eve prayers took place from 7pm to 10pm instead of 10pm to 1am on Saturday. Similarly, Christmas prayers will be from 10am to 1pm on Saturday.”“We did not carry out a procession in view of Covid-19. The government should pay attention towards the security of public instead of focusing on petty politics,” he added.Shalom Fellowship Church, Issa Nagar, senior pastor Salim Khan said, “To avoid gatherings in church, we will organise the prayers at Jain Public School on Saturday from 10am to 1pm. Gathering in church is not possible due to the pandemic. People should be careful while attending prayers or going out to public places.” William Sandhu, a resident of Haibowal, said, “We started decorating the house two weeks ago. There will be a small gathering at our house on Christmas in the evening. We have invited close friends who are fully vaccinated and did not travel outside the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/a-subdued-christmas-celebration-this-time-too/articleshow/88481665.cms||---
---||Delhi||Access denied: No city for differently-abled||NEW DELHI: After the Delhi high court recently asked the Delhi government to conduct a social disability audit in six weeks on a plea filed by a girl on how she was unable to use footpaths, narrow streets and public transport, disability right activists said it was unfortunate that even after five years of the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 being passed, nothing much had changed. The activists said accessibility for persons with disabilities (PwD) should be made mandatory in the building bylaws. TimesViewIt’s a matter of shame and a subject of concern that five years have gone by since the passage of the Act, yet many footpaths and official buildings continue to be near impossible for the disabled to access. Authorities must act fast to change this sorry state of affairs.The petitioner, Jyoti Singh (28), said, “I’m unable to access public transport. The ramps in the buses equipped with hydraulic lifts do not work. Most cabs do not have space to accommodate a wheelchair. Some drivers don’t want to take a wheelchair user as they fear that their cabs will become dirty. Metros are accessible, but no purpose is served if I cannot reach the station due to lack of a proper path to move in a wheelchair.” Creating ramps and ensuring proper space on footpaths would bring a huge change for PwDs, she added. Nipun Malhotra, who moved the high court in 2016 seeking exemption for PwDs from the odd-even scheme, said they faced many challenges in Delhi, so one could imagine the plight of such people living in other parts of the country. “Some changes are visible after the enactment of the Act, but more steps need to be taken to ensure movement of PwDs without any restriction. The focus should be on building bylaws and only those projects should be passed that take care of accessibility to PwDs,” said Malhotra, the founder of Nipman Foundation, which works for the health, dignity and happiness of PwDs and the underprivileged. Malhotra added that many places didn’t have toilets for disabled persons. Places where toilets were available were either not maintained properly or used as storerooms. He suggested that like Mumbai and Bengaluru, taxis with ramps should be introduced in Delhi. Arman Ali, executive director, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, said sections 40 to 44 of the Act were clear on accessibility. “It's been five years of the Act, but not one city is disabled-friendly. It’s unfortunate that disabled persons are being treated as second-class citizens despite 75 years of independence,” he added. Ali said it was necessary to make all buildings and spaces, transport, products and services accessible. Delhi government didn’t respond to TOI’s queries on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/access-denied-no-city-for-differently-abled/articleshow/88482707.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

What is going on is a big threat to peace and communal harmony. Therefore, I demand that strict action be taken against the organisers and speakers at the event who made provocative and hate speeches and openly called for genocide of Muslims and urged the entire Hindu community to be armed,” Madani wrote. In his letter, Madani also mentioned the provocative speech made by controversial head priest of the Dasna temple in Ghaziabad, Yati Narsinghanand, who had organised the event, which was held from December 16 to 19 at Ved Niketan Dham at Bhopatwala in Haridwar. After getting a complaint regarding the alleged inflammatory speeches at the event, police had late on Thursday registered an FIR against one named and several unnamed persons under section 153-A (offence of promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/muslim-body-writes-to-amit-shah-over-dharam-sansad-hate-speech/articleshow/88480960.cms||Mohd Dilshad

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: People forced to buy costliest power, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Holding the BJP government in UP responsible for compelling the people of Uttar Pradesh to buy costliest electricity in the country, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said had the BJP government went ahead and set up the power plants proposed in Etah and other districts during the SP regime, things would have been different.  He promised to ensure cheaper and regular power supply for all sectors by the SP government after the 2022 assembly elections. The former UP CM said the people of Uttar Pradesh are unhappy with the manner in which the government has failed to deliver what it had promised and the party poll managers are aware of the resentment among the people, which is why the government has now pinned all its hopes on Income Tax department, Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) and other such agencies. “The crowds at SP public meetings have left the BJP panicky. The BJP leadership has realized that they have lost ground in UP and are now conspiring to defame the SP and using the IT department and will rope in ED and CBI to do that,” Akhilesh said. He also attacked the BJP government over the power supply scenario in the state. In a tweet in Hindi, the former chief minister said: “Had the proposed power plants in Etah and other districts been built, the people of Uttar Pradesh would not have been compelled to buy electricity at the highest rate in the country. When the SP government takes over, we reiterate our resolve to provide cheaper electricity to agriculture, households, industries and businesses sectors.” If sources are to be believed, SP is planning to announce a fixed amount of free electricity to lower and middle-level power consumers across the state apart from allowing free electricity for irrigation purposes. The two announcements are likely to figure as the high points of the SP manifesto which will be released once the Election Commission takes the final call on the schedule for UP assembly polls. On Thursday evening, Akhilesh had tweeted that he would stay away from public meetings and interactions for three days as a precautionary measure as his wife Dimple and daughter had tested positive for Covid infection on December 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhilesh-people-forced-to-buy-costliest-power/articleshow/88482717.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Last year, city churches had called-off mid-night mass due to Covid-19 restrictions. However, they organised mid-night mass this year, albeit with precautions and additional measures in the backdrop of the new Omicron variant. The mid-night mass at many churches began around 11pm. Parishioners sang songs and waited for the birth of lord Jesus. The holy communion was celebrated wherein bread and wine were consecrated and shared by the priest. “We began our all-night vigil at 3am and the service went up to 7.30am. There was a bonfire set up outside the church premises. We took out a ceremonial procession where all the worshippers congregated and prepared to celebrate the birth of lord Jesus,” said Father Lijo Joseph of St Gregorios Orthodox Cathedral in Musheerabad. In few churches, Holy Qurbana was observed which signifies ‘complete worship’ to unite with the god. “In this service, we call to memory and participate in the redemptive dispensation of lord Jesus who lived on earth. The idea is to pray for an eternal life. Even during the pandemic, we have held special prayers everyday seeking strength to fight this crisis,” said Father Thomas Oommen of St Mary’s Orthodox Church, Ramachandrapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/churches-host-mid-night-mass-with-covid-precautions/articleshow/88481687.cms||Preeti Biswas

However, slight better weather conditions on Friday led to a marginal improvement in the air quality index (AQI) within the “severe” category. According to Central Pollution Control Board, AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 415 as against 423 on Thursday and 407 a day before that. The pollution monitoring agencies predicted better ventilation over the next few days. Track the pollution level in your cityIn the meantime, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast moderate-to-light rain from Sunday. “The easterly winds will continue for another few days till December 29. After that there will be icy westerly winds, but the speed will be less. So there will be no cold wave at least till January 3 or 4,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. On Friday, the city recorded the maximum and minimum temperatures at 22.9 degrees Celsius and 6.9 degrees, as against 23.1 and 5.5 degrees a day earlier. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum are likely to hover around 23 and 8 degrees Celsius on Saturday. The national capital has been witnessing “severe” air quality since December 21 as an active western disturbance led to a drop in the wind speed and rise in humidity, leading to poor ventilation and more accumulation of the pollutants getting generated locally and from neighbouring NCR towns. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5, saw slight improvement over the day. PM2.5 dropped to 239 micrograms per cubic metres by 8pm from 284.5 units in the evening, as against the safe limit of 60. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the air quality is likely to improve from Saturday due to better ventilation of pollutants and the winds. “Increased ventilation, mixing with air-mass above boundary layer and moist condition will reduce AQI from December 25,” it stated. According to the Union earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management of Delhi, both local and external emission sources affected the city’s air quality. The local transport, industries, residential emissions and construction remained the major contributors to the city’s overall PM2.5, while in the rest of NCR, the major contributors were Ghaziabad, Noida and Bulandshahr districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/light-rain-likely-on-sunday-aqi-severe/articleshow/88482725.cms||---

According to sources, officials decided that random genome sequencing would suffice if the numbers increase, and in accordance with Union government regulations, all samples of Covid- 19 tested foreign travellers would be sent for genome testing. The state informed the Centre that the spread of Covid-19 and Omicron is currently under control in the state. A positivity rate of 0.48% is safe as of now, also only one first contact of an Omicron positive person also tested positive. The state government informed that 1,197 patients are currently undergoing treatment. A team of officials is closely monitoring the spread of the variant across the globe. “Because the severity of symptoms is very mild when compared to the Delta variant, testing and tracing will be used more effectively, and home isolation will be closely monitored,” an official said. There is some debate about whether the classification of at-risk and non-risk countries is still valid now. “Especially now that more than 30% of the countries are in a wave-like situation as a result of Covid-19 and all should be considered at risk,” a government official said. A total of 48 samples can be tested for genome sequence in a set. “Symptoms may be less severe, but everyone is at risk because the variant is spreading so quickly. We are ready to take all serious patients in Gandhi Hospital,” superintendent Dr Raja Rao said. According to experts, the World Health Organization recently estimated that the speed of the Omicron variant in close settings such as households is three times faster than the Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-spread-in-control-state/articleshow/88481689.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The KMT has started an online survey to start the special buses for women. The administration has floated an online form and the women passengers regularly commuting by KMT buses have to fill the form. Sanjay Inamdar, the public relations officer of KMT said, “We have sought the details of the routes along which the women travel frequently and the time of their travel for work or colleges. The women passengers have to submit the details through the online form by December 31. In the first week of the new year, we will start the special buses for women along the routes with maximum demand. The initiative has been taken to ensure the safety of women.” The women who mostly work in the industries, commercial establishments and vendors commute by KMT buses. Many girls and women use the buses to travel to schools and colleges. The buses are safe for women passengers, however, many times the women face inconvenience due to the rush. The vendors arriving into the city had to struggle to find a place not just for themselves but also for their belongings. A large number of women passengers arrive from rural fringes every day into the city. Inamdar said, “In the first phase, we are planning to start at least four buses along major routes for women passengers. The plan to start special buses for women was floated in the KMT budget, but the idea could not be implemented due to Covid pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/special-buses-for-women-in-kolhapur-from-next-year/articleshow/88480376.cms||---
---||Surat||Senior citizens to build cybercrime awareness||Surat: City police will rope in senior citizens for a unique experiment to create awareness about cybercrime. Retired professionals will educate citizens about the dangers of online fraud, and in turn, they can spread the message further down. Cops have started educating senior citizens about the modus operandi of cybercrime and how to prevent fraud or being duped. They are teaching elders to sensitize their own families and society members. This unique drive will be launched across the city wherein literature will be shared to create awareness among residents about online risks. Senior citizens have been trained about prevention mechanisms that they will teach the public. Assistant commissioner of police, Y A Gohil told TOI, “Most of the senior citizens are not comfortable with the latest technology. Mobile phones have become part of our lives but most of the elders use them for calling or reading messages only.” While examining details of cybercrime cases, police found that senior citizens were the most susceptible victims of loan or insurance policy frauds. In such a scenario, police launched the “No tolerance against cybercrime” campaign earlier this year and registered 235 FIRs and detected most of the cases. Recently, city police organized a seminar at Vanita Vishram campus where around 150 citizens from different senior citizen clubs of the city took part. Police presented a powerpoint presentation providing details of 35 modus operandi with real examples and tips to prevent it. Police prepared 40,000 booklets to be distributed to residents . Ashok Mistry, a member of the senior citizen core committee said, “Senior citizens are soft targets for cyber fraudsters. Police sensitized us not to share vital information like OTPs, card verification value (CVV) or personal identification number (PIN) to anyone.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/senior-citizens-to-build-cybercrime-awareness/articleshow/88481044.cms||---

The step was taken in protest about their pending issues with public sector TPAs, said officials. Dr Viren Shah, secretary of the association, said that the last meeting with TPA officials was conducted on December 21 and remained unfruitful. “Our primary contention was their demand that the hospitals agree to a 40% cut against 2016 rates. We put forth our issue that they must consider inflation while deciding rates for various procedures,” he said. The association demanded payments directly through insurers and not through TPAs. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, AHNA president, said it delays the payments and hospitals and insured patients both suffer.

There is poverty, hunger, unemployment and misery everywhere. In the midst of all these disasters, we have also witnessed corruption, exploitation, cruelty and violence. In such a situation, it appears that a person is totally abandoned by all, including God. In these circumstances the birth of Lord Jesus Christ becomes much more meaningful since he enters our broken world to make it his home,” said the Bishop. Stating that Jesus Christ’s birthday is a constant reminder that God is with people, the Bishop said, every human being is precious in the eyes of God, who loves every person unconditionally. Human beings are a masterpiece of God’s creation. The Bishop further said, “Jesus Christ dwells with us, heals us.

The court also directed the police to coordinate with the man to clear the dates which are in a decayed condition within a few days. The court passed the order while hearing the petition by S T Thilagarajan, manager of Trichy Cold Storage Private Limited, seeking a direction to the police to pay rent arrears and cleaning charges. Justice G R Swaminathan said Thuvakudi police registered a case on finding that ordinary dates were being fraudulently passed off as “Original Kimia Dates”. As 500 cartons of dates were seized, Trichy judicial magistrate VI directed the police to keep the seized items in a cold storage facility till disposal of the case, in October 2018. The police approached the petitioner for storing the dates. “Unfortunately, the case went into cold storage. Weeks and months rolled by.. A full three years elapsed. What should have been a routine business engagement turned out to be a fatal 'date' with the dates,” the judge said that the foul odour made the situation unbearable. No rent was paid and the bill kept mounting to Rs 3.54lakh as of now. “Though as per Section 170 of Indian Contract Act, 1872, the petitioner as bailee has the right of lien over the bailed goods till the charges are paid, he is in an unenviable position of being unable to exercise the said right. This is one classic instance where exercise of statutory right would further worsen the condition of the right-holder. The petitioner obviously could not have acted on his own because of the operation of the court order,” observed the judge. Section 459 of CrPC authorizes the magistrate to direct sale of seized properties that are subject to speedy and natural decay. The fake labels and wrappers seized are sufficient to establish the case against the accused. Directing the police to keep the goods in safe custody till the disposal of the case was erroneous in the extreme. The judge said it is incumbent on this court to intervene when it is known that there has been an improper disposal of a case. Taking into account the fact that the petitioner had not approached the court earlier to mitigate his losses, the judge held that the petitioner is not entitled to the full rental amount, but only a total of Rs 1.25 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-orders-relief-for-cold-storage-owner-as-dates-seized-by-cops-rot-in-3-years/articleshow/88482229.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Principal among 6 arrested for leaking BCom paper||RAJKOT: The allegations of paper leak made by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) turned out to be true, even as the varsity flatly denied it at first, with police arresting six people including principal of a college in Babra of Amreli district and three students on Thursday. They were arrested for allegedly leaking the paper of ‘principles of macro-economics-I’ of BCom semester three of Saurashtra University on Wednesday. SU officials were informed that the paper was circulated in a Whatsapp group at 9.11am while the exam started at 10am. There were 18,000 students taking this exam in various colleges affiated to SU. An FIR was lodged on Wednesday midnight after rounding up of suspects by the police. This paper was available in “Lovely Yaaro’ group 50 minutes prior to the examination time. Police first detained Vivek Vadi, the group administrator and a resident of Kalavad village of Jamnagar. Vadi told the police that a student named Elish Chovatiya, a resident of Kotda Pitha village of Babra, had uploaded this paper to the group. Chovatiya told police that Divyesh Dhaduk, a resident of Jasdan, had forwarded this paper to him. Dhaduk’s questioning led police to Paras Rajgor who had forwarded this paper received from Rahul Panchasara, a clerk in Sardar Patel Law College in Babra. According to police, the mastermind of this paper leak is Dilawar Qureshi, principal of this private college of Babra who had the custody of the paper, and who was responsible to open the seal 20 minutes before the exam as per the prescribed procedure of varsity, in front of cameras. Police arrested Qureshi, Panchasara, Bhikhu Sejaliya, peon of this college and three students - Paras Rajgor, Divyesh Dhaduk and Elish Chovatiya. Talking to reporters, Manoharsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police, said “During primary interrogation, the financial transactions between the accused are still to be established. The motive of this paper leak is not clear and how many people got this paper is also under investigation.” Qureshi was the employee of a college in Babra for the past one-and-a-half years and he was acquainted with the procedure of papers and rules. Police will also take action against the administrator and members of the Whatsapp group in which this paper was leaked. This is because it was the duty of group members to inform police or the university in the public interest. Nitin Pethani, vice-chancellor of SU said, “This exam will now be conducted on January 3 at the same centers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/principal-among-6-arrested-for-leaking-bcom-paper/articleshow/88481113.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||International patients advised to defer travel for surgeries||Ahmedabad: On Friday, Gujarat’s Omicron cases reached 43 with 13 new cases in a day. Except four, all others either had travel history or were foreign nationals. Some of the positive patients were foreign nationals who were in the city or state for medical procedures. Keeping in mind the period where a large number of international patients arrive in the city for medical procedures ranging from stenting to knee and hip replacement surgeries, the city-based hospitals have put in place some checks and balances to reduce the chances of Covid cases. Neeraj Lal, COO of Apollo Hospitals in Gujarat, said they currently have a few international patients under treatment that undergo all safety protocols. “If the patients have not already reached India and if it’s not an emergency procedure, we ask them to defer travel if possible. We also have a good number of international patients who stay in the city for follow-ups. We are following stringent protocols for them. For example, irrespective of their Covid status, the patients’ rapid PCR is carried out and is followed up after 3 days before admission,” he said. Dr Nishita Shukla, group COO of Shalby Hospitals, said that international air travel had restarted some months ago and international patients had started arriving by October. “Thus, the rise in Omicron cases is going to impact the usual flow. We ask for negative RT-PCR before admission and follow the government guidelines,” she said. Namisha Gandhi, VP of Sterling Hospital, said that the patients are asked to defer their travel plans if possible. “Those who are following up after surgery and living in the city for 1-2 months, they also undergo tests. For all surgeries, irrespective of their nationality, we conduct RT-PCR test for safety,” she said, adding that foreign travel history is added in the patient detail as a new field to fill up. “Ahmedabad is established as a medical tourism hub, and the months from November to February are marked by the arrival of international patients. But this year, the Covid-19 scenario may hamper it. The number of foreign patients will not be over 50-100 currently in the city,” said Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/international-patients-advised-to-defer-travel-for-surgeries/articleshow/88481709.cms||Parth Shastri

Purohit approached the high court for anticipatory bail and submitted that he had been fearing arrest after cops arrested 11 persons and one of the employees of his printing facility has been accused of leaking the paper. He submitted that he has been cooperating with the investigation and presented himself before the investigator for last three days, though he has not been named in the FIR lodged in Prantij. He claimed that he followed strict procedure laid down in the guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Bank's Association for maintaining security and secrecy in his printing press. The state government strongly objected Purohit’s anticipatory bail plea and submitted that he should have first approached a sessions court. After hearing the case, Justice A C Joshi said it appears that Purohit’s employee has committed the alleged offence under section 409 of IPC by leaking the papers. The servant has exceeded the duty without connivance of the owner. In that case, how far the vicarious liability is applicable to Purohit is a question of argument at the time of final hearing of the matter. The HC admitted the anticipatory bail plea, sought reply from the government by January 17 and asked the police not to take any coercive action against him till the next day of hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-relief-for-printing-press-owner/articleshow/88481724.cms||---

---||Varanasi||SpeedBreed facility in Kashi to boost breeding of new rice crop varieties||Varanasi: The newly inaugurated Speed Breed (SpeedBreed) facility at IRRI South Asia Regional Centre (ISARC), an international rice research centre in Varanasi, will accelerate the breeding of new crop varieties, which can help Indian farmers increase their incomes and be less vulnerable to climate change effects. The facility, opened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, can be used to advance 39,200 rice plants at a time for four-five generations in a year against only one-two generations under normal conditions. Estimates have shown that speed breeding can reduce the development of new varieties by two to four years.  During his speech, the PM mentioned that the new Speed Breeding facility established at IRRI will reduce the time to develop new varieties of rice. Talking to reporters on Friday, deputy director general of IRRI Dr Ajay Kohli said, “Estimates have shown that speed breeding can reduce the development of new higher-yielding, climate-smart, and nutritionally-enhanced rice varieties by two to four years, allowing us to be more responsive to challenges and deliver innovations at a faster rate”. “Besides rice, ISARC will be collaborating with other institutes to extend the speed breeding facility’s capabilities to other crops, such as wheat, maize, soybean, chickpea, peanuts, and vegetables,” he added. ISARC director Dr. Sudhanshu Singh said that SpeedBreed has been developed within a short span of two years since the establishment of ISARC in 2018. Speed breeding is an emerging strategy among plant breeders to speed up varietal development through advanced technologies and protocols. This new facility, established with support from the department of biotechnology (DBT) and the department of agriculture and farmers’ welfare (DA&FW), will accelerate the breeding of new crop varieties, which can help Indian farmers increase their incomes and be less vulnerable to climate change effects. The facility can be used to advance 39,200 rice plants for four-five 4-5 generations in a year against only 1-2 generations under normal conditions. This facility will help ISARC to develop bio-fortified, low Glycaemic Index (GI) and resilient rice varieties at a faster pace. They said that ISARC is also developing rice-based products such as cookies, biscuits, pasta, rice flakes, and a fortified ice-cream from speciality and traditional rice varieties such as Kalanamak and black rice, to help diversify rural and urban consumers' diets for better nutrition and to maximize the income of the farmers cultivating these traditional landraces. According to them, the establishment of the ISARC in Varanasi in 2018 became a very important step forward strengthening IRRI-India partnership. Within a short span of time, ISARC has truly become a state-of-the-art centre that cultivates skills and knowledge to benefit India. Aspects of grain quality, nutrition (bio-fortification), value chain development of landraces and traditional varieties, climate resilience, seed-systems, and capacity development for various stakeholders, including women and youth, are the main priorities of this centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/speedbreed-facility-in-kashi-to-boost-breeding-of-new-rice-crop-varieties/articleshow/88482233.cms||---

The British-era structure has developed cracks due to the peepal trees growing behind the building. The cracks were exposed after the NMC axed the trees two years back. The building housed the Nashik East divisional office initially, which was later shifted to the Nashik West divisional office building located at the Pandit Colony area after the building developed cracks. Following this, the Nashik Municipal Corporation had urged the archaeology department to suggest measures to repair and renovate the structure. After the inspection of the building, the archaeology department submitted a report to the civic body, cautioning them that the British-era building housing the Nashik East division office needs urgent repair. The team also suggested the civic body to install sandbags near the walls to ensure that the structure does not collapse. The NMC had also supported the building wall with sandbags. The NMC officials said that the conservation work could not be done for the past two years owing to the Covid pandemic. “We have already floated a bid and the bidding process is expected to be completed soon. The work orders are to be given by the first half of January 2022,” said the officials. Meanwhile, the Nashik Municipal Corporation has also decided to build a new office building for the East division near the Dwarka circle area in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-floats-bids-to-restore-british-era-building/articleshow/88480401.cms||Tushar Pawar

The boy from Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, was airlifted to KIMS Hospitals for ECMO therapy for severe Covid-19 infection and was on life support utilizing the efficiencies of a veno-venous ECMO for over two months. This is said to be the longest time any patient, who was put on ECMO support, has fully recovered in the country. “When the patient came to us his lungs were fully affected and stiff and was unable to supply oxygen to his body. With ECMO support his lung was rested and gradually healed itself and regained enough function to be able to support him,” said Dr Vijil, chief of transplant pulmonology, KIMS Heart & Lung Institute. He added that the hospital has one of the largest and most experienced ECMO teams in the country with dedicated doctors and support staff without which such a remarkable recovery would not have been possible. The care given to the 12-year-old involved close monitoring of other organ functions, enhanced nutrition, physical rehabilitation, and advanced lung recovery manoeuvres while on the ECMO. The doctors revealed that the challenge with small children is their delicate bodies. “This critical Covid-19 illness leads to multiple comorbidities, muscle weakness caused by medications used to treat the primary condition, repeated infections in the bloodstream, and secondary infections in their airways over and above dense non-resolving pneumonia. This by far is probably the only reported case in the country of a child who was sustained on this mode of life support for over two months and has fully recovered from his infection,” a release from the hospital read. Dr Prabhat Dutta, Chief Intensivist at the institute, said that it is really a satisfying moment to see the child, who also had myopathy caused by steroids and immunomodulating therapy for severe Covid-19, fully recovering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/12-yr-old-up-boy-recovers-after-65-days-of-ecmo-support/articleshow/88481718.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

A clarification note stated that an MP or MLA was not a party to the petition and it is not in reference to an issue which may be covered by the judgment of the Supreme Court so as to refer the matter to a special court hearing cases against MPs and MLAs. A mere reference of relation to an ex-minister would not bring it under the jurisdiction of the special court. Accordingly, the matter may be listed for hearing before the roster court at Madurai bench. Petitioner K Lakshmi stated that her sons Vasanthakumar, Ramana and driver Rajkumar were detained by the police on the night of December 17. When the case was taken up for hearing during a special sitting on December 18, the state submitted that summons were issued to the three and they were let off after obtaining statements in the afternoon. The state also submitted that the three were not accused in the case and were not arrested. Justice G R Swaminathan passed an interim order restraining the Virudhunagar district police from summoning any relative of Bhalaji who is not an accused in the cheating cases registered by the district crime branch (DCB) police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cj-clarifies-madurai-bench-can-hear-plea-of-bhalajis-sister/articleshow/88482236.cms||---
---||Kochi||KAS is official: CM Pinarayi Vijayan harps on ‘happening’ Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the opposition to development projects in the state could be overcome if its reasons are scientifically analyzed and countered. He was inaugurating the first batch of Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) officials. Vijayan said the perception that nothing would happen in the state has changed. Citing the examples of the national highway development, the Kochi-Edamon power highway and the GAIL pipeline projects, he said: "There was strong opposition against all these projects. We were able to make those who opposed these projects understand the benefits. We were able to make them understand that these projects were necessary for the future of our country and our next generations, and they in turn welcomed them. In fact, those who oppose the development projects are also the beneficiaries of such projects," he said. The government is facing stiff opposition against the proposed SilverLine high-speed rail project. Besides the UDF and the BJP, the general public has also come out against the land acquisition plans. Addressing the KAS officers, the chief minister said they should maintain a cordial relationship with the IAS officials. He said while the IAS officials should fulfill their responsibilities towards the state with a nationalistic perspective, the KAS officers should also ensure inter-departmental coordination while performing the duties of their department. The civil service should become more people-oriented since the government implements its policies through it. The KAS was formed for using the knowledge of the new generation in the state's administration. The civil service is going through a rough phase, and there are deliberate attempts to weaken it. The state government is trying to strengthen it as it sees a strong civil service as imperative.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||KAS is official: CM Pinarayi Vijayan harps on ‘happening’ Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that the opposition to development projects in the state could be overcome if its reasons are scientifically analyzed and countered. He was inaugurating the first batch of Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) officials. Vijayan said the perception that nothing would happen in the state has changed. Citing the examples of the national highway development, the Kochi-Edamon power highway and the GAIL pipeline projects, he said: "There was strong opposition against all these projects. We were able to make those who opposed these projects understand the benefits. We were able to make them understand that these projects were necessary for the future of our country and our next generations, and they in turn welcomed them. In fact, those who oppose the development projects are also the beneficiaries of such projects," he said. The government is facing stiff opposition against the proposed SilverLine high-speed rail project. Besides the UDF and the BJP, the general public has also come out against the land acquisition plans. Addressing the KAS officers, the chief minister said they should maintain a cordial relationship with the IAS officials. He said while the IAS officials should fulfill their responsibilities towards the state with a nationalistic perspective, the KAS officers should also ensure inter-departmental coordination while performing the duties of their department. The civil service should become more people-oriented since the government implements its policies through it. The KAS was formed for using the knowledge of the new generation in the state's administration. The civil service is going through a rough phase, and there are deliberate attempts to weaken it. The state government is trying to strengthen it as it sees a strong civil service as imperative. The chief minister lauded those who worked for realizing the concept of KAS and the efforts of the state public services commission. The government has launched the KAS as a feeder service to the IAS and recruited 105 members to it but the KAS salary scale has faced criticism. The entry-level salary scale has been fixed as equivalent to an all-India service officer with nine years' service and the all-India service officers have made representations to the government in this regard.

Himachal defeated Services by 77 runs in the other last-four tie at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The summit clash on Sunday. Baba Aparajith (122, 12x4, 3x6), Washington Sundar (70, 8x4) and Baba Indrajith (50, 5x4, 1x6) led the show with the willow for Tamil Nadu. But it all came down to the last ball before Tamil Nadu aced Saurashtra’s target of 311. Tamil Nadu needed 7 off the last over bowled by medium-pacer Chirag Jani. R Sai Kishore (12 n.o.) and R Silambarasan (2 n.o.) rotated the strike between themselves to bring the equation down to 2 off 2 balls. Silambarasan took a single off the next delivery and Sai Kishore was saddled with the task of seeing TN cross the finish line. The allrounder hit a boundary off the final ball to spread cheer across the TN camp. Saurashtra notched up a 300-plus total thanks to Sheldon Jackson’s well-compiled 134. Left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya’s 5 for 62 kept Saurashtra in the battle right till the end. Sakariya’s top effort with the ball ---both at the start and towards the end --- put brakes on Tamil Nadu’s scoring rate. Sakariya dismissed N Jagadeesan (0) and skipper Vijay Shankar (4) in his opening spell before accounting for the dangerous M Shahrukh Khan (17, 1x4, 1x6), a well-set Washington and M Siddharth (1) to keep his side in the game. Earlier, Aparajith was his fluent self while opening the innings. The 97-run stand between Aparajith and Indrajith for the third wicket kept Tamil Nadu’s scoreboard ticking. Aparajith played shots on both sides of the wicket and switched gears at will during his 124-ball knock. Once Indrajith departed, Aparajith added 48 and 76 with Dinesh Karthik (31, 4x4, 1x6) and Washington for the fourth and fifth wickets respectively. Aparajith departed with Tamil Nadu needing 67 in the last 46 deliveries. “It was a very satisfying hundred for me and I am pleased because it came in a winning cause.

Singh was in Dhule to inaugurate several developmental works. “Because the words and deeds of the politicians did not match, people started losing trust in them. Our government has accepted this as a challenge and decided to end this trend. For this, one thing we have maintained is that we deliver whatever we promise to the people,” he said, Singh also drew the attention of the people towards the fact that Article 370, giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was repealed after the BJP came to power. “People would question the BJP over its promise to repeal the Act. We had no power due to which we could not. The moment people handed us the power, we lived up to our promise,” Singh said. Talking about cross-border terrorism, Singh reminded that India never in its history had attacked any other country nor acquired any land forcibly anywhere. “The surgical strike has established the capability of the county that we can kill the terrorists not only on our land, but also across the border,” Singh said, adding that India wants peaceful relations with its neighbours.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cars with sunroof under cop lens, traffic guards told to act||KOLKATA: Lalbazar has asked cops of all traffic guards to start a campaign and curb risky rides with removed sunroof car covers at the earliest. With the winter party season on in full swing, cops found that some motorists and their companions often removed the sunroof covers of high-end cars and while frolicking, they often risked their lives by leaning out of the vehicles. It is through the CCTVs that cops have spotted such daring attempts by passengers of some cars on the Maa and AJC Bose Road flyovers. In at least two instances, the victims, who had resorted to such risky rides, ended up being injured by kite strings dangling on the flyovers. Cops said they are trying to promote safe driving among motorists. “In some cases, we find that the riders try to climb on the roof of the car while it is moving. We flag down the car and slap the motorist with a fine of Rs 1,000 under 184 (f) of the Motor Vehicles Act. The motorists should understand that we penalise them to make them aware that they should not resort to reckless driving or put their life at risk for their own safety,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. So far, two such motorists have been fined for open roof driving in the city in and around the Park Street-Park Circus-Maa flyover zone by the East guard. The East, Southeast and South traffic guards have been instructed to send across this message this festive season. Aware that such sunroof car rides are common during nights and festivals, the cops posted at nakas have been asked to stay on alert. “We have instructed the sergeants not to rush in to issue such challans. Rather we have decided to use live CCTV footage in case challans are issued. We will also seek help from some celebrities in this regard,” said another officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cars-with-sunroof-under-cop-lens-traffic-guards-told-to-act/articleshow/88481742.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This decision was taken for the students’ sake, said DPUE director Snehal Rayamane. She told TOI, that the lecturers and students had complained that the paper had several anomalies. “After seeking a report from Dakshina Kannada DDPU C D Jayanna, we have now finally decided to leave out questions worth 30 marks. The questions were from outside the syllabus, and some questions had grammatical mistakes. Therefore, we have decided to leave out those questions,” said Snehal, adding that the Dakshina Kannada DDPU has been officially instricted in this regard. Earlier, the DPUE had come up with two solutions: either award grace marks or reduce the examination to 85 marks, instead of 100. “After several meetings, we have now officially settled for 70 marks, that will be converted into 100,” said Snehal, adding that this will help students who would have otherwise lost marks. Students and lecturers hailed the DPUE’s decision, and added that it is taken at the right time. Lecturers added that earlier they were directed not to take up the evaluation work of the II PU English midterm examination, until a clear directive from the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pu-english-paper-reduced-to-70-marks/articleshow/88481040.cms||---

Government officials who had given clearance for the structures at the school will also face action, he added. Holding the school management responsible for the tragedy, he said that the commission will press for legal and departmental action against officials who are at fault. He inspected the spot where the wall collapsed and interacted with parents of the deceased and injured boys. “The teachers did not help the boys stuck below the debris, prevented other students from helping them and also did not provide their cars to rush the boys who were rescued by the students to the hospital,” he said quoting school boys who alleged that the teachers stood as mute spectators. Jayachandran, while interacting with the media, said that the teachers have already been placed under suspension. Though a case has not been registered against them, he has asked the police to look into the allegations and initiate action against those found guilty. Asked if action will be initiated against officials from the revenue, corporation and fire and rescue services department who gave clearance certificates for the structural safety of the school, he said that the commission has only begun its first phase of inquiry. “If the explanation in their report is not satisfactory we will summon the officials and quiz them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/teachers-who-didnt-help-boys-trapped-will-face-action-shrc/articleshow/88482283.cms||---

A representative of the fishermen who met fisheries minister Anitha R Radhakrishnan here on Friday, told reporters that they will seek the Centre’s intervention to pressure Sri Lanka to release the 68 fishermen and their 10 boats detained by its navy recently. Sri Lankan navy had detained 55 fishermen on eight boats from Rameswaram last Saturday and Sunday and 13 on two boats from Pudukottai on Monday leading to strong protests and an indefinite strike. “The Tamil Nadu coast is very narrow and the IMBL is just 12 nautical miles from the shore. Since there are many boats, they cross the border at night,” the spokesman said. “The representation to the MEA by the fishermen was mooted by the CM to directly explain their plight to the minister,” Anitha Radhakrishnan told reporters and added that top officials from the fisheries department will also be part of the delegation along with fishermen from Rameswaram, Mandapam and Jegathapattinam. The fishermen justified crossing the IMBL for their livelihood and hoped that their meeting with the MEA would add to the pressure from the CM and MPs to release the arrested men and their boats. They also hoped that the meeting would result in Sri Lanka permitting TN fishermen to peacefully fish in their territorial waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fishers-to-meet-mea-on-fishing-in-lankan-waters/articleshow/88482272.cms||---

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will flag off the distribution from Lucknow by giving out 60,000 smartphones and 40,000 tablets to 1 lakh beneficiaries. The CM will also launch the Digi Shakti Portal and Digi Shakti Adhyayan App on Saturday. The app will be pre-installed on all the smartphones and tablets. “A large number of students from every district of the state will participate in the programme. The aim of the scheme is to ensure that students have easy access to remote classes, get content for studies and also information related to employment,” said a government spokesperson. The free tablet and smartphone scheme was announced by the CM earlier this year and cleared by the cabinet. The new app will be used by the concerned educational institute or university to provide study material to students, along with information about employment related schemes and other youth welfare schemes. Kumar Vineet, special secretary (IT and Electronics), said that the government will be signing a contract with Infosys for the company to provide over 3,900 programmes related to education and employment to the youth free of cost. “The government has made elaborate plans to empower the youth of UP. Through smartphones and tablets, the youth will be provided with excellent content for studies, competitive examinations and information on employment with which they will be able to become self-reliant,” he said. In the first phase of distribution, smartphones and tablets will be given to the youth in the final year of their studies. After this, programmes will be organized at district level for distribution of the phones and tablets to other students. Those youth who have not been able to register for the scheme can do so through the Digi Shakti portal from December 25 onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/distribution-of-tabs-phones-to-up-students-begins-today/articleshow/88482761.cms||Neha Lalchandani

His petition to Dindigul district collector S Visakan finally solved his problem. P Muniappan, 60, of Kotanatham village, an agricultural coolie, had put in all his earnings to construct a house in 2000 on the patta land he owned. However, trouble started when he approached the TNEB for a power connection. “I just wasn’t able to get it and also could not spend much on following it up because of my meagre income of about Rs 6,000 a month,’’ said Muniappan.  His three children including Indirani, who is now studying in Class XII, Periyasamy in Class IV and Periyammal in Class III were his only concern. Indirani who secured 401/500 in SSLC says she was sure that she would have earned more marks in the examination if she had electricity at home. Her relative Danabal says the girl sometimes comes to his house to borrow his cellphone in the nights so that she can study using the torch light in it. Danabal accompanied Muniappan to the collectorate on Monday to hand over the petition to the collector at the grievance day meeting. Collector S Visakan said he had come to know that some dispute between Muniappan and his neighbour had caused the delay. He asked officials to sort it out, and the connection was instantaneous. “When I came to know that the children’s education was affected I asked officials to resolve it immediately,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-man-gets-power-connection-20-years-after-applying-for-it/articleshow/88482278.cms||---

Surgana taluka has administered the first dose the vaccine to 67% of the target population, while Nandgaon, Baglan and Yeola talukas have achieved 75% to 78% vaccination. The health officials said that the migration of the people from Surgana taluka to other places and even to Gujarat in search of employment was the biggest hindrance in getting the exact data of vaccination of the taluka. In rural areas, 26.60 lakh (82%) out of the total of 32.46 lakh beneficiaries have been thus partially vaccinated so far. The percentage of vaccination in Nashik city stands at 84 (12 lakh) out of 14.33 lakh people. In Malegaon town, 44% (2.19 lakh) out of 4.96 lakh people have got the first shot. The rate of vaccination is comparatively better in Dindori, Trimbakeshar, Igatpuri, Peth and Kalwan talukas, where the coverage ranges between 80% and 88% of the target population. The Nashik taluka, which surrounds Nashik city, has achieved 92% vaccination. The health officials faced a huge challenge of convincing and reaching out to the tribal population, who live in remote locations and were reluctant to take the vaccines for several reasons. The health officials have now started door-to-door vaccination, especially in the late evening and night hours. “The aim is to counsel the people and vaccinate them as per their time. We do not want to disturb them when they are going for work and hence the night time vaccination,” Dr Kailas Bhoye, in charge of vaccination of the district, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/surgana-taluka-way-short-of-full-vaccine-cover-target-lowest-in-nashik-district/articleshow/88480433.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Omicron prep: Shortage of docs, saline, even gloves in GMCs||Nagpur: Both government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCs) in Nagpur have started taking action on the directives of Guardian minister Nitin Raut to start separate wards for Omicron patients, in preparation for the third wave. However, shortage of manpower (resident doctors) and material (including IV fluids, gloves, surgicals etc) remains a big issue for both GMCs, . Resident doctors are considered as backbones of the health system in government hospitals. In case of a wave, the GMCs will be shouldering the biggest responsibility and attending to highest number of patients, from city as well as from peripheries. As the new batch of residents has still not entered colleges due to court cases; the entire responsibility of handling probable wave will land on the two earlier batches of resident doctors. The senior-most and experienced batch is all set to leave medical colleges. Hence, it will be a major problem if the wave hits in such conditions. Officials of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said only house officers have been appointed in Nagpur and residents are overburdened with work already. “We are already facing a manpower crisis. In case wave comes, it’s going to be a tough situation. MARD has been continuously alerting the state government on this issue, but there is still no concrete solution on the ground,” said Dr Sajal Bansal of GMCH. Apart from shortage of doctors, GMCs in Maharashtra are also facing a crisis of medicines and general surgical items. Even IV fluids are running short in GMCs in Vidarbha, said resident doctors. Late on Thursday evening, the national body of Indian Medical Association (IMA) also issued an official statement appealing to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the PG counselling crisis ahead of the third wave. Sources said that even regularly used medicines like IV fluids are running short in most GMCs. Hand gloves and many surgical items are also not available. This is because suppliers have stopped supply to the Haffkine Institute, the procuring authority for GMCs in State. Haffkine is yet to clear pending dues of bills for the first and second wave of Covid-19. Most GMCs have already deposited the amount with Haffkine, said officials. TOI has confirmed reports that one of the GMCs in Vidarbha has sent an email to the Malanjkhand Copper Project (MCP) Hospital, at Malanjkhand in Balaghat district of MP, asking them to supply surplus IV fluids. A truck full of IVs and other medicines is expected to arrive from MP through this ‘unofficial’ procurement. When asked about it, dean of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) Nagpur Dr Sudhir Gupta said there is no crisis of medicines in his hospital but they had a verbal enquiry about getting IV fluids from the Malanjkhand Hospital after they came to know that the stock of IVs was nearing expiry date in this hospital. BOX How prepared we are? GMCH Nagpur plans 50-bed special ward for Omicron patients with ICU and O2 AIIMS Nagpur has already reserved 50 beds in Ayush building; more may be arranged IGGMCH is setting up ward with ventilators and oxygen support for 50 patients Shortage of resident doctors at both GMCs in city is big problem Batch of senior resident doctors with good experience of handling Covid-19 has passed out GMCs also facing shortage of IV fluids, medicines, hand gloves and other material due to govt apathy||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-prep-shortage-of-docs-saline-even-gloves-in-gmcs/articleshow/88481758.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The organization has deployed 60 teams, each comprising two doctors and three MBBS students from 31 medical colleges across UP to carry out the campaign. Though termed completely “apolitical”, the drive, nevertheless, marks the Sangh’s attempt to ramp up its footprints in UP where state elections are due in the next couple of months. Dr Prabhat Pandey, an orthopedician from KGMU who looks after NMO’s Awadh Prant, told TOI that the doctors and medical students will not only hold camps in the villages of the districts but will also stay with the families to foster a “special bonding” for a “long time”. A host of private practitioners are also expected to be part of the group. He said the people will be provided medical aid on a host of ailments including women and child health related issues. The drive will culminate in Ayodhya on December 27, where the doctors and medical students will share their experiences of working in the rural areas. The UP unit of NMO had last carried out a similar campaign in 2019 after which it stopped its operations following a surge in pandemic. The organization was formed by the RSS in 1977 to cater to the medical needs of the people in the remote areas of the country. In 2000, the organization had camped in the North-East states and Jammu and Kashmir. Sources said that Sangh inducts doctors and students having rightwing leanings into the NMO to escalate its outreach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rss-backed-body-to-hold-medical-camps/articleshow/88482766.cms||---

In September, the traffic police have introduced additional payment methods of digital wallets and internet banking to make it easier for public to pay fines for traffic violations. “In Madurai city, already introducing additional digital payment methods have made it easier for public to pay fines for traffic violations and there has been good response for it. However, still many are not sure where to approach and pay fines if they are not able to pay it immediately. Most people don’t always have debit/credit cards in hand. In such case, at a later time, violators can use the nearest collection point to pay the fine easily,” said S Arumugasamy, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Madurai city. Violators can use their credit/debit cards or any digital payment methods including digital wallets or internet banking to pay the fines at the booths. While at e-seva centres, an additional charge has to be paid to pay traffic fines, no such charge is levied at these collection points. The collection points in Madurai city are in place currently at the traffic police booths in Goripalayam junction, Southgate junction, Teppakulam junction, Flower market junction and Kattabomman statue junction. “Further, SMS alerts are also being sent to violators who have pending fines and asking them to pay the fines at the earliest by making use of the facilities,” said Arumugasamy. In November alone, 1,870 cases for improper number plate, 219 cases for silencer alteration and 430 cases for fixing bumper on four-wheelers were registered by the Madurai city traffic police and a total of Rs 2,87,600 as fine amount was collected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-traffic-police-set-up-5-fine-collection-points/articleshow/88482297.cms||---

Of these, 491 cases were found eligible for compensation, of which 482 cases had received compensation.  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar also assured the assembly that the government was committed to giving farmers who repaid their loans on time, an incentive amount of Rs 50,000 under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule loan waiver scheme. This had been announced earlier but there was a delay in disbursal due to resource crunch brought on by the pandemic. “We have made provisions for additional funds through the supplementary demands and will begin giving incentive payouts under the loan waiver scheme,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/farmer-suicides-govt-mulls-higher-relief-for-families-in-mumbai/articleshow/88483444.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Kolhapur||Man, two women found dead in Sangli||Kolhapur: The bodies of a young man and two women were found on Shekoba hills of Manerajuri in Sangli district, sending shock waves in the surrounding villages. According to the Tasgaon police, the locals who visited the hill top spotted the bodies on Thursday. The police suspect the trio consuming pesticide used in grape farming. The bottle of the pesticide and the glasses used to drink the pesticide was found at a spot on the hill, which is around 20 minutes from the nearest road. The police found a four-wheeler parked at the base of the hill, which was allegedly used by the trio to reach the hill on Wednesday night. Inspector Sanjeev Zade of Tasgaon police station said, “The post mortem reports show that the deaths occurred due to consuming pesticide. Our primary investigation has revealed that the 22-year-old man and the 19 year-old woman had an affair and wanted to marry. The woman’s family did does not want her to marry him. Therefore, they might have ended their life.” Zade said that the woman was living with her relative, who resided near the man’s house. The police found the woman dressed in wedding attire and two flower garlands. “Our records show that the man was wanted in petty crimes,” he said. The police are confused over the presence of the second young woman from Sangola tehsil of Solapur district. “This woman was not related to either of the couple’s families. We are unclear how she knew the couple and why she committed suicide. We are checking if it was an accident or planned murder. We have sought call details of all three to crack the case,” said Zade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/man-two-women-found-dead-in-sangli/articleshow/88480438.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Lower jaw shattered, Pombhurna tigress shifted to Gorewada rescue centre||Nagpur: With its lower jaw completely broken, the young tigress that was rescued amid high drama on Thursday from Pombhurna in Central Chanda was shifted to Gorewada Rescue Centre on Friday evening in critical condition. Dr Shirish Upadhye, director, Wildlife Research and Training Centre (WRTC), Gorewada, said, “The lower jaw of the animal is completely broken and is virtually dangling, due to which it is unable to eat anything or swallow liquid foodstuff. The injury is old and doesn’t seem to have happened yesterday during the rescue operation.” “The tigress is completely dehydrated as it must not have consumed food for the last 10-12 days. It is under tremendous stress and has been put on saline. We have administered fluids and antibiotics, and taken blood samples,” Dr Upadhye said. Amid conflicting reports about the tigress being injured after a mob threw a crude bomb meant to kill wild boars, sources said even if true, the incident did not occur yesterday. Sources said, “A camera trap image of the tigress captured on December 12 shows the jaw injury and perhaps due to this reason it was unable to hunt. In the last 10 days, the tigress was engaged in killing easy prey like goats near agricultural farms.” On Thursday too, the tigress had killed a goat but was shooed away by local people. In an attempt to escape, it entered a 35-feet-long culvert pipe and got trapped as the other end was blocked by sludge accumulated for a long time. “This means the tigress was injured before December 12, and the injury may be due to low-intensity crude bomb, wire snares, or possibly small steel traps laid for herbivores. She may have got stuck and injured its jaw got badly while attempting to free itself. However, forest officials and forest staff involved in the operation feel it is a bomb injury, as there is absolutely no injury on other body parts,” said sources. A section of Gorewada veterinarians ruled out a bomb injury, though. They feel an explosion would have damaged the upper jaw too, at least to some extent, but there is no injury to it. A territorial fight has also been ruled out as other body parts have no injury. For forest officials, the surprise catch turned out to be the problem tigress that was responsible for attacks on humans in the area in the recent past. The tigress had mauled three persons and injured five others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lower-jaw-shattered-pombhurna-tigress-shifted-to-gorewada-rescue-centre/articleshow/88481800.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Lucknow||Atal was adored by all: UP BJP chief||Lucknow: The stature of BJP stalwart and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was way beyond his credentials of being a Hindu, especially a Brahmin, as he was adored by people from all caste and religions, bringing the party at the centrestage of a broader political acceptability, said UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Friday. “Wo kisi bhi jaati, dharm aur dal se upar they (He was above caste, religion and political party),” Singh said, speaking to TOI on the eve of Vajpayee’s 97th birth anniversary. His observation, however, drew a sharp contrast with an event on Friday organized by a foundation headed by UP law minister Brijesh Pathak which prefixed Pandit before the name of Vajpayee. The ‘Pandit Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Foundation’ organized ‘Atal Ram Sankalp Apne Apne Ram’ in which poet and former Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas participated. CM Yogi Adityanath, Union minister and BJP’s UP election in charge Dharmendra Pradhan, party vice-president Radha Mohan Singh and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and other BJP leaders attended the event. Vishwas, who has been junking speculations about his political leanings, had attended a programme organized on the birthday celebration of SP national general Ram Gopal Yadav on November 23. Singh, however, maintained that the party considered Vajpayee as one of the tallest party leaders whose auroral persona penetrated through religious and caste lines to work as a flashlight in BJP’s quest for ‘attaining developmental goals’. Experts said this marked BJP’s attempt to quell the religious hardline narrative peddled by right-wing organizations and some of BJP leaders. “Vajpayee was considered moderate within the BJP. And the people who didn’t like the saffron outfit often looked up to him because of his image of a statesman,” said political analyst JP Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/atal-was-adored-by-all-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/88482769.cms||Pankaj Shah

While Cochin Carnival, one of the mega New Year celebrations in the state, is getting underway at Fort Kochi, many other events are being held or in the pipeline in other parts of the city. The curtains on the celebrations as part of the carnival have already been raised. “The celebrations started by placing wreaths at the war memorial in Kochi on December 12. A wrestling event was held at Fort Kochi beach on Thursday. Various events like kayaking, cross country race, angling etc were already held,” said former mayor K J Sohan. “Meanwhile, the carnival rally and burning of Pappanji which usually witnesses participation of tens of thousands have been dropped this time due to Covid control measures. But all other programmes as part of the carnival will be intact. There will be many programmes at Fort Kochi in the coming days,” Sohan said. In lieu of the events which would be scrapped, the organizers are planning to include new events which can be conducted by avoiding crowding. “One of such events being planned is a treasure hunt competition. It is being designed for ensuring participation of couples,” said Stephen Robert, secretary of Cochin Carnival Society, which helps in raising the funds for the event. “Last year, the carnival had to be scrapped. Though the rally and burning of Pappanji will have to be avoided this time, we are celebrating in all possible manners. Events like cycle race, shuttle/badminton tournament, Konkani songs recitation, wrestling, chenda melam, gazal etc were already conducted. Many events like rangoli competition, kolam varakkal, thekkoottam kali, orchestra, kids mega show, India@75 quiz competition, sevens football etc are in the store,” said N S Shaji, chairman of the Cochin Carnival committee. “Besides the programmes organized by us, there are other entertainments like amusement park.

Her samples have been sent to the state public health laboratory in Chennai for genome sequencing to ascertain if it is a case of Omicron variant. According to health department sources, the woman and her family, who are originally from Tirupur district, had first reached Chennai airport. “The woman, her husband and child all had tested negative for Covid-19 at the airport on December 15. They had then gone to Tirupur and from there had travelled to Dindigul. The woman alone has tested Covid-19 positive now when their samples were taken for testing on the eighth day as per protocol,” said an official. He further said that the woman has been admitted to Dindigul medical college hospital in isolation. She is currently stable and has mild symptoms of influenza-like illness. So far, a total of 25 close contacts of the woman were traced and their samples sent for testing. Of the 25, three have tested Covid-19 positive. However, it is yet to be ascertained if the woman is carrying the Omicron variant of SARS CoV-2 virus. The woman’s samples have hence been sent for genome sequencing to Chennai on Friday as is the protocol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sa-returnee-tests-covid-positive-near-palani/articleshow/88482307.cms||---

---||Kolkata||‘Writing With Fire’ shortlisted in Oscars’ documentary section||KOLKATA: Delhi-based Sushmit Ghosh and Rintu Thomas’s documentary ‘Writing With Fire’ has been shortlisted in the documentary section of the next round of the Academy Awards on Wednesday. Kolkata’s very own Tajdar Junaid, who has scored the music for this film along with Ishaan Chabbra, said the Oscar news opens up channels for more documentary filmmakers to come out of India and get recognition. This documentary chronicles the rise of ‘Khabar Lahariya’, a newspaper run by Dalit women, who switch from print to digital to stay relevant in modern times. In a cluttered news landscape dominated by men, this is India’s only newspaper run by Dalit women. Armed with smartphones, chief reporter Meera and her journalists break traditions, be it on the frontlines of India’s biggest issues or within the conﬁnes of their homes, redeﬁning what it means to be powerful. Incidentally, Tamil film ‘Koozhangal’ (Pebbles) that was selected by a jury in Kolkata as India’s official entry to the 94th Academy Awards failed to make the cut. On Wednesday, Ghosh wrote on Facebook that it is “a bit surreal saying this: ‘Writing With Fire’ has been short-listed for an Oscar!” Sharing a memory from the shooting, where the unit was having tea after finishing filming for the day, he wrote: “This is a story of hope and resilience and we celebrate this moment with everyone of you, it takes many cups of chai to make a film!” The documentary that has won 28 international awards, including double wins at Sundance, Audience Award at The International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, Best Feature doc at San Francisco, and double wins at BlackStar, was lauded by legendary journalist and activist Gloria Steinem. When Ghosh had asked Steinem whether there was anything in particular of the film that had appealed to her, Steinem first referred to its narrative or the story form. Then, she went on to describe how the film was “experiential” since the person, who narrated the story, had been there, instead of being a collection of facts. Junaid, whose composition ‘dastaan’ was earlier heard in legendary Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf's "The President”, Hollywood film 'Sold' produced by Academy Award winner Emma Thompson, the Indie film 'Mukti Bhawan' and the much-talked about OTT film 'Axone', said, “If a maker’s theory is unique and honest, it will reach where it has to reach.” While scoring the music, where he used South American instruments ronroco and charango, Junaid had to be “extra sensitive” about portraying their characters and be “subtle yet assertive”. “I had to become like a character in the film so that the music doesn’t overpower anything else,” he said. Two years ago when Ghosh had shown him an edit of the film, little did he know “the story of these powerful courageous women would be so inspiring”. “We take a lot of things for granted. They include things like returning at a certain time of the night, charging our phone without thinking about electricity. When I saw the story of these women, it left me jaw-dropped because of the courage they carry, the adversities they face, the problems of female journalists in the male dominated world. They are transitioning from print to digital and none of them have ever held a smartphone in their lives. To overcome these hurdles, to speak the truth for what the truth is through their work has been inspiring. It has made me complain less about things I don’t have.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/film-with-city-musicians-score-shortlisted-for-oscar-docu-section/articleshow/88481780.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

---||Kolkata||IICP students write success stories with online learning||KOLKATA: While the focus has been on online classes in mainstream schools, here children with cerebral palsy face different degrees of difficulties, from speech impairment to the lack of motor control. They have also slogged silently alongside and at the end of 20 months they are able to write success stories. When the Centre for Special Education, which is the school run by the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy (IICP), shut due to the pandemic and the students were told to stay home, no one was sure whether education for these children would also come to a halt because virtual learning needed the gadget bridge. However, today IICP is happy because these children have shown an unusual knack for smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktops that they have been using daily for their online classes. Like the students of mainstream schools, these children are also connected by WhatsApp groups, where study material, notes and videos are shared by teachers. “You will have to see to believe the alacrity, with which our palsy students have taken to the smart phone. Initially, these children needed their parents to guide them but now at the end of 20 months children have mastered the art of typing messages and dialling numbers to call teachers if they are late for class by a few minutes,” said the principal of the school, Susrita Pradhan. Educators here felt that since many children have been using computers as part of their skill training from a very young age — this helps them communicate even when their speech is unclear or their motor skills are underdeveloped — they have been able to cope with the virtual classes. “Since they do not have to travel to and from school and are saving a lot of time and exhaustion, considering their physical challenges, they are coping with the virtual classes even better,” said vice principal Suchetana Mukherjee. The attendance is near 100% (unlike mainstream schools where attendance related truancy has been a problem) and children look forward to the classes — their only connect with the world outside. Children like Ankush Majhi, Diganta Nagand Srija Sinha, have now mastered the skill of creative performances and have been uploading videos on their own regularly, said teachers. The school has successfully organised a five-day summer camp, where children did experiments and even performed magic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iicp-students-write-success-stories-with-online-learning/articleshow/88481792.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Experts back mask upgrade; proper fitting holds the key||Pune: Members of the Maharashtra task force on Covid-19 have hinted at upgrading masks being used by citizens in view of experts’ advice on tweaking Covid-appropriate behaviour to higher standards to protect people from the Omicron infection. Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at Delhi-based CSIR-IGIB, which is part of INSACOG, said in a recent tweet th-at a “right-fitting” mask was of utmost importance. “The unequivocal winner is without surprise a right-fitting FFP2 mask. Mean infection risk is one in 1,000 when the infected and susceptible wear a proper fitting FFP2 mask. Surgical masks fare much poorly (risk is one in 10). It might actually be a great idea to upgrade masks, in high-risk groups like immunocompromised and people with comorbodities, especially given the background that booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine are not in sight at least in India.” State Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said, “Covid is an airborne droplet virus. One has to use well-fitting masks to prevent catching the virus in the air... If an individual is wearing a cloth mask, s/he must additionally wear a surgical 3-ply mask so the cover against virus droplets is adequate.” He said the transmissibility of the ancestral strain from Wuhan was 3.5, which moved up to six for the Delta variant and over nine for Omicron. “Rapidity of transmission is very high for newer variants Delta and Omicron, which is why in healthcare and crowded settings, it’s very important to wear an N95 or FFP2 mask. The mask also should be well-fitted. Leaving gaps in mask even if it’s covering the mouth and the nose can pose risk of transmission.” Vasant Nagvekar, consult-ant, infectious diseases, and state task force member, said: “With highly transmissible Omicron in the picture, old concepts about Covid may need tweaking. For instance, many of those with a prior Covid infection plus both vaccine doses are also contracting the infection. But the infecti-on has been mild. So, they should not think that a past infection will make them immune. Two shots of vaccine is impo-rtant even for them,” he said. Dr Maria Nigam, physician and principal founder PRANA, said, “N95 or FFP2 masks prevent around 95% of airbo-rne virus particles from entering the nasal airway. But the surgical mask that most people wear is not good enough to block transmission effectively. Also it is loosely fitted.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-experts-back-mask-upgrade-proper-fitting-holds-the-key/articleshow/88483093.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Lucknow||Ayodhya to be linked with waterways: CM Yogi Adityanath||AYODHYA: Days after proposing a world class airport in Ayodhya, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday announced plans to also connect the temple city with the world through waterways. “Thousands of years ago, the princess of Ayodhya travelled to Korea through waterways. Taking a cue, we will now explore options to connect Ayodhya with waterways through grand rivers of Saryu and Ghaghra which flow through the temple town,” the CM said, insisting that efforts would be made to present Ayodhya as a world class destination with modern amenities and global connectivity. He said the new Ayodhya would have best roads, air, rail and waterways connectivity. The Chief Minister was in Ayodhya to lay the foundation for Government Ayurvedic College, along with 500 health wellness centres, and 50-bed AYUSH hospitals for six districts — Unnao, Shravasti, Gorakhpur, Hardoi, Sambhal and Mirzapur and 50-bed Integrated AYUSH hospitals for Lucknow, Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat. The CM also announced that the work was on to connect all Ayurvedic colleges of the state with the Ayurvedic University. In a scathing attack on the previous SP government in the state, the CM said there was a pressing need to bring ‘Ram Rajya’ in true sense. “People don’t want a government that fires bullets on Ram Bhakts,” he said with obvious reference to firing on the karsewaks in 1990. Describing Ayodhya as a symbol of faith for everyone, the CM said, “Everyone’s cooperation is needed to fulfill Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s resolve to develop Ayodhya as the most beautiful city in the world.” He thanked the central government for giving an Ayurvedic college to Ayodhya. “In a few days, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone for international airport in Ayodhya. Then you will be able to travel to any country from here,” said Yogi. Reminiscing the relationship of Ayodhya with Korea, he said, “It is said that Ratna, the princess of Korea, reached Ayodhya from Korea via the waterways from Ayodhya.” The CM also inaugurated the 50-bed Integrated Ayush Hospital and 500 Ayush Health Wellness Centres from Ayodhya and laid the foundation stone of Government Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Ayodhya.  He also laid foundation of 50-bed Ayush hospitals in Unnao, Shravasti, Gorakhpur, Hardoi, Sambhal and Mirzapur districts, 50-bed Integrated AYUSH Hospitals in Lucknow, Kanpur, Kanpur Dehat and 250 Government Ayurvedic dispensaries/AYUSH-health and wellness centres. Earlier, inaugurating Shri Ram Satsang Bhawan, the CM said the message of unity and peace was given to the entire country through Deepotsav in Ayodhya. “The government is constantly making efforts to ensure that the saints and devotees who come here do not face any problem. Shri Ram Satsang Bhawan will provide all facilities to devotees,” he said. Urging all to be careful in view of coronavirus, he said, “Our government is working to save lives and livelihood. Follow all the guidelines of the central and state government on coronavirus so that it is defeated and the country wins.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ayodhya-to-be-linked-with-waterways-cm/articleshow/88482788.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Bareilly||Uttar Pradesh: Mob shuts down ‘Sai’ juice shop run by Muslim owner in Moradabad||BAREILLY: A juice shop called 'New Sai Juice Centre', being run by a Muslim man for past 15 years in Majhola area of Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad district, was vandalised and forced to shut on Thursday after members of a right-wing outfit raised objection to the outlet's name. The activists claimed that "Sai Baba is a Hindu deity” and the Muslim owner should change its name. They also allegedly threatened to shut all shops run by Muslims which are named after Hindu deities in the locality. Locals in the area claimed that police initially remained a mute spectator while all this was going on and later advised the owner, Shabbu Khan, to change the shop's name “to avoid further trouble.” An FIR was subsequently registered against a local leader of the Bajrang Dal, identified as Navneet Sharma, and his aides for "rioting and criminal intimidation" on Friday. The action was taken after videos of the incident began circulating on social media. Speaking to TOI, Khan, the juice shop owner, said, "I was about to have dinner at home on Thursday when I was shocked to learn that a few people started vandalising my shop. They asked me to close my shop because of my faith. This shop is part of my life and is important for my family.” Assuring appropriate action against the culprits, Majhola SHO Dhananjay Singh said, “We found that about 20-25 people, led by Navneet Sharma, had forcefully closed the juice shop. They also slapped its owner. We have registered an FIR under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 147 (rioting) against Sharma and his aides.” Incidentally, a complaint was also lodged by the right-wing activists against Khan but police said the complaint against the shopkeeper is “not convincing enough as the man has been running the shop for 15 years and there has been no issue so far.” Watch Uttar Pradesh: Bajrang Dal shuts down ‘Sai’ juice shop run by Muslim owner in Moradabad||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/right-wing-group-objects-to-muslim-man-running-juice-shop-named-after-sai-baba-in-up-claims-sai-is-hindu-deity/articleshow/88481085.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||DSK’s kin gets bail in economic fraud||Pune: The Bombay high court has granted bail to Kedar Vanjape, son-in-law of jailed developer DS Kulkarni alias DSK, in the alleged Rs2,091-crore economic fraud by the realtor and his group of firms. “The case of the applicant can be said to be better placed than that of the other co-accused Anuradha (Purandare, who is DSK’s sister-in-law) and Hemanti Kulkarni (DSK’s wife) who are already ordered to be released by this court,” Justice Nitin Sambre said while passing the order on Thursday. Vanjape was an executive director (ED) of the DSK Developers Limited (DSKDL) in 2009 and is facing charges of being a part of the conspiracy by all accused to defraud the group’s sole public limited company in the Phursungi land transactions for a proposed SEZ project Vanjape’s lawyer Aniket Ujjwal Nikam had argued that the allegations against Hemanti Kulkarni (director) and Anuradha Purandare (vice-president and authorised signatory) were on a much higher pedestal as compared to the applicant (Vanjape). The applicant was not involved in any act of accepting deposits from the depositors and none of the depositors have named him. The only role attributed to him was that of facilitating the transaction for buying land. Special prosecutor Pravin Chavan had opposed the bail on the grounds the applicant’s involvement in the act of hatching a criminal conspiracy in the matter of commission of offence can be inferred from the available material. The HC observed, “As far as invoking of the provisions of MPID Act are concerned, there is hardly any material to infer that the applicant had any time promised higher returns to the depositors and lure them to deposit the amount with the company. The applicant was an ED of the company for about nine months and, prior to it, he worked as an employee. The only role attributed to the applicant is that of facilitating the transaction of acquiring land at Phursungi.” The HC further observed that the investigation does not reflect that the applicant had received any part of the ill gotten money from the land deal. “Some parcel of land was purchased in the name of applicant’s wife, she was already ordered to be released by this court,” the HC said. As such the applicant deserves to be released on bail, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dsks-kin-gets-bail-in-economic-fraud/articleshow/88481833.cms||Vishwas Kothari

According to airport officials, the total water requirement at Surat airport is around 807 KLD, at present. The airport is now developing its own sewage treatment plant of 210 KLD which will help the premises reuse treated water multiple times for various purposes other than drinking. The airport at present requires around 301 KLD of freshwater which is supplied by Surat Municipal Corporation and no groundwater is extracted for this. Once the sewage treatment plant becomes operational, up to 210 KLD treated water will be available for use while SMC will have to supply 45 KLD. Airport’s own sewage treatment plant that is likely to come into operation in a few months. This high-tech plant will recycle water and treat sewage to ensure “zero-effluent discharge” by next year. It is estimated that wastewater generation is 488KLD, which will be treated in the STP that uses Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor(MBBR) technology. Treated water will be reused within the airport premises for flushing, gardening and in the cooling system of terminal building. The proposed expansion project will be a Zero-Effluent Discharge Unit, said an official. Once the new terminal building work gets completed, flights and passenger traffic will also increase thus pushing up usage of water. Treated water will thus be helpful to reduce freshwater consumption. Airport director Aman Saini said, “We are working on developing a sewage treatment plant along with projects like natural lighting and solar powered panels. Surat airport is also a silent airport.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-airport-to-develop-own-210kld-sewage-treatment-plant/articleshow/88481068.cms||Mehul Jani

The police on Friday filed a final report (FR) in the case after concluding their investigation which revealed that a former teacher, Dev Prakash Yadav in collusion with a woman, had asked the families of five girls to file FIRs against the teaching staff. SP (Bhiwadi) Ram Murti Joshi said that the police is likely to take action against Yadav and his aide in the case. Police alleged that Yadav was posted in the same school and was sent to jail for sexually assaulting a minor student last year. Police alleged that Yadav had offered money to the families of the girls. Bhiwadi police had long suspected Yadav’s role in the case because the teachers named in the case were witnesses in his case. He later came out of jail and hatched the conspiracy with a local woman wherein they allegedly offered money and persuaded families to file cases against the teachers. Three FIRs were registered at a police station on December 7 in which a total of 15 persons, including teaching and clerical staff were of a government booked. Immediately after the incident, the Rajasthan police had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the matter. Bhiwadi police said that their investigation found that Yadav had plotted the entire conspiracy with an aim to implicate teachers of the school. Along with Yadav, police are also probing the involvement of a woman identified as Mamta, who had colluded with Yadav. Police said that action is likely to be taken against Yadav for his role in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/alwar-school-gangrape-police-report-finds-charges-false/articleshow/88481831.cms||---

The ruling Shiv Sena and Congress, however, voted against the adjournment motion. The BJP also sought resignation of Shiv Sena corporator Rajul Patel, the BMC’s health committee chairperson. “We had sought an adjournment motion over infant deaths. But the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP defeated our motion. This shows that the ruling MVA wants to protect the culprits. They are all cold-blooded and have no sympathy,” said BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde.  On Thursday, Patel faced flak after she questioned if parents of the dead infants had asked the BMC before admitting them there. “We are not getting pediatric doctors in BMC. How is it our responsibility? Why did you come from Goregaon? Why should we take responsibility and what responsibility should we take?,” Patel told relatives. She later apologised for her comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bhandup-infant-deaths-bjp-seeks-to-adjourn-civic-panel-meet-in-mumbai/articleshow/88483463.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

About 93.3 lakh fewer doses have been administered to women in the state, according to CoWin.  As of Friday, of the 13 crore vaccine doses administered, 6.9 crore doses have been given to men and 6.05 crore to women, which translates into 866 doses delivered to women for every 1,000 given to men. The gender gap in doses administered is wider in the bigger districts and urban centres.  Mumbai, the state’s most populous district, has administered 1.76 crore first and second doses of which 59% beneficiaries have been men while just 41% doses have gone to women. In Maharashtra, 54% doses have gone to men and 46% to women. After Mumbai, the biggest isparities have been seen in Pune, Thane and Raigad where 56% men have got vaccinated. Another 26,000 doses have been given under the category ‘others’, which could include transgender people, among others.  Interestingly, there are also districts that have bucked the state’s trend. Sangli, Wardha, Satara and Ratnagiri are the only four districts where the distribution of doses is equal between men and women. However, Bhandara and Gondia have been the real exceptions. Both have administered more doses to women than men. In Bhandara and Gondia, 51% and 52% women have taken the vaccines, respectively. The health officials of Bhandara said they haven’t taken any special drive to get more women participation. Arokiasamy said that problems of access are likely to be less in rural or semi-urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/glaring-gender-disparity-in-maharashtra-covid-vaccine-drive/articleshow/88483110.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Their salaries have been hiked and implemented. Those coming back to work are not facing any action. Still, many workers are not ready to join. We have no option other than invoking the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (Mesma). The state government will have to take the decision, though,” a senior MSRTC official based in Mumbai told TOI. The MSRTC employees’ strike entered its 58th day across the state and the 46th day in the Pune division. The total losses of the transport corporation are set to touch Rs1,000 crore now. Of the 4,275 employees in the Pune division of MSRTC, only 1,019 have resumed duty. Just 150 buses of the earlier 700 are plying now. “Our losses are almost touching Rs55 crore now,” Dyaneshwar Ranavare, the traffic manager, told TOI. The state-appointed committee looking into the grievances of the unions had presented its interim report to the Bombay high court on Monday this week. The interim report stated that an opinion on the merger issue — the main demand of the agitating employees — had not been prepared. “The next hearing of the court is on January 5. The workers seem convinced that some decision will come in their favour that day. Hence, they are not ready to come back to work. Even after two major unions backing off, the workers are not convinced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mesma-only-option-to-end-msrtc-strike-officials/articleshow/88481846.cms||Joy Sengupta

The incident came to light when some girl students of the Government Higher Secondary School in Vellalore blocked road on Friday, seeking action against Computer Science teacher C Vijay Anand. A week ago, students of Class XI and XII had told the headmaster that the teacher tried to touch girl students in class. He also insisted on meeting them while submitting assignments. As no action was taken against the teacher even after a week, the students blocked road seeking removal of the teacher. After receiving a written complaint from the students on Friday, chief educational officer (CEO) N Geetha ordered immediate suspension of Vijay. “The child welfare committee was informed about the students’ complaints last week and an inquiry is being conducted. Also, a complaint was lodged with the Podanur police,” Geetha told TOI.

---||Kochi||Ernakulam: Fish farmers reap bumper harvest||KOCHI: Adding colours to their Christmas celebrations, a group of farmers from the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe communities in the district has a bumper harvest of pearl spot (karimeen) and tilapia through their cage fish farming venture. The farmers reaped good catches from the two cage farming ventures at Nettoor and Ezhikkara. The eight-month-long cage farming was carried out under the schemes — scheduled caste sub plan (SCSP) and tribal sub plan (TSP) — of the central marine fisheries research institute (CMFRI). A self-help group named ‘Sreedevi’, including 22 ST families in Thandassery Colony at Nettoor, harvested a yield of 600kg of pearl spot and 1,300kg of tilapia from four cages. While pearl spot attained a growth of an average 300g, tilapia got an average weight of 650g. Under the TSP scheme of CMFRI, the ST families were provided with cages, ancillary facilities, fish seeds and feed. Five SC families benefited from the cage farming carried out at Ezhikkara under the CMFRI’s SCSP scheme as they managed to harvest 250kg of tilapia from one cage. A team of researchers from CMFRI led by K Madhu, Rema Madhu and Rajesh N coordinated the cage farming ventures. Under the SCSP scheme of the CMFRI, cage fish farming is being undertaken by members of the SC community across the country, and biofloc farming is aimed at extending the benefits of this scheme to those who do not have access to open waterbodies. The biofloc project is underway in Palakkad, Thrissur, Idukki, Kottayam and Kollam districts under CMFRI’s guidance. The tilapia fry were procured from MPEDA’s hatchery in Vallarpadam. Biofloc technology is a scientific method for high-density fish farming in a controlled environment in which fish wastes are converted into useful nutrients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fish-farmers-reap-bumper-harvest/articleshow/88481128.cms||---

The Goa consumer action network (Goacan) conducted the inspection of the stores selling food items at the KTC Panaji bus stand after receiving complaints from consumers that food items were being sold in violation of the rules prescribed by directorate of food and drug administration (DFDA) and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Packaged food items were being sold without the mandated DFDA/FSSAI licence while various other food items like coconut sweets and puran polli are being sold in sealed packets without any label showing the name, address, date of manufacture and expiry and even the MRP. Goacan has therefore written to the KTC managing director at the head office in Porvorim to monitor the food safety standards as prescribed by FSSAI at the bus stand. It has also sought intervention of the DFDA to protect the interests of consumers by taking the necessary steps in this regard and ensure that the KTC premises cannot be used to sell food items to commuters/consumers by failing to follow the food safety laws as prescribed by them or the FSSAI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/violation-of-food-safety-norms-found-at-panaji-ktc-bus-stand/articleshow/88482386.cms||---

While long queues were seen in rural areas, few people turned up to vote in urban areas. Ward number 16, which recorded maximum of 72.81% voting includes colonies of sector 25. On the other hand, ward 23, which includes sectors 34, 35 and 43, recorded lowest of around 42.66% voting. In colonies and villages like Dhanas, Maloya, Bapudham, Mauli Jagran, Vikas Nagar, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Lahora, Manimajra and Palsora, people started queueing up before polling started at 7:30am. The long queues of voters kept polling officers, security personnel and political parties busy since polling began in the morning. Security personnel worked hard to ensure proper lines and law and order in these areas. In some colonies, the situation was near chaotic as candidates and their supporters tried to win over people. Elaborate security arrangements helped control the situation. Almost all candidates and their supporters pressed multiple vehicles into service to bring voters to polling stations. In stark contrast, voters started trickling in only by afternoon in urban areas, especially in the northern and southern parts of the city. The inflow of voters suggested that voting percentage was quite low in northern areas of the city as compared to colonies and rural areas. Polling staff in these areas were seen waiting for voters as against their counterparts in rural areas. The situation in colonies and villages was such that even Covid norms were violated. Voters crowded together despite attempts to maintain social distancing. While the police tried hard to control the situation, it was practically impossible for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/long-queues-in-rural-areas-offset-by-thin-voting-in-cities/articleshow/88481863.cms||Deepak Yadav

The placement was earlier scheduled in September, but work was suspended for almost three-and-a-half months following objections from elected representatives and Ganesh Mandal workers over the girder’s height. Finally, the work was taken up under police protection late at night on Thursday and continued till Friday morning. The traffic movement on the bridge was halted and it was diverted from alternate routes to assist work. Since the work was planned during night hours, it did not have much impact on traffic movement, except those travelling on the route had to take a detour via Bhandarkar road and other arterial roads. The MahaMetro has said that the second set of two girders will be placed in a similar manner in the next few days.The MahaMetro has already placed similar girders each on Shivaji bridge and Gadgil bridge. A MahaMetro official said, “The girder work at Lakdi bridge is part of the Metro’s Vanaz-Ramwadi route. We have already completed the viaduct work from Garware College end towards Lakdi bridge. We had approached the city police to complete the work.” Officials said the Metro work along the river has been expedited. There is a plan to complete the remaining portion at the earliest. The completion of work at Lakdi bridge will help finish remaining work up to Civil Court interchange station. The opposition parties in the PMC, including the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena, had protested against the placement of the girder at the general body meeting, demanding a discussion on the Metro work and its alignment. Mayor Muralidhar Mohol refused to accept their demand, claiming that the general body had already discussed the issue. All prominent Ganesh mandals in the city had announced on Wednesday that they do not have any objection to the placement of the girder on Lakdi bridge.

The accused is a history sheeter with offences of robberies, snatching and cheating registered against him at Kumar, Dindoshi, Nayanagar, Mumbra and Pydhonie police stations. Jafri was arrested after he and his accomplice Irani on May 29 this year intercepted Primal Adak, an employee of a jewellery firm. Adak was on his way to deliver gold bars and deposit money in the bank at Kalbadevi when Jafri and Irani stopped him. Posing as cops in mufti, they asked Adak where he was going during the lockdown and ordered him to show his bag. They forcibly took him to one side of the road, and on the pretext of checking his belongings, they removed gold bars from the packet. The duo let him go after noting down his identity details. The duo then fled on a motorcycle. After coming to a certain distance, Adak opened the bag only to find the valuables worth Rs 1.50 lakh missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fake-cop-held-for-robbing-jewellery-shop-worker/articleshow/88483482.cms||Ahmed Ali

Taking strong objection to actor Nani’s comments, irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav said the actual problem lies in the remunerations of the stars. He said heroes could reduce the burden on the producers by cutting down on their remunerations if they are really bothered about the producers.He said the heroes could provide entertainment to their fans by bringing down their remunerations.  “The state government has fixed the movie ticket prices to help the commoners and also the exhibitors. Heroes are creating unnecessary controversies on the issue,” said the minister.  He said the officials are carrying out inspections to check whether the theatres are maintained as per the rules prescribed in the licence. He said it is the duty of the administration to put everything on track, and added there is no point in closing down theatres for fear of facing inspections if everything is clean.  Reacting to the minister’s comments, actor Siddarth suggested the government to bring down the ministers’ luxuries being enjoyed with the tax payers’ money.  Producer of ‘Bahubali,’ Sobhu Yarlagadda said it was the right of producer to fix the MRP on movie ticket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/twood-govt-spar-over-movie-ticket-prices-continues/articleshow/88481894.cms||Samdani MN

As per the schedule, the schools’ registrations and verification will be done between December 28 and January 27, online forms for admissions will be open from February 1 to 28 and the lottery rounds will be held on March 8 and 9. The admissions in 2021-22, went on till December 21 and of the 985 schools that registered in Pune, 14,773 seats were available of which over 10,857 seats were claimed by the students. Across the state, there were 9,432 schools registered to offer 96,684 seats of which 61,700 were claimed by students. Officials have requested interested candidates to apply for all documents such as income certificates, caste certificates etc in advance so that they do not lose out on admissions due to lack of documents. For many students RTE holds hope for a better education, and life. Mukund Kirdat, an RTE activist from Aam Aadmi Party, said, “Getting documents is a hard process for many, especially for economically and socially disadvantaged women who have been separated from their husbands. Many times, they are not legally separated and hence that presents a whole lot of issues because, at the time of admission, the caste certificate, income certificate etc of the father needs to be submitted. Another option is that of registering as a single parent but even here, the department has not given details on what documents to submit.” Dinkar Temkar, in charge of RTE admissions in the state, said that for single parents, an affidavit from the tehsildar’s office needs to be submitted as proof during the admission process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rte-admissions-from-feb-1-schools-can-register-from-tue/articleshow/88482384.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Ahmedabad||Act against polluting housing societies, says Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: While a drive to sever drainage connection of polluting industrial units is underway at the behest of the Gujarat high court, the judges on Friday ordered the authorities to take criminal action against office-bearers of housing societies that are found discharging their sewage directly into the Sabarmati river. The issue was brought to the court’s notice during the hearing of a suo motu PIL on improperly treated wastewater being discharged into the river. The amicus curiae in the case, advocate Hemang Shah, had earlier pointed out that the joint task force noticed discharge of untreated sewage from residential societies into the river. He and a member of the JTF, Rohit Prajapati, also drew the attention of the court to such direct discharge. On Friday, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati took cognizance of this and directed the authorities to immediately find these offenders, “If you find a particular house in a society, there should be immediate disconnection of their connection. There should be a prosecution of officebearers of such societies.” The judges later reiterated, “If any residential society is caught discharging sewage directly into the Sabarmati river, there will be criminal prosecution against the officer-bearers. You need to stop this.” The court has ordered Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to launch a drive to snap drainage connection of industrial units that discharge their trade effluent in sewage lines. The court has ordered disconnection because trade effluent is carried in sewage lines to STPs, which cannot properly treat this mixed waste water and plants get damaged. The authorities have snapped 380 such connections till date. On Friday, the court came to know that the mega pipeline, which is especially laid down to carry treated industrial wastewater, from Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) to Sabarmti also have illegal domestic connections quickly silting the pipeline and reducing its carrying capacity. The amicus spoke about 12 residential societies whose sewage connections join the mega pipeline which is meant for industry. One of the companies operating a CETPs also complained about 66 such illegal connections to the mega pipeline and about 30 connections have been snapped. The high court ordered that such illegal connections be identified and snapped immediately. The AMC and the company that operates the mega pipeline will jointly carry out the operation. The court posted a further hearing on the river pollution issue for January 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/societies-sewage-discharge-hc-seeks-action/articleshow/88481902.cms||---

Inspector-in-charge of Maheshtala police station Subendu Sarkar said, “We have put a lot of efforts to bring down the number of accidents. We have deployed traffic cops. But the narrow bridge is not suitable for two-way movement. It is ideal for tidal movement.” Administrator of Maheshtala Municipality and local MLA Dulal Das said, “Accidents and deaths are unfortunate. Often bikers ride at a great speed. We are trying to solve the issue by speaking to police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/couple-11-year-old-son-killed-as-tourist-bus-hits-bike-on-flyover/articleshow/88481908.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

On Thursday, during the hearing on a bunch of pe- questioning the titions Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act 2020, advocate General Kamal Trivedi made a statement, re we meet in “Befo- the new year, we areco- ming out with an ordinance. I am ma- king it very clear and we are trying to see whatever we can do, we will do it.” The advocate general made the statement about the government’s plan to promulgate an ordinance after the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri showed him a recent amendment made by the Karnataka government in its Land Revenue Act, by which it has made provisions of regularisation for tribals and forest dwellers’ possession of land, which they have been cultivating in an unauthorized manner. The court drew the government’s attention to this provision after a lawyer argued about hindrances that the anti-land grabbing laws have created in regularising possession of agricultural land for tribal persons. In this case, a trust had taken a parcel of land on a 99-year lease in 1966, and after the enactment of this law, the trust was dubbed a land grabber. The law has been under question for various reasons, mainly for unsettling settled disputes by its overriding effect on pending civil disputes and decrees of civil courts. The lawyers termed this law draconian and submitted how Gujarat has adopted few safeguards compared to other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-to-amend-land-grabbing-laws-through-ordinance/articleshow/88481913.cms||---

On Tuesday, 25 cases were registered in the ward, followed by 20 and 33 cases on Wednesday and Thursday respectively. The doubling time here has dropped from 1,424 days on November 12 to 699 now. Doubling rate, which represents the number of days it takes for Covid-19 cases to double, is an indicator of how quickly cases are increasing; lower the doubling rate, faster the cases multiply. The city’s doubling rate has dropped (1,536) and the infection’s weekly growth rate has doubled from 0.02 to 0.05 in less than a month. The weekly growth rate is highest in ward A at 0.1% (double of the city’s rate). Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital in New Marine Lines said there is a slight increase in the number of people calling up with Covid-positive report. “Number of people calling up for e-consult due to Covid has definitely gone up in the last one week, but most have mild symptoms and don’t need hospitalisation,” said Dr Bhansali. The surge isn’t confined to ward A. Similar stories are unfolding in wards D (Malabar Hill), G-South (Worli, Lower Parel), H-West (Bandra-West) and the overcrowded K-East and West wards in Andheri. Malabar Hill saw 198 cases in a week, Bandra saw 189 cases and Worli 120. The doubling rate of cases has dropped below 1,000 days here. Andheri (W) saw the highest weekly increase in the city at 248. BMC officials said the surge in A ward is possibly due to the high floating population. All shops and restaurants had been directed to check vaccination status of people and ensure social distancing. BJP corporator from Colaba, Makarand Narwekar, said, “There is always a lot of floating population in south Mumbai, increasing the risk of Covid here. We have also urged all housing societies to follow Covid protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-covid-doubling-rate-surges-in-sobo-western-suburbs/articleshow/88483150.cms||---

They alleged that election officials were wasting time chatting over mobile phones or with each other and having snacks. Residents also alleged that they were checked three to five times before reaching EVM machines. A large rush of voters was witnessed at the polling station in Maloya but many people here complained about the slow election process. Shakuntla Devi, a resident of Maloya, said that she stood in the queue at around 10am but could come back only around 1pm. “We got only two hours from our employer to cast votes but due to the huge rush and slow process, we took three hours,” she complained. Another area resident, Ajay Shukla said when he reached outside the polling booth, police checked his voter card and then allowed him to enter. Later, police asked him to show the voter card and voter slip outside the booth again. Inside the polling booth, election officials verified their credentials again, he said. However, no such complaints were reported from sectors. People said they had to stand in queues for several hours but no potable water was provided at polling booths of Maloya and other booths in colonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-complain-of-slow-poll-process/articleshow/88481910.cms||---

The incident highlights lack of proper road connectivity to her village. Ambulance could not reach 30-year-old Majji Gangamma’s village because of the poor infrastructure. Not only four-wheelers, even two-wheelers cannot travel on the hilly, slippery pathway.  Locals travelled by foot through the thick woods to reach Mettapalem Junction from where she was shifted to the government hospital at S Kota in a vehicle. She is receiving treatment now.

This is a recent move of the state government and work on the samples has just started. Three scientists of IICB, Partha Chakrabarti, Saikat Chakrabarti and Siddik Sardar are working on the samples as part of the Insacog (Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genomics Sequencing Consortium) programme. IICB and NIBMG, Kalyani are responsible for sequencing viral genome in the state, the scientists said. There is RNA as genetic material and sequencfing means ti know the exact order of the arrangement of the nucleotides. “We will look for changes in this order or sequence. Particular changes or mutations can be identified and the strain of virus can be found including omicron,” explained Partha Chakrabarti. Once Omicron samples are isolated from the rest of the Covid samples with the help of this sequencing, it will be possible to isolate the patients and contact trace them. “That way we will be able to contain the spread to an extent,” Chakrabarti explained. “When more and more samples come in it will be possible for us to identify localities where the infection spread is high and we will be able to create micro containment zones to prevent the spread,” he added. “From what we have learnt already, the strain spreads fast but might not be as deadly as some other strains. We will need to study the cause for that too. We are happy that we have been chosen for this work because we will be able to contribute towards the latest challenge that the country is facing,” Chakrabarti said. However, no formal letter has been given to IICB for this genome sequencing by the state government but it is a default choice for any sequencing programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iicb-to-do-genome-sequencing-for-omicron/articleshow/88481914.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||Flyover work in Kolkata: Rabindra Sarani turns out of bounds||KOLKATA: Around 100m-150m of K K Tagore Street between its crossing with Rabindra Sarani and Kalakar Street will be shut from this weekend to facilitate the dismantling of Vivekananda Road flyover.  This shutdown would effectively bar vehicles from using Rabindra Sarani, and the diversions would increase the travel time of both buses and small vehicles headed for north Kolkata, a Lalbazar officer said. Joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey took stock of the traffic flow of the earmarked portion of KK Tagore Street after which the diversion plan was finalized. “Effectively, Rabindra Sarani will become out of bounds for vehicles though the road itself has not been shut. This will mean a longer diversion either through Jadulal Mullick Street or BK Pal Avenue,” said a senior traffic officer. The diversions might be in place for a long time as KMDA has reportedly sought six months to complete the work between Ganesh Talkies and Posta. “East-bound vehicles on K K Tagore Street will be diverted towards north either through Jadulal Mullick Street or Strand Road. The diverted traffic will take Nimtala Ghat Street to avail of C R Avenue or J M Avenue. East-bound traffic of Nimtala Ghat Street will also be diverted along B K Pal Avenue towards north to avail of Rabindra Sarani or J M Avenue. Buses on Strand Road from Mirbahar Ghat Street will take M G Road towards east to take Rabindra Sarani or C R Avenue. Mini buses on Strand Road from Mirbahar Ghat Street will also take M G Road to take Rabindra Sarani/C R Avenue,” stated the notification signed by police commissioner Soumen Mitra. The Jorabagan traffic guard said they were prepared for the diversions. “We will deploy extra personnel at each crossing. As the stretch is likely to be closed for a long time, we might change diversion plans, based on ground conditions,” said an ACP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/flyover-work-rabindra-sarani-turns-out-of-bounds/articleshow/88481936.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rhythm House among Rs 1,000 crore Nirav Modi assets to be auctioned||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has de-attached assets worth Rs 1,000 crore, including the building that once housed Rhythm House music store at Kala Ghoda, a Nepeansea Road flat, an office building in Kurla and jewellery, of diamantaire Nirav Modi on court order for auction to recover the Punjab National Bank (PNB) dues. The National Company Law Tribunal has appointed a liquidator to auction the properties. The ED has already released some of these properties and is in the process of giving possession of the rest, which includes a solar power plant in Ahmednagar district, to the bank for the auction. The agency has also handed over to PNB around Rs 6 crore it had recovered earlier after auctioning cars, paintings and other expensive items owned by the Modis Modi had allegedly defaulted Rs 6,500 crore PNB loan through fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoU) and the ED had confiscated assets worth Rs 2,600 crore in a money laundering case it is investigating against him. Modi is currently lodged in a jail in London, facing extradition to India. Some of Modi's properties that were not mortgaged with the bank, including his four lavish flats at Samudra Mahal building in Worli worth over Rs 100 crore, his Alibaug bungalow and windmills in Jaisalmer, will remain in ED's possession. The investigating agency is yet to get possession of his properties abroad, including in the US. It is alleged that Modi had bought many of these properties through the money he had defrauded from PNB. In 2017, he had bought the iconic Rhythm House building through his company Firestar Diamond from its owners, the Curmally family, for Rs 32 crore. His plan was to convert the heritage property into a high-end jewellery showroom. In 2018, after Modi fled the country with his family, the ED had attached Rhythm House building along with other properties and confiscated them after legal proceedings. Later, industrialist Anand Mahindra had proposed crowdfunding to save the iconic music store and revive it. He had also met ED officials to discuss the auction process. Even the BMC heritage committee had held a discussion to acquire the structure for public purposes, including music promotion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rhythm-house-among-rs-1k-cr-nimo-assets-to-be-auctioned/articleshow/88483505.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Delhi||No exemptions on admissions under Right to Education: Delhi government||NEW DELHI: Private schools cannot seek exemption from admitting children under 25% reserved category now, stating that there were no general category admissions this year, the directorate of education (DoE) has ordered. The schools had time till August 31, 2021 to seek exemption, according to the DoE. This was for the draw of lots conducted by the department in June. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many private schools earlier said that they would not be able to admit students from economically weaker section/disadvantaged (22% seats) and children with special needs (3% seats) categories as they have not had general category admissions. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had, however, said that irrespective of general category admissions, the schools had to admit EWS/DG category students. A private school association had moved court against the order. This year, the first draw of lots was conducted for around 33,000 seats. On December 3, the department conducted a second draw of lots for the 5,500 vacant seats. As 1,000 seats for EWS/DG and 5,000 seats for CWSN still remained vacant, the department had called for fresh applications and conducted another draw of lots on December 17. According to the latest DoE order, the private unaided recognised schools, which are running on the land allotted to them by DDA and other land-owning government agencies at a very minimal/concessional rate on a no-profit and no- loss basis and are situated at prime locations, cannot deny admission to the EWS/DG/CWSN selected eligible candidates at entry-level classes on the ground of lesser admission of general category children. “This will not only be an under-utilisation of the national assets but also deprive the children of the nearby locality of education as mandated under Section 12 (1)(C) of the RTE Act 2009,” the order stated. With the government providing reimbursement to the expenditure incurred on these students, the schools have no further right of denial, adds the order. The decision has been taken following parents’ requests, the Delhi government stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-exemptions-on-admissions-under-rte-govt/articleshow/88483168.cms||Shradha Chettri

Shri Pal Jain said that his wife fell down at the polling booth. “I was pushing the wheelchair and while trying to negotiate a step, the wheelchair lost balance and my wife fell down.” In another polling booth at the Sector 20 Govt College of Education, an elderly woman who could not find a wheelchair was seen gasping for breath. The SDM on duty said that only one wheelchair had been provided and it may have been in use. However, on investigation, no wheelchair was found on the premises. Neelam, (70) who came with her son Raman, was also gasping for breath and had to sit on the chair provided by a policewoman to rest as she had to walk nearly 200 metres to reach the polling booth from the gate. Ram Lakhan (70) found it hard to walk and took 25 minutes to reach the polling booth from the main gate of Sector 30. “They should have provided wheelchairs for us to travel inside the polling station,” he said.

---||Pune||Experts back mask upgrade; proper fitting holds the key||Pune: Members of the Maharashtra task force on Covid-19 have hinted at upgrading masks being used by citizens in view of experts’ advise on tweaking Covid-appropriate behaviour to higher standards to protect people from Omicron infection. Vinod Scaria, principal scientist at Delhi-based CSIR-IGIB, which is part of INSACOG, said in a recent tweet that a “right-fitting” mask was of utmost importance. “The unequivocal winner is without surprise a right-fitting FFP2 mask. Mean infection risk is one in 1,000 when the infected and susceptible wear a proper fitting FFP2 mask . Surgical masks fare much poorly (risk is one in 10). It might actually be a great idea to upgrade masks, in high-risk groups like immunocompromised, people with comorbodities etc, especially given the background that booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine are not in sight at least in India.” State Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “Covid is an airborne droplet virus. One has to use well-fitting masks to prevent catching the virus circulating in the air. Cloth masks do not prevent transmission. If an individual is wearing a cloth mask, s/he must additionally wear a surgical 3-ply mask so the cover against virus droplets is adequate.” Dr Joshi said the transmissibility of the ancestral strain from Wuhan was 3.5, which moved up to six for the Delta variant and over nine for Omicron. “Rapidity of transmission is very high for newer variants Delta and Omicron, which is why in healthcare and crowded settings, it’s very important to wear an N95 or FFP2 mask. The mask also should be well-fitted. Leaving gaps in the mask even if it’s covering the mouth and the nose can pose risk of transmission,” Dr Joshi said. Vasant Nagvekar, consultant, infectious diseases and another member of the Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, reiterated that a well-fitting mask covering one’s mouth and nose was the first line of defence against Covid-19. “With highly transmissible Omicron in the picture, old concepts about Covid may need tweaking. For instance, many of those with a prior Covid infection plus both vaccine dose are also contracting the infection. But the infection has been mild in such cases. So, people should not think that a past infection will make them completely immune. Two shots of Covid vaccine is important even in this set of people,” he said. Dr Maria Nigam, Mumbai based physician and Principal Founder PRANA said, “N95 or FFP2 masks prevent around 95% of airborne virus particles from entering the nasal airway. On the other hand, the blue surgical mask that most people wear is not good enough to block transmission effectively. Moreover, it is so loosely fitted, that it leaves enough scope for the virus to enter the nasal airway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-back-mask-upgrade-proper-fitting-holds-the-key/articleshow/88482415.cms||Neha Madaan

Kher, who reached a polling station in Sector 7 on Friday afternoon to cast her vote, said it was Congress and Bansal who brought the Jaypee company to the city that created the garbage mess. “Since there was no exit clause, BJP had to fight a legal battle to throw out the company,” she said. “The company failed to process the garbage, turning the site into a mountain of waste. When Bansal was the MP, he used to say officers do not listen to him. It was surprising that how officers were not listening to him, because officers listen to us and we got number of works done,” Kher claimed. “What did Bansal think before bringing the company to run the plant. The number of works took place in our regime were not carried out in the past. We have brought legacy mining to remove the dump. Since it is a huge dump, it will take some time,” Bansal said.

---||Pune||Maharashtra’s first dose coverage in 18-44 years age group 80%||PUNE: Only 80% beneficiaries in the 18-44 years age group have received the first shots of Covid vaccines till December 22, barely a week before the deadline to achieve 100% first dose vaccination in the state ends. The first dose coverage for this age group was below the state average in nearly 27 districts, according to the data updated till December 22. The delay in vaccinating those turning 18 years in both rural and urban areas had affected the total vaccination percentage in most districts, stated officials. Metro cities like Mumbai and Pune have achieved 100% first dose vaccination for the 18-44 years age group. Also, the coverage in Raigad, Palghar, Thane, Nagpur, Bhandara and Chandrapur is above the state average. It is below 80% in the other districts. “We have been urging the members of this age group to get vaccinated. But laxity has crept in among them. Even under the threat of Omicron, there is no urgency among them to get inoculated,” said a nodal officer, who conducts immunisation. The vaccination pace in the state had picked up at the start of the month because of the Omicron scare. But it gradually tapered after people learnt that the new variant’s symptoms were mild. Another health official said the parents should take the responsibility for the youth and ensure that they get vaccinated. “This age group is the travelling group and the numbers of vaccination should have been much more. The first dose vaccination in districts such as Nandurbar, Beed, Osmanabad and Latur is below 66%,” said the official. The Centre and the state health officials earlier stated that increased vaccination was a must after Omicron’s emergence.

Officials said some of these applications may either be duplicate or there could be more applications from kin. Over 50,000 applications are being scrutinised over multiple claims, said officials. Local authorities have been grappling with incomplete details, duplicate applications and incomplete forms, affecting disbursement of ex-gratia, officials said. The data will be verified with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal before disbursement of ex-gratia. All local authorities have been asked to double check and verify family members’ details and then disburse the amount. A senior state government official from the state disaster management authority said that multiple IDs linked to a single patient and multiple claimants have been uploaded by many local authorities. “The local teams will check on the claimants and if there are any issues, they can approach the district level grievance committee members. Only after due checks and agreement between claimants will the amount be disbursed,” said an official. Recently, Latur district collector BP Pruthviraj sought a report after it came to light that names of people still alive were on the list of covid deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-6l-ex-gratia-applications-against-1-4l-covid-deaths/articleshow/88482418.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He took five days to accomplish the feat. During the course of his attempt, he swam for an accumulated 28 hours and 40 minutes and was assisted by the escort boat while keeping himself floating the rest of the time. Vanmali claims to be the first Indian to do so. Overcoming challenges of the rough high sea and despite having painful rashes all over his body and running fever because of being stung by jelly fish, nothing could stop his spirit. “Nobody has attempted this before. It has given me impetus to pursue more such challenges,” said an elated Vanmali. His next attempt is to swim alone along the 413km sea route from Goa to Mumbai sometime in 2022. “I was moved by the cheering crowd gathered at the finishing line. Such a rousing reception was absolutely unexpected,” said Vanmali. His feat has been certified by the Swimming Association of Maharashtra and he was technically guided by Thane District Swimming Association. “It was quite amazing to see one of the prominent long-distance sea swimmers of the metropolitan region achieving such a milestone,” said Santosh Patil, vice president of the Swimming Association of Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/stung-by-jellyfish-running-a-fever-man-swims-for-five-days/articleshow/88483508.cms||B B Nayak

---||Delhi||Activists bat for rollback of NEP||New Delhi: Academicians and activists on Friday stressed on the need for taking a cue from the farmers’ movement to fight against the National Education Policy (NEP). Speaking at a public meeting held as part of the “Rollback NEP” movement started by All India Students Association (AISA), RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj Kumar Jha told students, “Don’t depend on Parliament. The farmers didn’t depend on it.” “If we carefully listen to the advertisement of mutual funds, it first narrates the benefit slowly, then suddenly starts talking quickly about risk. This 65-page NEP document is the mutual fund disclaimer document, where terms and conditions apply. NEP was supposed to have a national character. But it can, instead, be called a New Education Policy where you sell education,” said Jha, a professor at Delhi University. Historian S Irfan Habib said, “This government and NEP seek to saffronise our culture and daily lives. There needs to be a huge movement, like the one spearheaded by the farmers against the three contentious agri laws.” Another DU teacher, Nandita Narain, said, “The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) scheme, promotion of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) and graded autonomy will destroy the public education system. ABC states that students only need to collect 50% of the credits. With this, how does one check what students are learning. MOOC has failed in other countries. What will be the value of such an education system? We will only end up producing students with low intellectual levels.” JNU Teachers’ Association secretary Moushumi Basu stressed on the need of making education a political issue with students and teachers starting a movement like the farmers. Hindu College teacher Ratan Lal said NEP was a document loaded with “rhetoric”, which failed to talk about reservation and stressed on concepts such as digital online education. AISA announced the beginning of a 50-day campaign against NEP ending in “Parliament gherao” during the budget session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/activists-bat-for-rollback-of-nep/articleshow/88483180.cms||Shradha Chettri

Senior microbiologist Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, the state coordinator for genome sequencing, told TOI, “The maximum daily sample limit for Mumbai would be 300, while for Pune (including Pimpri Chinchwad), it would be 100. This means nearly 4,000 samples would be sent for genome sequencing in the 10-day period to assess the likelihood of the new variant’s community transmission.” Daily samples from Mumbai would be sent to Kasturba Central Laboratory for whole genome sequencing. Samples from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits would be sent to BJ Medical College. It would distribute the samples to other labs like Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) according to the requirement. Dr Karyakarte said a targeted accelerated sequencing carried out of the 909 Covid positive samples drawn from the community of infected patients without a travel history from Pune in November had found Delta and its sub-lineage behind the infection. National Centre for Disease Control has sent a directive to select metros to opt for community surveillance in the wake of Omicron’s emergence in the country. So far, only samples of international travellers were being sent for genome sequencing, the state health department officials said. An official source said, “It has been almost a month since Omicron’s detection in India. The government has proactively tested international travellers. Travellers from only high-risk countries were tracked initially. Those coming from other countries may have not been tracked, though they may have had layovers en route. Hence, the exercise to check if the variant has somehow slipped into the community.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/govt-to-send-4k-ve-swab-samples-for-genome-study/articleshow/88482426.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Allahabad||No chemotherapy needed for cancer cancer patients: AU prof and American scientist’s research||Prayagraj: Good news awaits the patients suffering from cancer as a team of 11 scientists, working in the field of cancer in the Cleveland Clinic of America and a researcher from Allahabad University, have found a way, following which chemo and radiation therapy will not be required to kill cancer cells. The work of the team, led by Professor of Cancer Biology at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr Yang Li and assisted by Munish Pandey, of the department of Biochemistry, AU, has been published in the prestigious journal ‘Oncogene by Nature’. The research bears significance as the work promises a treatment, using which the cancer patients will be saved from the side effects of chemo and radiation therapy. After its successful experiment on rats, efforts are now being intensified to apply it on the human body. “The study may give relief to cancer patient who undergo chemotherapy. Chemotherapy uses radiation and other drugs which has many side effects and evoke immune system that causes severe pain and allergic reaction. The team has earlier developed knockout mice for miR-21 and same was published in PNAS journal. MicroRNA-21 (small non-coding RNA) is one of the most abundant microRNAs in mammalian cells that regulates apoptosis (programme cell death) and oncogenic effects,” explains Pandey. According to Pandey, assistant professor at Department of Biochemistry, AU, “I have worked along with the American scientists and invented an alternative to chemotherapy and drugs in the treatment of cancer, which damage normal cells, along with cancer cells during cancer treatment. This successful experiment was done by a team of 11 scientists in the Cleveland Clinic of America, Dr Yang Li. Our team, while experimenting on mice, injected its anti-sense into mice to make miR-21 ineffective.” After this, it was found that the tumor formed in the body of the rat gradually became smaller. Some tumors have disappeared completely. This experiment went on for a year in America. However, it has not yet been used on the human body. After getting the success of the experiment on the first step, now the effort has been intensified to apply it on the human body, says Pandey. The expert further told that due to the disease of cancer, tumors are formed in the body. These tumors are eliminated through chemotherapy and drugs. In this process of treatment, along with cancer cells, normal cells are also damaged and has a negative effect on the body. The patient also suffers a lot. During research, the team found that microRNA i.e miR-21 kills normal cells. This makes cancer cells more effective. The group is further working on other programmed cell death mechanisms, microRNAs and Chemeric Antigen T Cell therapy (CAR-T) to tackle carcinogenicity in mice model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/no-chemotherapy-needed-for-cancer-cancer-patients-au-prof-and-american-scientists-research/articleshow/88482436.cms||---

I will speak on the questionnaire and the letter once the on-going litigation on the subject is over. As a leader of opposition, I have the right to express my views. The government has no right to ask my source of information,” Fadnavis said. Apparently, the then State Intelligence Commissioner Rashmi Shukla had tapped phones of certain persons after due process of law and after securing permission of the competent authority. According to reports, the information gathered during phone tapping pertained to transfer and posting of IPS and other police officials when senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh was the home minister. Since specific contents of the reports were leaked, the state home department had entrusted the probe to the cyber cell of Mumbai police. In fact, the cell had registered an offence against unknown persons after Fadnavis’ press conference in Nagpur. The state’s application for orders to the Centre to produce a pen drive which was given to the MHA by opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis was heard on Friday by a magistrate. State’s special public prosecutor Ajay Misar informed the court that the IO from cyber cell in the case registered against alleged leak of Rashmi Shukla’s phone tap report has sought answers from Fadnavis and he has informed that he will intimate when he is available. The Magistrate reserved the state’s plea for orders to be passed on December 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/phone-tap-leak-info-sought-from-fadnavis-in-mumbai/articleshow/88483186.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The CM would also address a public meeting at Lukarganj after laying the foundation for the houses. Talking to TOI on Friday, UP cabinet minister and BJP spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh said, “Yogiraj has brought an end to Samajwadi Party’s (SP) mafia and goondaraj, paving the way for Ramraj in Uttar Pradesh. This would be the first government construction on land freed from the mafia. It bears significance as the Yogi government wants to convey the message to the masses that days of mafiaraj in the state are over.” “Now, a popular CM is ruling the state and various lands, that have been freed from land mafia and criminals, would be used for the welfare of the poor, starting from this piece of land which is in my assembly constituency,” said Singh, who is also the MLA from City West, the assembly seat in which this piece of land is located. Before being elected as MP from Phulpur, Atiq Ahmed has been an MLA from this assembly seat for five terms in a row. Later, his winning streak was broken by Raju Pal, who contested on a Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) ticket. However, after Pal’s murder in 2005, Atiq’s younger brother had won the seat in the follow-up by-poll. In the last assembly elections in 2017, Singh had won the seat with a huge margin by defeating SP’s icha Singh. The cabinet minister further informed TOI that the CM had recently announced plans to build houses for the poor on land freed from the mafia. Following this, 75 houses would be built in Lukarganj on the land that was freed from Atiq Ahmed and his henchmen. Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) got this land free last year. On Thursday, the minister inspected the foundation stone laying site. He said that the CM will lay the foundation stone and inaugurate many more development works, address a public meeting and can also review the preparations for Magh Mela-2022. In October this year, PDA had prepared a blueprint for construction of houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana on the land freed from Atiq Ahmed. A tender has also been issued for the construction of this housing scheme. There is a plan to build houses for the poor on 1,731 square meters of land freed from the mafia. Altogether, 75 flats will be built in multi-storey buildings. Each flat will be built in an area of 34.09 square meters. A community hall and park will also be built in the residential scheme. This will be the second project of PDA under the PMAY. The first one has come up at Kalindipuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/cm-to-lay-foundation-of-pmay-homeson-land-freed-from-ex-mp-atiq-ahmed/articleshow/88482453.cms||---

This is the first highway intersection in the country where the trials have started and soon it will be extended to other highways too in coordination with the ministry of road transport and other relevant agencies,” said Piyush Tewari, the CEO of SaveLIFE Foundation, which is working with the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). He added, “With the help of the high-visibility paint and soft barricading at different points along the intersections, we have tried to make it safer for the population residing and using the intersection.” Different alerts and signage have been painted on the road along the intersection in bright colours so that they are easily visible to motorists and pedestrians. The road width has also been adjusted with the help of temporary blocks and barricading so that speeding can be reduced. Proper areas have been earmarked for bus parking for the convenience of passengers. MSRDC joint managing director Chandrakant Pulkundwar said they intended to use the same technique at other intersections along the highway too. “Karla Phata has a heavy pedestrian footfall with over 250 pedestrians using the intersection during the peak hour. Through these trials at Karla Phata we aim to test a methodology to treat high-risk intersections on national highways and use pre-emptive measures to reduce conflict and therefore any risk to human life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tactical-urbanism-trial-starts-on-old-mumbai-pune-highway/articleshow/88481975.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||‘Environmental science paper’s importance diluted’||New Delhi: Certain teachers of Delhi University, some of whom are also executive council (EC) members, have written to the vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh raising concerns over the National Education Policy (NEP) framework suggested for the environmental science paper. They said that the framework suggested reduced the importance of the paper and has been significantly diluted. The university has sent two alternative frameworks to the colleges seeking their feedback. As part of the changes under NEP, DU will be introducing four-year undergraduate programme. As part of the four-year programme, the curriculum structures are being revised. Explaining the change, Anupam Sunny, environmental science teacher at Satyawati College, said, “Till now, EVS was a compulsory paper, wherein some students would study in the first semester and others in the second semester. It was a four-credit course. Now, as per the framework, it is categorically written that it will be two credit courses. Reducing from four lectures to two lectures is not just going to dilute the course, but will also reduce workload with many ad hoc teachers losing their jobs.” As part of the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) implemented in the university in 2014, environmental science is a compulsory paper called the Ability Enhancement Compulsory Course (AECC).

While there is no official word on the spread of Omicron within the community, the daily tally in Mumbai continued to rise with 673 cases on Friday. The caseload has been growing at over 15% every day in the last few days. The Maharashtra tally grew proportionately to 1,410 cases on Friday, with 70% of the cases hailing from Mumbai and its surrounding municipalities (962). The daily test positivity rate in Mumbai climbed from 0.5% at the start of the week to 1.7% on Friday. However, Covid deaths continued to be low, with Maharashtra registering 12 deaths, including one in Mumbai. Meanwhile, the BMC on Friday said actor Kareena Kapoor-Khan’s genome sequencing report was negative for the Omicron variant. Kapoor also posted on Instagram that she had tested-negative for Covid-19 on Friday. While thanking her family and friends for their support through her quarantine, she also thanked the BMC for “being so amazing and prompt...” The number of active cases in Mumbai rose sharply to 3,227 from around half the number two weeks ago. The state has 8,426 active cases. However, the number of sealed buildings in Mumbai has remained steady at 14. Only 7% of the 15,299 Covid hospital beds in the city are occupied and the number of critical cases hasn’t increased (145) in weeks. “While the number of Covid patients has increased, hospitalization has certainly not,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali, who is a member of the state task force on Covid-19. Task force member Dr Rahul Pandit said the rise in cases in Mumbai is “very concerning”. He said there is an urgent need to ramp up genome sequencing and identify the strain that is dominant. “Our public health response will depend a lot on identifying the predominant strain. If it is Delta, we will expect a rise in hospitalisation in the next couple of weeks. If it is Omicron, then we need stricter policies with zero tolerance to no-mask and the need to adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbais-weekly-covid-19-case-tally-sees-a-37-rise/articleshow/88482464.cms||---
---||Patna||No relaxation in liquor law for outsiders: Nitish Kumar||PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday categorically dismissed the demand for some relaxations in the stringent anti-liquor law for those coming to Bihar from outside the state. Addressing a public meeting at Gopalganj as part of his ‘Samaj Sudhar Abhiyan’, the CM said many people have gone against him because he dared to enforce total prohibition in the state. “Some people say people coming to Bihar from outside should be given permission to drink liquor. Do people from the other places visit Bihar to drink liquor? Why should we give permission to the outsiders?” Nitish asked. Citing a WHO report on percentage of deaths due to alcohol across the world, Nitish said this report showed the ill effects of liquor across the globe. The CM also rejected suggestion by a section of people that an exemption be made on medical grounds for the alcoholics. “Some people argue that alcoholics will fall sick if they are not allowed to drink. I say you will fall sick only after you drink. If you not drink, you will not fall sick.” Nitish also dismissed his detractors’ contention about the alleged fall in tourist footfall in Bihar after the enforcement of total prohibition. “The tourist footfall will never be affected. In the last two years, the tourists avoided coming to the state due to Covid restrictions. Till 2019, the number of tourists visiting Bihar kept increasing even after the enforcement of prohibition. More than 2 crore tourists arrived in the state in a year,” Nitish said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-relaxation-in-liquor-law-for-outsiders-nitish/articleshow/88481227.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: NPAs up by 29% in second quarter of 2021-22||AHMEDABAD: Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) in banks across Gujarat increased by a whopping 29% in the second quarter of 2021-22, compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year, according to the latest report of the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) Gujarat. The 171st SLBC meeting was held in Ahmedabad on Friday. In the quarter that ended on September 30, bank NPAs grew from Rs 32,564 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 41,999 crore in 2021-22. This was driven by bad loans for non-priority sector advances, from Rs 16,163 crore to Rs 24,503 crore, a 51% increase. Non-priority sector loans are mainly extended to large corporate entities. Bankers and SLBC sources said that due to the moratorium period being extended last year, banks did not classify accounts as NPAs and therefore a massive surge has been witnessed in the second quarter this year. “Last year, no NPA accounts were classified by banks in accordance with RBI guidelines. Moreover, a lot of businessmen opted for the moratorium too. As a result of this, a massive spike in NPAs is witnessed in the second quarter this year,” said a well-placed source in the SLBC. Compared to the preceding quarter, gross NPAs declined marginally, signalling an economic recovery in the second quarter. Gross NPAs declined from Rs 43,487 crore in the June quarter. “The quarterly decline in NPAs signals a revival in the economy which was seen in the second quarter. As markets reopened fully and Covid-19 cases receded, production went up. Many businesses were able to repay loans because of which NPAs showed a marginal decline,” the source further went on to say. Industry players also say that raw material prices increased dramatically this year, which inflated working capital needs of businesses. “Working capital requirements almost doubled for the manufacturing industry due to the surge in raw material prices in the first two quarters of 2021-22. Companies thus faced difficulties in repaying loans. Moreover, bank norms for classifying an account as an NPA also became more stringent due to which overall NPAs increased,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/q2-npas-up-by-29-in-state/articleshow/88481988.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Pune||Pune: 4 assailants fire 8-10 rounds to kill wrestler near Chakan||PUNE: Four men fired multiple rounds of bullets to kill a 38-year-old wrestler in his SUV at Shel Pimpalgaon near Chakan, about 40 km from the city, around 10pm on Thursday. “Prima facie, old rivalry appears to be the motive behind the murder,” Pimpri Chinchwad deputy commissioner of police Manchak Ipper told TOI on Friday. “We have established the identity of the assailants and four of our teams are working on arresting them,” he said. Based on the recovery of empty rounds in and around the scene of crime, the police said the assailants fired at least eight to 10 rounds at the victim. “There were eight bullet wounds on Karale’s body. We have found 10 empty cartridges from the scene of crime. The manner in which the crime was executed indicated it to be a pre-planned act,” Ipper said. Karale was a wrestler and known as “Pahilwan” in Shel Pimpalgaon. He used to run a wrestling academy at Shel Pimpalgaon. This was the third murder in the Pimpri Chinchwad area in the past seven days. CCTV footage recovered by the police showed Karale opening the door of the sports utility vehicle (SUV) to take the driver’s seat. He was about to start his vehicle when the assailants came in a car and stopped behind his SUV. One of them hurriedly approached the SUV from the right side and fired at Karale from close range. Another assailant followed suit and fired a few more shots, as Karale tried to move to the adjacent seat. A third assailant then came from the left side of the SUV and fired shots, barely giving any chance to Karale to escape or survive, the police said. The entire incident occurred within a matter of a few seconds, as the assailants swiftly got back into their car and sped away. Karale’s friend and some people from the vicinity rushed to the spot and ran towards the car, but in vain. Karale was taken to a hospital at Chakan where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. Ipper cited investigation so far and said Karale had on Thursday night gone to meet a friend at the latter’s beer shop at Shel Pimpalgaon. “He was attacked, when he was leaving the shop. The assailants did not give him a chance to escape,” the officer said. On December 18, Yogesh Jagtap, a criminal on police records, was shot dead at Katepuram Chowk in Pimple Gurav. On Wednesday night, a 17-year-old college student from Talegaon Dabhade was brutally murdered by his cousin and neighbour.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Conservancy worker ends life after two years without pay||MUMBAI: The BMC on Friday suspended three staffers from its solid waste management department (SWM) after a conservancy worker allegedly died by suicide over non-payment of his salary for close to two years. The safai kamgar, Ramesh Parmar (27), had consumed poison on Tuesday at the office since he was under financial pressure, according to his uncle Pitambar. Ramesh was admitted to HBT Trauma Hospital in Jogeshwari, and later to Parel’s KEM Hospital, where he was declared dead late on Thursday. He is survived by his brother and mother. The BJP had demanded immediate suspension of officials responsible for delaying Ramesh’s payments. Safai kamgars also protested outside the P-South ward to protest Parmar’s death. The corporation has suspended Anita Naik (administrative officer), Sameera Manjrekar (head clerk) and Pankaj Khillare (clerk) from the SWM department in the P-South ward. TIMES VIEWThe death by suicide of a safai kamgar after he went without salary for close to 2 years is shocking. Safai kamgar unions have said that payment of several workers is pending. The BMC’s action to suspend three officials seems to be a case of too little too late. These workers have done their duty through the Covid-19 pandemic. The BMC must fast-track all pending dues and ensure that there is no delay in their appointment and payment.“Ramesh’s father, Jagdish, was also working as a conservancy worker in BMC. He died two years ago and was replaced by his son. Ramesh was given a job by the BMC on compassionate grounds, but for two years, they did not pay him for his work. He waited for two years in the hope that his salary would come, and finally he died,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. He said the civic body should also file a case of culpable homicide against the culprits. “At the same time, someone from the Parmar family should be given an immediate job and compensation of Rs50 lakh. Ramesh was also differently abled and his death is tragic,” Mishra said. Safai kamgar union members said that salaries of several workers were pending. “This is common and if they die on duty, their family members have to pay money to get a job on compassionate grounds. Many safai kamgars have not got their retirement benefits from the BMC. So there is massive corruption,” a union member said. “For the loss of life, as immediate financial assistance we have given Rs1 lakh to his family within 24 hours. Since Ramesh was unmarried, his brother will be absorbed in BMC. The appointment will be done within seven days. The pending dues and admissible claims on account of death of an employee while in service will be paid to his nearest family within 15 days. A detailed and formal report will be filed at earliest possible,” said Sangeeta Hasnale, deputy municipal commissioner (SWM).  “On investigation and inspection of the records of administrative officer up to the clerk concerned, it was noted that the payment papers of Ramesh were with the concerned clerk and head clerk for the last one-and-half years, and they had failed to put up the proposal for condoning delay in the date of appointment. The clerk and head clerk concerned have been suspended immediately, pending inquiry,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-conservancy-worker-ends-life-after-2yrs-without-pay/articleshow/88483204.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Ahmedabad||Bank deposits in Gujarat rise by 12.4%||AHMEDABAD: Even as the post pandemic economic recovery began from the second quarter, stalled capital expenditures led to steady growth in the bank deposits. According to the latest report by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) Gujarat, bank deposits in the state grew by almost Rs 1.01 lakh crore — from Rs 8.15 crore to Rs 9.17 crore, a rise of 12.4% — in the second quarter of 2021-22 in comparison to the same period of last year. Bank deposits in Gujarat stood at Rs 8.84 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2021-22. Banking sector experts attribute the surge in deposits to stalled capital expenditures and expansion plans. “Even as the economy began its recovery path after the second wave of Covid-19, capital expenditures on part of the industries as well as MSMEs were stalled. Industries did not widely execute expansion plans in the wake of uncertainty and concerns over the projected third wave. Moreover, people who faced unforeseen medical emergencies during the second wave began saving money in a big way. This primarily fuelled bank deposit growth even in the second quarter,” said a well-placed source in SLBC Gujarat. According experts, even as investors did invest into other asset classes, people also traded with a lot of caution and opted for avenues that deliver assured returns. This was one of the key reasons that propelled growth of bank deposits which remained consistent in the second quarter as well. Private sector banks showed the highest growth in deposits at Rs 52,729 crore during the said period. According to the SLBC report, private bank deposits surged from Rs 2.31 lakh crore in the September quarter of 2020-21 to Rs 2.83 lakh crore in the same period of 2021-22. On the other hand, public sector banks, including the State Bank Group showed a growth of Rs 42,860 crore during the same period — from Rs 5.29 lakh crore to Rs 5.72 lakh crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bank-deposits-in-gujarat-rise-by-12-4/articleshow/88481998.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Courts refuse stay on MSRTC workers’ dismissal notices||MUMBAI: Two industrial courts refused to give a stay on showcause notices for dismissals issued to MSRTC workers participating in the indefinite strike, an official said on Friday — the 58th day of the strike. The MSRTC management dismissed 182 more employees from duties on Friday as stringent action for participating in the indefinite stir. The official further said, “The MSRTC had issued showcause notices for dismissal to over 550 staffers in the past one week. Some of them approached the Latur and Yavatmal industrial courts to get a stay, but the courts rejected their plea.” Following this, the MSRTC on Friday dismissed more workers, and the total number of people sacked from service till now is 241. “The reasons for dismissal were genuine. They instigated workers to stay away from duties and obstructed those who wanted to come back to work,” said an official. As many as 2,369 employees had returned to work in two days (Wednesday and Thursday) after the MSRTC management set a new deadline of December 23, for revoking suspensions, dismissals, transfers and criminal charges against staffers. The number of employees on indefinite strike are now less than 69,000 as they await the next court hearing which is scheduled for January 5 next year. Officials said 2,796 staffers have been transferred while a total of 10,731 suspended from work till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-courts-refuse-stay-on-msrtc-workers-dismissal-notices/articleshow/88483536.cms||Somit Sen

Pawar also said that the striking ST employees should not insist on the demand of a merger. “If everyone starts demanding a merger with the state government, no government will be able to give it. We have given them a significant hike in salary, so they should leave their extreme stand. They should not end up like the mill workers,” said Pawar, adding that all attempts have been made to speak to the striking employees. He also said that the hike given in salaries was higher than in many neighbouring states. “This will also lead to a hike in ST bus tickets,” said Pawar. He was responding to criticism by the opposition on various issues — from the state’s failure to end the ST strike to the state reducing excise on liquor but not giving any relief towards the high fuel prices. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/any-further-relief-in-fuel-tax-will-lead-to-revenue-loss-of-rs-250cr/mth-dycm/articleshow/88483542.cms||---

This is apart from taking stern action against the respective municipal commissioners and gram panchayat secretaries in their respective jurisdictions. The district collector has recommended action against the municipal commissioners and gram panchayat secretaries who worked earlier, for failing to stop the illegal structures including some on the lake’s buffer zone. “The state government had created additional collector (local bodies) post two years ago mainly to monitor the functioning of both rural and urban local bodies in their respective districts. In each district hardly, there are two or three municipalities. Even those municipalities functioning are not being monitored by the additional collectors,” a senior official of municipal administration department said. The municipal administration is getting reports on unauthorized structures in all the 74 newly created municipalities especially merged villages in various municipalities. The commissioner of municipal administration has asked the commissioners to submit the report by the end of this month. Municipal minister K T Rama Rao is likely to hold a meeting with additional collectors and other municipal commissioners.

According to police, they want to remove encroachment from public place and also save homeless people from the bone-chilling cold. Since Tuesday, more than 50 people have been shifted to shelter homes. “We found that they were addicted to drugs and cleanliness was another issue. Winter was also approaching,” an officer said. The cops said a few cases of street crimes had been reported from CP in the past two-three months. A few anti-social elements were living among the homeless people and committing crimes, an officer added. Earlier, teams from the Connaught Place police station led by station house officer Upender Kumar shifted more than 300 beggars from the Hanuman Mandir area. On Tuesday, the drive started in the roundabouts of the gurdwara. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said they had rehabilitated a few homeless people with the help of NGOs. Another officer said a few beggars also volunteered to be shifted to nearby shelters. Police have told people not to encourage begging and go to shelters if they wanted to distribute food. An officer said the beggars were being provided with essential items like food and blankets with the help of NGOs. “We are also trying to offer education to their children and impart vocational training to the homeless,” he added. The cops are keeping a watch on the cleared areas so that the beggars couldn’t return to these places. “They have been living on the street for years and sometimes don’t want to leave it. So we have to counsel them with the help of NGOs,” an officer said. The head priest of the gurdwara said they were happy with the police efforts and would help the homeless people at shelters live a dignified life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-expand-clean-cp-drive-shift-50-homeless-to-shelters/articleshow/88483224.cms||Abhay Singh

The new rules came into effect Friday midnight. Meanwhile, BMC has issued an order banning all New Year events. It says "no NY celebration programme, gathering or party would be allowed in any closed or open space in Mumbai". The order will be effective December 25 midnight. The government's order states that not more than 100 guests will be allowed at weddings held in closed venues. At open air venues, the limit has been set at 250 guests or 25% of capacity, whichever is less. The same rules apply to social, political and religious events. Functions in closed auditoriums can operate at 50% of capacity if the seats are fixed and at 25% if they are movable. Open air venues will continue at 25% capacity. For sporting events, 25% of a venue's capacity will be allowed. Theatres, gyms, hotels to operate at 50% capacityOwing to the surge in Covid-19 cases and the threat of the Omicron variant looming large ahead of the festive season, the Maharashtra government on Friday issued fresh curbs in the state even as the BMC banned all new year events in Mumbai. The state order has placed restrictions on attendance in weddings, social, political and religious functions. Cinema halls, gyms, spas and restaurants will continue operating at 50% capacity. They have been asked to prominently declare their 100% capacity as per the licence. “The sudden surge in Covid cases is a cause for concern as a rise was expected from next month. Experts were of the view that steps should be taken to ensure there is no crowding, especially in public areas, during the festive season,” an official said. The government order also mentions that Christmas festivities will be regulated as per the state home department’s order on Thursday, capping the attendance in churches at 50% of capacity, banning stalls and shops outside churches, and observing social distancing, masking and the use of sanitisers. In its previous order on November 27, the state had allowed auditoriums, including wedding halls, to operate at 50% capacity and open-air venues at 25% capacity, without specifying the guest limit. As nearly four lakh weddings were expected in the state since November, officials pointed out the need to regulate the crowd. Officials said other restrictions like requirement of complete vaccination to access public transport and public places will continue to be in force. District disaster management authorities have been given the power to regulate activities that are not mentioned in the order as per their local situation. However, a public notice should be given before making stricter restrictions applicable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-theatres-gyms-hotels-to-operate-at-50-capacity/articleshow/88482491.cms||Bhavika Jain

Mevani’s Facebook live post shows him saying was is in Mandavdhar village of Gadhada taluka in Botad district for a public meeting when he received complaints from local dalit youths that untouchability is still being practised in the village. He says that members of SC and ST communities complained that they are not being allowed entry into a local temple, owners of food joints do not let them dine in and local barbershops deny them service. The videos show Mevani, accompanied by local dalit youths and a police sub-inspector going to a pau-bhaji eatery in the village, where he asks the owner if he doesn’t allow dalits to eat at the joint, to which the owner says that is correct and that other villagers do not allow him to do so. The video later shows Mevani and dalit villagers along with police officials going to a local temple, where he asks a monk whether local dalit community members’ complaints of not being allowed entry into the temple are correct. The monk is heard saying that he is just visiting the temple and has no knowledge about the practices there. Mevani is seen requesting police officials to provide security to local dalit community members in case there is retaliation from other villagers. “We also visited a soda shop where the owner accepted that he keeps separate glasses for dalit community members. I have had a word with Additional DG SC, ST Cell Vikas Sahay and sent him the videos,” Mevani said. “I am aware of MLA Mevani’s visit to Mandavdhar village and have instructed local officials to take action if they receive complaints from dalit community members,” Harshad Mehta, SP, Botad told TOI. Mevani said that he asked the locals to lodge complaints if they continue facing discrimination or if other villagers subject them to reprisals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/via-fb-live-mevani-exposes-discrimination-in-botad-village/articleshow/88482011.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC dismisses Reliance Industries Ltd plea against I-T dept’s order||Mumbai: In no relief to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Bombay high court dismissed its petition challenging a January decision of the income-tax department making them ineligible to resolve pending tax disputes under the Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Tak (DTVSV) Act. The I-T department said since an FIR was registered against the company under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, it had withdrawn its letter of October 2020 which had allowed RIL to take benefit of the tax vivad law. The company had filed 27 applications under it. The DTVSV Act provides paym-ent without additional interest and also immunity from prosecution in certain cases. The HC bench of Justices K R Shriram and Amit Borkar, in its order on Thursday, said: “Both proceedings are cases where prosecution was instituted since in both cases an FIR had been duly lodged. Both cases charge petitioner as having conspired to commit offences under the PC Act, thus casting a shadow on the monies sought to be offered to tax”. Holding that there is “no merit in the petition”, the bench dismissed it. The HC said the DTVSV Act is for the benefit of both the assessee and the department to reduce pending cases and ensure timely revenue for government. It is meant to apply only for money acquired legally and Section 9 is to ensure that the Act is “not utilised for regularising or seeking benefits qua tainted monies or monies which fall under the shadow of a socio-economic offence”, it said. Senior counsel Vikram Nankani, with advocate Raj Darak, for RIL, said the company desired to avail benefit of DTVSV Act for pending I-T litigations before various appellate levels. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for I-T department, contended that the intention of the Act is to exclude persons against whom prosecution is instituted for socio-economic offences, and that it is not meant for legitimising proceeds of crime by payment of tax on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-dismisses-ril-plea-against-i-t-depts-order/articleshow/88483550.cms||Swati Deshpande

The report will be finalised at the next board meeting. Professor Virendra Sethi from IIT-B’s environmental science and engineering department made a detailed presentation of the ‘Source apportionment study’ for air quality in Vasco to GSPCB. Source appropriation tracks down the sources as well as measures the amount of ambient air pollution. The state has witnessed several agitations due to air pollution in the port town and this report is expected to ascertain the exact cause of pollution. The technology institute had been tasked with conducting a source appropriation study following allegations of coal pollution at Vasco. The first phase of the report had stated that coal was not the only mineral responsible for the air pollution in the area. A senior GSPCB official had said that while the interim report hadn’t pinpointed the reason for pollution in Vasco, the second phase would provide details about the exact source of pollution. The first phase began in April 2017 and was completed in May 2018. Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) is bearing the cost of the entire study which has been pegged at over Rs94 lakh, a senior GSPCB official said. The study included aspects such as identification of sampling locations, monitoring ambient air quality, and locating pollution sources. These were conducted as per guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/iit-bombay-submits-vasco-pollution-source-study/articleshow/88482532.cms||---

Such offers are largely posted on social media. The cybercops also warned people not to click unsolicited links, particularly those promising you to be the lucky one to win an offer, as they may end up compromising their mobile and lose money. The cyber police issued the warning after noticing the fraud trend witnessed in the last few years in the month of December. A bulk of cases of online fraud have been reported during the year-end festive season when people opt to place online orders without verifying the contact numbers they find on the internet. Cybercops have advised people not to blindly trust the contact numbers or information about hotels, restaurants, or wine shops found on the internet. “One should not share their bank card details, instead, while making any online order, the people should insist on payment on delivery,” cybercops said. The people should refrain from downloading AnyDesk or Quick Support (remote access app) or QR Code on the suggestions of unknown persons, the cyber police said. –V Narayan||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ny-eve-alert-cyber-police-warn-shoppers-about-e-cheats-in-mumbai/articleshow/88482524.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Factionalism comes to fore in U’khand Cong: Party leader heckled by rival faction members, video goes viral||Dehradun: Even as senior party leaders like Harish Rawat and leader of opposition, Pritam Singh were in Delhi on Friday to meet the party high command, a party leader, Rajendra Shah – who had held minister-level rank in the previous Congress government in the state, was heckled by rival faction members at the Congress state headquarters at Rajpur Road on Friday morning. A video clip of the incident shows some party members repeatedly warning Shah to not speak ill of the former CM. A few of them can even be seen slapping Shah. A few senior leaders like the party's general secretary, Mathura Dutt Joshi, intervened to save the situation. Notably, Shah was earlier regarded close to Rawat. In his term as the chief minister, Harish Rawat had made Shah a minister of state in the minor irrigation department. Shah is later believed to have switched allegiance to Pritam Singh, with whom Rawat is at odds. Shah claimed that he was threatened on Thursday as well by two close associates of Harish Rawat. “On Friday morning, a group of party members attacked me. If not for the intervention of other party members, they would have thrashed me,” he told TOI. He added, “Some party members were criticising our state in-charge and I just pointed out that their conduct was not right. Since taking charge, Devender Yadav has remained active in the field. In fact, it is for the first time that a state in-charge is working at the ground level. I also want to clarify that I haven’t said anything against the former CM. He is a respected and senior party leader.” Meanwhile, Mathura Dutt Joshi downplayed Friday’s incident saying, “There was a minor issue and we will sort it out. It is an internal matter of the party and we will look into it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/factionalism-comes-to-fore-in-ukhand-cong-party-leader-heckled-by-rival-faction-members-video-goes-viral/articleshow/88481320.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Delhi||Delhi may get its 13th city forest in January||NEW DELHI: Free for the weekend and want to connect with nature? There’s news for you: the capital is expected to get a new city forest in northwest Delhi’s Mukhmelpur by January. A forest land that was occupied by cattle owners for the past few decades is being restored and developed into a green zone. According to a forest official, the encroachments were removed in August last year and the waste was cleared to develop the area into a city forest. “The forest has been created by reclaiming the land from encroachers. For years, waste was being dumped here. A majority of the work is now complete and it is expected to be thrown open to the public in January 2022,” an official said. Spread over 3.86 acres, the city forest will include a butterfly garden, a waterbody, sitting huts, information boards to identify trees and medicinal herbs and a grass bank for people to sit. Though native trees, including peepal, jamun, neem and jacranda, are mostly present here, the city forest will have shrubs and smaller plants too. Explaining the importance of a city forest, Vipul Pandey, deputy conservator of forests (north division), said: “The forest acts as a green lung for the city and helps create awareness about the green cover. It also serves as an habitat improvement for birds and butterflies. The waterbody, which has been developed inside the city forest, will help in groundwater recharge.” Delhi already has 12 city forests while four others were announced at Marmurpur in Narela, Ayanagar, Jaunapur and Deramandi. “The work on developing the four city forests is under way. Apart from natural forests, such initiatives in urban areas are important for the ecosystem’s restoration. It helps in the revival of flaura and fauna,” another official added. A forest official said the green cover of Delhi had been witnessing a steady growth in the last one decade. It currently stands at 21.9% (324.4 sq m), while it was 20.6% (308.4 sq m) in 2017, 20.2% (299.9 sq m) in 2015 and 20% (297.8 sq m) in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-may-get-its-13th-city-forest-in-january/articleshow/88483244.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Hyderabad||Will dump unprocured paddy at India Gate, says Telangana minister Vemula Prashanth||HYDERABAD: Telangana minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy said the government would dump 60 lakh MT of paddy procured from the farmers in the current Kharif season at India Gate in Delhi if the Centre fails to give a written assurance that they would buy the 60 lakh MTs of paddy. He said the state government has completed the procurement of the 60 lakh MT paddy in the state and earlier Union minister Piyush Goyal said the Centre would buy 60 lakh MT of paddy. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has also earlier announced that the state government would dump the procured paddy at India Gate and state BJP office in Telangana if there was no clarity from the Centre on paddy procurement. “We (ministers) asked for appointment of Union minister for public distribution Piyush Goyal through resident commissioner of Telangana government. There was no response from the minister. We strongly condemn the attitude of the minister towards Telangana government,” Telangana roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashant Reddy told media in Delhi. He said the Centre had not increased the godowns to store the procured paddy but gave an oral assurance on the floor of the Parliament that it will buy the 60 lakh MT paddy. Another state minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao alleged that the state BJP leader Bandi Sanjay and Union minister G Kishan Reddy were influencing the Centre on written assurance to the state government on paddy procurement issue. “It is most unfortunate that the leaders were trying to create hurdles and were politicising the issue that pertains to farmers instead of cooperating with the state government. For the sake of farmers, we have been camping in Delhi for the past one week to get a written assurance,” Dayakar Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/will-dump-unprocured-paddy-at-india-gate-min/articleshow/88482028.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: IMA urges PM to intervene in crisis over PG admissions||Mumbai: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has now sought the prime minister’s intervention in resolving the ongoing postgraduate medical admission crisis and expediting the process. With an entire batch of resident doctors missing from hospitals across the country, it will be difficult to handle the impending third wave, the IMA said. The PG counselling process has been delayed by over eight months owing to an ongoing court case filed against the Central government's notification applying the OBC and EWS reservations to the all-India quota seats. Resident doctors in a few states have struck work in protest. In the statement issued by the association, it mentioned that the second wave was handled by limited doctors due to the delay in conducting the NEET-PG exams. The entrance exam was conducted in September this year instead of January. “However, due to legal impediments now the counselling is withheld resulting in a shortage of 45,000 doctors in the frontline,” the association mentioned. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ima-urges-pm-to-intervene-in-crisis-over-pg-admissions/articleshow/88483563.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Father, daughter attacked in road rage near Pothencode||Thiruvananthapuram: Before shockwaves created by the gruesome gangland murder at Pothencode subsided, the place witnessed yet another episode of violence on Wednesday night. This time, it was a father-daughter duo that faced a rude assault at the hands of a group of violent men on a public road. Shaikh Mohammed alias Shah of Venjarammood and his 17-year-old daughter are the victims of the assault. They were going from Kazhakootam to Venjaramoodu direction when the gang intercepted their car near Kattayikonam and attacked them. The police have registered a case and launched a probe to trace the suspects. Visuals from surveillance cameras nearby and those captured on mobile phone by his daughter showed the assailants reaching inside the vehicle through the window and attacking the duo. Speaking to TOI, Shaikh Mohammed said that the attack was related to road rage. He was returning home after dropping his wife at her workplace for night shift when he faced the attack. ‘’Their car was parked in front of a restaurant beside the road. Our vehicle reached the spot as they were taking a U- turn. They signalled us to go in reverse to let them pass. Though I tried, I could not move faster as there were other vehicles behind me. Suddenly, they came out of their vehicle and started thrashing us,’’ Mohammed said. The assailants did not spare his daughter either. She managed to get out of the car and dial the emergency number of police. The cops reached the spot within a few minutes. But, the assailants fled from the scene before the police arrived. Mohammed added that the assailants appeared to be in an inebriated state. While the police were very supportive as they comforted his daughter, who was shaken by the attack, he was disappointed by the response of the public, who stood silently and watched the violence. ‘’My son, who is a class VI student, was also with us just moments before the attack happened. We dropped him off at the residence of his friend, who was celebrating his birthday, at Chenkottukonam,’’ Mohammed said, adding that the child would have been traumatised had he had witnessed the violence. Pothencode station house officer inspector K Syam said that three out of four suspects have been identified. They are Faisal, Noufal and Ashique. ‘’Faisal is a known criminal, who was involved in a robbery case reported near Mangalapuram early this year,’’ the inspector said. The latest crime goes on to show that the special drive being conducted by the police to curb the criminal activities in the district have little effect on the miscreants. The special drive was launched a week ago following the murder of Sudheesh at Kalloor near Pothencode. As part of the special drive, the police had executed numerous arrests of wanted criminals and preventive detentions in the past one week. Raids are also being conducted frequently at sensitive locations to check activities related to ganja and drug peddling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/father-daughter-attacked-in-road-rage-near-pothencode/articleshow/88461072.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Infrastructure firm MD held for Rs 53 crore bank fraud in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Economic offences wing (EOW) sleuths of Cyberabad on Friday arrested K Santosh Reddy (36), managing director of an infrastructure company, for allegedly cheating Union Bank of India of Rs 53 crore by resorting to forgery of bank guarantees. Police said Santosh, MD of Kompass Infrastructures Private Ltd, duped the bank by exceeding his credit limit using forged bank guarantees. Two cases were registered against the company and its four directors, including Santosh, in Cyberabad. “Santosh along with his associates has cheated the bank to the tune of Rs 53 crore,” Cyberabad police said. Police arrested Santosh, who has been on the run, from a house in Jubilee Hills. On July 8, S Prakash Babu, AGM of Union Bank of India, lodged a complaint with Madhapur police stating that directors of Kompass Infrastructures — Santosh, N Srinivas, K Gopal and S Surender Reddy — obtained bank guarantees from UBI’s Kondapur branch for ₹53 crore through 39 transactions in favour of various beneficiaries like Hella Infra Market Ltd, HPCL and Infinity Projects. According to police, the company of the accused undertakes civil contract works. To procure materials from different supplier companies, the accused have been taking bank guarantees from UBI. “Based on the bank guarantees, eight companies supplied materials to Santosh. To obtain bank guarantees from the bank, Santosh kept properties of one of the directors as security. He was eligible to take bank guarantee for Rs 15 crore as per the norms,” police said. “After reaching ₹15 crore limit, the accused has to either close the old bank guarantee or renew it to get a new bank guarantee in its place. In order to get material from different companies beyond the sanction limit prescribed by the bank, Santosh forged bank guarantees and submitted to the companies as if they were issued by the bank. He also returned the original bank guarantees to the banks with the company’s forged letters as if they were returned by the companies to obtain new bank guarantees,” police alleged. During verification by bank officials, fraud came to light. Srinivas was issued notice under section 41(A) of CrPC on the confession of Santosh. Two accused are absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/infra-firm-md-held-for-rs-53-crore-bank-fraud/articleshow/88482038.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Anoop, 39, of Kallippara near Palode is the accused. He is a civil police officer attached to Valiyamala police station under rural police district. According to the police, the alleged crime was committed when Anoop worked as a CPO at Vithura police station two years ago. He is accused of sexually harassing a 16-year-old girl. The complainant is the daughter of a couple who had approached the Vithura police two years ago over marital problems. While the couple got separated, Anoop maintained a close relationship with the mother of the complainant. He even became a regular visitor to her house. It was during these visits, the accused tried to sexually harass the girl. The Vithura police registered a case four months ago after the girl, who is currently aged 18, gave her statement in this regard before the Child Welfare Committee officials. The mother of the girl was also booked as the second accused in the case as she mentioned in her complaint that the latter did not take any action despite being informed about the sexual advances of the accused. Anoop's anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the POCSO court here following which he approached the state High Court. The High Court directed him to surrender before the investigation officer. Though he filed his bail plea, special public prosecutor Kattayikonam J K Ajith Prasad strongly opposed the bail. Judge K V Rajaneesh admitted the prosecutor's contentions and remanded him in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cop-in-judicial-custody-for-sexually-harassing-minor/articleshow/88461087.cms||---

The notice is issued under the Environment Protection Act, 1972. The resort, located on plot number 446, is now owned by one Sadanand Kadam. The building, road and other structures fall within 200 metres of the high tide zone, which qualifies as no-development zone under CRZ-III, as per the notice issued by Dr H Kharkwal, additional director, CRZ. State transport minister Anil Parab had purchased the agricultural land of 4,200 square metres from Vibhas Sathe in 2017, but had registered it on June 19, 2019. Parab later sold the property to Sadanad Kadam, a Kandivli (E) resident in December 2020. The ministry has asked the resort owners as to why it shall not order demolition of all the constructions and remove roads which are prohibited as per CRZ regulations. The owners have to respond within 15 days. The action follows complaints by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya. The 7/12 land extracts do not have minister Anil Parab’s name. Hence previous owner Vibhas Sathe, along with current owner Sadanand Kadam, was served with the notice by Ratnagiri revenue authorities. The NA permission was issued to Sadanand Kadam by then sub-divisional officer in Dapoli in September 2019. “Town planning report as per government issued guidelines has not been obtained. Hence, the NA permission was revoked and accordingly a report was submitted to our higher authorities,” said Sanjay Shinde, additional collector, Ratnagiri.  Kadam had moved the civil court in Khed and obtained a ‘status quo’ on the said property on July 19, 2021. The issue is subjudice but a fresh row has now erupted over the notice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-parabs-former-resort-gets-notice-over-crz-breach/articleshow/88483259.cms||Umesh K Parida
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Finance wing recommends revenue recovery from PwC||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A report by the finance inspection wing of the government on Kerala State IT Infrastructure Ltd (KSITL) has recommended the recovery of Rs 16.15 lakh from the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) through which the accused in the gold smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, was appointed in KSITL’s Space Park project. The report, accessed by TOI, said that if the recovery is not possible from PwC, the amount should be recovered from IAS officer and former IT secretary M Sivasankar, KSITL MD Jayasankar Prasad and space park special officer Santhosh Kurup as it was their deliberate and planned move that had resulted in the appointment of Swapna Suresh who did not even have the required qualifications to be appointed as junior consultant in Space Park. The report said that Rs 19.06 lakh was given to PwC for paying her salary and after deducting GST, Rs 16.15 lakh should be recovered. The report further said that KSITL should immediately put an end to appointments via consultants and must depend on employment exchanges for recruitment in unavoidable circumstances. It also added that the administrative department of KSITL, which is the IT department, should ensure that appointments through project management units (PMUs) are done only after preparing a list of three or more candidates (with requisite qualifications) and choosing the right candidate after an interview by a selection committee. PwC was a PMU for Space Park project. Last year, a report by the then chief secretary Vishwas Mehta and additional chief secretary (finance) Rajesh Kumar Singh had found that Swapna had approached the special officer for Space Park in August 2019, with a reference from the then IT secretary M Sivasankar, while still working as a secretary to the consul general of UAE. Also, MD of KSITL as well as the special officer for Space Park had cross-checked the reference of Swapna with Sivasankar and confirmed it. The committee had also reported that the overall sequence of events show that Sivasankar had a hand in appointing a person with dubious credentials to a post in Space Park. The committee had then recommended blacklisting PwC for two years from participating in any projects by the state IT department, on the basis of which the government had issued an order banning the organization. However, after PwC challenged the government decision in the high court, the court stayed the government order. The FIW report on KSITL also found serious lapses in appointments in the organization. It said that while there were only six recognized posts and 15 other posts that were transferred from various other organisations in KSITL, 62 persons were appointed in KSITL from 2009 to 2020. Of the 62, no details regarding the notification of the posts and the educational qualifications of 14 employees are available with KSITL, which is a serious lapse. Though the report was prepared and furnished to the department early this year, no action was taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/finance-wing-recommends-revenue-recovery-from-pwc/articleshow/88481364.cms||KP Saikiran

With no other option left, he has resigned from the cabinet.” Harak Singh Rawat was recently in Delhi and after the Congress gave full control of poll campaign to Harish Rawat, there had been rumours of the Kotdwar politician, who has somehow managed to remain in government irrespective of which party came to power, joining the Congress or another political outfit. Meanwhile, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami denied talking to the media when asked about the resignation and left the secretariat in a hurry soon after the cabinet meet. Government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal when queried, said, “Harak Singh Rawat was annoyed over the establishment of Kotdwar medical college.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Faithful ring in Christmas with early mass amid Covid-19 protocol||MUMBAI: Praying for a swift end to the Covid pandemic, the Christian community began Christmas celebrations with Vigil mass Friday evening. Churches advanced midnight mass timings by two to four hours owing to Covid protocol. Archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias delivered mass at 8pm at Holy Name Cathedral instead of the usual hour of 10.30pm. Bishop John Rodrigues of Mt Mary Basilica permitted 80 people each for multiple masses given limited indoor capacity. However, those who sought ‘darshan’ of the holy statue were allowed to file past. Fr Clarence Fonseca, parish priest of St Andrew’s Church, Bandra, had a thought-provoking message for the people. “It is time to remove the Covid within us that isolates us from others. Let us rid ourselves of our inner lockdown baggage and bring the love of Jesus into our hearts and lives,” he said. The beautiful crib at Victoria Church, Mahim, created by Fr Rocky Banz and his team drew admiring glances. He said, “The theme for this Christmas is ‘Journey together to Jesus: Synodal Church’. These words are put at the crib which we hope will inspire all of us to reflect on communion, participation and mission.” Fr Hubert Goveas of St Jude’s Church in Malad (East) said, “The theme our parish took this year is ‘Put Christ back into Christmas’. We have urged our parishioners to make cribs at home, put up a star and make sweets at home. Our SVP has already distributed gift hampers well in advance. The youth made the Parish crib and the choir sang carols before Christmas mass.” Fr Dennis Gonsalves, parish priest of Gloria Church, Byculla, scheduled mass at 9pm. He said, “We are careful to restrict numbers owing to the threat by Omicron.” Members of Infant Jesus Church, Koparkhairane, distributed blankets and food kits to the homeless in Navi Mumbai under their theme ‘Blankets for Baby Jesus’. “They also spent a day at Jyothi’s Care centre, a home for mentally challenged people in Taloja,” said parish priest Davis Tharakan. For the second year, the 56-year-old Prabhu Yeshu Janmotsav celebrations at Chowpatty will move online Saturday. Organiser Abraham Mathai said the event draws 25,000 spectators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-faithful-ring-in-christmas-with-early-mass-amid-covid-protocol/articleshow/88483281.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Special 25 to crack down on pervs on Park Street||KOLKATA: Kolkata Police will bank on its Special 25, comprising members of the Winners unit (the specialized women unit of Kolkata Police, the detective department and south division), to tackle harassment and molestation in Park Street. These woman cops, who will be posted in Park Street, will be in uniform as well as plainclothes and will act as the the first respondents on Christmas in case anyone lodges a complaint. Times ViewRevellers should keep in mind all the safety and Covid protocols in place. The police force is stretched to its limits in the best of times; with Covid still around, cops will have an extra tough time. The least we can do is be responsible. Maintaining Covid protocols and avoiding drinking and driving should be on the priority list."The idea is to make women comfortable. If they can confide in our trained female team, we can tackle the culprits and arrest them. But they will also be used to detect those who might target women in the crowd," said an additional commissioner. According to cops, the safety of women — like all other years — will be on top of the agenda this year too along with anti-street crime measures and traffic management. Kolkata Police has urged revellers to use ‘Bondhu’ app to help women facing harassment on road or the elderly in need of immediate medical assistance. Besides, 27 PCR cars and 40 two-wheelers with women personnel will patrol south Kolkata areas, including the Park Street-Alipore zoo zone on Saturday. According to joint CP (headquarter) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar, these female cops will be part of the 3,000 strong team that will hit the Park Street-Maidan zone from 9am on Christmas. Cops said they had not yet decided when to shut Park Street. "It will depend entirely on the crowd flow," said a DCP. "Park Street witnessed a huge footfall on Friday evening and night and it is set to increase on a holiday. We have so far divided Park Street into zones and put a DCP in charge of each zone. There will be several female DCPs too. A total of 65 ACPs and inspectors will be on guard to provide security in Park Street. A temporary control room has been opened there,” said a Lalbazar source. Among the most vulnerable places that will be heavily manned are the Park Street-Camac Street crossing, Mullickbazar crossing, RB Avenue and Pratapaditya Road crossing. The cops have made Park Street “pedestrian friendly” in a way that people will have enough space to walk down the pavement. Special arrangements have also been made for tourist spots like Victoria Memorial and Alipore zoo, parks, shopping malls and Metro stations. Traffic police has already challaned over 5,000 motorists and two-wheeler riders in the run-up to Christmas Eve. "We had challaned 2,944 people on Thursday. The numbers crossed 2,500 by 9pm on Friday. Though there will be no night nakas, we have the special Christmas night nakas. We expect the numbers to go up further," said an officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said that on Thursday alone, 23 were caught driving drunk. Another 208 were fined for driving dangerously, around 373 were found to disobey traffic signals and 129 others were found not wearing helmets. There have been 185 cases of drink-driving in the city this month alone. Under 184/184 MVA (dangerous driving), total prosecution registered till December 22 stands at 3,922. There have been 206 temporary driving licence suspensions on this count. Under 218(2) WBMVR/184 MVA (using mobile phone while driving), the total prosecution stood at 529. “We have recommended driving licence suspension in 277 cases," said Sinha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/spl-25-to-crack-down-on-pervs-on-park-st/articleshow/88481441.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CM yet to decide on eviction notices for Patole, Deshmukh||Mumbai: The general administration department (GAD) led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is facing a piquant situation over issuing eviction notices to former speaker Nana Patole and former home minister Anil Deshmukh for overstaying in government accommodation.A senior official said it is for the CM to take a call on the course of action. “The GAD will have to prepare a note on the present status and put it up before the CM for directions. It will be a political decision, since both Patole and Deshmukh belong to the ruling MVA alliance,” the official said. Congress leader Nana Patole was unanimously elected as the speaker of the legislative assembly on December 1, 2019. He was allotted a bungalow across Mantralaya. Deshmukh took over the reins of the home department in March 2021 and was allotted a bungalow adjacent to Varsha, the official residence of the CM at Malabar Hill. Patole quit the post on February 5, 2021 and took over the reins of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC), while Deshmukh had to resign on April 5, 2021 after the then Mumbai police commissioner Parambir Singh levelled charges of corruption against him. Parambir had written a letter to the CM saying Deshmukh had set a target of mobilizing Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. Deshmukh was arrested and is currently in judicial custody.  Patole told TOI, “I am yet to vacate the bungalow. I have asked the government to allot the said bungalow to Congress for its office as has been done in case of Shiv Sena.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cm-yet-to-decide-on-eviction-notices-for-patole-deshmukh/articleshow/88483299.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Education institutes go for hybrid Christmas celebrations||By: Poulami Roy KOLKATA: Even though schools and colleges are open, most have not called students on campus to celebrate Christmas this year. Educational institutions have, instead, tweaked their celebrations to accommodate pandemic protocols. Scottish Church Collegiate School has sent cake slices to students while St Lawrence and St Xavier’s have sent video messages. Some schools, however, held on-campus celebrations with Covid restrictions. Ruby Park Public School, Taratala, for instance, organised a Christmas gathering with students from nursery to Class X. Two years ago, before the pandemic, students of St Lawrence School celebrated Christmas in school, followed by the year-end programme, where the main attractions were the carols. “This year, we have prepared a video and sent it to the students. We had called very few students and made a video in the school, and sent it to all the students,” said principal Fr Francis J Keepuram. St Xavier’s Collegiate School had sent blessings in a video message to students. A Christmas programme was organized at Paikhala and Raghavpur by the St Xavier’s College (Calcutta) Alumni Association (SXCCAA) where 110 students participated. DPS Joka arranged Christmas celebrations in two phases — on campus and in the virtual mode. Scottish Church Collegiate School and Scottish Church College have decorated the buildings with colourful lights, but students have been asked to stay home. The college organised a Christmas programme on December 14, which was available to students online while the school has gifted sliced cake to students as a Christmas gift. “We have missed our students. But due to the threat of Omicron, students were not asked to take part in the Christmas celebrations. We have distributed cake slices with the annual result,” said principal Bibhas Sanyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/education-institutes-go-for-hybrid-christmas-celebrations/articleshow/88481449.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Harish Rawat given ‘free hand’ to lead Uttarakhand Congress in polls||DEHRADUN: Two days after former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat posted a series of tweet expressing his displeasure with the functioning of the party organisation of the state Congress, he was given the green signal by the party high command to lead the election campaign. On Friday, Harish Rawat and a few other Uttarakhand Congress leaders, including state party president Ganesh Godiyal, leader of opposition Pritam Singh, state in-charge Devender Yadav, MLA Qazi Nizamuddin and Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Tamta, met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. During the meeting, it was decided that Rawat would lead the party’s poll campaign in the state and a decision on the name of the chief minister would be taken only when the party wins the elections. Uttarakhand Congress president Ganesh Godiyal was also given the go-ahead to announce his team in the next few days. Separately, it was decided that Congress would appoint a senior member as the central observer to ensure that differences between party leaders are resolved amicably. According to TOI sources, Rajashan CM Ashok Gehlot is likely to be made the party’s central observer for Uttarakhand. Notably, Rawat’s tweet had brought to the fore his differences with Devender Yadav, the party’s state in-charge. After the meeting with Gandhi, Rawat told TOI, “We will work as a team and ensure a win for the party. I have been directed to lead the election campaign.

But Rawat’s grievance was that he was not being given the primacy that the position conveys. On Friday, Rawat scored by having the leadership, through AICC general secretary (organisation) K C Venugopal, convey to the gathering that the leader was leading the campaign and all should cooperate with him. It implies that Rawat will be above other poll panels. To assert his “first among equals” status, it is learnt that Rawat is likely to hold on Sunday a meeting of all the chairmen of various election committees.

---||---||Harish Rawat given ‘free hand’ to lead Uttarakhand Congress in polls||DEHRADUN: Two days after former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat posted a series of tweet expressing his displeasure with the functioning of the party organisation of the state Congress, he was given the green signal by the party high command to lead the election campaign. On Friday, Harish Rawat and a few other Uttarakhand Congress leaders, including state party president Ganesh Godiyal, leader of opposition Pritam Singh, state in-charge Devender Yadav, MLA Qazi Nizamuddin and Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Tamta, met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. During the meeting, it was decided that Rawat would lead the party’s poll campaign in the state and a decision on the name of the chief minister would be taken only when the party wins the elections. Uttarakhand Congress president Ganesh Godiyal was also given the go-ahead to announce his team in the next few days. Separately, it was decided that Congress would appoint a senior member as the central observer to ensure that differences between party leaders are resolved amicably. According to TOI sources, Rajashan CM Ashok Gehlot is likely to be made the party’s central observer for Uttarakhand. Notably, Rawat’s tweet had brought to the fore his differences with Devender Yadav, the party’s state in-charge. After the meeting with Gandhi, Rawat told TOI, “We will work as a team and ensure a win for the party. I have been directed to lead the election campaign. There were some minor issues that have been sorted out.” Meanwhile, political analysts said there is nothing new in Congress’s announcement about Rawat heading the campaign, as he was named the chairman of the campaign committee in July.

On September 24, a few dairies at the Kanwali Road were inspected by the ADM based on a complaint given on September 16, 2021, to the district magistrate by the members of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The complaint alleged that none of these dairies were registered with Nagar Nigam nor did they have any licence to operate. There was also evidence that these dairies were discarding solid waste directly into the drains in complete violation of environment protection laws. During inspection, a dairy was found to be using oxytocin, a prohibited drug, on animals. It has now been served with a notice of closure by the district administration. The use of oxytocin is prohibited but dairy owners sometimes use it to enhance milk production. Following the incident, SPCA also filed a complaint with the city police and the concerned dairy owner was booked under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Meanwhile, the ADM, in his report, has directed various departments like the pollution control board, city police, chief veterinary officer, among others, to take appropriate action. “The dairy needs to be closed within 15 days. Moreover, action should be taken against anyone found violating pollution norms or indulging in animal cruelty,” read the instructions given by the district administration. The local drug controller has also been instructed to check illegal supply and usage of oxytocin. Besides, the chief veterinary officer has been asked to ensure proper tagging of animals and registration of such establishments. Also, officials have been instructed to keep conducting surprise inspections and raids to ensure that all guidelines are being followed. “We are thankful for the swift action against the dairies that are flouting rules and mistreating animals. We would now work with the chief veterinary officer, food & drug administration and other departments to help them identify dairies that use illegal drugs such as oxytocin,” said Rubina Nitin Iyer, SPCA member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/district-admin-issues-notice-for-closure-of-dairy-where-oxytocin-was-found/articleshow/88481459.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Both Bishop Paritosh Canning, the head of CNI in the diocese of Kolkata, and archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of the Roman Catholic Church in the archdiocese, said there are too many distractions keeping the youth away from church services and all-round efforts are being made to encourage them to return on church premises and get involved in social activities of the parishes. The young brigade needs to visit churches and the parish priests to be able to establish contact with the distressed, if any. The pandemic has increased the divide and since, for a long time, people were used to attending church services virtually, an inertia has set in, the church heads said. “We need to break this inertia that has almost become like a reverie and we are pulling out all stops to bring the young people back to church. I have told all churches to start sporting activities on the premises to pull the youth back. We have set up badminton courts inside St Paul’s Cathedral and St James Church. The response is encouraging. I am also going to start football and cricket tournaments involving parishes. These will automatically bring the youth back,” said Bishop Canning. Archbishop D Souza felt social media is the main distractor of youths. He said the chasm the pandemic caused has taken the youth closer to social media. “There is too much attention towards material gains and comforts. This is leaving young people tired and depressed. Churches provide the soul succour they need because it is only through a spiritual connect with the divine that the youth be able to overcome depression. The pandemic has taught us that we cannot live by ourselves and need hand-holding at every level. We need to awaken this realisation in the youth and I will do this with the help of the parish priests,” the archbishop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ahead-of-christmas-church-heads-call-for-greater-youth-attendance/articleshow/88481457.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Dehradun||Details of over 490 foreign returnees still unknown||Dehradun: Amid the looming Omicron scare and Uttarakhand reporting its first case this week, state health department is on its toes to track 490 travellers whose whereabouts are still unknown. As reported by TOI earlier, around 1,900 foreign returnees had landed in Delhi airport between November and December 15 in the past one-and-a-half months. Of them, whereabouts of over 490 flyers are not known. Ever since, Uttarakhand family and health welfare department has been on its toes to track them, as they had at the airport stated that they would head to Uttarakhand. However, it later came to light that they had filled in incorrect details in the forms at the airport. “Information has been shared with local investigation units of all state districts. They are gradually working on tracing them,” said Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general, health. A senior official of health department in Dehradun, however, said none of the travellers has been traced yet. Meanwhile, Dutta enclave on Kanwli road and a house in Raj Vatika on GMS road have been declared micro-containment zones after cases were reported from there. Only essential services will be available for residents, said officials. “Tracing and sampling are an ongoing process. We now want to focus on vaccination to ensure there isn’t too much transmission of the virus,” said chief medical officer Dr Manoj Upreti. Uttarakhand had reported its first Omicron case on December 22 when the genome sequencing report of a 23-year-old woman, who had returned from Scotland, tested positive for the variant. Her RT-PCR test, conducted at the airport, had come out negative. But when she returned to Dehradun, she was tested again and her report came out positive on December 12. She was put under 14-day home-isolation. Officials claim that they are sequencing every positive case to keep a check on the Omicron situation. On Friday, 27 fresh cases were reported in the state, bringing the cumulative figure to 3,44,724.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/details-of-over-490-foreign-returnees-still-unknown/articleshow/88481483.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Activities start in these churches weeks before the festival as the members plan different activities around the celebrations and observe different rituals. Assembly of God Church on Park Street has a Nepali section where the Christmas proceedings take place in Nepali. Close to 300 Nepali Christians attend the service every year. “This year, we will have the special service and prayers on Sunday so that all our members can come to the church. The service will be in Nepali language,” said Pastor Philip, who will be conducting the service. Duff Church in north Kolkata has close to 400 members and almost 98% of them speak in Bengali. Many locals often refer to the church as Bengali church. Several members of the Chinese community in Tangra and near Tiretta Market follow the Christian faith. “We visit the church in the morning on Christmas where all the services are held in Chinese,” said Ah Lam, a Chinese resident of Tiretta Market. On Christmas, Tamil Christians dress in new veshtis and pattu saris and head for the special service to St Saviours’ Tamil Church where the prayers are held in Tamil. “The feast on Christmas reflects the region we hail from. While several families make mutton biryani, there are others who opt for Chicken edi. Sweets include Mysore Pak, payasam andadhirasam,” said Gabriel Vasanthakumaran, who attends the Christmas service at the church every year. The members of the Syro-Malabar Catholic community, or Malayali Christians, start their preparations from December 1 by observing lent for 25 days. “Close to 120 families are settled around the Behala Blind School. Members sing Carrols in Malyalam. The Christmas service, too, is in Malyalam,” said Martin P Jacob, a trustee of St Thomas Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/non-english-services-at-city-churches/articleshow/88481464.cms||Zeeshan Javed

On the eve of Christmas on Friday, the neighbourhood that can be distinguished with narrow alleys and brightly painted two-storeyed structures was teeming with hundreds of revellers out to savour a slice of Christmas. Bow Barracks has been decorated with lights and a giant Christmas tree right in the middle. Teesta Mukherjee, an IT professional who spent many years in several European cities, said she has been coming to Bow Barracks during Christmas since she was transferred to Kolkata in 2017. “Christmas celebrations here are very warm and inclusive,” The residents’ association made the musical night and dinner on December 21 a paid event to prevent over-crowding in the wake of the pandemic. On other days, too, the visitors are being requested not to stay for long and make way for others. “We are concerned about the safety of our residents. On some days, the crowd becomes unmanageable, which is why we had to levy a charge on December 21. The celebrations will continue till year-end but we request everybody to avoid crowding,” said Angela Govindraj, secretary of the residents’ association.“The place has a photogenic aspect to it. And when it is decorated during Christmas, the vibe is very warm. I visit the place every year with my friends on Christmas,” said Sougata Dey, a resident of Naktala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/revellers-make-annual-trip-to-bow-barracks/articleshow/88481480.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Gurgaon||SCERT to set up teachers’ training programme as per their choice||Gurgaon: State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) plans to tweak its training programme for teachers and give them the option to pick and choose the training modules of their choice. Under the current model, all teachers have to take all training modules, but, according to the council, it wastes teaching time and other resources. So, now, it will set up the training programme depending on the needs mapped by the teachers. SCERT asserted that it would set up a comprehensive teacher-centric training module, following the New Education Policy, and ensure at least 50 hours of training in a year. “Teacher training has been at the centre of education planning and policies. NEP also puts special emphasis on the training of teachers, and every state has to ensure that they have a comprehensive plan of conducting at least 50 hours of annual training of the teachers. So, we have decided to engage the teachers in mapping the training and workshop needs, and based on that, we can formulate a revised training module,” SCERT director Rishi Goel told TOI. Academicians have suggested adopting an approach where teachers get the freedom to choose a set of training modules each year. The SCERT is drafting a proposal based on their suggestions and will send it to the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for approval. On the other hand, the pandemic has thrown up newer areas for the training of teachers, according to SCERT. Increased enrollment in state-run schools due to a decline in incomes has led to the need for a revised training model. “Pandemic has changed the teaching and learning needs. It has thrown up new challenges, which, if addressed properly, can lead to opportunities. So, we need to change the previous mechanism of training, where all teachers were required to take all the training. There was a demand and suggestions to make the training more teacher-centric in terms of this that the teachers get to decide the topics they want to get trained in,” said a SCERT official. Teachers said that aside from this move, the education department and SCERT should actively work on the shortage of teachers in the schools. Several teachers in areas such as Nuh have claimed that, due to staff crunch, they have been failing to improve education standards while many students are dropping out. “Training and all is good, but what’s the point when a single teacher gets forced to teach multiple subjects to multiple classes; at times, holding two classes together? All this, because there aren’t enough teachers. We have been demanding that the government appoint new teachers, but no action to date,” said a teacher of a senior secondary school in Nagina block of Nuh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/scert-to-set-up-teachers-training-programme-as-per-their-choice/articleshow/88482985.cms||Siddharth Tiwari
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Mall enforces no-vax-no-entry rule, no curbs at others||KOLKATA: The largest mall in the city that is set to attract nearly 1.5 lakh visitors a day on the double dhamaka Christmas and New Year weekends ushered in the ‘no-vaccine-no-entry’ policy for adults entering the mall. Other mall operators said they would wait for a government order mandating entry to only fully-vaccinated adults than risk rubbing customers the wrong way. South City mall, which had tried to implement the vaccine pass in July but had to pull out at the eleventh hour because retailers refused to play ball fearing huge loss of clientele as large sections of the population were yet to be vaccinated at the time, met with success on Friday after the retailers agreed to put in place another level of safeguard in the wake of the spread of Omicron virus worldwide. “The Covid protocols that had been put in place last year when the mall reopened post lockdown continue to be followed. Visitors undergo thermal scans and AI software recognises those who don’t wear masks properly. Then there is additional manpower deployed on the floors to ensure people comply with mask and distancing regulations. Now with a large section of the population inoculated, we felt it was time to ring in the vaccination certificate checks to ensure added safety in the premises,” said South City mall vice-president Manmohan Bagree. Additional security persons deployed at the entrance checked the certificate and even assisted those who had difficulty fishing it out of Co-Win. Mall authorities said 85%-90% of customers downloaded the certificate and showed it to the security guards. Only 10%-15% had either difficulty in furnishing the document or made a fuss about being asked to do so. However, cops that had been posted at the entrance ensured that there was no furore over it. “When the police officers at Jadavpur PS learnt that we would be implementing the no-vaccine-no-entry policy, they kindly consented to deploy a few cops to ensure there was no trouble,” said an official. The other malls — Quest, Acropolis and City Center I & II — said they had no immediate plans to ring in such curbs as they felt customers could take umbrage. “In the absence of a government notification, it could prove a contentious issue. As it is, most of the people are now vaccinated. Why create an additional hassle for them?” felt Acropolis mall general manager K Vijayan. Authorities at CC-I and CC-II said that while entry could be prohibited without a mask, doing so for vaccination would be offensive to many. “This will impact our business. No one wants any disruption at this point,” said Ambuja Neotia wholetime director Ramesh Pandey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mall-enforces-no-vax-no-entry-rule-no-curbs-at-others/articleshow/88481501.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Dehradun||Voting time extended; candidates with criminal antecedents to make records public||Dehradun: Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra on Friday said that keeping in mind the challenges in the hill state, the voting time has been extended by an hour in Uttarakhand. Until now the voting time was from 8am to 5pm, and now it is till 6pm. Candidates with criminal antecedents will have to reveal cases against them in print and electronic media. “Besides, political parties giving tickets to such candidates, too, will be required to mention the cases on their website and also give the reason why the ticket was given to such a person,” Chandra said. Keeping in mind the Covid-19 scare, the number of voters on each booth has been reduced from 1,500 to 1,200. Besides, the poll centre would be properly sanitised, with strict adherence to social-distancing norms and wearing of masks. With the number of voters now 1,200, 623 new polling booths would be set up, taking the total number to 11,647. On a query related to Covid-19, the CEC said, “We are on alert. I spoke to chief secretary who told me that one case of Omicron has been reported in Uttarakhand. State disaster management authority teams have been directed to keep tabs on developments and act accordingly.” The CEC announced that 150 polling booths of Uttarakhand would be developed as model polling booths. A total of 66,700 volunteers have been named to help the physically challenged at polling booth. For the elections, five booths have been reserved for the physically challenged and these booths would be manned by staff with disabilities. In addition, 100 polling booths would be reserved for women voters. For people above 80 years of age, election commission has decided to provide the facility of postal ballot. “To ensure free and fair voting, the EC team would be getting the video recording done so that no one can raise a question over the process. This way, we will be reaching out to people. Our aim is to ensure maximum participation of voters.” “A total of 601 grounds and 277 buildings have been identified for campaigning. Our teams have identified these venues and the political events will be held here,” Chandra said. During his two-day visit, he met representatives of six political parties and took their feedback. He also interacted with state and police officials. According to the updated voter list of Uttarakhand, the Himalaya state has over 81 lakh voters out of which more than 66,000 are physically challenged and over 93,000 are service voters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/voting-time-extended-candidates-with-criminal-antecedents-to-make-records-public/articleshow/88481505.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Goa||In Goa’s heartland, Christmas is about communal harmony||KERI: While Christmas is celebrated with much pomp and fanfare in urban parts of the state, rural Goa has traditionally opted to mark the much-anticipated Christian festival as a close-knit celebration of communal harmony. This year is no different. The tribal Gaude of the Tiswadi taluka, who were victims of forced conversions during the Portuguese rule in Goa but were later reinstated into Hinduism, still maintain the age-old practice of honouring the Holy Cross in the vicinity of their settlement at Nauxi, near Bambolim. Called the Nav-Hindu Gaude due to their re-entry into Hinduism through a ‘shuddhi’ (purification) movement by spiritual leader Vinayak Maharaj Masurkar in 1930, they also invoke the blessings of the Holy Cross during the annual Zagor festival and offer garlands to it. At Angodwada, which skirts the Colvale river in Pernem taluka’s Ibrampur, 12 Dhangar families look forward to Christmas celebrations at the 13 homes of their Catholic neighbours. “Every year, the Catholic families happily take part in our Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations by visiting our houses eating vegetarian food and sweets. During Christmas, we visit their homes and relish nevreos, dodol and others delicacies. We look forward to Christmas,” Chandrakant Shinde, a villager, told TOI. A similar camaraderie is seen in Bhironda and Guleli in Sattari despite the Catholic population there being much lesser than the Hindus. Populations, however, do not seem to matter. “In our ward, the Catholic families are in majority. There are only eight Hindu houses, but we live in communal harmony. We love to take part in Christmas celebrations and they relish the vegetarian food offered during our festive occasions,” Swapnil Valvoikar from Vazri of Sankhali, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-goas-heartland-christmas-is-about-communal-harmony/articleshow/88482114.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar
---||Nagpur||A crisis that was a test of one’s character||Nagpur: A well-built man desperately held his mother like a child as if trying to hold her from leaving him. The woman in her sixties was gasping for breath and her son was waiting for doctors. They were in a autorickshaw queued along with other vehicles. There were ambulances, private cars and even autorickshaws all lined up. Each had a patient urgently needing medical attention but the wait was never-ending. It was in April this year and the scene was at Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH), popularly known as Mayo Hospital. The man and his mother would have perhaps become an iconic photograph depicting desperate situation during the second wave of Covid. He looked straight into the eyes of this diarist and pleaded for help. It would have been too cruel to take a picture at that time amid the chaos. The autorickshaw went ahead and this diarist did not keep a further track of him. When beds were scarce during the second wave, this diarist visited both the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and IGGMCH to check the situation. Though not a medical reporter, this diarist used the experience in field reporting. Patients were gasping for oxygen dying at the doorstep of the wards. Hospitals were full and there was a time when even the two huge hospitals of the city ran out of beds. Those refused by private hospitals rushed to GMCH and IGGMCH as the last resort. At GMCH, a man was shaking his dead brother in a bid to revive him. The man died waiting for a bed. The brother told this diarist that the person was gasping but the RT-PCR did not test Covid positive, and so he could did not get admission in the Covid ward. There were around seven persons outside the ward at GMCH — three were already dead. A boy stood weeping as the hospital staff zipped his father’ body in a black plastic sheet and took it away. Two young girls who looked like medical students or resident doctors stood dazed. Journalists derive a certain thrill reporting crisis straight from ground zero. During Covid times this diarist realized that even we were equally vulnerable. It brought about a change in outlook. The doctors also expressed helplessness about the situation. Among the pandemic heroes this diarist covered included the NMC workers who cremated the Covid dead. The crematoria were full with burning pyres with men in white PPEs standing in front of the fire. The PPE indicated that the person had died due to Covid. Even the hearse vans were running short to carry the dead. Things normalized as faster than it took for the crisis to build. This diarist hopes not to face a similar situation.

The DC has issued a circular in this regard to PDOs and heads of educational institutions. Most of the students from Kerala who pursue medicine, nursing, paramedical, engineering and other courses in Dakshina Kannada have gone back home for the Christmas vacations. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra has directed institutions and panchayat development officers (PDO) to take necessary steps to conduct tests on students, when they return to their campuses, he said. In his letter to the DC, district surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh had pointed out that many of the students of medical, paramedical, engineering and other professional college students were staying in private paying guest facilities. However, those paying guest facility owners have not followed Covid-19 guidelines, leading to the spread of the virus in campuses. Hence, the surveillance officer has requested that respective PDOs to monitor all such facilities. Similarly, the district administration has also decided to ramp up tests. The district at present conducts an average of 7,000-7,500 tests per day. The number of tests will be increased to above 10,000 per day, though the district has been reporting an average of less than 20 cases per day. More emphasis will be given to tracing primary, secondary and tertiary contacts of those who tested positive for the virus. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer for Covid-19, told TOI that the health department has already given a PHC-wise target for testing. “We were conducting more than 10,000 tests earlier, but the number was reduced, due to a fall in the number of cases. We have given directions to increase the number of tests in the wake of festivals and New Year celebrations. Even if a single case is reported, the contact tracing mechanism will be made thorough, to find all primary and secondary contacts,” Dr Ashok said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dc-directs-pdos-to-monitor-students-returning-from-kerala/articleshow/88480837.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Nomination not yet final, says Rane Sr||MARGAO: A day after Congress cleared the candidature of its 83-year old legislator Pratapsing Rane to contest from Poriem in the upcoming assembly polls, the Congress veteran on Friday denied that the party has finalised his nomination. “No, Congress has not finalised my ticket,” Rane told TOI. “I have not been informed about it by the party.” Rane’s assertion is seen as an indication that he is in two minds about contesting the election for yet another term. With Congress officially announcing Rane’s candidature, a day after his son, health minister Vishwajit Rane, said he would contest against his father and defeat him, it appeared that the stage was set for a high-profile father versus son contest in Poriem. Senior Rane’s changed stance has perplexed the Congress leadership which is keeping a close eye on the developments in Poriem and junior Rane’s moves. Sources in Congress however hoped that Rane Sr would contest on a Congress ticket though the leadership is exploring options in case he declines to contest owing to pressure from his family. Rane, who has completed 50 years as MLA, has never lost an election from Poriem—where he has won since 1989, the first election after Goa attained statehood He is now challenged by his son Vishwajit, who represents Valpoi constituency. While Rane Sr is learnt to have been not too keen in contesting the 2022 polls initially, he changed his mind after his supporters insisted that he contest. “I have to listen to my supporters,” he had said two days ago while announcing his decision to fight the polls. In September, BJP’s Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis had visited Rane Sr at his residence, along with BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade. While Rane had dismissed the visit as a courtesy call, Fadnavis had said his party had got the blessings of the veteran politician.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nomination-not-yet-final-says-rane-sr/articleshow/88482125.cms||---

Cops have gathered leads that the ill-gotten money was diverted to China through cryptocurrency by the accused. Rachakonda police said that the three accused- Gopal Sherpa, Sushil Gurung and Nima Tamang- who are residents of Siliguri in West Bengal, were nabbed at Secunderabad Railway Station. In October, 2021, cyber crime police had received a complaint from B Kiran of Ghatkesar, who alleged that he lost Rs 86 lakh hoping to get high returns after clicking on a link for an online investment opportunity sent by the accused. The victim clicked on the link and later sent money to different bank accounts as directed by the accused. Later, he found out that he could not withdraw the money as promised by the accused. Based on his complaint, police had earlier arrested three persons from Siliguri and found that Depu Mandal, a Nepali, is the key accused. Though the cops had launched a manhunt for Depu, they came to know about the role of three other Nepalis- Gopal, Sushil and Nima- who were in Hyderabad and in the process of setting up a call center to dupe people by offering them fake investment plans. “Depu created fake ID proofs and gave it to the arrested accused. He used them for procuring SIM cards and opening bank accounts. On analysis of a messaging app on the phone of the accused, it was found that the proceeds from the fraud were diverted to China through cryptocurrency exchange,” Rachakonda police said. Police are trying to trace Depu, Manish Chettri and other accused. Depu is believed to have fled to Nepal to avoid being caught by the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nepal-nationals-used-crypto-to-divert-fraud-money-to-china/articleshow/88482149.cms||---

---||Ludhiana||Bogus billing case: CGST arrests another city bizman||Ludhiana: The Central GST commissionerate (CGST), Ludhiana, on Thursday arrested another businessman for bogus billing worth several crores and availing fraudulent input tax credit of approximately Rs 12 crore. Accused Gurbakhash Singh was said to be hand in glove with another bogus billing accused Baljinder Singh Bunty who was arrested earlier this year. After his arrest on Thursday, the accused was produced in a local court that remanded him to judicial custody till January 6. This is the second arrest by the CGST department in a span of two days, as on Wednesday a businessman was arrested for availing and passing on fraudulent ITC of Rs 34 crore. A source in the department said, “During investigation of a case, Gurbakhash Singh’s name cropped up. He owned and controlled two firms through which he availed and passed on fraudulent ITC of Rs 12 crore by using fake invoices of about Rs 77 crore. In his voluntary statement to the CGST department, the accused has admitted that these two firms of his were created in connivance with Bunty only for receiving and issuing fake invoices and showing trading without goods for availing and passing on of fraudulent ITC. Based on the evidence gathered and the statement of the accused, he was placed under arrest and produced before the magistrate, who has remanded him to judicial custody till January 6. Further investigation is under way. Vital clues have been found, hinting at the involvement of more people in this scam.”Bunty was booked in March this year by the CGST commissionerate for being part of the Rs 484-crore bogus billing nexus executed through 19 fictitious firms. In a web of companies spun by Bunty with the help of others, he passed on fraudulent ITC worth several crores by showing fake sale and purchase entries in multiple firms. Besides Bunty, there have been several more arrests in this case. In one instance, a father-son duo was arrested last month for availing and passing fraudulent ITC of about Rs 13.5 crore on bogus invoices of about Rs 91.73 crore through four bogus firms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bogus-billing-case-cgst-arrests-another-city-bizman/articleshow/88481563.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Nagpur||Bogus contracts scam: UDD min assures probe, cops form SIT||Nagpur: On a day Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde reportedly assured in the state assembly to probe the bogus contracts scam in the BJP-ruled Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), city police have handed over the probe from Sadar police to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW). CP Amitesh Kumar told TOI that a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed in the EOW, which will only look after this matter. “The entire case seems to be big and there is need for SIT to probe the matter thoroughly and expeditiously,” said Kumar, who did not specify any time limit for the probe. City Congress president Vikas Thakre raised the issue in the assembly during the ongoing state legislature session in Mumbai on Friday. Thakre told TOI, “Shinde took serious cognizance when I raised the issue and assured a thorough probe.” During the discussion on supplementary demands, Thakre said, “NMC has been hit by bogus contracts scam, similar to the sports material procurement scam that took place in the civic body between 1997-2000. As per Nandlal Committee report which probed the scam then, over 100 corporators were booked.” “Various departments of the NMC are involved in the bogus contracts scam, which is estimated to be of over Rs100 crore. The civic body has lodged complaint with the police on which very few accused have been booked and arrested. The government should constitute a committee and conduct probe to expose all those involved,” said Thakre. TOI was the first to report about the scam on December 14. Thakre had on December 17 written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to order a probe and also dissolution of the NMC. Sources in the NMC said, “Urban development department has directed municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B to send a detailed report on the scam. Accordingly, NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi has sent a report informing the government about the irregularities, action taken, formation of seven-member committee to investigate all contracts approved between April 1, 2020 and December 13.” If the government sets up a committee at its level, it will be third such panel to probe the scam. Apart from seven-member committee constituted by the civic chief, the standing committee had passed a resolution to constitute a three-member committee of its members for conducting an inquiry into all contracts approved in last five years. The committee constituted by the civic chief has started inquiry and held two meetings. The committee proposed by the standing committee is yet to be set up and start working. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar on Friday approved the resolution passed a couple of days ago, which comprises formation of committee. Earlier, Sadar police have obtained PCR of NMC accounts officer Rajesh Meshram till December 28.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bogus-contracts-scam-udd-min-assures-probe-cops-form-sit/articleshow/88481581.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Hyderabad||Telangana issues government order to fix cinema ticket rates||HYDERABAD: Amid conflicts and protests between the film industry and the AP government over the state’s decision to prescribe cinema ticket rates, the Telangana government too fixed cinema ticket rates for all the AC, non-AC, ordinary and multiplex theatres in the state. A GO too was issued to this effect that allowed the theatres to raise the ticket rates substantially all over the state. While the theatres and film industry approached the courts in AP describing the action of the state as an attack on them and also as an intervention in ‘their affairs’, the Telangana high court closed a PIL that wanted the state to control cinema ticket rates stating that what the petitioner was seeking has been done by the state. The Telangana government informed the high court that it revised the cinema ticket rates and issued an order, GO MS No 120, dated December 21, 2021, also for the purpose. The state informed this to a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji when the latter took up the hearing of a PIL filed by advocate GL Narasimha Rao who charged the state and its authorities with allowing the theatre owners to fleece the people with high ticket prices, particularly at the time of the release of new films. He wanted the state to break this nexus and fix reasonable prices. The state home department’s counsel T Srikanth Reddy informed the court that the state government has fixed cinema ticket rates and furnished a copy of the cinema tickets GO to the court. The bench told the petitioner that what the petitioner was seeking has now been fulfilled by the state. When the petitioner was raising new demands, the bench asked him to come back to court if the new GO is violated by any of the theatres. The petitioner alleged that the theatres were unduly enriched in the last 5 years by collecting huge charges at the time of the release of new films. The bench refused to take up all the alleged past violations of the theatres at the behest of the petitioner. File separate petitions in each such past case with evidence, the bench said while disposing of the petition. What happened in the past?Following a directive from the Hyderabad high court in 2016, the Telangana government formed a six-member committee headed by the home secretary. Based on the recommendations of this committee, the state government, on June 23, 2017, classified theatres into several categories based on their facilities and location and fixed prices for them through GO Ms. No 75. And surprisingly, a week later, citing administrative reasons, the state kept this GO in abeyance on June 30, 2017. The grievance of the petitioner is that the theatre owners were filing petitions before the high court and were obtaining interim orders for hiking ticket charges before the release of new movies. They have been citing the abeyance order as the reason. Since the state could not come out with a clear prescription, they were seeking temporary relief. The petitioner says that this had unduly enriched some bigwigs in teh film industry in an undue manner at the cost of the ordinary filmgoers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-issues-go-to-fix-cinema-ticket-rates/articleshow/88482162.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The foundation stone for the project was laid by urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon and mayor Sanyukta Bhatia in an event organised on Friday, the eve of the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister and Lucknow MP Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Glowing tributes were paid to Vajpayee, who represented Lucknow in Lok Sabha for over two decades. Of the 857 parks, 706 belong to Lucknow Municipal Corporation and their beautification will cost Rs 34.5 crore. The remaining 154 belong to Lucknow Development Authority and will cost Rs 9.5 crore. Remembering Vajpayee, Tandon said, “He was considered an inspiration for development. Whoever wants to do development work is close to Atalji because Atalji gave affection to them.” Mayor Bhatia said, “Lucknow is the city of Atalji's dreams. LMC is leaving no stone unturned to make it the city of his dreams. Lucknow's cleanliness ranking from 269th to 12th place is a strong step towards it. The 857 parks being dedicated to Lucknow today will directly benefit everyone.” Minister Neeraj Bora said, “Whoever comes to these parks after the beautification work is completed will never be able to forget the city of Nawabs. Organized at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan in Gomtinagar, the event was also attended by BJP leader Neeraj Singh, LMC executive committee chairman Rajnish Gupta, municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi and other senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/857-parks-in-city-to-get-makeover-worth-rs-44cr/articleshow/88482626.cms||---

Only final finishing touches and paving of the area are pending,” Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza said. The initial deadline given for phase one was six months, which was to end in July. A total of 20,000 sqmts of land at the Mapusa bus stand is under the state directorate of transport, about 10,000 sqmts of which was to be developed under phase one of the project. The progress of the project was moving at a snail’s pace, and D’Souza had attributed the reason from multiple delays in works to prolonged rain causing disruption in cement setting and compacting. One of the major problems resolved is that of retention of water due to the monsoon, Fernandes said. The bus stand currently has 54 bus bays, 48 car parking slots and 68 two-wheeler slots, and space for 15 autorickshaws. “The provision is systematic for the current load of vehicles and all the buses that are stationed outside the bus stand will be allowed to operate from inside the premises. There will also be facility for overnight parking of vehicles. This will reduce the load on the vehicular traffic in the town,” he said. Following this, phase two of the project will be taken up – that of shifting the KTC bus stand to start the project of multi-storied parking at the existing bus stand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-bus-stand-to-be-ready-by-next-month-joshua/articleshow/88482153.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Despite HC nudge, UP polls may not be deferred: Experts||Lucknow: A day after the Allahabad High Court requested the Election Commission of India to postpone the upcoming assembly polls in UP by two months, citing the fear of third wave of novel coronavirus, constitutional expert and former chief election commissioner (CEC) SY Quraishi said that while EC can ban political rallies, postponement is highly unlikely. “It is a constitutional mandate that before the term of the current house is over, the next assembly should be ready through the election conducted by the ECI. The term of the assembly can be extended during an emergency and the emergency can be declared only for two reasons -- first, a war and secondly, huge internal disturbance (law and order situation). Pandemic cannot be the reason for the postponement of the election,” Qureshi told TOI. He further said, “Election rallies can be banned to avoid spread of the virus and campaigns can be done via print, TV and social media. Even a door-to-door and bicycle campaign in small groups following the Covid protocol can be done.” Meanwhile, Balraj Chauhan, constitutional expert and former vice-chancellor of three national law universities, including Ram Manohar Lohia Law University Lucknow, told TOI: “Before declaring the dates of the election, the EC can consult the government to maintain constitutional morality, commitment and requirements. Once the date of election is announced, then all the decisions will be taken by the EC according to the Constitution.” Responding to the apprehension of a third wave impacting the election, he said, “The EC has to take steps to save the people’s life which is more important than anything else. Even PM Narendra Modi said ‘Jaan hain to Jahan hai’ during the first lockdown. But during the second lockdown he changed it to ‘Jaan bhi jaroori hai aur jahan bhi’. According to EC sources, stringent steps will be taken to ensure strict adherence of Covid protocol during polling. “There will be more polling booths and social distancing will be followed. Every booth will have sanitation kits along with masks. For all above 80 years of age or those who are ill and unable to come to the polling station, the EC is likely to reach their doorstep. The polling timings too would be increased.” Meanwhile, responding to the Allahabad HC concerns ‘if rallies are not stopped, results will be worse than the second wave’, CEC Sushil Chandra said, “Next week we will go to Uttar Pradesh, review the situation there and then take an appropriate decision.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/despite-hc-nudge-up-polls-may-not-be-deferred-experts/articleshow/88482633.cms||Arvind Chauhan

City-based Deem Distributors Private Limited was accused of availing and utilising fake input tax credit (ITC). Director of the company Sanjay Kumar Agarwal admitted to GST officials that he had traded in invoices without actual receipt or supply of goods for a commission. CGST officials carried out an investigation in various commissionerates about existence of suppliers of Deem Distributors. The probe revealed that around 13 suppliers do not exist or were involved in supply of fake invoices without supply of goods. “Deem Distributors availed ITC on the strength of these fake invoices.

---||Goa||Around 300 taxis awaiting installation of digital meters||Panaji: With the fitment of digital taxi fare meters under way in Goa, 8,194 vehicles have completed installation of the device till December 18. Bookings for fitments in 8,527 vehicles have been made, fitments for which are yet to be taken up. This leaves only 333 vehicles on the pending list. There are roughly around 20,000 taxis registered in the state, of which about 16,000-17,000 vehicles are operational. After the directorate of transport held meetings with the two agencies executing the work of installing meters — Rosmerta Auto Tech Pvt Ltd and Securinex Pvt Ltd — to urge them to improve the rate of installation, the average daily number of installations had slightly gone up to 142 installations per day. Owing to the tourist season and the festival period of Christmas-New Year, many taxis have been engaged in operations, making the fitment process slower. “Taxi operators feel they will be wasting time waiting in queue for fitments during this peak business period, which is why the footfalls are lesser these days. We are, however, optimistic that we will complete the bookings of all vehicles by next month,” a transport officer said. In view of the high court directives, the government had earlier set a deadline of October 31 for the series-wise fitments of digital meters, following which the pending taxi operators were given until November-end to get the installation complete. The transport department is now looking at January as a potential date for completion of the task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/around-300-taxis-awaiting-installation-of-digital-meters/articleshow/88482652.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||8 held in Hyderabad for 7,000 illegal Aadhaar card enrolments, data changes||HYDERABAD: Task force police busted an Aadhaar card enrolment-cum-corrections scam and arrested eight offenders from the city. The accused made 7,000 illegal Aadhaar card enrolments/ data changes by uploading forged documents from illegally obtained enrolment officer IDs allotted to Assam. The arrested accused were identified as T Nitesh Singh, 30, a businessman from Borabanda, Syed Mustafa, 28, a businessman from Hakeempet, Rabbani MA, 28, employee of a private company in Hakeempet, Md Azhar Shareef, 27, employee of Mustafa from Hakeempet, Md Sohail, 23, employee of Nitesh from Borabanda, Sk Jahangir Pasha, 37, a private worker from Miyapur, Md Anwaruddin, 34, a businessman from Mylardevpally and Md Ahmed, 20, a private worker from Mylardevpally. Another key accused, Pavan, 35, employee of Aadhaar enrolment agency in Assam is absconding. According to Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar, in October 2021, Nitesh Singh obtained six login IDs from Pavan to make Aadhaar card enrolments and also make corrections in the Aadhaar cards by paying him Rs 90,000. Nitesh used one ID for Aadhaar enrolments and sold five IDs to Mustafa, Jahangir and Anwaruddin to carry out corrections in Aadhaar cards and new enrolments. Put together, the arrested accused from the city carried out 7,000 new enrolments and corrections in a span of two months by charging Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 from each client. Pavan, who supplied the six IDs which are allotted to Assam by UIDAI, gets Rs 3,000 per day as commission from the citybased accused, said a task force official. Based on the complaint given by the UIDAI, police registered two cases against the accused at Banjara Hills and Golconda police stations under relevant sections of the IPC, IT Act and Aadhaar Act, 2016. The accused, along with the seized property, were handed over to Golconda police for further probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/8-held-for-7000-illegal-aadhaar-card-enrolments-data-changes/articleshow/88482166.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||Glowing waves observed at Padukere Beach||Udupi: The phenomenon of bioluminescence was observed at the Mattu-Padukere Beach in the past few days. Bioluminescence is light emitted by living organisms or algae, through chemical reactions in their bodies. Mohith Shenoy from Manipal Birder’s Club told TOI that bioluminescence at the beach was reported a few days ago. “I went to the beach to check for bioluminescence on Wednesday. We expect that it could be there for some more time. It was observed last year too. However, this year it is not as massive as last year, on this stretch. It is visible at certain spots, but it is mostly scattered. Currently, we saw it on the Mattu-Padukere Beach stretch, and we expect it to happen along other parts of the coast,” he said. Last year, after word spread about bioluminescence or sparkle in the sea, people thronged beaches to watch the same. “It is definitely a treat to watch, but it is an indicator of marine health,” Shenoy added. Dr A Senthi Vel, professor and dean, College of Fisheries (COF) said that a team will visit the place to find out if the same species Noctiluca scintillans, is found this year too. “Bioluminescence can be attributed to the rise in marine organic pollution. Once the organic load in the water increases, then the algal bloom starts. When the bloom happens, there is a drastic reduction in the fish catch, as the oxygen depletes in that particular area. This is an indication that the fish catch may decline,” he said. Last year, this phenomenon was noticed in November at Padukere, Sashihithlu, NITK Surathkal, Tannirbavi, Panambur, Ullal and Someshwara beaches. Following this, a team of scientists from COF visited the sites for observation, and collected water samples for the plankton and bacterial composition. The plankton analysis was carried out using a microscopic method, and it was found that the major plankton composition consists of Noctiluca scintillans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/glowing-waves-observed-at-padukere-beach/articleshow/88480893.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Nagpur||Customs raises Rs7 crore bill for 8 years on MADC||Nagpur: The customs department has raised a demand of Rs7.35 crore on Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) for providing its services to the Mihan-SEZ. The dues have been accumulated from January 2013 till December 2021, according to the customs’ claim. The MADC is countering the claim citing a different method of calculation, which has been a bone of contention for eight years. Under the SEZ regime, the services including that of the customs department, which is a key agency in the set up, are on paid basis. It’s called cost recovery charges. The cost towards salaries of the department’s officials and that of the contractual staff has to be borne by the developer. For the Mihan-SEZ, the developer is MADC. The eight years of dues have become a vexed issue between the MADC, a state government company, and the customs department, which comes under the ministry of finance. In any SEZ, the customs department plays an important role. A designated customs examination area has to be created in an SEZ. The officials are responsible for monitoring inward and outward movement of goods, to keep a vigil on any tax evasion. The SEZ is a deemed foreign territory and only exports happening from here are tax-free. Even the inputs purchased are duty-free. The customs department is posted to prevent any diversion out of the SEZ for illegal tax gains. A specified officer of the department is in-charge of monitoring the movement of goods. However, this comes at a cost. Time and again, the mater has been raised before the MADC but the issue remains unresolved, said sources. If the matter worsens, ultimate consequence can be withdrawal of customs department from the area. If this happens, the very existence of the SEZ can be questioned, finally leading to even scrapping of Mihan’s status as SEZ, said a source explaining the situation. Though this would only happen as a worse case scenario, said the source. According the latest communication, the customs department has put up the demand at over Rs7.35 crore. A revision of the earlier amount of over Rs4 crore put the liability at Rs8 crore towards MADC. After deducting the amount paid, the final due comes to Rs7.35 crore. The MADC has been asked to pay the dues according to the basic salaries and not the average monthly cost method. A source said this means the customs is stressing on paying the actual outgo towards salaries. TOI had sent a text message to vice-chairman-cum-managing director Deepak Kapoor seeking his comments. MADC’s project consultant SK Chatterjee replied to the query on behalf of Kapoor. Chatterjee told TOI that the customs calculations come to 1.85 times of the actual figure. The vice-chairman cum-managing director’s office had objected to it in 2012 itself. However, the customs is continuing to demand higher. Chatterjee, however, said the actual amount as per MADC will have to be worked out. Salaries unpaid, 3 PAP contract workers stop work Three contractual staff engaged by the customs department have stopped their services after five months salaries remained unpaid. Two of them were engaged in monitoring the movement of goods. The department had indicted that their absence can affect the monitoring. All the three are project affected persons (PAPs), whose lands were taken over for the Mihan project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/customs-raises-rs7-crore-bill-for-8-years-on-madc/articleshow/88481591.cms||Shishir Arya

The CBI alleged that Hyderabad-based PCH promoters were involved in diverting the loan amount. Based on a complaint from SBI deputy general manager BG Sudha Rathna, the CBI registered a case of criminal conspiracy and cheating under IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act sections. The CBI named PCH chairman Huzur Singh, managing direcotr Sutinder Singh and director Komal Singh and public servants. A forensic audit report by auditors MM Reddy and Company revealed that the accused had colluded together and committed forgery by manipulation, submission of fake financial statements, fabrication of fictitious transactions, diversion of funds and misappropriation of funds for purposes other than released by the bank. The company has overstated stock and book debts statements intentionally to the tune of Rs 155 crore. It also siphoned off Rs 91 crore and Rs 44 crore in 2014-15 and 2015-16 in the name of writing off loans, the CBI alleged. The account of PCH was classified as a non-performing asset on March 31, 2014. The fraud had taken place at SBI’s commercial branch, Secunderabad, from where the accused diverted the funds. Several properties of the accused company mortgaged to the bank are caught in legal disputes. The CBI had earlier issued FIRs against PCH. The Enforcement Directorate too booked cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against PCH and its promoters based on the CBI FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-books-pch-for-rs-205cr-sbi-loan-fraud/articleshow/88482171.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

Besides, the cabinet has also given exemption of motor vehicle tax for stage carriage buses (big and mini buses) and contract carriage with vehicles less than 16 seats. Businessmen are upbeat over the announcements. Vinod Thapar, chairman of Knitwear Club, said, “We are thankful to the state government for accepting our demand of bringing OTS for PSEIC and other departments. Under the OTS for PSEIC, defaulter allottees have been given an opportunity to clear their long outstanding dues after availing a waiver of 100% component of penal interest and of 25% of normal interest due or maximum up to the current reserve price of the plot (after adjusting the already paid amount), as may be chosen by the plot-holder. The deadline for availing the benefits under this OTS has been fixed for March 31, which is fair enough.”Harish Kairpal, president of Ludhiana MSME Association, said, “Ludhiana industrialists are going to get the maximum benefit of the OTS schemes approved by the cabinet as most disputes with these departments are from here. The OTS for the industrial estates will apply to allottees of plots and sheds in industrial estates, including commercial allotments like shop-cum-flats (SCFs) made by the industries and commerce department. The rollout of the OTS will end decades-old disputes.”Balwinder Singh, executive member of Business Bachao Morcha, said, “We are thankful to the state government for giving exemption of motor vehicle tax to stage carriage buses and less than 16-seater contract carriage vehicles. This will give a huge relief to transport businessmen and also to those who ferry their own staff.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bizmen-heave-sigh-of-relief-as-cabinet-okays-ots-schemes/articleshow/88481594.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Cyberabad cops put brakes on ISB road speed limit||HYDERABAD: The Cyberabad police removed all the signboards displaying 30 kmph of speed limit on the 2.63 km of Indian School of Business (ISB) road after TOI reported how the stretch had turned into a fine trap for many commuters. On December 4, TOI had reported woes of several commuters who termed speed limit of 30 kmph on the six-lane road with a slope as arbitrary. Many commuters living in Narsingi, Kollur and areas abutting the outer ring road who frequently use the ISB road were issued challans of ₹1,035 for over-speeding on that stretch. An online petition was floated seeking transparency in fixing the speed limits which has got close to 2,500 signatures so far. Citing the TOI report, the petition stated that the fixed speed limit of 30 kmph has turned a bane for the motorists who head to their offices and houses in the nearby areas. “The citizens are outraged at the absurd speed limit on the ISB road. We challenge the logic for posting such a low speed limit of 30 kmph for a six-lane divided road with a significant declivity where even the gravity would pull the vehicles faster!,” read the petition. Following this, the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, which was responsible for fixing the speed limit at the stretch, instructed the cops to remove them. “We got instructions from higher authorities to replace the 30 kmph signboards with ‘go slow’ signboards. The same was informed to the traffic cops who have done the needful,” said Shravan Kumar, zonal manager, TSIIC. However, the commuters are demanding the authorities to cancel the challans issued by the cops so far. “A few of us got a call from the traffic police department informing them about cancellation of their speeding challans. The same should be done for all those who have suffered due to this ambiguity,” said Sameer Dubey, a resident of Narsingi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-put-brakes-on-isb-road-speed-limit/articleshow/88482170.cms||Preeti Biswas

As she was on leave, I was returning to my chamber on the third floor. Before going upstairs, I went to the washroom. As I came out and was on the stairs, about 30 feet away, I heard a blast.”“I stood still as I could not understand what had happened. I turned around and saw smoke. An obnoxious smell filled the compound. I was shocked and could not move. In the meantime, I saw a man in black coat under the debris. I thought he could be an advocate. I had no courage to go near him, as I feared another blast could occur. As some advocates moved ahead, I too joined them and we took the man out from under the wreckage,” he added.“I could not recognize that advocate for a minute. When I calmed myself, I identified him as our colleague Kuldeep Singh Mand. Thereafter, more people came and he was taken to a hospital. Thereafter, I reached my chamber, took some time to gather myself and thanked the almighty for saving my life,” he said.On if he noticed anything suspicious in the washroom, he said, “There are so many people in the court, including advocates and their staff, who use that washroom. We generally do not notice anyone in a public place. I did not see anyone or anything suspicious.”Two more advocates, Vishavpreet Singh Sandhu and Ishwarpal Singh Ahuja, also witnessed the incident.Ahuja said, “My colleague, Vishavpreet Singh Sandhu, and I were on the stairs of the second floor when we heard the blast.

---||Dehradun||Ground developed during Kumbh for Rs 7 crore in bad shape||HARIDWAR: Rodibelwala ground in Haridwar, on which around Rs 7 crore of funds were spent during the Kumbh Mela to prepare it for the mega event, has now been left abandoned, as a result of which squatters have occupied the place. Also, as per residents, anti-social elements and drug peddlers are operating from the ground with impunity. For the Kumbh Mela, toilets were constructed, new lights were installed and a fresh layer of grass was planted in the ground, ostensibly at a cost of around Rs 7 crore. However, barely months after the event, the money pumped into the ground, which is located near the central control room tower, seems to have come to nought. Kanheya Khewria, a resident, claimed, "Around Rs 35 crore was sanctioned for development of Har-ki-Pauri ghat under CSR funds of Indian Oil Corporation, of which officials spent Rs 7 crore for development of Rodibelwala ground. We raised the issue about spending such a huge amount on the ground. An inquiry was ordered but no action has been taken so far." During the development work at the ground, Haridwar MP Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ had also expressed anguish on "the wastage of money” and asked to conduct a probe. The probe is yet to be completed. Haridwar DM, Vinay Shankar Pandey, who holds charge as the mela officer, said, "The city magistrate is doing an investigation in the case. We are taking the matter seriously.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ground-developed-during-kumbh-for-rs-7-cr-in-bad-shape/articleshow/88481603.cms||MS Nawaz
---||Nagpur||Mangalwari, Laxmi Nagar zone citizens worst in civic sense: Data||Nagpur: A report by nuisance detection squad (NDS) has placed people living in west and southwest Nagpur areas — particularly Mangalwari and Laxmi Nagar zones — on top for ‘lack of civic sense’ among all ten zones of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). These areas are represented by city Congress president Vikas Thakre (west Nagpur) and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis’s (southwest constituencies). Since December 2017, the NDS has caught 20,061 residents and 19,893 shopkeepers from these zones for creating civic nuisance. The NDS team kept a close watch in markets areas, bus stops and railway stations for anyone littering and spitting, apart from creating other civic nuisance, said NDS commandant Virsen Tambe. Despite instances of interference by political parties, 1,39,457 violators were fined Rs15.30 crore since NDS came into existence in December 2017. Both Laxmi Nagar and Mangalwari zones comprise many posh localities including Deo Nagar, Khamla, Raj Nagar and Chhaoni Most of the violators were caught for littering in public places, followed by encroachments on footpath, stocking construction material on roads, footpaths and urinating in open spaces, show statistics compiled by the NDS. Even residents in Dharampeth zone too lack civic sense as 18,169 residents were caught for creating civic nuisance by the NDS. Satranjipura and Lakadganj zones have done better than the tony areas of the city. In these zones, the NDS team penalised 9,157 and 9,855 citizens respectively for creating civic nuisances. As per rules, civic cops collect Rs100-10,000 fine for such acts. The fine for spitting is Rs100, while the penalty of Rs200 is recovered for urination in open areas. As per the NDS action taken report, the highest number of penal actions were taken in the year 2020 when they penalised 62,066 Nagpurians and collected a fine of Rs50.34 lakh. In this calendar year, till December 18, it caught 44,561 citizens indulging in civic nuisance and recovered a fine of over Rs6.66 crore.

---||Hyderabad||No Covid-19 variant called Delmicron, assures expert||Hyderabad: There is no variant of novel coronavirus called Delmicron and people need not worry about it as it is simply non-existent, clarified a top scientist. There have been reports since Thursday about the “emergence” of a new variant called Delmicron, creating a sort of fear among people. The fake reports talked about the alleged mixing of the genetic material of Omicron and Delta variants leading to the birth of “more dangerous” Delmicron. Scientists, however, dismissed the news as a mere figment of imagination. “Delmicron is a misleading term. There is no new variant by this name,” said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director of Tata Institute for Genetics and Society, Bangalore. Mishra, who earlier served as the director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, told TOI that it is extremely rare that same person harbours both variants of Covid-19 at the same time. “It is extremely rare that same person will have both variants and even then it is not correct to give it a new name,” he said. According to Dr Rakesh Mishra, if and when a new variant comes, it is the WHO that gives the name. “Currently, in some countries there is a rise in cases due to two variants - Omicron and Delta. But it does not make a new variant,” he clarified. Meanwhile, the WHO in its latest technical update on Omicron has said there is consistent evidence that this new variant has a substantial growth advantage over Delta. “It is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant in countries with documented community transmission, with a doubling time of 2-3 days,” it said. Stating that the data on clinical severity of patients infected with Omicron is growing but still limited, the WHO technical briefing said early data from South Africa, the United Kingdom and Denmark suggested a reduced risk of hospitalization for Omicron compared to Delta. However, the risk of hospitalization is only one aspect of severity, which may be altered by admission practices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-covid-19-variant-called-delmicron-assures-expert/articleshow/88481628.cms||Syed Akbar

---||Delhi||Delhi records highest single-day Covid case tally in 6 months||NEW DELHI: The national capital on Friday recorded 180 fresh Covid cases, the highest single-day rise since June 16, and zero death. The positivity rate, at 0.29%, was the highest in the past five months, according to the health department data. On June 16, the city logged 212 Covid-19 cases. Three new cases of Covid-19 caused by the Omicron variant were also confirmed, taking the total number of such cases in the city to 67. After Maharashtra, Delhi has recorded the maximum number of cases by the highly-transmissible Omicron. This variant is suspected to be behind the increased incidence of the viral infection over the past two weeks. Delhi has witnessed an uptick in novel coronavirus infections recently amid more and more cases of the new Omicron variant. It reported 125 cases on Wednesday, which was then the highest daily count since June 22. The positivity rate was 0.2%. On Thursday, the new case count stood at 118 with a positivity rate of 0.19%, while one death was reported. The total number of cases reported in Delhi since the pandemic has struck is 14,42,813, of which 14.16 lakh have recovered. The death toll stands at 25,103. Five deaths have been reported in December so far. Seven deaths were reported in November, four in October and five in September. In the past 24 days, the data shared by the government shows, Delhi has recorded an average of 78 Covid cases daily, the highest in the past four months. In August, September, October and November, Delhi recorded a daily average of 48, 37, 32 and 35 cases, respectively. At present, there are 782 active cases, of which 227 are in hospitals. Public health experts say cases may go up in the coming days due to the spread of the new variant. Calling on people to support measures put in place in view of the new variant and the holiday season, World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday said the overall threat posed by Omicron would also depend on how people perceived risk and followed the preventive measures. “The threat from Omicron not only depends on how transmissible the virus is, or severity of the disease it can cause, or its impact on vaccines, but also on how people understand and perceive its risk, and follow control measures, including public health and social measures,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director of WHO Southeast Asia Region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/highest-single-day-case-tally-in-6-months/articleshow/88482654.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Jab it right: 15 districts in Telangana set bar for Covid vaccine takers||HYDERABAD: Though 28 lakh people in the state are yet to take their second dose vaccine, the state is on the verge of completing 100% coverage of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Fifteen districts out of 33 in Telangana have more than 100% first dose coverage. What it would imply is that the jabs in these districts were given to a larger number of people than the estimated eligible, targeted population, experts explained. However, the coverage in various districts was varied — from 113% (Rangareddy at the top) to 101% (Mahbubnagar). Telangana has now covered 99% of the targeted population’s first dose, officials said. While 29 districts have more than 90% vaccine coverage, only Suryapet (89%), Medchal (85%), Kamareddy (85%) and Kumuram Bheem Asifabad (84%) have less than 90% coverage. The health department has taken into account the overall projected population of 3.7 crore, using the Census data from 2011. And 75% of 3.7 crore population is over the age of 18, making them eligible for Covid-19 vaccine. According to experts, it is better to exceed estimated targets because the projected population is large. “There would have been more migrating and floating population after 2011 and the projected population would have been large as well. Exceeding the first dose coverage targets in Rangareddy and Hyderabad is a sign of it. People from other states also move between cities in general. More the coverage, the better, especially when vaccine waste is negligible,” said Dr Kiran Madala, a certified researcher n the Indian Council of Medical Research. Telangana is also one of the top states with higher first dose coverage than the national average. The state government has set a goal of completing the first dose coverage by December-end, which looks like a possibility, officials explained. Meanwhile, health minister T Harish Rao has asked the Centre for a clarification on the booster dose. “We have been asking the Centre for permission for at least healthcare personnel who were vaccinated long time ago,” he said. He said the Centre has not responded to the state’s request yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jab-it-right-15-dists-in-t-have-over-100-1st-dose-vax-coverage/articleshow/88481608.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Soren was received by Toppo, auxiliary bishop Theodore Mascarenhas and sisters of the various congregations. Pausing before a crib, especially put up at the entrance of Archbishop House, to mark Christmas, the Ranchi archbishop presented a statue of infant Jesus. Later, the CM spent about 20 minutes with the archbishop. After the meeting, Soren appealed to the people to abide by the Covid-safety norms while celebrating Christmas. He said, “Christmas is a time to spread the message of peace and joy. But the threat of Covid still looms large and people need to be careful while celebrating.” Congress leader and former Union minister Subodh Kant Sahay also called on the archbishop on the occasion. Meanwhile, at the 113-year-old St Mary’s Cathedral, thousands of faithful gathered to attend the mass. However, the giant crib, depicting the Nativity or the birth of Jesus, put up on the grounds of the cathedral annually, is missing this year. Even the usual decorations are absent, abiding by the directives of the archbishop, who has directed that all churches under his jurisdiction observe an austere Christmas and donate more in charity to help people in distress during the pandemic and the lockdown. At the 149-year-old St Paul’s Cathedral in Bahubazar, which is administered by the Church of North India, the authorities put up a glass ceiling with blue cloth and fish to make the visitors have an underwater feel with the fish, taking a cue from the Biblical story of Jonah and the Big Fish. Talking to TOI, Supriya Tirkey, who is overseeing the decorations, said, “Stories in the Bible have a lot of marine connection. In the Bible, God commanded Jonah, a resident of Israel, to go to Nineveh city and start preaching. However, Jonah boarded a ship and tried to get as far away as possible. Angry with him, God sent a storm and the sailors threw Jonah into the waters to save themselves. God then sent a big fish, which swallowed Jonah and kept him alive inside its belly. After three days, the fish vomited Jonah out on dry land. Thankful that his life has been spared, Jonah took up his prophetic mission.” At the 167-year-old Christ Church, more popularly known as the Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Church, arrangements have been made to broadcast live the midnight mass and the church services to prevent overcrowding on the church premises. Decorations at the church were low-key to give out the message of a more austere Christmas. Markings have also been put on the church benches to tell people that they need to maintain social distancing and stay safe while coming to the church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cm-greets-ranchi-archbishop-faithful-on-christmas/articleshow/88481685.cms||Tapas Biswas
---||Ranchi||Double doses must to enter Basukinath Temple on Jan 1||Dumka: Devotees, who have taken both their doses of Covid-19 vaccines, will be allowed to enter the Basukinath Temple on January 1, 2022, the Dumka district administration has announced. While only fully immunised adults will be allowed to offer their prayers, those below 18 years of age will not be allowed to enter the temple premises. A statement in this regard was issued by the district public relations department on Thursday evening. The statement said the new order was being put in place to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases because of the new Omicron variant. The order was issued by the district administration after deputy commissioner Ravishankar Shukla, SP Ambar Lakda and other officers huddled into a meeting with Panda Dharam Rakshini Sabha, the association of priests of the temple. Like the Baidyanath Dham temple in Deoghar, the Basukinath temple in Dumka draws thousands of devotees from across the region on New Year's day each year. Additional deployment of police forces will be done in and around the temple on the day, the administration said. The announcement has caused dissent among the priests of the temple. "A large number of devotees come to the temple from Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. They will be deprived from offering prayers," a local priest said. "There was no effort from the administration to ensure Covid appropriate behaviour during the Sarkar Apke Dwar programmes in Dumka town and rural parts of the district. Why this double standard then?" said another priest. Deoghar administration on Friday also issued an order which prohibits the entry of adult devotees to the Baidyanath Dham temple if they have not taken both their doses of Covid-19 vaccine. Deoghar DC Manjunath Bhajantri inspected the temple premises and its surroundings. The Deoghar Municipal Corporation was also directed to ensure proper sanitization in and around the temple premises and the Shiva Ganga, the holy pond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/double-doses-must-to-enter-basukinath-temple-on-jan-1/articleshow/88481600.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey
---||Ranchi||8 mths after CM nod, 300-bed facility for Cov patients a non-starter||Ranchi: The second wave of Covid-19 in April-May this year exposed the inadequacy of available medical facilities in the capital and several patients had to be shifted to hospitals in neighbouring districts. It was during the crisis period that chief minister Hemant Soren explored the possibilities for augmenting health infrastructure and directions were issued to the district administration to include a 300-bed facility at the TB Sanatorium in Itki for treating Covid patients. The CM also gave a deadline of three months to complete the work. Almost eight months since his directions in April, the additional 300-bed facility is yet to be made functional for various reasons. The TB Sanatorium in Itki is managed by Ram Krishna Mission Ashram and has a capacity of 200 inpatients, including 150 dedicated to TB patients. The hospital was one among the first to install RT-PCR testing facility for detection of Sars-Cov 2 virus during the first wave and came as a major support to the testing laboratory at Rims when it was getting overwhelmed with a large number of samples. According to letter number 1623 (II) issued by the Ranchi deputy commissioner’s office on October 26, the process of arranging 150 beds at the inter-ward of the sanatorium is under way while a few beds at the women’s ward of the hospital have already been readied with oxygen facility. “To ensure uninterrupted power supply in the hospital, we have directed the office of electrical executive engineer, Ranchi division, to install a 200KVA transformer at the earliest,” the letter reads. The delay in completion of the facility was also raised in the house by Mandar MLA Bandhu Tirkey during the recently concluded winter session. It was after receiving his question that the department of health and family welfare gave administrative approval of Rs 58.94 lakh under the state plan head for construction of a PCC approach road for the new wards. Officials in the health department admitted that in absence of the 1250 mt long approach road, it would have been difficult to operationalise the additional bed facility. “We expect the 300-bed facility to be operational as soon as decks are cleared for construction of road and installation of the transformer,” an official in the health secretariat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/8-mths-after-cm-nod-300-bed-facility-for-cov-patients-a-non-starter/articleshow/88481589.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Desperation for jobs, livelihood deepens on govt’s third year||Ranchi: The year 2021, which was declared as the year of jobs in Jharkhand, largely remained as the year of serial protests by different job-seekers even as the coalition government helmed by chief minister Hemant Soren took a few baby steps to provide employment. Soon after the JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government took charge during the end of 2019, it stared at “empty coffers” of the state treasury. Even before it could set the wheel rolling to fulfil its mandate, the pandemic — Covid-19 — hit the state within months, sending the government into a tizzy. The entire 2020 was largely spent on fighting the lethal pandemic. Only after the more deadly second wave of the pandemic eased from August onwards, it made some humble beginning by providing direct jobs to 40 sportspersons, which according to the CM was the first in the state. He also said that the government has come up with a holistic sports policy for giving employment to scores of sportspersons regularly every year. In the next few months, the state kept providing a handful of job letters to different sections of people. But critics and scores of youths desperate for jobs saw it just as a piecemeal step, considering the giant claims of giving 5 lakh jobs per year promise that this coalition government before the 2019 assembly polls. The government had also promised an unemployment allowance, but nothing materialised. According to the statement presented in the recently concluded winter session of the assembly, over six lakh people had enrolled/registered themselves with different employment exchange offices across 24 districts till June this year. The government has conceded that it failed to provide jobs to any of them so far. State labour and employment department minister Satyanand Bhokta conceded in the house that the rate of unemployment in Jharkhand is highest among all the neighbouring states. He said in 2019, the total number of job-seekers registered with employment exchanges remained at 85,122, which shot up to 5,60,722 till June this year. However, of the 5.25 lakh total sanctioned posts in different government departments, about 60% are vacant. A senior official of the state government said to tackle the rural and agrarian crisis, the government also rolled out a slew of schemes to create MNREGA man-days in the last two years. “This apart, chief minister Hemant Soren has been stressing on providing 70% reservation to locals in both public and private jobs here,” he said. Academician and economist Ramesh Sharan, however, predicted that the gap between haves and have-nots, working-class and unemployed will only widen in the coming year. Coupled with the pandemic, the desperation for jobs will only get critical. “The government can’t give jobs to all but it has to play the role of facilitator to usher in an environment where investments come. Though the state is harping on 70% reservation for locals, for it to succeed, it has to ensure that it can provide the right skill-set to employers. The biggest hurdle in this state has been lack of proper continuity and clarity,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/desperation-for-jobs-livelihood-deepens-on-govts-third-year/articleshow/88481574.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Across the state, 92% of the police personnel have been administered both doses but the figures are dismal in the state capital. As many as 1,455 police personnel have also not received even the first dose in the state. According to official data, out of the total 69,454 police personnel in Jharkhand, 67,999 have received their first dose and 64,315 have got both doses. However, out of 5,486 police personnel in Ranchi, only 2,835 police personnel have received both doses. At the state level, 3,684 policemen have not received their second dose out of whom 2,267 are from Ranchi police. It may be mentioned here that several districts, including East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Palamu, Garhwa and Giridih have achieved almost 100% double dose vaccination. SP (Ranchi rural) Naushad Alam expressed concern over the dismal figures. He said, “All policemen have been instructed to get both the doses. It is possible that they have taken the second dose and there is a delay in uploading the data. I will inquire into the matter.” Another official also said there is no hesitancy among the police personnel. He said, “A vaccination centre is functioning at the police lines where the personnel and their family members are getting the shots.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/vaccine-coverage-among-city-police-dismal-data/articleshow/88481658.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Statues of deities recovered from Charwa Dam||Hazaribag: A group of locals chanced upon half a dozen stone idols in Charwa Dam on Friday morning. As the word spread, residents of Kanchanpur, Godhakhar, Charwa, Khutra and Pabra villages headed towards the dam, brought the idols to the bank and began worshipping them under a makeshift tent before local police rushed to the spot and seized the idols. Located eight kilometers from Hazaribag, the Charwa Dam was constructed in 1952 by the Damodar Valley Corporation. To this day, the reservoir supplies drinking water to Hazaribag. In 2012, during a digging by the district administration in the reservoir’s command area, a stone statue of goddess Kali was found. The locals built a temple nearby and installed the idol, where it is worshipped even to this day. Pelawal police station in charge Abhishek Kumar Singh said the deities were sighted first by a group of locals who were going to the dam to defecate. The idols, made of stone, were found half immersed in the water by the banks. “The group then headed back to their dwellings and informed others about it. The locals then gathered at the bank and started offering prayers,” Singh said. The idols recovered include a two-feet high Shiva Lingam made of black stone and white stone idols of Hanuman, Parvati, Vishnu and Nandi. The police suspected that these idols were stolen from nearby temples and dumped in the dam’s waters, only to be retrieved later for sale. “The idols have been seized and kept in the police station while nearby police stations have been told to share information of thefts in recent weeks,” Singh said. Hazaribag SP did not respond when contacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/statues-of-deities-recovered-from-charwa-dam/articleshow/88481617.cms||Abhijit Sen

The vaccine, developed by Zydus Cadilla, is administered using a needle-free applicator. Dr Mrityunjay Singh, WHO surveillance officer in-charge of Palamu, said: “Besides Palamu, the state health department plans to introduce ZyCov-D vaccine in Bokaro, Giridih, Dhanbad and Ranchi districts. A group of trainers are being readied for training healthcare personnel on this vaccine.” The state health department held a virtual training programme for the trainers on Thursday. The trainers were shown how to inoculate with the pharmajet injector by doing mock vaccinations on sponge balls. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has approved the ZyCov-D vaccine for beneficiaries above 18 years of age. So far, Jharkhand has largely administered doses of Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine is also being administered in the state. Beneficiaries who will get the first jabs of ZyCov-D will have to take the next two shots on the 28th and 56th day. State immunisation officer Dr Rakesh Dayal has asked the district hospitals to train 30 ANMs (Auxiliary Nursing Midwife) each as master trainers for the new vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/5-jharkhand-districts-to-get-zycov-d-vaccines/articleshow/88481641.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Mohali court rejects Bikram Singh Majithia’s bail plea||MOHALI: Former minister and Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, who has been booked in a drug case, now faces arrest as a Mohali court dismissed his anticipatory bail application on Friday. Majithia had moved the court on Thursday, after a lookout circular issued against him. Court of additional district and sessions judge Sandeep Kumar Singla maintained that keeping in view all facts and the gravity of the offence, it was not a fit case where benefit of anticipatory bail could be granted to the applicant. The court order reads: “Accordingly, finding no merit in the bail application, the same is hereby dismissed.” In the court of additional district and sessions judge Sandeep Kumar Singla, his counsels pleaded: “The applicant is a senior leader of the Shriomani Akali Dal and the Congress-led government got the FIR registered (against him) to wreak vengeance in the run up for upcoming assembly elections. Three DGPs and three directors of Bureau of Investigation were changed, and police officers have been coerced to falsely implicate the applicant.” Majithia’s counsels include Damanbir Singh Sobti, H S Dhanoa, Arshdeep Singh Cheema, Shivkartar Singh and Somnath Tayal. The special public prosecutor, assisted by district attorney Sanjeev Batra, additional public prosecutor Manjit Singh and SIT members, maintained that the case had been duly filed after the opinion of Punjab advocate general D S Patwalia. They added that portions of the STF report have been reiterated in the FIR, which mentions that during investigation, enforcement directorate deputy director Naranjan Singh had recorded the statements of NDPS case accused Jagjit Singh Chahal, Jagdish Singh Bhola and Maninder Singh alias Bittu Aulakh, which disclosed the complicity of Majithia in the drug trade as he provided vehicles and gunmen to international drug dealers namely Satpreet Singh alias Satta, Parminder Singh Pindi and Amrinder Singh Laddi, who even stayed at the applicant’s residence. Bhola had stated that Pindi and Satta even came from Canada to attend Majithia’s marriage and stayed at his house in Amritsar. Aulakh has claimed that Majithia introduced him to Satta and Pindi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-court-dismisses-majithias-pre-arrest-bail-plea/articleshow/88482691.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

The crucial programme is also being monitored by the cabinet secretary to ensure that various ministries, which are part of the plan step up their efforts to ensure that the target is met. “We will be very close to the target for FY22 and if there is any gap it won’t be wide,” said an official while detailing the strategy. While roads and power ministries are in line to meet their targets, thanks to REITs and InvITs, which are like mutual funds that pool assets, ministries including railways, petroleum, mining and sports are way behind schedule. In fact, railways is seen to be the biggest laggard after a change of guard. “Progress needs to be stepped up as it is a crucial part of the plan,” said an official. The Railways have a target of raising Rs 17,810 crore under the national monetisation pipeline in the current financial year. Its plans to get the private sector to run passenger trains received a cold response and work is in progress to revise the terms, which many believe is being held up due to the powerful bureaucracy in the ministry. While officers see REITs and InvITs as safer bets, transfer of assets to individual entities are seen to be risky, just like strategic sale, prompting babus to be “extra cautious”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/financial-year-2022-target-government-to-speed-up-asset-monetisation-drive/articleshow/88483629.cms||Surojit Gupta
---||Chandigarh||Will go after big fish in drug trade, enough evidence against Majithia: Channi||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Friday said there were big fish and strong forces involved in drug trade, but he would ensure that the fight is taken to a logical conclusion. He justified the action against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, saying there was enough evidence against him based on the report of the special task force (STF) on drugs. Addressing a press conference, Channi said, “It is our duty to do what the previous governments did not. It is the fight of the youth and people of the state. We will take the fight against those involved in drug trade to a logical conclusion. Their sand and liquor businesses too will be looked into. Over 51,000 drug-related cases have been registered and 66,000 people arrested in the last four years. But they are not the big fish, they were mostly drug addicts. Until the big smugglers are arrested, it does not send out the message.” Denying political vendetta behind the FIR against Majithia, Channi claimed, “It is not a case made under the Congress government. It came to light during the SAD-BJP government when Rs 6,000 crore drug racket was exposed in 2013. Majithia’s name figures in the police documents. Jagdish Bhola also took Majithia’s name and he has been under the scanner of the enforcement directorate (ED). The STF submitted its report on drugs, but previous CM Amarinder Singh and the then advocate general did not get the report opened. The court has now asked us to act on the report. On court directions, we opened the report. There is enough evidence against Majithia, and we have converted the report into an FIR,” he said. “The way drugs spread during the previous SAD-BJP regime, Punjab got the tag of ‘Udta Punjab’ and the economy of the state was also hit... I tried to convince myself and took feedback from the officers... I was convinced that these people were involved. I listened to the voice of my conscience,” he added. BOX Ridicules Kejriwal for apology to Majithia Channi said Kejriwal tendered an apology to Majithia after levelling allegations of his involvement in drug trade and ran away after the Akali leader filed a defamation case. “He couldn’t take a stand. Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann supported him and was the only one who did not object to the move. After the last elections, Kejriwal submitted an apology on the party letterhead that said ‘retraction of allegations made against you and an offer of regret’. It is a part of the court records in Amritsar and shows the character of the Aam Aadmi Party,” said Channi. “This is Kejriwal. You have to be strong to be able to safeguard Punjab’s interests. They should clarify their position now. Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann should apologise to the people of Punjab as Majithia has now been booked,” he said. Sirsa played a role in apology Channi claimed that BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who was then with the Akalis, brokered the apology between Kejriwal and Majithia. “The letter was not drafted in a day. Sirsa mediated the agreement,” he said, adding that Amarinder too is now supporting Majithia as he has been reminded of his family ties with him. No Covid restrictions for now Channi said while there was a need to be careful about Covid threat, the Punjab government did not intend to impose any restrictions for now. “There is Covid threat and I want to make an appeal to people to be careful,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-go-after-big-fish-in-drug-trade-enough-evidence-against-majithia-channi/articleshow/88482713.cms||---

The couple had nurtured a dream to toe the line of the likes of Dr Abhay and Dr Rani Bang or the Amte couple. Milind, now posted at Vyankatapur police station in the Aheri tehsil of south Gadchiroli, was Diptee’s classmate at Vasantdada Patil Ayurvedic College in Sangli before they fell in love and ended up tying the knot in 2015 by galloping over an inter-caste hurdle. Milind got selected as an officer through MPSC in 2013. While Milind approached the state police headquarters in 2018 to post him to Maoist-affected Gadchiroli to be able to serve in the challenging terrain, Diptee was initially reluctant to let her husband follow his heart but relented later. With the closest primary health centre (PHC) at Aheri 35km away and only a sub-PHC at Vyankatapur, it did not take much time for Diptee to become popular among the villagers in the adjoining hamlets with people coming from as far as 10-12km to seek her assistance free of cost at the police post. “My husband told me that places like Gadchiroli lack adequate medical facilities. He said neither can people afford medicines nor is it easy for them to access medical facilities in Gadchiroli. I thought why not serve these people and use the opportunity to the fullest,” said Diptee. She soon stacked up some medicines and started attending medical camps organized by her husband as a part of his civic action. In his nearly three-year stint, Milind deterred Maoists from making any recruitment at Vyankatapur. He too always carried medicines and treated people during gram-bhets (village visits), jan jagaran melawas and health camps organized at the police station level under the guidance of SP Ankit Goyal, DIG Sandip Patil and Addl SP Anuj Tare. A disbeliever in coercive action, Milind said he aimed at continuous dialogue with the villagers and focused on their socio-economic transformation to alter their vision. “My wife too does not remain confined at the police station but many times accompanies our team to the closeby hamlets for treatment and other social work on her own,” said Milind who had organized a training camp for villagers who were provided knowledge about ‘cashew nut’ production by the agricultural officers. A round couple of days ago, Milind and his team had also organized a visit of the animal husbandry officials and vaccinated 750 bovines in the adjoining villages against foot and mouth disease. He also ensured that almost 770 persons got driving licence. “My wife too joined our team to constantly campaign to remove misconceptions of villagers about the vaccine and take the first and second dose from health teams,” said Milind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/college-romance-spills-onto-gadchiroli-as-wife-decides-to-join-hubby-cop-on-posting/articleshow/88481694.cms||Soumitra Bose

With 7 days to go for the year to end, 81 humans, 41 tigers and 174 leopards have already died this year. The conflict has worsened, admits Maharashtra PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye. Though as per forest department’s claim, 29 tigers and 153 leopards have died this year, according to data compiled by Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), an NGO working to tackle the country’s growing wildlife crisis, the toll in Maharashtra was 41 tigers and 174 leopards. The WPSI data also includes the recent cases of poaching in which a large cache of tiger and leopard body parts was seized from at least 80 poachers and accused by forest officials in the region. This is the second consecutive year when human deaths in wild animal attacks crossed over 80, though it is marginally less compared to 2020 when 88 people had died. According to state forest department, of the 81 human kills, Chandrapur 44 and neighbouring Gadchiroli 16 accounted for 60 deaths combined. Of the 60 victims, 47 were mauled by tigers and 10 by leopards while 3 were attacked by an elephant and wild boar. Nashik had reported 9 deaths in leopard attacks. Nagpur also reported 3 fatal attacks by tigers and 1 by a leopard. Two persons had also died in Yavatmal due to tiger attacks. It was not only humans vulnerable to attacks, but tigers and leopards too suffered big casualties as a result of the conflict. Of the 41 tiger deaths recorded by the WPSI, 20 died due to poaching, 12 were found dead, 2 died in road accidents, and 7 died in infighting. Similarly, of the 174 leopard deaths, 89 were found dead, 26 were due to poaching, 28 died in road and railway accidents, 20 in infighting and the remaining deaths were due to attack by local villagers and killed during rescue operations. As per the All India Tiger & Leopard Estimation-2018, the tiger numbers in Maharashtra have increased from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018 and is around 350 now. Similarly, leopard numbers have increased to 1,690 in the state, which is the third largest in the country. Hence, the conflict will not end unless there is strong enforcement plan to contain it. “The two-state wildlife board committees have already submitted reports and we are on the job to implement them by creating awareness among the locals by various means. But most importantly, we can mitigate the problem if people maintain restraint by not intruding into the space occupied by big carnivores.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2021-saw-2nd-highest-man-animal-conflict-toll/articleshow/88481739.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Business||PM’s visit: India, UAE trade deal is finalised||NEW DELHI: India and the UAE have completed negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, with an announcement to be made during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the West Asian country in the first week of 2022, in a move that is expected to boost trade with countries in the Gulf as well as Africa. Apart from lowering of tariffs, the trade pact — only the second since the one with Mauritius — is expected to include key provisions for easier movement of Indian professionals and workers to Emirates. While the UAE is already the largest base for the Indian diaspora, companies are expected to get more leeway in hiring workers from the country, with some of the eligibility test requirements also expected to be eased, sources familiar with the deliberations told TOI. In addition, there will be a message to signal easier investment norms, with UAE entities expected to pump in money into creating critical infrastructure in India. On the import duty front, some of the areas of interest for India, such as food products, are expected to get concessions so that they can compete with products from other parts of the world more favourably. In return, some of the products from the petro-chem value chain will be allowed lower duty access into India. Government sources said the effort has been made to ensure that third country imports are not routed through minor value addition in the UAE, including those from other Gulf countries and China. The UAE is part of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which was negotiating a free trade agreement with India several years ago, until the talks were abandoned. India as well as GCC had paused talks with several trading partners. The bilateral trade agreement with the UAE also marks a significant change in India’s stance as the Modi government had virtually stopped talks with all countries until it shed its inhibitions after its exit from RCEP due to the overarching presence of China. Since then, it has entered into negotiations with the EU, the UK, Australia and Israel with some of the FTAs expected to be worked out in the coming months. With bilateral trade of $43 billion, UAE was India’s third largest trading partner during the last financial year, lagging China and the US. During April-October this year, it was the second-largest export destination for Indian goods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pms-visit-india-uae-trade-deal-is-finalised/articleshow/88483668.cms||Sidhartha

Dr Milind Wyawahare, who heads the ICU at GMCH, said it was not less than any miracle because the man was brought in a very critical condition and that too after nearly 2 hours of travel from his village on December 5. “He had consumed insecticide, locked the room from inside and hanged himself with rope of baby cradle. After his wife peeped in through the locked door, she saw her husband hanging and raised an alarm. The man’s father jumped inside the room from the roof and untied the noose,” said Dr Wyawahare. The patient was brought to the ICU on December 5 evening. He was unconscious due to hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (a type of brain dysfunction that occurs when the brain doesn’t receive enough oxygen or blood flow) and had full-blown signs of organophosphate (OP) poisoning with bilateral aspiration. “The patient was put on ventilator on admission and successfully weaned off today after 20 days of the life support,” said Dr Wyawahare. The farmer’s wife told TOI that he was the only earning member in the family. Owner of just 1 acre land, the couple has two kids — a 3-year-old son and a 2-month-old daughter. The farmer was frustrated because of the economic crisis, especially after Covid-19 period. The incident is not just a story of saving a young life, but also shows that farmers, especially those who own smaller pieces of land, are still facing life and death crises. “We consider ourselves fortunate as we could have lost life of a head of the family with children. The patient is doing well now. He will get discharge soon,” said a resident doctor from the ICU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gmch-docs-save-farmer-who-attempted-suicide-twice/articleshow/88481822.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Nagpur||Toy sellers by the day, dacoits by night||Nagpur: City police have busted a gang of dacoits whose women members, posing as beggars and toy sellers, recced areas in the day and their men struck at desolate houses where armed looting can take place without resistance at night. On Thursday, city police have arrested four dacoits in a joint operation with Allahabad crime branch sleuths. After scanning recordings of nearly 100 CCTV cameras across the city and confirming their involvement with fingerprint analysis, the crime branch team under additional CP Sunil Phulari and DCP Chinmay Pandit managed to identify the gang of Madhya Pradesh’s Changiram Gosavi. The arrests were made with the help of mobile tracking technology. Though Gosavi succeeded in giving the cops a slip, crime branch team of assistant PIs Mayur Chourasiya, Ganesh Pawar, PSI Balram Jhadokar and others managed to pick up the kingpin’s son Guru alias Akash, Nirmal Mogya, Rohit Bhagat and Pintya Mogya from Pardhi localities with the help of their Allahabad counterparts. The cyber cell had helped the team track down the locations of the culprits. CP Amitesh Kumar, who was closely monitoring the investigation on day-to-day basis, said Gosavi, his other son and others would be soon apprehended. “This gang had a previous history of striking at different places in the city,” said the CP, adding three cases were solved after the detection which included one at a senior citizen’s house in Dabha and the one at the residence of a couple residing within the limits of Beltarodi police station. “We have also recovered valuables worth Rs4.60 lakh from them,” he said. DCP Pandit said the gang members also acted as pickpockets in and around railway station and Sadar. Police are learnt to have identified the gang after seeing them dispersing after each dacoity and then reuniting at RBI and LIC Squares. The kingpin Changiram was spotted in one of the footage from where the gang got identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/toy-sellers-by-the-day-dacoits-by-night/articleshow/88481835.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Took step back on farm reforms, step forward soon: Union agri min||Nagpur: Union agriculture minister Narendrasingh Tomar said the government may have certainly taken a step backwards on the three farm laws but would soon take a step forward in the direction. At the inauguration of Agrovision exhibition, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari exhorted farmers (anna-datas) to become urja-datas and grow crops to make ethanol for transport vehicles. “Both religion and farming are prime to India. Knowing its importance the prime minister has taken a number of steps to promote farming,” he said. The three farms laws were the first fundamental reforms initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, it was not liked by some. The government is not disheartened after the laws had to be withdrawn, he said. The minister said the government would come up with measures that would ultimately benefit farmers. However, when asked by journalists, Tomar remained evasive on the likelihood of a law guaranteeing Minimum Support Price (MSP). Tomar also evaded an answer to a question on the timeline for setting up the proposed committee that would deal with making MSP regime more effective, natural farming and crop diversification. This was part of the announcement made following withdrawal of the three controversial farm laws to end the farmers’ strike. Tomar also praised Gadkari, saying that his efforts have led to removal of the tag of drought and unemployment prone region for Vidarbha. The minister was in the city to inaugurate the Agrovision farm expo patronized by Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari. Gadkari also mentioned the three farm laws. They could not happen due to politics, he said. Stressing on how doing away with middlemen helps, he said, vegetables grown in his farm directly go to a store in Pratap Nagar locality of the city. There is no need to pay any commission to a middleman. “Customers specifically ask if vegetables from my farm are there and buy them,” he said. Gadkari said his sons have floated a company that would be allotting pumps for ethanol. Majority of the automobile companies have agreed to make flexi engines, which can run on both petroleum and ethanol. Making a push for ethanol as alternate fuel, he said sugar production is already in surplus. This time, farmers were saved due to the demand created on account of a drought in Brazil. The situation may not be the same always, he said. If making sugar becomes less profitable, ethanol can be the option, which can substitute petroleum fuel, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/took-step-back-on-farm-reforms-step-forward-soon-union-agri-min/articleshow/88481847.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Delhi||Delhi: 5 held for bid to extort Rs 2 crore from Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni over 'violence video'||NEW DELHI: After a weeklong chase, Delhi Police has arrested five men for allegedly blackmailing junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni and trying to extort Rs 2 crore from him. The tech-savvy gang was difficult to catch as they covered their tracks by using proxy servers and "technically creating confusion" over their location while making the calls. A probe is being conducted to ascertain if the accused - Kabir Verma, Amit Kumar, Amit Majhi, Nishant and Ashwani - had been hired for the job and whether an acquaintance of the minister or a political rival was behind the incident, a source said. One of the accused has a criminal antecedent and was involved in a case of cheating in the past, an initial probe has revealed, while the others are first-timers. Police said the tech-savvy gang was difficult to catch as they covered their tracks by using proxy servers and ‘technically creating confusion’ over their location while making the callsThe VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) calls were made on the official and publicly available number of the minister, which were received by his personal assistant. The caller had claimed to have a video, which could apparently 'indict' Teni and his son in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the minister's office claimed in their police complaint. On October 3, four protesting farmers and a journalist were mowed down by a convoy of minister Teni's son, Ashish Mishra, following which three people in the convoy were killed in retaliation. The accused were claiming to possess an unseen video of this incident. Insisting that there could be no such incriminating video, the minister requested Delhi police commissioner Rakesh Asthana to investigate the calls on priority. An FIR was registered at the North Avenue police station in New Delhi district on December 17 and a probe initiated. A crack team was formed to nab the suspects and the special cell provided crucial inputs, including leads generated through "social engineering" methods, sources said. The arrests were the result of an extensive analysis of internet protocol details records coupled with traditional technical methods, which required getting access to the suspects' devices. The suspects are highly trained in technical aspects of voice-over-internet telephony because of their BPO background. They were using proxy servers for dynamic, jumping IPs and virtual private network (VPN) in making the calls. The accused made the extortion calls from a park in Noida's sector 15 to avoid being arrested as the park falls between two mobile signal towers. This, they assumed, would give misleading data to cops if they tried to trace the location of the call. Sources said the police are trying to probe if the gang had morphed any videos as they have recovered a video device apart from technical equipment used in VOIP calling. After the technical surveillance led the cops close to the accused's location, a calibrated operation was launched to nab them. As they were continuously on the move in their "car office", they were told to collect the money. When a suspect arrived to take the payment, he was nabbed by a covert team and simultaneous raids were conducted in Noida and Siraspur area in Delhi to nab the other four. The accused were produced in court and taken on three days' remand for interrogation and unravelling of the entire conspiracy. They are being questioned at an undisclosed location. The gang, cops said, chose its targets randomly. They called up people embroiled in controversies after seeing them on news channels and tried to extort money using morphed audios and videos, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-5-held-for-bid-to-extort-rs-2-crore-from-union-minister-ajay-mishra-teni-over-violence-video/articleshow/88483749.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

In all, 175 incidents of extreme rainfall events in 31 districts and 189 incidents of untimely rainfall in 36 districts have been recorded in the last five years besides a four-time rise in extreme drought events (increasing to 79 in 2010-19 from 23 the previous decade and 17 in 1990-99), all of which can be attributed to climate change, indicates the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2021. The report, along with its findings on Maharashtra, was presented by principal secretary for environment and climate change Manisha Mhaiskar at an event held at the central hall of the state assembly on Friday. The state has spent over Rs 21,000 crore in compensation and drought relief works taken up during disasters caused by events such as flash floods, unseasonal rains, cyclone, hailstorms and landslides, the report said. Mumbai is also one of the 12 listed Indian cities at the risk of coastal submergence due to increase in sea surface temperature, extreme rainfall events and rapid urbanisation, the report indicates. Besides public health, the report also warns of threat to the economy. Most of Mum region an Urban Heat IslandBetween 2006 and 2018, the global mean sea level has risen by 3.7mm per year due to rising temperature, the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reveals. By 2050, the report says, major land areas of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane will be more likely to get severely flooded. According to the report, almost the entire Mumbai region has become an Urban Heat Island (UHI) as a result of increased concretization, destruction of wetlands, degradation of mangroves and depleting greenery along with areas such as Kothrud, Hadapsar, Aundh and Viman Nagar in Pune city. UHIs have higher daytime temperatures which contribute to flash floods and unseasonal showers besides causing reduction in groundwater levels. "While major parts of Mumbai have experienced a temperature rise of approximately 2 degree C between 1991-2018, the parts of Pune have experienced about 3 degree C temperature rise between 2001-2016," the report points out. Environment expert Raunak Sutaria and former MPCB chairman Sudhir Shrivastav said streamlining and decongesting concrete-based urbanisation and enhancing vegetation should be the top priorities to tackle rising temperatures, especially in cities under the grip of the UHI effect. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, chairman of the state Legislative Council Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar, Deputy Chairman Neelam Gorhe and former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan were present when the report was unveiled. Thackeray said the effects of climate change "have already reached us and adversely affected us" and is no more a prediction but a reality. "Now, it's time to act decisively to save mother earth and the precious life on it," he added. Nimbalkar said an incident of 750mm overnight rain in Mahabaleshwar is nothing but the fallout of climate change which needs serious efforts to negate carbon emissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/untimely-rain-in-every-maharashtra-district-in-last-5-years/articleshow/88483763.cms||---
---||Chennai||Keep health infrastructure ready: Experts to Tamil Nadu govt||CHENNAI: The steady increase in Omicron cases combined with inadequate vaccination coverage and lack of Covid appropriate behaviour ahead of the upcoming festivals has increased the risk of Covid resurgence by several fold, experts told chief minister M K Stalin on Friday. Keep infrastructure ready During a review meeting on the prevention and management strategies, WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said Omicron variant may not give healthcare providers time for preparation. The rise and fall of new cases will be rapid. The variant has a high transmission rate, evades antibodies and immunity, she said. The state must stock up on beds, oxygen, drugs, testing kits. Lower transmission rate Although Omicron may be causing fewer hospitalisations and deaths, absolute numbers will be high if daily new cases are high. The state must enforce stringent covid appropriate behaviour. Experts also said vaccines play a key role. At least 8.8 lakh people in TN haven’t taken any vaccine and 9.4 lakh are yet to complete the course. Go easy on parties Health secretary J Radhakrishnan pitched for muted celebrations, online darshans, and virtual celebrations during Christmas, New Year, and Pongal. While all international passengers will be screened at the airport, those coming from ‘at risk’ countries will undergo mandatory testing on days 1 and 8 besides 7-day domiciliary quarantine. Need for rapid testing kits “We need rapid antigen kits, at least in hotspots, so contacts can be quickly identified and isolated. As cases increase, the turnaround time for RTPCR results will also go up. This can increase transmission,” said National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Prabhdeep Kaur. “The sensitivity of newer antigen tests is good, and it is being used across the globe.” Community engagement Public health officials will release education materials along with media briefs to prevent misinformation. “Hospitals will use digital display boards to inform about the condition of inpatients. No visitors will be allowed to enter isolation wards,” said director of public health Dr T S Selvavinayagam||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/keep-health-infrastructure-ready-experts-to-tamil-nadu-govt/articleshow/88483781.cms||---

Investors are pouring money due to strong growth in the business, ranging from 2x in 3 years to 8x in 10. When Spinny raised $283 million earlier this month, it had more than doubled its valuation to $1.8 billion in just 6 months. Similarly, Cars24 saw its valuation jump 60% to $3.3 billion in just 3 months in December. CarDekho raised $250 million in October, including $200-million series-E equity and $50-million debt in its pre-IPO round, while Droom closed the first leg of its ongoing pre-IPO growth funding round of up to $200 million. According to a recent OLX Auto-Crisil study, the country’s used car sales will nearly double its tally to 7 million units in 4 years from just under 4 million units in FY21. According to estimates, the segment should end FY22 at just under 4.4 million units. “The used car market will hit 10 million vehicles by FY30 at a 14% CAGR — how many segments can promise that kind of growth?” Given that only 6-8% of this is currently digital, “much of the funds will go into digitising a larger share of the ecosystem,” said OLX Autos CEO Amit Kumar. Unicorn startups are already adding manpower and markets as they scale up tech infrastructure. Spinny founder & CEO Niraj Singh said, “We’re present in 13 cities and will expand to 25 cities in two quarters and we’ve gone from a 40-strong headcount in our tech and products team to 200. We’re investing in scale-up.” “We’re scaling up our presence in Australia, Thailand and Middle East and we will use these funds for further international expansion,” said Cars24 founder & CEO Vikram Chopra. The funding floodgates and aggression of the unicorns means that market leaders are also stepping on the gas. Mahindra First Choice Wheels, which has 50% share in the organised used car market. Its CEO Ashutosh Pandey said, “We are planning a fund-raise to increase our lead in the retail side.” Auto experts say the investment optimism in used cars is more with an eye on the future. “Investments in used cars is like FOMO — people feel they will be left out of the next bull run,” said Pandey. “What happened with mobile phones in last 10 years will happen in pre-owned cars too. The pandemic and chip shortage are tail winds for new cars but the long waitlist has prompted consumers to turn to used cars. This is a growing category globally, where the used to new ratio is 3:1 whereas in India it is 1.5:1 and growing fast,” added Vikram Chopra of Cars24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/used-car-companies-in-top-gear-3-unicorns-in-2021/articleshow/88483774.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

He was 90. The Tamil film industry got its first national award for best film through his Marupakkam in 1991, 16 years after he made a mark in Tamil movies with the MGR-starrer 'Naallai Nammathe', a remake of 'Yaadon Ki Baraat'. The Malayalam movie 'Achanum Bappayum' won the Nargis Dutt award for best feature film on national integration. 'Venal Kinavukal' scripted by M T Vasudevan Nair was Sethumadhavan's last Malayalam movie. In Tamil, 'Nammavar' (1994) starring Kamal Haasan, Nagesh and Gauthami was his last movie. To Hindi film buffs, Sethumadhavan is known as the director of 'Julie' (1975), an inter-community love story remade in Tamil in 1984 as 'Oh Maane Maane'. Starting his career as an assistant director in 1951, Sethumadhavan made his directorial debut with the Sinhalese movie Veeravijaya in 1961. He went on to direct over 60 movies in different languages, including Malayalam, Kannada and Tamil. He won 10 national film awards and eight Kerala state film awards and was bestowed the J C Daniel Award for his lifetime contribution to cinema in 2009. 'Kannum Karalum', 'Panithiratha Veedu', 'Chattakari' and 'Vazhve Mayam' were some of his movies that achieved cult status in Malayalam. It was Sethumadhavan who first introduced Kamal Hassan as a child artist in his movie 'Kannum Karalum' in 1962. Later he had Hassan in a lead role in his 1974 movie 'Kanyakumari'. Mammootty made his debut as a junior artist in Sethumadhavan's 1971 movie Anubhavangal Palichakal. Sethumadhavan's Odayilninnu, Achanum Bappayum, Yakshi, Chattakkari, Oppol, Punarjanman, Panitheeratha Veedu etc were based on stories by eminent writers in Malayalam. His first movie Gnanasundari was based on a short story by Mutath Varkey. 'Odayilninnu', in which Sathyan played a rickshaw puller, was based on the novel by Keshavadev and won national award for best Malayalam feature film. 'Panitheerathaveedu', an adaptation of a novel by Parappurath, brought him plaudits. Sethumadhavan also made films based on the literary works of Uroob, Thoppil Bhasi, K T Muhammed, Malayatoor Ramachandran and C Radhakrishnan. "For Sethumadhavan, movies were an extension of literature and he successfully adapted many popular characters of Malayalam literature to the silver screen without compromising on their integrity", said director-writer Madhupal. 'Kanyakumari' and 'Oppol', written by M T Vasudevan Nair, are the best examples of Sethumadhavan's talent," Madhupal said. The film 'Chattakkari', written by Thoppil Bhasi based on the novel by Pamman, was another notable Sethumadhavan movie. Sethumadhavan is survived by his wife Valsala, sons Sonukumar and Santhosh, and daughter Uma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/noted-filmmaker-k-s-sethumadhavan-dies-at-90-in-chennai/articleshow/88483804.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Bill tabled to make minister pro-chancellor of universities||MUMBAI: The state government on Friday tabled amendments to the Maharashtra Public Universities Act to introduce the post of a pro-chancellor which will be occupied by the minister of higher and technical education. The pro-chancellor's powers are to be wide ranging: from chairing the university's senate, its high-level decision-making body, to presiding over the convocation ceremony in the absence of the chancellor. TimesViewMaharashtra now holds the dubious reputation of going against the broader national policy of depoliticizing campuses. Experts are worried about the likely impact on universities if the minister begins to chair meetings. Interference in day-to-day functioning of campuses by politicians goes against the spirit of academic freedom. It bears repetition that this government sought to directly appoint a registrar to the Mumbai University by sidestepping the procedure. The courts had to intervene and the state lost the caseTOI has access to a copy of the draft bill that was tabled in the upper house. It will come up for discussion in the coming week. Experts say the move is a blow to the autonomy of the universities. 'Amendments retrograde, detrimental to higher edu'Among the amendments, the state has also proposed altering the selection method of the vice chancellor. The state will now receive the list of five nominees picked by the selection panel, shortlist two for the consideration of the governor, the chancellor of universities. "If the state does not approve any of the person so recommended, it may call for a fresh panel either from the same committee or after constitution of a new committee," said the draft. The plan has been roundly criticised by eminent academicians. "The concept of autonomous universities was given to us by the Britishers. Under that the VC is the head of the institution and no one can enter the campus or interfere in its functioning. The chancellor is expected to save the university from the influence of the state government or politics. That freedom should not be taken away. We are facing a conflicting situation," said former vice chancellor of Pune University Ram Takawle. Bhushan Patwardhan, former vice chairman of University Grants Commission, said the amendments are "retrograde" and "detrimental" to higher education. "These changes will have long term adverse impact on the universities. The amendments are crossing all limits. Ministerial level interference in the appointment of the VC and selecting a person of their choice and ideology is like taking over education. If the universities' freedom is taken away, the central government will have to step in and stop this. I hope the state reconsiders these amendments," said Patwardhan. He recalled that in 30 years of being a part of the university system, he had never seen such interference. Some other states have made attempts to dilute the autonomy of their universities but those were met with protests and the states were forced to retreat. Except once, when the Maharashtra Public Universities Bill was amended in 1974 and all financial powers were taken away by the state, including the right to create new positions. "With these proposals, the state has murdered the autonomy of universities," said former pro-vice chancellor of Mumbai University A D Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-bill-tabled-to-make-minister-pro-chancellor-of-universities/articleshow/88483813.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Those aged 65 and older, overseas travellers, health workers, sufferers from chronic ailments and all adults living in “high risk” areas are eligible, the officials said. “Bhutan becomes the first country in the South Asian region to administer booster doses,” public service broadcaster BBS said. Officials said Bhutan planned to inoculate more than 2,28,000 people in a week. “As we did for the second dose, mix and match is recommended even for the booster, given its higher efficacy,” an official said. Bhutan has not reported any cases of Omicron so far. The nation of about 7,50,000 people says it has vaccinated more than 93% of people older than 12 with a second dose. It has reported just three deaths linked to Covid and 2,659 cases since the pandemic started||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/bhutan-becomes-1st-south-asian-nation-to-start-booster-drive/articleshow/88483814.cms||---

The number of cancellations globally as of Friday morning added up to more than 3,000, the Flight Aware website showed. It was the latest blow to the holiday season, mainly caused by the new and highly transmissible Omicron variant. In the Unites States, Delta Air Lines said that it had cancelled about 135 flights for Friday after exhausting “all options and resources,” including rerouting and substituting planes and crews to cover scheduled flights. It attributed the cancellations to “a combination of issues, including but not limited to, potential inclement weather in some areas and the impact of the Omicron variant.” United Airlines cancelled at least 150 flights scheduled to leave dozens of airports on Friday — along with 44 more that were supposed to take off on Saturday, according to Flight Aware. Other airlines, including JetBlue and Allegiant, did likewise, although American Airlines said on Friday that it currently had no flight cancellations. In Australia, dozens of flights were cancelled at airports in the major cities of Sydney and Melbourne as cases surged in the country, which has recorded more than 500 Omicron cases. Many airline staff members are unable to work after being identified as close contacts of positive coronavirus cases, airline officials said. And in Europe, a spokeswoman for the Eurostar train service said that because of travel restrictions across the continent, a small number of trains had been cancelled amid a drop in demand. Customers took to social media to air their grievances about the cancellations. “I feel like screaming. Daughter in Sydney did all the right things. Double vacc(ination), boostered, PCR test, Qld border pass. Jetstar just cancelled her flight to Bris(bane). No explanation,” a Brisbane resident wrote on Twitter||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/thousands-of-flight-cancellations-across-globe-upend-holiday-travel/articleshow/88483822.cms||---

After Thursday’s explosion at Ludhiana court complex, in which one person died and six were injured, the state police head office in a communication shared with its officers mentioned the high possibility of explosion having been triggered by an IED. It indicates to a ‘terror attack’ though the blast probe is at a preliminary stage now, says the communication. The Punjab Police headquarters had earlier also shared a series of inputs on July 9 and December 7, about the plans of ISI and pro-Khalistan terror outfits to carry out multiple terror attacks in the state. These inputs included warning about the possibility of the use of powerful IEDs by terror outfits to target vital installations and places of high footfalls. The state police officers have been asked to meticulously follow a number of counter measures suggested earlier by the police headquarters through alerts and advisories to avoid any further untoward incident. All commissioners of police, SSPs, range IGPs and DIGs have been advised to involve themselves personally in the planning and review of security arrangements and satisfy themselves about the preventive and precautionary measures being taken to avoid any untoward incident. Police officers have been asked to allocate additional resources for enhanced intelligence coverage of hotspots, to ensure thorough anti-sabotage checks in and around the peripheral areas of vital installations and check antecedents of persons residing in nearby areas. The field police officers have also been advised to deploy special round-the-clock armed nakas in the areas of all court complexes; establishments related to police, defence and central armed police forces besides other vital installations. Instructions have also been issued fordeployment of quick reaction teams at all strategic locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-alert-very-high-threat-of-terror-attack-by-pak-isi-pro-khalistan-forces/articleshow/88482608.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Chandigarh||Ludhiana explosion: Cops may quiz Jalalabad blast case accused||Ludhiana: A day after the blast in Ludhiana district courts complex, police officers on Friday hinted at a link between Thursday’s explosion and the Jalalabad cycle blast which had led to the arrest of many accused by Jagraon cops about one and half months ago. There is also a possibility that these accused may be brought on a production warrant for investigation in this case. On November 13, Ludhiana rural police had arrested two persons for providing shelter and logistical support to Jalalabad blast accused Ranjeet Singh alias Gora. Those arrested were identified as Gora’s father Jaswant Singh alias Shinda Baba of Jhugge Nihanga Wale village in Ferozepur and Balwant Singh of Walipur Khurd village in Ludhiana. The case is being investigated by the NIA. A senior officer of Ludhiana rural police said that following the arrests they had recovered 5kg of RDX from a paint box hidden by Gora in agriculture fields at Ali Ke village near India-Pakistan border in Ferozepur district. He added that all the accused are in Ludhiana Jail now.  The officer, who did not want to named, said the accused were part of a terror module and since such modules are interconnected, they could provide some sort of information in the Ludhiana bomb blast case. He added that there were indications of possibility of such attack following recovery of explosives, including RDX, from the Ferozepur border and 1 kg and 800 grams of another explosive from a person in Nathowal area. A Ludhiana police officer, who is a senior investigator, said they might bring the Jalalabad bomb blast accused on production remand for questioning in the case. Former DGP Shashi Kant said that such incidents suggest that central agencies and Punjab police haven’t been able to neutralise the sleeper cells. He added that terror modules are linked with each other so a perpetrator in one incident had links with persons behind other such incidents. He further said that jailed persons involved in such explosive-related cases should be questioned as they could provide leads. UAPA case After a tiffin bomb was found in fields at Ferozepur, on November 1, Ludhiana rural police had registered a case under sections 212 (harbouring offender) and 216 (harbouring offender) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 18 and 19 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) Act at Police Station Sidhwan Bet in Ludhiana Rural in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ludhiana-explosion-cops-may-quiz-jalalabad-blast-case-accused/articleshow/88482632.cms||Shariq Majeed

This is the third confirmed case of Omicron among patients under institutional quarantine in Kolkata. Earlier, a seven-year-old boy from Farakka and a 49-year-old from Kolkata had tested positive for this variant at Telangana and New Delhi. Even though the Omicon count in Bengal is not yet alarming, health experts fear the number could multiply soon given its high transmissibility. The state health department on Friday asked all private hospitals to keep their infrastructure ready and called a meeting with them on Monday. The latest Omicron patient, a resident of south Kolkata, has been working in Dublin, Ireland, for the past five years. He reached the city last Friday, flying from Manchester via Abu Dhabi and New Delhi. He tested negative on arrival but developed symptoms later and was admitted to Woodlands Hospital after testing Covid positive. "The patient has been allotted a single room in the Covid-19 unit as per the isolation protocol. He is stable," said Rupali Basu, MD & CEO of Woodlands. Currently, two other Covid patients in hospital isolation - one in Kolkata and another in Kharagur - are awaiting genome-sequencing reports. Another 26-year-old woman, who arrived in Kolkata from UK on December 10, tested negative for Omicron on Friday. She was Covid negative on arrival but was admitted to Beliaghata ID Hospital after developing symptoms. 'Pvt hosps must ramp up infra for Omicron cases' The five Omicron cases in the state and the suspected ones have international travel history. Anticipating more such international flyers needing hospital isolation, the health authorities have asked private hospitals not to refuse international flyers, who test positive on arrival, and prefer private hospital treatment. "Some Covid-positive international travellers prefer private hospitals. Private facilities need to step up isolation infrastructure for suspected and confirmed Omicron cases," said a health official. The health department has shared a document, 'Infrastructure information regarding private hospital for isolation of Covid Omicron suspect admission from the airport' with private hospitals. The hospitals have to update details, including number of Covid beds, Covid ICU beds, isolated beds for international flyers and the number of ventilators. "We will have an online meeting with private hospitals on Monday where Covid infrastructure update, with stress on facilities for Covid-positive international travellers and those detected with Omicron," said a Swasthya Bhawan official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-omicron-case-in-kolkata-govt-calls-meet-of-private-hospitals/articleshow/88483910.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He promised that AAP will give a strong government in Punjab and punish the masterminds behind such crimes, if voted to power. He also announced his five point agenda for maintaining peace in the state and assured to eradicate the menace of drugs within six months of coming to power. Addressing a rally in support of party candidate Raman Behal here, Kejriwal said, “There are some people for sure who are trying to vitiate the atmosphere of Punjab. Why are all these incidents happening ahead of elections? Last time also, about a week before the 2017 assembly elections, there was a bomb blast at Maur; in 2015, a sacrilege incident had happened in Bargari and now again ahead of elections, some people have hatched a conspiracy to disturb the atmosphere of Punjab. Who are these people behind such incidents? Referring to the December 18 incident in Amritsar, the AAP convener said, “According to me, the person who did the act of desecration inside the Golden Temple was sent by someone, some mastermind who is sitting somewhere and making it happen. Unless that mastermind is held, such incidents will continue to happen.” On the the 2015 sacrilege incident, he said the government changed but justice was not delivered. “The Akali government was replaced by Congress, Amarinder Singh was replaced by (Charanjit Singh) Channi), yet there is no justice. This indicates that the governments are supporting the culprits,” he alleged. “What should we construe? That they all are hand in glove?” he asked. Taking a swipe at the Congress over its “internal disputes”, Kejriwal claimed that the Punjab government was so weak that “this minister is fighting that, the Punjab (Congress) president is fighting with the chief minister; how will they run the government”. On the FIR against Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia, he said it took them five years to file a case against him, and now Navjot Singh Sidhu and Channi are bragging about their “achievement” (of registration of FIR against Majithia). “Did the filing of FIR against one person eradicate drug trade? No it has not happened. They are doing dirty politics. They don’t mean to abolish drugs but get votes. There are drug dealers in every district who will catch them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sacrilege-blast-incidents-happening-as-punjab-govt-weak-kejri/articleshow/88482649.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Nagpur||Felling of trees: Forest officials wake up after ex-RFO strike||NAGPUR: Even as the hunger strike by retired range forest officer (RFO) KD Shriwas and deputy sarpanch of Pahadsinghi Uttam Khule entered the third day, there is no action against the officials and contractor involved in the illicit felling of big 59 trees on reserve forest land in Alegaon range under Akola division. Shirwas, who worked for 14 years in the Alegaon range before his retirement, has alleged that 59 trees have been felled in the forest area, which is adjoining the farm of by Prakash Dakhore, who owns 1.4-acre, and his kin Laxmi Dakhore who owns 3.36-acre land. There were 8 teak trees on both the farms. However, on March 15, 2021, Dakhore sought permission to fell 72 teak trees claiming the trees were on both farms. The forest officials concerned granted permission to cut these trees without visiting the spot. Tree felling started the next day and 67 trees were felled. Of these, 59 trees measuring 150-cm in width were felled on forest land and only 8 trees were on farmers’ land. Five trees are still standing on forest land. An inquiry was conducted by the inquiry officer & ACF HP Padgavahankar in August this year but the report is not acceptable to the senior forest officials or the farm owner. Shriwas had pursued the matter for the last eight months by sending letters and reminders to deputy conservator Arjuna KR for action in the case. However, ahead of the launch of the hunger strike on December 22, the deputy conservator swung into action, and on December 20, wrote to the revenue department to take up the exercise to demarcate forest and private land boundaries. Arjuna asked the retired RFO to withdraw the hunger strike till taluka land record (TLR) officials submit a report. “If it is found that illicit tree felling has been done on forest land then action would be taken against all, including forest officials,” he said. Shriwas says this is a classic case of fence eating the farm. “Every attempt is being made by the deputy conservator to save the forest officials who issued tree felling permission without visiting the spot. If my allegations are not true then why were hammer marks on the felled timber removed,” he asked. Green activist Sheikh Munna Sheikh said, “If the inquiry conducted by forest officer is not acceptable then it is surprising that forest department is not trusting its officers and listening to a private party to whom this report is not acceptable. The move to demarcate the boundaries afresh is just an eyewash.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/felling-of-trees-forest-officials-wake-up-after-ex-rfo-strike/articleshow/88481611.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Bengal advocate general S N Mookherjee made the submission on Friday before a Calcutta High Court division bench, led by Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava. Mookherjee stated that the Raj Bhavan cleared the bill on Wednesday. Accordingly on Thursday, the state election commission proposed polls to Howrah Municipal Corporation, along with Bidhannagar, Asansol, Siliguri and Chandernagore, on January 22. The polls to Howrah and Bally were earlier planned to be held along with that to Kolkata Municipal Corporation on December 19. The governor had in November returned the bill sent for his assent after it was passed by the state assembly. He had held that the authorities acted in an “arbitrary, unfair and non-judicious manner”, and sought a clarification from the government over its decision to bifurcate Howrah. The Bally wards had been merged with Howrah Municipal Corporation in 2014. Raj Bhavan sources said the governor’s assent to the bifurcation came only after the government sent a clarification of its decision, turning down objections raised by a section of citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-clears-bifurcation-bill-makes-way-for-howrah-bally-polls/articleshow/88482383.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||GJM ex-leader Binay Tamang joins TMC ahead of GTA polls||Darjeeling: Former Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leader Binay Tamang joined the Trinamool Congress in Kolkata on Friday, embarking on a new political journey. In June, Tamang had resigned as president of his faction of the GJM, announcing his decision to embark on a “teshro adhya (third chapter)”. Tamang was handed the party flag by senior leader and state education minister Bratya Basu. “I have always worked for the people. I feel joining the Trinamool will give me a better and larger scope to help the Hills community,” he said. Former Kurseong MLA Rohit Sharma also joined TMC along with Tamang. Tamang and Anit Thapa had rebelled against GJM president Bimal Gurung in 2007 to form the second faction of the party. Thapa went on to float the Bharatiya Gorkha Prajatantrik Morcha (BGPM) earlier this year. The BGPM president, however, refused to be drawn into Tamang’s move, saying it was the prerogative of every individual to take decisions in a democracy. “I wish him well for his new political innings,” said Thapa. The BGPM leader said his party will always work in cooperation with the TMC government. “Everyone is aware that chief minister Mamata Banerjee trusts us. She refused to field her party candidate in the elections. She respects regional politics and its importance in a political alliance,” Thapa added. Law minister Moloy Ghatak said, “The joining of Tamang and Sharma will bring a significant shift in Hills politics. They are joining the party to be part of the development initiatives taken by Mamata Banerjee.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gjm-ex-leader-binay-tamang-joins-tmc-ahead-of-gta-polls/articleshow/88482360.cms||Deep Gazmer

---||Kolkata||Bengal to seek legal opinion on making CM interim chancellor, says edu minister||Kolkata: The Bengal government is seeking legal opinion on whether the chief minister can be made the chancellor of state-run universities for an interim period as the governor, the present chancellor, has failed to see anything positive in Bengal universities, education minister Bratya Basu said on Friday. “We will explore the constitutional provisions and take legal advice on whether this can be done at a provincial level,” he said in response to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s statement that he would like to call for a UGC probe into private universities’ role. Basu took it as a threat and said: “After CBI and ED, UGC is being used as a threat.” The statement comes after Dhankhar took to Twitter to post a video in which he said none of the 11 private university chancellors or vice-chancellors had heeded his invitation – as the university visitor and governor – to attend a Raj Bhavan meeting on December 23. The governor said he would urge UGC to “seriously probe” the role of private universities since these have “breached their roles regarding the visitor”, and asked the Bengal government to re-examine appointments of all vice-chancellors. Dhankhar complained that VCs were appointed bypassing him and said the situation was “alarming which indicated the rule of the ruler and not law”. Vice-chancellors staying away from a Raj Bhavan meeting was not the first such instance. In January 2020, vice-chancellors of state-run universities didn’t turn up for a meeting at Raj Bhavan, sparking a war of words. In the present instance, the private university heads had cited “Omicron” and their personal health fears due to age and comorbidities. Basu said: “It is sad that we hear nothing positive from him (Dhankhar). He must shed this confrontationist attitude and work as an enabler. He now cites unionism and gives the threat of UGC. Like CBI and ED, UGC now comes to the list. You can’t expect anything more from a person who had been the legal aide of a movie star implicated in killing deer.” Basu further said: “But if he continuously sits on files, delays decisions and appointments, we will explore the suggestion made by the Kerala governor and consider whether as an interim measure, we can replace him by the chief minister as university chancellor.” Kerala governor Arif Mohammad Khan had, in an attempt to end animosity with his own government, written to CM Pinarayi Vijayan to take over as chancellor so that the governor didn’t have to interfere in “political appointments” in his role as chancellor. The Bengal government had in 2019 curbed the chancellor’s role after it felt that the governor was standing in the way of education matters. This rule gives the chancellor little leg room in choosing vice-chancellors. The chancellor now has little power to take punitive action against vice-chancellors. Even all communications from the chancellor to vice-chancellors must be routed through the higher education department. While this was limited to state-run universities, the issue has now extended to private universities where the governor is a visitor. The 2019 rules were framed after differences between the state and the governor over Kalyani University VC’s appointment came out in the open.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-to-seek-legal-opinion-on-making-cm-interim-chancellor-says-edu-minister/articleshow/88482405.cms||---

The Rail Land Development Authority on Friday invited bids for the project that will entail redeveloping 96 quarters for railway employees on 6,000sqm land and utilising the remaining 16,000sqm for commercial and residential projects. The reserve price for 99-year lease on the latter land parcel is Rs 26.7 crore. The successful bidder will have to redevelop the railway quarters within two years. “The twin towns of NJP and Siliguri are the gateway to Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Gangtok hill stations. The plot of land in question is square in shape and surrounded by prominent landmarks like a government girls’ high school in the west and railway offices in the east. It is linked with the main road of the city on the northern periphery. The NJP station is a 10-minute drive from the land parcel. The land is free from any obstruction or encroachment and development can start immediately,” said RLDA vice-chairman Ved Parkash Dudeja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rlys-invites-bids-for-njp-quarters-revamp/articleshow/88482382.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||‘Vision for Kolkata’ & 10-pt agenda in works: Mayor-in-waiting Hakim||KOLKATA: Kolkata Municipal Corporation will now concentrate on relaxing thika tenancy rules to enable citizens to build their own residential houses on thika land located across the city, especially in slums. This new plan will be included in a 10-point agenda for the city’s development, said Firhad Hakim, the mayor-in-waiting after taking oath of office as an elected councillor at the KMC headquarters on Friday. Besides Hakim, 124 elected councillors, including Independents and lone Congress councillor Santosh Pathak, took the oath of office. Later, Hakim said he was working on a “vision for Kolkata” agenda that promises to take the city towards the path of development. The vision will include a 10-point growth agenda that has been mentioned in Trinamool Congress’ election manifesto for the KMC polls. “We are committed to take up development agenda for the city, as has been desired by our party chief Mamata Banerjee, and implement the same on time,” Hakim said. He added that he was consulting would-be mayor-in-council members in this regard before entrusting party councillors and civic officials with implementation of the goals. According to KMC sources, Hakim was keen on augmenting the city’s water supply system, improving its century-old drainage system, and making the city cleaner and pollution-free. “These issues, along with housing schemes for the urban poor, are high on our agenda, as stated by the mayor-in-waiting,” said a KMC official posted at the civic headquarters. Speaking on pro-growth measures, Hakim said the councillors would need to play a crucial role in this regard. “We will explain everything to the newly elected councillors, train them on how to take up development projects in their wards and finish these on time,” he said. According to Hakim, councillors would need to take an examination every six months. “We shall prepare a report card of the councillors every six months judging their performance. If a councillor performs well, we shall entrust him/her with taking up bigger development work. If he/she fails, they will be given a second chance to perform better,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vision-for-kol-10-pt-agenda-in-works-mayor-in-waiting-hakim/articleshow/88482340.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Kolkata||Centre must withdraw proposed GST hike on natural fibres: Amit Mitra||KOLKATA: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman should urgently call a meeting of the GST Council and roll back the proposed GST hike on natural fibres, fabrics and garments, Amit Mitra said on Friday. The textile and clothing industry has expressed concerns over the council’s proposed plan to implement GST rate hike for fabrics and garments from 5% to 12% from January 1, 2022, arguing that this would affect 85% of the industry and nearly 80% of final products. They pointed out that GST rate was already 12% for garments worth over Rs 1,000. The proposed GST hike would result in job losses of over 15 lakh in main and ancillary units, Mitra, the principal chief adviser to CM Mamata Banerjee, said at a virtual meeting. “The additional 7% GST would lead to closure of 1 lakh small units. The Centre is saying it wants to correct the inverted duty structure because GST on manmade fibre is 18%. But manmade fibre is only 15% of the industry and the rest is natural fibre,” he added. The Centre’s argument on the inverted duty structure issue relates to a segment of the textile value chain that, according to stakeholders, constitutes not more than 15% of the total industry. According to Mitra, textile is a Rs 5.4 lakh crore industry and 80-85% of it comprises natural fibre. It employs over 39 million people. In Bengal, the Metiaburuz cluster generates an annual business of Rs 20,000 crore, Mitra added. The total tax collection from the entire value chain is Rs 19,000-21,000 crore, the former Bengal finance minister said. He pointed out that the Centre has estimated an additional Rs 7,000 crore revenue from the planned hike. But this may come at the cost of job losses and a major hike in prices of garments as cotton price too has gone up by 70% in the last one year, he added. “The incremental revenue too may not come as a lot of units may close and a lot of small units, which were in informal sector prior to GST, may go back to the old days,” Mitra said. Earlier, WBHA president and Lux Industries Ltd chairman Ashok Todi said that another increment would lead to a severe drop in consumption, or a shift to cheaper and lower quality goods. FOHMA vice-president Sanjay Kumar Jain had said: “We believe that a far more beneficial and reasonable solution will not only resolve the inverted duty structure anomaly but also give a fillip to the industry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centre-must-withdraw-proposed-gst-hike-on-natural-fibres-mitra/articleshow/88482428.cms||---

If he has any evidence linking an Akali leader with any such heinous crime, he should make it public immediately. If not, he should issue a public apology for trying to politicize the tragedy,” said Sukhbir while speaking to media after addressing a rally in favour of S R Kaler in Jagraon and Baldev Singh Manuke in Nihalsinghwala. Pointing out that five more blasts had taken place in different parts of Punjab during the last four months, he said the chief minister should give a status report of the probe into them. “It is clear that the government has been caught sleeping. It has been busy trying to frame its political rivals and given a field day to anti-national forces,” he said. Had the government probed the earlier blasts, the Ludhiana tragedy could have been averted, he claimed. The Akali leader also referred to the attempt to murder cases registered against the sons of party’s Moga district president Teerath Singh Mahla on trumped up charges. Once the SAD-BSP alliance government is formed in the state, all false cases would be probed by a commission and action taken against those who filed them, he warned. He said the next government would also review all anti-people decisions taken by the Congress government in the past three months. Regarding the recent cases of sacrilege at Anandpur Sahib and Amritsar, he slammed the chief minister and the home minister for laxity, saying the accused in both cases were handed over to police but there was no follow up action. “This has hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community worldwide,” he added. Sukhbir also met advocate Kuldeep Singh Mand and Krishan Kumar who were injured in the Ludhiana blast and are admitted at the Dayanand Medical College (DMC) hospital. Asking the chief minister to extend ex gratia grant to the injured immediately, he said, “This should be your priority instead of launching a blame game against your political rivals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/show-proof-linking-ludhiana-blast-to-political-rivals-sukhbir-challenges-cm/articleshow/88482695.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Societies that change redevelopment builder must ensure new allottees get flats: MahaRera||MUMBAI: In an order that clarifies the role of a housing society in redevelopment projects, the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (Maha-RERA) recently held that societies have a duty to give reasons when changing a builder midway and must also honour allotments made by the old builder towards buyers of the project’s free sale component. “The rights and interests of allottees in a redevelopment project are not extinguished on account of change of developer at all stages and the onus of safeguarding the interest of the allottees is on the cooperative housing society appointing the new developer,” said MahaRERA while protecting the rights of those who had booked flats a decade ago in a project at Kurla. The society had in March 2018 terminated a 2010 development agreement with its erstwhile builder on the grounds that he had “abandoned” the project, brought in a new builder in November 2018 and registered the project afresh under the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (under it, every project, pending or new, is required to be registered). The society said it had no liability, and the old buyers—who said they had paid substantial amounts—should take up their issue with the old builder. Rera cancels new regn, tells soc to change name of bldrMahaRERA stepped in, cancelled the subsequent project registration and directed the society to take steps as mandated under RERA for changing the name of the builder seamlessly, and till then protect the interests of the buyers and ensure their allotment was complied with even after changing the builder. The order, given by MahaRERA chairperson Ajoy Mehta on December 3, held that in such projects, a housing society has the dual responsibility of not only ensuring that its original members are rehabilitated but also that the new allottees in the sale component are put in possession of the premises offered for sale. Several buyers who had booked flats in 2012 in the redevelopment project contended through their advocate, Dhrumil Shah, that the society had initiated redevelopment in 2010 by entering into a development agreement with a builder and they had come into the picture and cannot be left out in the cold. They sought orders to the society and the new builder to ensure that their allotment was secured and also sought orders for completion of the project (Vishwas CHS) and get compensation. The MahaRERA chief held, “A cooperative housing society in a redevelopment project is mandated under the said Act to not only inform MahaRERA, but also provide for reasons for change and seek permission with regard to any change in the developer/promoter at any point in time during the development of the real estate project.” He said it is the society which brings in a builder and permits him to bring in free sale buyers to ensure financial viability of the rehabilitation component of the project and hence has a duty towards such buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/societies-that-change-redevelopment-builder-must-ensure-new-allottees-get-flats-maharera/articleshow/88483946.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Bhopal||Indore Metro caught in seismic-zone ‘faultlines’||BHOPAL: Seismic factors may trigger the next political rumbler in Madhya Pradesh. The Congress has called for an independent inquiry into the shifting of Indore metro rail project from Seismic zone-II to zone-IV, alleging that this ‘unprecedented’ alteration has led to massive loss of revenue to the government while benefiting certain business houses. Congress leader Jitu Patwari has alleged that the government is shying away from sharing copies of the feasibility report and DPR related to Indore metro rail in response to his questions in assembly. “The city was kept in zone-II in the feasibility report. It was shifted to another zone for more money. Experts from IIT and other departments should carry out an independent study to assess whether Indore actually falls in a ‘severe intensity’ area, like Jammu, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Sikkim, northern UP, Bihar, West Bengal, parts of Gujarat and a small region of Maharashtra near the west coast and Rajasthan. MP is nowhere there,” Patwari told TOI. Construction costs are significantly higher in seismic-IV areas than zone-II because of higher safety standards. The Bureau of Indian Standards divides the country into four seismic zones — Zone-II to V, based on seismic history. Zone IV is the most seismic active region, say experts. Patwari has sought details about the ‘two geological faults’ that are being cited as a key reason behind shifting of seismic zones for the Indore rail project. He has asked for precise locations and distance of these ‘faults’ from the project site. Only 1% of Indore metro rail project has been developed, assembly informedI’d like to know if every bridge and high-rise in Indore is made as per zone-IV protocols. Ahmedabad, which records earthquakes every year, is in Zone III category,” he points out. “If a study finds that there is no ‘geological fault’ in Indore, the additional budget incurred by the government should be recovered from those accountable for it,” he said, adding that if there is “indeed so much danger, the project should have been abandoned instead of putting lives at risk”. Only 1% of Indore metro rail project has been developed, the assembly was informed in response to Patwari’s query on Tuesday. Last month, metro rail authorities had told reporters that a 17km metro rail route at Indore will be operationalised by September, 2023 – close to the assembly polls.

State BJP president Sukanta Majumdar is expected to announce the date of the march from Jalpaiguri on January 10. Compensation for farmers who have been hit hard by untimely rain, farm loan waivers up to Rs 5 lakh, “corruption” in Trinamool-led panchayats over 100-day work guarantee, Prime Minister Awas Yojana and various central schemes for farmers are key issues behind the proposed Nabanna march. BJP national president J P Nadda is likely to visit Bengal in January to meet the new state committee members. At a public meeting in Reyapara on Friday, leader of the opposition and Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari asked the educated youth to file applications under the RTI Act in every gram panchayat to seek information on beneficiaries of several schemes in the 2020-21 financial year. “They are bound to reply to your applications within a month. Gather all information and we will make the same public at the rally in Nimtouri (East Midnapore) on January 6 in the run-up to our Nabanna Abhiyan,” Adhikari said. The MLA cited examples of other states and demanded loan waivers for farmers in Bengal. “Why can’t the government here waive loans of farmers hit by untimely rain when UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath has waived loans up to Rs 3 lakh and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan up to Rs 5 lakh?” Adhikari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-gears-up-for-nabanna-march-ahead-of-civic-polls/articleshow/88482352.cms||---

They have been appointed to boards and corporations — a long-awaited rehabilitation. A handful of BJP organizational workers have also been rewarded. Scindia faithful Imarti Devi has been appointed chairperson of Madhya Pradesh Laghu Udyog Nigam (Small Industries Corporation).

Scindia loyalist Munnalal Goel, who lost from Gwalior (East), has been made chairman of Madhya Pradesh Seeds and Farm Development Corporation. Raghuraj Kansana, who was defeated in Morena, is chairman of Madhya Pradesh Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare Corporation. CM Chouhan has also tried to pacify former BJP MLAs who lost in 2018 and now find themselves cornered by the entry of Team Scindia. Mix of Team Scindia & BJP long-timers on the listThey have to live with long-time bitter political rivals — the ex-Congress leaders who are now in the saffron camp, many of them ministers. So that they are not demoralized by the admission of Scindia loyalists, CM Chouhan has placed Narendra Singh Tomar, who lost from Mandhata in 2018, as vice-chairman of Madhya Pradesh State Tourism Development Corporation.

More hidden money is likely to tumble out as some of his properties in Kannauj are still being searched. The search teams combed 11 premises of Jain and two of his partners — one is a pan masala manufacturer and the other is a transporter. The premises included factory outlets, offices, cold storages and petrol pumps in Kanpur, Mumbai and Gujarat. The raids started simultaneously at 11am. Tax evasion of Rs 3.09 crore through shell companiesOfficials said tax evasion of more than Rs 3 crore through shell companies was discovered. “Jain took loans in the name of shell companies and has huge foreign transactions,” a source said, adding, “Documents are being scrutinised. SBI officials are helping count the seized money.” Jain, who is originally from Chhipatti in Kannauj, is known primarily as a perfume merchant. He has around 40 companies, including two in West Asia, and owns a house, head office and a showroom in Mumbai.

A division bench of Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Rajarshi Bharadwaj observed: “...We direct that the state election commission shall take steps to install CCTV cameras at conspicuous spots in all the main and auxiliary booths across the state in order to maintain transparency and fairness and will preserve the CCTV footage so that in case of need it can be sent for audit.” The bench, while taking note of the petitions alleging violence and coercion during the Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls on December 19, directed the commission to preserve CCTV camera footage from all booths in the city. It also asked the poll panel to preserve diaries of presiding officers, registers containing thumb impression/signature of voters, control units of EVMs and voting records of all booths in sealed cover. The division bench directed petitioners to file their objections to the SEC compliance report and also the affidavit by the state before the court takes up the matter for hearing on January 6. Bengal advocate general S N Mookherjee had submitted the other day that a writ court had no jurisdiction to hear such pleas unless they were filed as election petitions. The bench took note of the SEC’s submission of a tentative time frame to hold polling across 111 civic bodies in two phases on January 22 and February 27 and the submission by advocate general Mookherjee that the Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, had received the governor’s nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/install-cameras-for-civic-polls-cal-hc-tells-sec/articleshow/88482419.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Ahmedabad||‘Typo’ sends Gujarat back into dark ages||AHMEDABAD: When cases of Sati in Gujarat -- rather Amreli district to be precise – rocketed from 0 to 13 this year, it raised the fear that the abolished practice where a widow sacrifices herself on her husband’s pyre had reared its ugly head again. A scramble to find out the cause brought some relief to officials when the “spree” was traced to a data entry error made by an LRD constable. The home department’s official website states that there have been no cases of Sati in Gujarat between 2015 and 2020. However, thanks to the consistent but erroneous ‘typo’ made between January and November, the CID crime records show 2-3 cases registered under the Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act almost every month in Amreli (see box). While all other districts reported zero cases, Amreli registered 13 cases. Superintendent of police (Amreli) Nirlipt Rai said, “We inquired into the matter and have found out this occurred due to an error at the data-entry level. “An LRD constable mistakenly entered the crime figures under the wrong head. I have still sought a fact-finding report. We have not registered a single Sati case in Amreli. “Preliminary enquiry suggests that some cases related to abetment to suicide (IPC Section 306) were mistakenly registered under the Sati Prevention Act.” DGP (CID Crime) Anil Pratham said he was on leave and was not aware of the issue. However, Director General of Police Ashish Bhatia said, “There has been no instance of Sati in Gujarat, but if such data has been put in public domain, we shall enquire and rectify this error.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/typo-sends-gujarat-back-into-dark-ages/articleshow/88484135.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

It was a dream to build an institution in Bahraich in the name of Raja Suheldev. The foundation for a medical college has been laid after Raja Suheldev,” Yogi said. Samajwadi Party exploited farmers, misled youth: CMThe CM said a grand memorial was also being constructed in the honour of the Hindu king. Yogi also accused the SP government of showing disrespect to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel by equating him with Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “In contrast, the BJP government honoured Patel by erecting his tallest statue in the world.” He said the SP exploited farmers, misled the youth and fired at the devotees of Lord Ram. Yogi said the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was moving ahead with the ideology of ‘Ram Rajya’ and is working for the development of all sections of the society. The CM, who was participating in Jan Vishwas Yatra that started from Shrawasti and reached Mehsi via Payagpur and Bahraich, inaugurated and laid foundation for 98 projects worth Rs 35.98 crore and handed over keys of tractors to 15 farmers during a programme in Maharaja Balbhadra Singh area under Mehsi assembly constituency. Later, the yatra proceeded to Lakhimpur Kheri. “BJP sarkar Ram rajya ki kalpana ke saath aage badh rahi hai (the BJP government is progressing with the vision of Ram Rajya). Pradhan Mantri Anna Yojana will start from December 28 under which 35kg of food grain, 1kg daal, 1kg sugar and 1kg oil will be distributed to Antyodaya cardholders besides 5kg food grain per unit to every household of Uttar Pradesh,” Yogi said. “The state government is always ready with bulldozer to trample down those involved in corruption and exploiting the weaker sections. Our government emphasizes on ‘Soch Imaandar, Kaam Damdaar’,” he added. Attacking opposition leaders, the CM said, “Bua-Babua and Bhai-Behen would have been enjoying vacation in London leaving people to die had they been in power during the coronavirus pandemic. The opposition leaders are feeling the pain when they see the construction of Ram temple, highways and medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh. “Recently, PM Narendra Modi handed over Saryu Nahar Pariyojna to farmers of Bahraich, Gonda, Shravasti, Balrampur, Basti, Siddharth Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj district of UP,” he said.

It's longstanding tradition for first ladies to visit Children's National Hospital at Christmastime, but Joe Biden's visit on Friday was a surprise. It marked the first time that a sitting president had joined the fun, the White House said. It wasn't the only tradition that the president joined in on Friday. Jill Biden answered calls to the the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa tracking service, another longstanding tradition for first ladies, and she was joined by Biden for the calls. At the hospital, the Bidens spoke with a group of children making lanterns as part of a winter craft project, asking each one what they drew on their lanterns. Some drew family, snowmen or other holiday-themed art. They both spoke to a child who said the hospital ``helped him when he was down.'' ``Well we hope we're bringing you some joy today,'' Jill Biden responded. The president added, ``You're bringing us some joy, pal.'' Biden also pulled out his phone to show the kids photos of his new dog, Commander, a nearly four-month-old German Shepherd puppy. The dog joined the family this week and was seen playing with a handler on the South Lawn of the White House complex earlier Friday before the Bidens left for their visit to the hospital. ``His name is Commander!'' Jill Biden told the kids. ``And this morning he was eating my slippers!'' The president and first lady then sat before the hospital's Christmas tree, where Jill Biden read ``Olaf's Night Before Christmas'' to the kids, which was broadcast to hundreds of children in their rooms at the hospital. The Walt Disney Co. provided copies of the book for each patient so they can follow along with the first lady, the White House said. Each book includes a White House bookmark designed by her office. The annual tradition of a hospital visit by the first lady dates to Bess Truman, who served in the role from 1945-1953. Before returning to the White House, the two stopped briefly at a Jill Biden-themed Christmas tree set up on the street in D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood by a local business owner. The president hung the 2021 White House Christmas ornament on one of the branches, nestled between large cutouts of Jill's face dotting the tree. Back at the White House, the two capped off their Christmas Eve festivities by answering calls for NORAD, as they watched Santa soar over the United Arab Emirates on the Santa tracker screens. They took three largely pleasant phone calls from kids and parents, though one father capped off an otherwise polite conversation with the president by wishing him a happy holidays and adding, ``Let's go Brandon!'' before hanging up. The phrase has become widely used by conservatives as a stand-in for a more vulgar epithet against the president. Biden didn't seem to catch the caller's intent, however he responded, ``Let's go Brandon, I agree`` as the call came to an end. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Biden's response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-first-lady-visit-hospitalized-kids-on-christmas-eve/articleshow/88484091.cms||---

The restrictions will be in place from 11 pm to 5 am till an indefinite period as the state saw daily Covid-19 cases almost double overnight to 49 on Friday. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said that the number of persons at social events and marriages should also be restricted to a maximum of 200 for closed spaces and 50% of the capacity for open spaces. A government spokesperson said: “A rise in the number of Covid-19 cases is being seen across several states and therefore a need was felt to take some stringent steps. In markets, a policy of ‘no service if no mask’ will be implemented. Vendors and traders would be told not to sell to someone who is not wearing a mask. Masks are also mandatory on roads and in markets. The police have been asked to regularly monitor the situation and public address systems will be used to sensitize people.” The CM has also said that every single person coming into UP will have to be tested, especially in light of the more infectious variant Omicron. Monitoring committees are being reactivated in both urban and rural areas in light of the third wave so that they can help in monitoring spread of infection. Industrial units have been asked to set up Covid helpdesks and day care centers. When asked whether Friday's order will have any bearing on political rallies also, a government official said that there were “no specific orders for political rallies so far” though people will be “encouraged” to wear masks. In the past 24 hours, the state carried out 1,91,428 tests and found 49 fresh cases. In the same period, 12 people recovered from the disease. There are currently 266 active Covid-19 cases in UP and not a single active case in 37 districts. While cases of the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported from several states, UP has reported just two cases so far, both of which have recovered and returned to their home state of Maharashtra, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/uttar-pradesh-imposes-11pm-5am-night-curfew-from-saturday-as-covid-cases-surge/articleshow/88489608.cms||Neha Lalchandani

BJP, which had ensured the smooth passage of Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021 in the assembly on Thursday, failed to clear the council hurdle after Congress and JD(S) members objected to tabling of the bill in the absence of many opposition members. The ruling party, which lacks a majority in the council, had planned to table the bill at the eleventh hour after several members left for their hometowns, hoping to push through the controversial legislation. However, Congress thwarted its plans by staging a vehement protest, alleging that the government was using the absence of members to bulldoze the controversial bill without discussing it on the floor of the house. It also criticised the government’s “arrogance” in tabling the bill at the last minute knowing well that half the members had left for their hometowns early. Finally, the government relented and decided to defer the bill. Social welfare minister and leader of the house Kota Srinivas Poojary announced that the government will take it up in the next session. Earlier, high drama prevailed as chairman Basavaraj Horatti adjourned the house for lunch and asked the members to reassemble at 3pm, indicating that the government would table the controversial bill. This was after the assembly was adjourned sine die before lunch. When there was no sign of reassembling until 4pm, Congress members led by opposition leader in the council SR Patil entered the chairman’s chamber and asked him to adjourn the house sine die. Congress even accused the chair of deliberately delaying the session after lunch to facilitate BJP to get its numbers together.

Poojary moved a motion to bid farewell to 17 members who are retiring. Congress members opposed the move, alleging that it was a strategy to kill some more time to ensure the return of BJP members who had left the session early. Outside, some leaders of both BJP and Congress were seen busy calling up members who were heading back to their constituencies and telling them to return to the house.

At the meeting, opposition leaders gave two options to the government — either extend the council session by two days solely to discuss the bill or take it up at the next session. When the house reassembled, Horatti asked deputy chairman MK Pranesh to preside over the proceedings. Later, Poojary announced that the bill would not be taken up in this session. The anti-conversion bill may not face many hurdles at the next session, considering the BJP’s strength in the council, after January 5, will go up to 37, one short of the simple majority, and it is expected to get the support of Independent Lakhan Jarkiholi, who had contested as rebel BJP candidate in the recent MLC polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/karnataka-anti-conversion-bill-faces-hurdle-in-council-due-to-lack-of-numbers/articleshow/88484195.cms||---

Education minister P Sabitha Reddy said the decision was taken following an advice by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and added that it would be the last time students are promoted even when they fail to secure pass marks. “We have decided to promote all students to ensure students are not under stress when they appear for the second year exams,” said Reddy, adding that there is no fault of the Intermediate Board or the state in students failing in the exam. “Our teachers were in touch with students, they were attending digital classes. We reduced syllabus to 70%, gave learning material, took all precautions in conducting exams. It is disheartening to see people blaming the Board and state for students failing in exam,” she added and made it clear that no technical errors were committed by the Board in evaluating papers. The minister said even after adding 30 marks, barely 83,000 failed students were eligible to be passed. “By keeping their (students) future in mind, we are promoting all students. This is the last time. Don’t assume that students will be promoted if dharnas are staged. Encourage them to study well and clear their papers,” the minister said. Reddy also said that students who wish to better their scores can appear for improvement exams along with second-year subjects. She said that if students who applied for revaluation or recounting are satisfied with pass marks, they can approach the Board for a refund of the fee. In the Intermediate first year exams, of the total 4,09,911 students who appeared, 51% of them flunked. Subsequently, six students had ended their lives after failing in the exam. Even since the results were released, students, their parents and student organisations have been protesting against the Intermediate Board and the state government, demanding that they award pass marks to all students. They have been blaming the Board and the state, alleging that students failed as the state did not conduct online classes properly and held exams without a plan. The state, which earlier promoted first year students to second year because of pandemic, had decided to hold first year exams when students were in the middle of second year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-passes-all-in-1st-year-intermediate-exam-after-suicides-stirs/articleshow/88484207.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

It has also decided to strictly enforce night curfew from 11pm to 5pm and the wearing of masks. Besides, the government will also pressurise the Centre to allow giving booster doses for eligible citizens. "Night curfew is already imposed in the state. We had never withdrawn it. The night curfew is from 11pm to 5am, it should be strictly followed," said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the pandemic review meeting held with doctors and officials of the health and home departments. A detailed guideline is expected to be released soon by the home department on night curfew. The state government is also contemplating making Covid vaccination mandatory. "Collectors to patwaris should motivate and encourage people to get vaccinated. A list of people refusing to get vaccinated has to be prepared. They will be removed from the beneficiary list. We have to do this for their own interest. In Punjab, salaries have been stopped. People in Punjab who refuse to get vaccinated will not be given salaries. Tamil Nadu has made it compulsory. All governments are taking their own steps," Gehlot said. "The state government has to make vaccination compulsory. Those who are refusing have no right to say so as the person can spread the virus to others. So, he does not have the right to refuse..." Collectors asked to scale up vaccination "If we can pass a law in the assembly on wearing face masks and imposing a penalty for not wearing it, then we can do this in the same way. We can give one month's time to get two doses, or we will impose penalties. We have to make vaccination mandatory, only then people will understand the importance of it and come forward," he said. Gehlot also called for booster doses. "The WHO has issued a warning and is saying to get booster doses. It is a major warning. Despite that, the Centre is not moving ahead with the booster dose. The Centre should think about giving booster doses, if not for all then for those who are 60+, people with comorbidities, frontline and healthcare workers. We have to now pressurise the Centre for booster doses," he said, directing health department officials to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding booster doses. District collectors have been directed to scale up vaccination. "It is now the responsibility of the state government to vaccinate people. We have to tell collectors to take it seriously. The vaccination campaign is your (collectors) responsibility," he said. Referring to the Omicron variant, Gehlot said, "Nobody knows what kind of situation will emerge in the coming days. For saving the lives of people, we have to take steps." He recalled the ordeal of people faced shortage of oxygen during the second Covid wave. On wearing face masks, Gehlot directed the home department to take strict measures. He asked them to give citizens four to five days to follow it.

---||Udaipur||CM Ashok Gehlot calls for mandatory Covid vaccination in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Amid rising concerns of the infectious Omicron variant of Covid-19, the government is planning to make vaccination mandatory in the state and has decided to prepare a list of those refusing to get the jab. It has also decided to strictly enforce night curfew from 11pm to 5pm and the wearing of masks. Besides, the government will also pressurise the Centre to allow giving booster doses for eligible citizens. "Night curfew is already imposed in the state. We had never withdrawn it. The night curfew is from 11pm to 5am, it should be strictly followed," said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot during the pandemic review meeting held with doctors and officials of the health and home departments. A detailed guideline is expected to be released soon by the home department on night curfew. The state government is also contemplating making Covid vaccination mandatory. "Collectors to patwaris should motivate and encourage people to get vaccinated. A list of people refusing to get vaccinated has to be prepared. They will be removed from the beneficiary list. We have to do this for their own interest. In Punjab, salaries have been stopped. People in Punjab who refuse to get vaccinated will not be given salaries. Tamil Nadu has made it compulsory. All governments are taking their own steps," Gehlot said. "The state government has to make vaccination compulsory. Those who are refusing have no right to say so as the person can spread the virus to others. So, he does not have the right to refuse..." Collectors asked to scale up vaccination "If we can pass a law in the assembly on wearing face masks and imposing a penalty for not wearing it, then we can do this in the same way. We can give one month's time to get two doses, or we will impose penalties. We have to make vaccination mandatory, only then people will understand the importance of it and come forward," he said. Gehlot also called for booster doses. "The WHO has issued a warning and is saying to get booster doses. It is a major warning. Despite that, the Centre is not moving ahead with the booster dose.

Talking to TOI on the sidelines of JJS that started on Friday, Jain said after the pandemic, some workers did not return to the trade creating shortage of hands at manufacturing units. "About 15% of workers who were engaged in core manufacturing process did not return as they found other livelihood opportunities in their native places," added Jain. While the industry has taken the onus of training new people and is drafting them into the trade, it needs time. "Our association in Sitapura has been training new people, including women who were earlier not part of any jewellery manufacturing process. This this will take time," added Jain. Similarly, raw material pipeline also got exhausted as importing during the lockdown took a hit. "Through organized sales (auctions), it has not stabilized for some categiories of gemstones like rubies. But there is a shortage. So far the countries from where the colour stones are imported not affected by the Omicron virus. If they get affected, there will be pressure on supply of raw materials as well," added Jain. With regard to the demand, exports have declined slightly. But the domestic demand has been holding up pretty well. JJS spokesperson Ajay Kala said, "The wedding demand has been strong. There was pent up demand as well as some of the weddings could not take place last year earlier due to the pandemic. However, we expect the demand to remain steady in coming months and quarters if there is no surprise from the Omicron front." Kala said because of supply constraints, prices of diamond had increased by around 10% and similar is the case for gemstones. The show was inaugurated on Friday by Amit Yadav, director general, directorate of foreign trade (DGFT) and additional secretary, department of commerce, ministry of commerce and industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-supply-concern-even-as-demand-for-gems-jewellery-is-steady/articleshow/88484311.cms||---

More hidden money is likely to tumble out as some of his properties in Kannauj are still being searched. The search teams combed 11 premises of Jain and two of his partners — one is a pan masala manufacturer and the other is a transporter. The premises included factory outlets, offices, cold storages and petrol pumps in Kanpur, Mumbai and Gujarat. The raids started simultaneously at 11am. Tax evasion of Rs 3.09 crore through shell companiesOfficials said tax evasion of more than Rs 3 crore through shell companies was discovered. “Jain took loans in the name of shell companies and has huge foreign transactions,” a source said, adding, “Documents are being scrutinised. SBI officials are helping count the seized money.” Jain, who is originally from Chhipatti in Kannauj, is known primarily as a perfume merchant. He has around 40 companies, including two in West Asia, and owns a house, head office and a showroom in Mumbai. Explaining the modus operandi, sources in the department said multiple invoices, all below Rs 50,000 for a truckload, were generated in the name of fake firms to avoid paying GST. They added that 200 fake invoices were found and more than Rs 1 crore was seized from the transporter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/177-crore-seized-from-house-of-kanpur-perfume-trader/articleshow/88484324.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The police have added the provisions of the Arms Act under Sections 27, 54, and 59 as they had recovered a pistol on Sunday. The police amended the FIR filed in the case on Sunday Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi said in a media interaction in Chandigarh on Friday morning that investigations revealed it was not a case of sacrilege but of murder and that the police would proceed accordingly. “Things are moving towards murder and inquiry is on. We have solved the case and the FIR is being changed,” Channi said. The police officers in Kapurthala, on Sunday itself, had said that there were no visible signs of sacrilege despite the granthi’s claim to the contrary. Jalandhar zone IG Gurinder Singh Dhillon said the police would identify the rest of the accused from videos and photographs circulating online. He said the FIR mentions around 100 unidentified persons and among them, 25-30 were armed and at the forefront. “I’m sorry that an innocent and unarmed person died in a brutal attack,” he added. The granthi was remanded to police custody for two days when the police presented him in a local court after his arrest on Friday. Granthi Amarjit Singh, who lives with his family and aides in the compound of the gurdwara, had live-streamed from his Facebook account on Sunday morning and had alleged that the youth, who had by then been locked up in a room in the gurdwara compound, had attempted to commit sacrilege. He did not report the matter to the police even though a police post is just a few yards away. Mentioning the Saturday incident at Darbar Sahib in Amritsar, Amarjit had claimed he saw the youth and tried to capture him when he got up at 4 am but had failed as the electricity went off. He had claimed that he had nabbed the youth later with the help of his aides. Amarjit did not disclose at the time that he had spotted the youth making tea and eating chapatis in the residential portion of his house. The youth was booked for hurting religious sentiments on Amarjit’s complaint. At the time, Amarjit asked the Sikh groups to rush to the gurdwara and refused to hand the young man over to the police even as cops had rushed to the gurdwara complex. He focussed on creating a frenzy and the youth was killed in the afternoon by a group of Sikh youths who entered the room he was in by breaking open its window and then attacking him with swords in police presence. It has already emerged that Amarjit has very close links with senior police officials and his son is an ASI in state Intelligence department headquarters at Mohali. The post-mortem of the deceased has revealed that there was a deep cut on the front side of his neck and both his wind and food pipes were cut. His neck also had a cut on the right side. Even his skull bone was broken due to a deep cut and he had a brain injury too. His ribs were also broken and his lungs were injured. “Most of the injuries on his body were caused with sharp-edged weapons,” Kapurthala SMO Dr Narinder Singh had revealed on Thursday while adding that his viscera was also being sent to the Kharar laboratory for examination. The medical team also preserved samples for DNA examination for matching if his family approaches the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gurdwara-caretaker-arrested-for-murder-in-kapurthala-killing-case/articleshow/88484461.cms||IP Singh
