Masoodi and two other NC MPs – Farooq Abdullah and Mohammad Akbar Lone – had boycotted the first meeting of the commission earlier this year, saying the exercise was an outcome of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act of 2019, which the party has challenged in the Supreme Court. “The party leadership will sit and decide on participation in the meeting,” he said. The Delimitation Commission has invited all five LS MPs from J&K to participate in proceedings of the panel on December 20 at Hotel Ashoka, New Delhi. In addition to the NC parliamentarians, BJP MPs Jitendra Singh and Jugal Kishore Sharma are associate members of the commission. The commission is headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Desai and also comprises Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra as an ex-officio member and the Jammu and Kashmir chief electoral officer. The commission has time till March 6 next year to redraw the boundaries and create new constituencies. According to the Delimitation Commission Act, 2002, the associate members don’t have voting rights nor can they sign any decision of the commission but their dissenting proposals can be published in the official gazette. In its December 20 meeting, the panel is expected to discuss and share with its members the progress achieved by the panel in delimitation of 90 assembly constituencies in the Union Territory. According to sources, the panel is likely to suggest a floating constituency for migrant Kashmiri Pandits in the UT assembly, which may have seven more seats – one in the Kashmir valley and six in Jammu division – taking the number to 90 from the present 83.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-delimitation-commission-nc-mps-get-invite-to-decide-on-participation-in-crucial-panel-meet/articleshow/88230656.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Sources said that the IGP was at a joint meeting of the Army, CRPF and police where he reviewed operational work and instructed field officers to generate specific inputs and enhance anti-terror operations in the district. "A single Pakistani terrorist came and fired upon the driver and one PSO of the SHO but couldn’t snatch their weapons due to retaliation by the second PSO," the IGP said. However, two OGWs had helped him, he said. Meanwhile , J&K police chief Dilbagh Singh said on Saturday that only a few foreign terrorists are active in north Kashmir and that they are targeting policemen. Talking to reporters at the home of the Sopore cop killed in Bandipora on Friday, DGP Dilbagh Singh said the police are working on initial clues with regard to the attack to identify the those involved. "The police, with the support of the security forces, has been protecting people and ensuring their well-being, which doesn’t suit the militants, thus they are attacking the police force," he said. Asked about foreign terrorists active in north Kashmir, Singh said the number was not very high but some had entered India in recent infiltrations. "The police is keeping an eye on them. Some of them have been killed while the remaining will be neutralised soon," he added. National Conference president Farooq Abdullah, meanwhile, reiterated that there is no way out except to hold talks with Pakistan to end militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. His remarks came when reporters asked him about the killing of two policemen in Bandipora on Friday. "You think we are happy that they are killing people," Dr Abdullah asked. "It is a sad story… Are people safe? When your police personnel are not safe, how is an ordinary man safe?" When asked if he still insisted on talks with Pakistan, Abdullah retorted, "You have to talk. There is no way out (to end militancy)." "You can talk to China. What do you say about that? China is coming and occupying our territory. They are making their own houses in that territory," he said, adding, "Let the government of India allow discussion in Parliament to understand what the Chinese are doing." Earlier, Dr Abdullah had said "nothing" could stop displaced Kashmiri Pandits from returning to their native land and that the conspirators of their "ethnic cleansing" would never get J&K. "You have suffered a lot and what happened then had never been even comprehended," Dr Abdullah told Kashmiri Pandits at an event organised by the party’s minority cell president. He said, however that the time was not ripe for their return because of the hatred between two communities in the valley that has been "deliberately created" over the years by vested interests for political gains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-terrorist-involved-in-killing-of-two-cops-in-bandipora-igp-kashmir/articleshow/88230694.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Centre prepares plan to check out of Ashok Hotel||NEW DELHI: As part of the Centre’s ambitious asset monetisation programme, the government is all set to transfer the iconic Ashok Hotel in the Capital to the private sector on a 60-year contract. It will also offer land parcels in the 21.5-acre complex for the setting up of a hotel or serviced apartments and other development works. The plan, expected to be cleared by the cabinet shortly, envisages two land parcels to be offered on a longer-term licence term of up to 90 years, sources familiar with the development told TOI. Although the government is seeking to complete the process at the earliest, the entire transaction is unlikely to be completed in the current financial year. The land parcels include a 6.3-acre plot, classified as spare land, that can be used for the development of serviced apartments or a hotel. The construction is proposed on the side facing the British High Commission. Another 1.8-acre plot, one the same side, is being offered for commercial development with a higher floor area ratio (FAR). The remaining land in the complex is proposed to be offered to potential bidders, which can be part of the main hotel complex so that there is a possible upside for the entity that bags the deal. It will also help improve the realisation from the project, a source explained. Like other PPP projects, the land will come back to the government on expiry of the licence. The winning bidder for the hotel can completely refurbish it but will not be allowed to make changes to the exterior of the property that came up in 1956 along with a large convention centre to host a conference by the UN. An analysis by the tourism ministry, which is piloting the proposal, has suggested that there is vast commercial and revenue potential that has remained untapped. Against the permitted FAR of 3.25, just 1.3 has been utilised. Similarly, just 23% the permitted 40% ground coverage has been utilised, said a source. Besides, there are non-revenue aspects, such as common utilities, power sub-stations (for Hotel Ashok and Samrat) as well as large parcels being used for staff quarters that are proposed to be offered. Samrat Hotel has been kept out due to security considerations. The hotel, with more than 500 rooms, was included in the ambitious asset monetisation programme as its performance remains below par compared with other five-star properties in Lutyens’ Delhi. Replacing worn-out carpets and poorly maintained furniture, along with renovation, could cost Rs 400-500 crore by conservative government estimates. In any case, the government believes it should not be in the business of running hotels, an area where the private sector is much more efficient. The hotel will be offered under the operate-maintain-develop model. The land parcels that are to be used for development of commercial or office complexes and hotel or serviced apartments are proposed to be given out through the design-build-finance-operate-transfer route, sources said. “There will be the option for one bidder to take over the entire project or multiple players can come in,” an official said. Apart from the upfront payment, the government is looking at an annual revenue share. A part of the upfront payment will be used to offer a voluntary retirement scheme and clear dues. Several attempts have been made in the past to sell the iconic hotel in the heart of the Capital’s diplomatic area, run by ITDC, but the plans had to be abandoned due to a string of factors, including labour issues, dues and past contracts that the had signed. In the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, the disinvestment department under the then minister Arun Shourie had tried to sell the property as part of its wider policy to get out of the hospitality business. Subsequently, the NITI Aayog had suggested a new model but it did not go through.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-prepares-plan-to-check-out-of-ashok-hotel/articleshow/88231011.cms||Sidhartha
---||Goa||Goan coach lives his dream in Egypt, with Queiroz and Salah||Panaji: Francisco Bruto da Costa is enjoying his time with the Egyptian Football Association. Since joining as part of technical director Nelo Vingada’s coaching staff two months ago, Francisco has now worked with the national team, under-20 men’s team, under-17 team and the senior women’s team. It’s been a new experience, and as the Goan coach witnessed on his first day with the national team, there’s so much to learn. “I had the chance to work with Egypt national coach Carlos Queiroz during his first camp here,” Francisco told TOI. “He’s so meticulous with everything that he does. Whether it’s planning the training session, planning future camps, analysing games, analysing individual players, he looks into every detail. It’s fascinating.” Queiroz has been an assistant with Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, managed Portugal, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Iran and Colombia. But in Egypt, he’s not the biggest name. That honour is exclusively reserved for Mohammed Salah. Francisco, 40, had time to watch the Liverpool forward from close when he joined the national team camp. It was 48 hours after his unbelievable solo effort against Manchester City, but while the world remained in awe and Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said “people would talk about this goal for a long, long time,” Salah himself went about his business like nothing happened. “One thing that I have realised working with Nelo or Queiroz or having Salah in the team, these guys are very simple and humble,” said Francisco, who was named East Bengal coach last season but wasn’t allowed to take charge after a change in guard. “When I met Salah, it was difficult to believe this was the same player who scored a wonder goal (against Manchester City). He’s very down to earth and has no airs of a superstar.” The Margao-based coach was summoned to Egypt by Vingada, the strategic advisor and technical director for EFA. Having worked together at NorthEast United FC, Kerala Blasters FC and the Malaysian national team, it was easy to understand why the Portuguese wanted him by his side, again. “Even at NorthEast United (where they met), you could so easily see Francisco’s professionalism. He’s been thorough right from the start, and it’s easier since we share the same culture and speak Portuguese,” said Vingada. Last season, Francisco was named coach at East Bengal, but before he could take charge, the Kolkata giants – with backing from Shree Cement – made it to the Indian Super League (ISL) where Robbie Fowler was appointed as coach. The Goan coach has also worked in Malaysia and Bangladesh, while having stints with junior teams at Salgaocar (U-18) and India (U-16 and U-19).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-coach-lives-his-dream-in-egypt-with-queiroz-and-salah/articleshow/88231088.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Goa||10-man FC Goa catch Bengaluru off guard||You just cannot dismiss FC Goa. Whether it’s three losses in a row or a red card to their most influential player on the field, Goa have now shown they have the stomach for a fight this season. Nowhere was this better dramatized than their spirited 2-1 win against Bengaluru FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Saturday. Goa surged ahead in the 16th minute through Ashique Kuruniyan’s own goal, before Cleiton Silva equalised with a freekick at the stroke of half time. In the second session, Bengaluru created a flurry of chances and then enjoyed a numerical advantage when Jorge Ortiz was sent off in the 55th minute. But just when it seemed like Goa had invited trouble for themselves, Devendra Murgaonkar gave them the lead in the 70th minute, which they protected till the end. In-between, Suresh Singh, responsible for Ortiz’s retaliation and subsequent red card, was sent off towards the end for a second bookable offence. The win took Goa to seventh on the table with six points from five matches. Bengaluru, on the other hand, are enduring their worst start since the club was started in 2013. The former champions have now lost four of their last five matches and have four points from six matches. Only SC East Bengal have fared worse. Goa coach Juan Ferrando opted to start with the same team that registered a win in the last game, their first of the season, and his decision seemed spot on as the hosts started on the front foot. Ortiz and Devendra troubled the rival defence with their pace. The Spanish winger was the most dangerous as Bengaluru defenders found it difficult to keep pace. In the first five minutes itself, Ortiz made his way inside danger zones twice and Goa found themselves ahead in the 16th minute. It was Glan Martins who won a header in the middle and set Devendra free on the left. The Goa forward darted inside the box and crossed where, Ashique, under pressure from Ortiz, turned the clearance into his own goal, his second this season. Upfront, Cleiton and Sunil Chhetri didn’t have much to do for Bengaluru, though the captain should have done better than shoot wide from handshaking distance when Roshan Naorem had picked him up, just five yards out. Bengaluru, though, equalised with their first shot on target, a minute before the breather. Cleiton won a freekick on the left after a challenge from Ivan Gonzalez and the Brazilian himself stepped up to curl it into the top corner, over goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh and defender Mohamed Ali. When Bengaluru took the field for the second half, they were a different side, with the introduction of Prince Ibara and Paresh Shrivas. When Ortiz was sent off in the 55th minute, it seemed Bengaluru would seize the advantage. They tried, but it were Goa who took the lead for the second time through a smart set-piece which Saviour Gama collected from Edu Bedia, floated inside the box and Ivan Gonzalez headed in the path of an unmarked Devendra to do the rest. For the rest of the game, Goa defended like their life depended on it. Ferrando made a clutch of changes, and as Dylan Fox, Sanson Pereira and Ivan all flung themselves, Bengaluru just couldn’t find a way past the defence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/10-man-fc-goa-catch-bengaluru-off-guard/articleshow/88231115.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Punjab moves SC over BSF jurisdiction||NEW DELHI: Raising a Centre-state dispute over extension of the BSF’s jurisdiction in border areas to 50km, the Punjab government has moved the Supreme Court with an Article 131 original suit accusing the central government of attempting to rule state territory by proxy and deal a blow to the constitutionally mandated federal structure of governance. The extension of BSF’s jurisdiction along the international border in three states — Assam, Punjab and West Bengal — saw vociferous opposition from the opposition governments in Punjab and West Bengal, both of which termed the move a "unilateral decision". They asked why the established practice of the BSF working in tandem with state police for search, seizure and arrest was abandoned without prior consultation. The home ministry has clarified that the procedure for arrested persons being handed over to local police for filing of regular cases has not been altered in any way. Though the Charanjit Singh Channi-led Congress government challenged the extension of BSF’s jurisdiction, his predecessor Amarinder Singh had welcomed the Centre’s decision saying it would help Punjab stop cross-border illegal activities, allegedly aided and abetted by Pakistan. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee too has stoutly opposed the extension of BSF jurisdiction. The SC has not fixed any date for hearing on Punjab’s original suit, which was filed on December 6. Previously, the Kerala government had challenged the Citizenship (Amendment) Act under Article 131 on the grounds that it is violative of Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution. It said CAA covers only a section of minorities from neighbouring countries. The BSF has a 50km jurisdiction from the international border in Rajasthan and Gujarat (it was earlier reduced from 80km to 50km). In other states having international borders, the armed forces have no jurisdictional restraint in carrying out search, seizure and arrest operations. The government had said that it was to bring uniformity in BSF’s jurisdiction in states having international borders. Interestingly, Section 139 of the BSF Act, 1968 does not provide for prior consultation with states. It says: "1) The central government may, by general or special order published in the Official Gazette, direct that, subject to such conditions and limitations, and within the local limits of such area adjoining the borders of India, as may be specified in the order, any member of the Force may, (i) for the purpose of prevention of any offence punishable under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, the Registration of Foreigners Act, the Central Excises and Salt Act, the Foreigners Act, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, the Customs Act, or the Passports Act, or of any cognisable offence punishable under any other Central Act; or punishable under any other Central Act; or (ii) for the purpose of apprehending any person who has committed any offence referred to in clause (i), exercise or discharged such of the powers or duties under that Act or any other Central Act as may be specified in the said order, being the powers and duties which, in the opinion of the Central Government, an officer of the corresponding or lower rank is by that or such other Act empowered to exercise or discharge for the said purposes." In Parliament, the home ministry defended the amendment to the Act and gave a written reply saying, "The extension in territorial jurisdiction of BSF in some states is aimed at empowering BSF to discharge its border guarding duties more effectively in the wake of use of technology like dynamic remotely operated navigation equipment (drones), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), etc generally having long range, by anti-national forces for surveillance as well as for smuggling of arms, narcotics and fake Indian currency notes. It [the increase in territorial jurisdiction] would also help in curbing the menace of cattle smuggling as smugglers take refuge in the interior areas outside the jurisdiction of BSF." However, the Punjab government in its suit said that the explanation given by the Centre for extension of the territorial jurisdiction of BSF in border areas was a mere fig leaf and the real intention behind the decision is to encroach onto the jurisdiction of the state governments. In West Bengal, CM Mamata Banerjee has reportedly told police to remain vigilant and not allow the BSF personnel to venture into villages outside without permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-moves-sc-over-bsf-jurisdiction/articleshow/88231291.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Do away with discretionary quota for allotment of public property: SC||NEW DELHI: Holding that allotment of public property, including plots by government authorities on discretionary basis, leads to corruption and nepotism, the Supreme Court on Saturday said such policies should be done away with and revived criminal proceedings against some Odisha government officials for allotting land to their relatives. Setting aside the Odisha High Court order for quashing proceedings against officials belonging to Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) and Housing and Urban Development Department, a bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna said the power of quashing an FIR “should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection and in rare cases”. “Before parting, we may observe that now the day has come to do away with allotment of government largess on the basis of discretionary quota as this inevitably leads to corruption, nepotism and favouritism. Government and/or the public authorities like BDA are the custodian of public properties. Allotment of public properties must be transparent and has to be fair and non-arbitrary. In such matters, public interest only has to be the prime guiding consideration,” the bench said. “The allotment of plots in the discretionary quota cannot be at the whims of the persons in power and/or the public servants who are dealing with the allotment of plots in the discretionary quota. When a democratic government in exercise of its discretion selects recipients for its largess, then discretion should be exercised objectively, rationally, intelligibly, fairly and in a nonarbitrary manner and it should not be subjective and according to the private opinion and/or the whims and fancies of the persons in power and/or the public servants,” the court said. The court said even the guidelines framed for such allotment are hardly followed or are often manipulated. “Therefore, the best thing is to do away with such discretionary quota and allotments of the public properties/plots must be through public auction by and large.” While cautioning the HCs not to quash criminal proceedings against accused in a routine manner, the bench said, “Quashing of a complaint/FIR should be an exception rather than any ordinary rule.” It said power given to HCs under Section 482 CrPC is very wide, but conferment of such power requires the court to be more cautious. “It casts an onerous and more diligent duty on the court.” In this case, it was alleged that keeping the general public in dark, the accused distributed ten prime plots among themselves or their relatives and that too at minimal rates as compared to the prevalent rates in the area and thereby causing loss to the BDA and the public exchequer without any public interest. “It cannot be said that the criminal proceedings initiated against the respondents – accused— are an abuse of process of any court. On the contrary, the allegations are an instance of abuse of the powers with a mala fide intention and allotment of the plots to the family members by hatching a criminal conspiracy and to allot the plots to the family members at throw away price causing loss to the B.D.A. and the public exchequer,” the bench said while setting aside the order of HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/do-away-with-discretionary-quota-for-allotment-of-public-property-sc/articleshow/88231468.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||After victory march, farmers leave their 'year-long home' for real home||NEW DELHI: They assembled on Delhi's borders over several months, their numbers swelling with each passing day. It, however, took them only a couple of days to pack up and leave for their villages in Punjab and Haryana. After a victory march on their tractors and trolleys in the morning, the farmers at Singhu began the journey back home on Saturday. Amidst, slogans, songs and sword dances, there was a twinge of pain in their hearts as they left what has been their home and friends behind. It will take two days for the police to remove heavy barricades and open the highway. At Tigri border, however, things moved fast. By 12 noon, 90% of the tents had been removed as farmers left in a convoy amid a shower of petals. The authorities wasted no time in clearing the road. A makeshift cement wall, four layers of barricades created with cemented bollards, containers, fences and trolleys got removed one by one with the help of cranes. At UP Gate, speeches and prayers marked the day as most of the farmers dismantled their tents. The Delhi-Jaipur eway was, meanwhile, thrown open to traffic by the evening with local shopkeepers planning to reopen shops on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-victory-march-farmers-leave-their-year-long-home-for-real-home/articleshow/88231635.cms||---

Among those granted interim relief by a bench of justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar on December 9 are Rihen Mehta, promoter-director of Dubai-based Global Green Bridge FZC, and son of Harshad Mehta of the Rosy Blue diamond group. The company had taken credit of AED 11 million (nearly Rs 45 crore) from Bank of Baroda's Dubai branch and Rihen Mehta was also a personal guarantor. In 2019 he returned to India with his family. In December 2019, BoB declared the company's account a non-performing asset and initiated recovery proceedings. On January 13, 2020, Rihen Mehta was stopped at Mumbai airport on his way to New York. The court heard petitions that challenged the LOC issued by the ministry of home affairs following an October 4, 2018, office memorandum (OM) where persons can be restrained from travelling if their departure is detrimental to the "economic interest of India". The OM allows the chairman of SBI, and MDs and CEOs of all other public sector banks to request the issue of an LOC. The common complaint of the petitions is because an individual or corporate identity is indebted to a public sector bank, LOCs have been issued restraining their travel overseas. While some petitioners have civil or recovery proceedings pending and others criminal proceedings, the bench said none "can be said to be absconding or fugitive" evading an arrest or a warrant. While some petitions challenged the LOC, two questioned the Centre's power to issue such an OM, saying curtailing fundamental rights must be by statute or constitutional amendment and not by an executive order. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, with advocate Rui Rodrigues, said it is for each bank to justify its action in requesting an LOC. "The fact that a particular bank may have been wrong in making that request will not vitiate the office memorandum itself," said Singh, adding there is no reason to question the power to issue such an OM. He said the OMs address security concerns, are not a blanket infringement of fundamental rights and have inbuilt safeguards. Since there is a complete challenge to even the first OM of October 27, 2010, the judges posted the hearing on February 4. In individual orders, they directed the petitioners to give their exact itinerary with contact details to the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bizmen-facing-lookout-notices-can-go-abroad/articleshow/88231656.cms||Rosy Sequeira

"A soldier is not a soldier only when he is in the Army. His whole life is marked by discipline and dedicating himself to upholding the country's dignity. In the coming days, Gen Rawat will see his India moving forward," the PM said while inaugurating the Saryu Canal project in UP. Modi said India's first Chief of Defence Staff, who died in a helicopter crash along with his wife and 11 colleagues last Wednesday, worked relentlessly towards strengthening the borders, improving coordination among the armed forces and building a set-up that would be self-reliant in every way. He said the best tribute to the General from a country in mourning would be to "strive harder to face every challenge, both within and outside the country". The PM also mentioned the lone crash survivor, Group Captain Varun Singh, who is fighting for his life in a hospital in Bengaluru. He assured Singh's family that the country would stand by them, and with the families of all those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-in-pain-but-will-moveforward-pm-salutes-rawat/articleshow/88231698.cms||Neha Lalchandani

I will become an IAF pilot." The young girl said this minutes after her 7-year-old brother lit their father's pyre in the presence of family members and friends at the Tajganj crematorium in Agra. Talking to TOI, Aaradhya said, "My father was my ideal. He always advised me to focus on my goals. I will follow his advice and achieve my dream, just lie he did." The final rites of Chauhan, who was killed along with CDS General Bipin Rawat and 10 other military personnel in a chopper crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu's Nilgiris district on Wednesday, were performed amid the chanting of patriotic slogans and state honours with the customary gun salute. The mortal remains of the late officer arrived at the Agra airport around 10 am and was later brought to his residence where hundreds of people had gathered to pay their tributes. Union minister SP Singh Baghel and senior defence personnel were there at the airport to receive the casket. Chauhan's son Aviraj saluted his father after wearing his cap and later lit the pyre along with his sister. Outside the crematorium, huge crowds of mourners had gathered and people showered flower petals. Meanwhile, a road leading to Chauhan's house, which was tattered for years, was repaired after the chief minister paid a visit to the family on Saturday. A neighbour, Om Prakash, said there were a lot of potholes in the small stretch but no one gave any attention to it for 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/want-to-be-iaf-pilot-says-wing-commander-chauhans-daughter-son-7-wears-fathers-cap/articleshow/88231749.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The passing out parade (POP) was reviewed by President Ram Nath Kovind. In light of the toned-down ceremony, the academy did away with the tradition of bringing the reviewing officer to the historic Drill Square, where the parade is held, in a horse-driven carriage. The tricolour also few at half-mast as a mark of respect to the 13 lives lost in the chopper crash. The flower petal showering ceremony after the GCs are commissioned was also given a miss. Among 320 Indian GCs, maximum 45 were from UP. Uttarakhand gave 43 officers to the Indian Army, Haryana 34, Bihar 26, Rajasthan 23 and Puducherry 22, while Maharashtra and MP gave 20 officers each. Anmol Gurung from Assam was awarded the coveted Sword of honour and gold medal. The silver medal was presented to Tushar Sapra and bronze to Ayush Ranjan. Chief of Army Staff banner was awarded to Keren Company for standing overall first amongst 16 companies. Attending the parade, President Ram Nath Kovind condoled the death of General Bipin Rawat and 12 others in the chopper crash on Wednesday and underscored the need for the Army to embrace modern-day technology. "Advancement in technology is often driven by military dynamics. The battlefield, today, presents a multidimensional situation... Armed forces across the world are heavily reliant on the use of tech to deter or defeat the enemies' fighting capability. As modern-day military leaders, you must embrace this technological shift and understand the seamless synergy required between men and machines. It is, therefore, imperative that you develop sound scientific temperament," said the president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ima-shuns-ceremonies-in-subdued-passing-out-parade/articleshow/88231778.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The school-going population declined from 254.8 million in 2012-13, the year when the unified district information system for education (UDISE) was initiated, to 250 million in 2019-20, the latest year for which data is available. "Overall enrolment has been falling at all levels for almost a decade, whether primary, elementary or overall I to XII enrolment. The decline in enrolment is much higher than the decline in child population," said Arun Mehta, former professor of NIEPA and author of the research paper, "Is decline in school enrolment in India a cause of concern?...Yes, it is". Mehta said one of the problem points was that "instead of trying to explain the steady slide, the government has announced improvement by citing the 2018-19 enrolment data which is the lowest enrolment fell to in a decade". The last decade saw the highest enrolment in 2015-16, when it touched 260.6 million, and the lowest in 2018-19, when it dropped to 248.3 million. The government has focused on how total enrolment increased by 2.6 million in 2019-20 compared to 2018-19. In reality, enrolment in grades I to XII in 2019-20 was less than that in all other years since 2012-13, barring 2018-19. Curiously, 2019-20 saw an increase in enrolment over 2018-19 despite a steep fall in the number of schools covered by UDISE that year. The number fell by 43,292, compared to 2018-19, the biggest decline in the number of schools covered since 2012-13. The sharpest decline has been in schools run by the department of education, a reduction of over 50,000 schools, offset by an increase in the number of private schools. This reduction in the coverage of government schools under UDISE+ is generally believed to be due to the merger and closure of thousands of schools for "consolidation and rationalisation of schools" under Niti Aayog's Sustainable Action for Transforming Human Capital project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/enrolment-in-schools-dipped-by-3-3mn-in-10-years/articleshow/88231827.cms||Hemali Chhapia

"It's a tragedy," a shaken Biden said in televised comments. "And we still don't know how many lives are lost and the full extent of the damage." As darkness fell Saturday scores of search and rescue officials were helping stunned citizens across the US heartland sift through the rubble of their homes and businesses searching for any more survivors. More than 70 people are believed to have been killed in Kentucky alone, many of them workers at a candle factory, while at least six died in an Amazon warehouse in Illinois where they were on the night shift processing orders ahead of Christmas. "This event is the worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky's history," said Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, adding he fears "we will have lost more than 100 people." "The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words," the governor told reporters. The western Kentucky town of Mayfield was reduced to "matchsticks," its mayor said. The small town of 10,000 people was described as "ground zero" by officials, and appeared post-apocalyptic: city blocks leveled; historic homes and buildings beaten down to their slabs; tree trunks stripped of their branches; cars overturned in fields. Beshear said there were some 110 people working at the candle factory when the storm hit, causing the roof to collapse. Forty people have been rescued, but it would be "a miracle if anybody else is found alive," he said. CNN played a heart-rending plea posted on Facebook by one of the factory's employees. "We are trapped, please, y'all, get us some help," a woman says, her voice quavering as a co-worker can be heard moaning in the background. "We are at the candle factory in Mayfield. ... Please, y'all. Pray for us." The woman, Kyanna Parsons-Perez, was rescued after being pinned under a water fountain. "When I walked out of City Hall this morning, it -- it looked like matchsticks," Mayfield Mayor Kathy O'Nan told CNN. "Our downtown churches have been destroyed, our courthouse... is destroyed, our water system is not functioning at this time, there is no power." "It looks like a bomb has exploded," 31-year-old Mayfield resident Alex Goodman told AFP. David Norseworthy, a 69-year-old builder in Mayfield, said the storm blew off his roof and front porch while the family hid in a shelter. "We never had anything like that here," he told AFP. In a parking lot in downtown Mayfield, volunteers were collecting warm clothes, diapers and water for residents. The tornado that smashed through Mayfield had rumbled along the ground for over 200 miles in Kentucky and for 227 miles overall, Beshear said. Previously, the longest a US tornado has ever tracked along the ground was a 219-mile storm in Missouri in 1925. It claimed 695 lives. In one demonstration of the storms' awesome power on Saturday, when winds derailed a 27-car train near Earlington, Kentucky, one car was blown 75 yards up a hill and another landed on a house. No one was hurt. Reports put the total number of tornadoes across the region at around 30. At least 13 people were killed in other storm-hit states, including at the Amazon warehouse in Illinois, bringing the total toll to 83. In Arkansas, at least one person died when a tornado "pretty much destroyed" a nursing home in Monette, a county official said. Another person died elsewhere in the state. Four people died in Tennessee, while one died in Missouri. Biden promised the full assistance of the federal government and said he planned to travel to the affected areas. Scientists have warned that climate change is making storms more powerful and frequent. Biden said that while the impact on these particular storms was not yet clear, "We all know everything is more intense when the climate is warming, everything." The American Red Cross said it was working to provide relief across all five states. Beshear declared a state of emergency in Kentucky and said scores of search and rescue officials had been deployed along with the national guard. More than half a million homes in several states were left without power, according to PowerOutage.com. When another tornado hit an Amazon warehouse in the southern Illinois city of Edwardsville around 100 workers were trapped inside. Hundreds of workers scrambled to rescue the trapped employees. "We identified 45 personnel who made it out of the building safely, one who had to be airlifted to a regional hospital for treatment, and six fatalities," Edwardsville, Illinois fire chief James Whiteford told a press conference. Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said its workers' safety was the company's "top priority."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/powerful-tornadoes-kill-more-than-80-in-five-us-states/articleshow/88231861.cms||---

On Wednesday, the ED conducted searches at four premises related to office bearers of PFI in Kerala, including the residences of Shafeeque Payeth, a PFI member based in Kannur, Abdul Razak BP, PFI divisional president of Perumpadappu at Malappuram, Ashraf M K at Muvattapuzah in Ernakulam and the office premises of Munnar Villa Vista Project at Mankulam in Munnar. "The seized documents indicate money laundering activities of PFI through various projects in Kerala, including the Munnar Villa Vista project which is being built by PFI leaders to launder proceeds of crime generated in India and abroad," the ED said in a press release on Saturday. The agency further said that its investigation of the seized documents have revealed acquisition of foreign properties by PFI leaders, including a bar and restaurant in Abu Dhabi. TOI had sought comments on the searches from PFI's senior leader Prof P Koya, who refused the request. The ED has accused PFI leaders of an attempt to "disrupt the search operations". The ED officers, assisted by a contingent of the CRPF, conducted the search operations successfully and seized incriminating documents, digital devices and evidence related to foreign funding and acquisition of properties abroad, the ED said. Last year, after a series of raids on the organisation and its functionaries, the agency had questioned top office bearers at the ED headquarters in Delhi. Both PIF and RIF are also under scanner for alleged funding of anti-CAA protests in Delhi and Aligarh and in other parts of UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-searches-reveal-pfis-laundering-via-assets-in-india-uae/articleshow/88231892.cms||---
---||India||Soon, 'equivalence' SOP for different Boards||NEW DELHI: In order to address the difficulties faced by students related to the 'equivalence certificates' issued by their secondary/senior secondary boards for the purpose of admissions in higher education institutions and also for employment, the ministry of education has now entrusted the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to prepare a standard operating procedure (SOP) for this. At present, there is no formal mechanism to determine "equivalence" of scores obtained by students of different education boards. The SOP will ensure that "the applicant school education board is following the Right to Education (RTE) Act, extant National Curriculum Framework (NCF), and is National Education Policy-compliant and that the teachers in schools affiliated to the board possess qualifications as laid down by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)". Equivalence will be granted based on fulfilment of the SOP. The AIU has constituted a 10-member committee comprising representatives from the UGC, AICTE, NCERT, CBSE and NIOS, among others. AIU secretary general Pankaj Mittal said, "There are times when during enrolment in institutions or jobs, the institutions are not sure whether this is a valid board, or whether the certificates issued have equivalence with other boards. Till now, we (AIU) have been doing the equivalence of foreign boards like the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge International with Indian boards. For Indian board, there is an informal arrangement with the COBSE (Council of Boards of School Education in India). But there is no formal arrangement so far." There are over 60 boards in India and the number is growing. Ashok Ganguly, former CBSE chairperson said there is wide disparity in respect to curriculum design, transaction and evaluation. "There must be some sort of uniformity so that students moving from one board to other or moving vertically for university admissions," said Ganguly. Once the 10-member expert committee decides on what aspects AIU should look into while determining equivalence of certificates issued by various boards, it will prepare the SOP. Once it is approved and issued by the education ministry, AIU will invite applications from the boards. The first meeting of the committee will be convened on December 27, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soon-equivalence-sop-for-different-boards/articleshow/88231931.cms||---
---||India||Economy to rebound strongly: Govt report||NEW DELHI: India has not only caught up with its pre-pandemic output in the second quarter of the 2019-20 financial year, but is also expected to do so for the full year too, a finance ministry report said on Saturday. The report also asserted that preliminary evidence suggests the impact of the Omicron variant is expected to be less severe due to rapid vaccination. It said India will be among only a few economies in the world to rebound strongly from Covid-induced economic contraction of 2020-21. India’s economic recovery is expected to gain further strength in the remaining quarters of this financial year, as evident from 19 among 22 high frequency indicators (HFIs) in September, October and November of 2021 crossing their pre-pandemic levels in the corresponding months of 2019, the report said. Omicron may pose a fresh risk to the ongoing global recovery, the report said, though it assessed that “ ...preliminary evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is expected to be less severe and more so with increasing pace of vaccination in India”. Listing the domestic impulses to growth, the report asserted that India’s recovery is aided by rapid vaccination covering more than 90% of its adult population with at least one dose. It said that this has helped daily Covid cases decline further in November, with month-end active caseload reaching its lowest since June 2020, concentrated in only few states of the country. Around 80% of the active cases are in Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Mizoram. The report said the Covid pandemic has led to considerable human and economic costs, setting countries back on their development goals. 2021 is thus a “catch-up” year for the global economy including India, trying to recover the pre-pandemic output level of 2019, according to the report. “The MPC (monetary policy committee) in its December statement has maintained the growth forecast of 9.5% during FY 2021-22, implying a full recovery and a 1.6% growth over pre-pandemic GDP level of FY 2019-20,” said the report. The economy has scripted a robust recovery after impact of the lockdown on growth and various sectors. Real GDP in the second quarter of FY 2021-22 has grown by 8.4% year-on-year recovering more than 100% of the pre-pandemic output in the corresponding quarter of fiscal year 2019-20. The monthly economic report for November said India is among the few countries that have recorded four consecutive quarters of growth amid Covid-19 (Q3, Q4 of FY21 and Q1,Q2 of FY22) reflecting the resilience of the Indian economy. “The recovery was driven by a revival in services, full-recovery in manufacturing and sustained growth in agriculture sectors. The recovery suggests kick-starting of the investment cycle,” said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/economy-to-rebound-strongly-govt-report/articleshow/88231954.cms||---

He also said the Venus mission is planned for launch in 2023, L-1 Aditya solar and Chandrayaan-3 missions due for launch in 2022-23 and the country's first space station is likely to come up by 2030. He said Gaganyaan's major missions, like the test vehicle flight for the validation of crew escape system performance and first uncrewed mission of Gaganyaan (G1), are scheduled during the beginning of second half of 2022. This will be followed by the second uncrewed mission at the end of 2022 carrying 'Vyommitra', a spacefaring human robot developed by Isro, and finally the first crewed Gaganyaan mission in 2023, "which would, undoubtedly, place India in the elite club of nations (America, China and Soviet Union now Russia)". Singh said that more than 500 industries are involved in the launch of Gaganyaan. He said the programme got "slightly delayed" due to Covid restrictions, but preparations are now in full swing to achieve the mission by 2023. Giving the status of the programme to the RS, the minister said the astronaut training facility is getting established in Bengaluru and is in advanced stage of completion. Basic aeromedical training and flying practice completed as part of the Indian leg of training. The design of all systems has been completed and realisation of various systems is in different stages of progress. Ground qualification tests of human-rated launch vehicle propulsion stages have been successfully progressing. Setting a timeline for India's first space station, he informed the RS that "by 2030, we would, possibly, be able to set up a space station, which would be unique of its kind. As I said, the journey of India's ascent to the top has already begun through space."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gaganyaan-to-be-launched-in-2023-indias-first-space-station-by-2030-jitendra-singh/articleshow/88231964.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||Keep close watch on district-level Covid clusters: Govt to states||NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked states and UTs to strictly monitor and implement measures at district level clusters of new Covid-19 cases, with a particular focus on areas reporting more than 10% positivity rate or over 60% bed occupancy on either oxygen support or ICU. The health ministry has also raised concern over districts with high positivity rate in three states - Mizoram, Kerala and Sikkim. The three states have eight districts reporting more than 10% positivity. Besides, 19 districts in Kerala, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Manipur, West Bengal and Nagaland have been reporting positivity rates between five and 10% in the last two weeks. "Thus, these 27 districts need to be monitored very closely," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and UTs on Saturday. "In case of any district reporting a surge in cases, or rise in positivity rates, intensive action and local containment as per the containment framework must be initiated," Bhushan said. The Centre suggested specific containment measures to ensure there is no sudden surge in cases and healthcare systems are not burdened. The government maintains that at present the health systems are not burdened due to Omicron. However, there are clusters where cases are increasing rapidly. While Delta continues to be the dominant variant, the Centre has stressed on states to continue genome sequencing of positive samples. "The strategic containment interventions in identified areas with test positivity rate of over 10 per cent or over 60 per cent bed occupancy on either two oxygen-supported or ICU beds, include night curfews, restricting intermingling of people, prohibition of congregations (social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious, festival-related), curtailment of attendees in marriages and funerals or last rites, etc," Bhushan said. Testing and surveillance interventions include ramping up testing and active case search, testing of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases through rapid antigen tests (RAT) and re-testing by RT-PCR of symptomatic RAT negative tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/keep-close-watch-on-district-level-covid-clusters-govt-to-states/articleshow/88231991.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Of 5,873 international travellers in December, 5 test positive on arrival at Bengaluru airport||BENGALURU: In December, five of the 5,873 passengers who landed at Bengaluru from ‘at risk' countries tested positive for Covid on arrival. They are at designated hospitals and their genomic sequencing reports are awaited. The five passengers are: two girls, 17 and 18 years, who travelled from the United Kingdom, a middle-aged man from the UAE who tested positive on arrival late Friday night, and two men, one each from Germany and Sweden had tested positive on December 8. International passengers coming from ‘at risk' countries who are on quarantine post arrival are being tracked by the BBMP. "Four passengers have shown symptoms of Covid while in home quarantine. They have also been shifted to designated hospitals," said Dr Balasundar AS, chief health officer, BBMP. A 32-year-old German is currently being treated in a private hospital. "She travelled to Bengaluru on December 4 and was staying in a hotel. She showed symptoms three days later and tested positive. She is currently in a private hospital and her swab sample has been sent for genomic sequencing," said Dr Balasundar. In another case, a 34-year old man who returned from South Africa on December 1 developed symptoms later. He tested positive on December 3 and his genomic sequencing report is awaited. Though they had carried Covid negative certificate during their journey and tested negative in the on-arrival Covid test, they may have incubated the virus which has shown symptoms later, health officers said. BBMP is doing contact tracing of their primary and secondary contacts. "We're waiting for genomic sequencing reports of 14 samples," said officers. In Bengaluru, six private hospitals have been designated to treat Covid positive international passengers from ‘at risk' countries, apart from Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospital. They are all suspected for Omicron variant until the genomic sequencing report proves otherwise. Till Saturday, international passengers turning positive were sent to Bowring hospital and from there referred to the designated private hospital as per their request. "This will be streamlined. They can directly go to designated hospital from the airport directly," said health and family welfare department authorities. At private hospitals, the patients have to bear the cost and hospitalisation cost varies from Rs 10,000 per day in general ward to Rs 25,000 per day in ICU with ventilator, as per the government's price cap. The six hospitals designated to admit Omicron suspected cases are: Manipal hospitals, Apollo hospitals, Fortis healthcare, Suguna hospital, Sakra world hospital and Rainbow children's hospitals. "Appoint a special officer"At a recent meeting, members of the Technical Advisory Committee suggested the government to appoint a special officer to coordinate between Omicron suspected patients, genomic sequencing labs, BBMP and hospitals. Experts referred to the recent case of the Omicron infected doctor. "Three of his contacts didn't come positive for Omicron. They tested negative for Covid and waited for discharge. They had to request BBMP for discharge. The hospitals do not get genomic sequencing reports directly and this needs to be coordinated efficiently between the health department and BBMP. Till Omicron concerns are settled for next two months, one officer must coordinate between labs, hospitals and patients," said TAC members.When contacted D Randeep, health commissioner said two officers, one from the health department and an IAS officer appointed for surveillance activities, were looking after this and it would be streamlined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/of-5873-intl-travellers-in-dec5-test-positive-on-arrival-at-kia/articleshow/88232004.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Woman gifts liver, then kidney to her ailing son in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: In what doctors term a rare case, a 40-year-old woman has donated vital organs twice to her ailing son in Bengaluru in the past 13 years. The first transplant was in 2008 when her son, then seven years old, was diagnosed with chronic liver disease. His mother Swapna (name changed) was found to be a matching donor and she donated a portion of her liver. She became an organ donor for the second time recently when her son, now 20, had no choice but to undergo a kidney transplant and she donated a kidney. The kidney transplant was done on September 11, 2021 and the mother-son duo is doing fine, said Dr Ishtiaq Ahmed, senior consultant – nephrology and renal transplant physician, Narayana Health. Both transplants were done in the same hospital. Dr Ishtiaq Ahmed said retrieving more than one organ from a single living donor and transplanting it to a single recipient is rare phenomena. Dad wanted to donate kidney but wasn’t fit: DocSwapna, who runs a tea shop near Basaveshwara Nagar in Bengaluru, told STOI the boy had suffered through his childhood and her decision to donate was only her duty. “My son suddenly started having swelling in the stomach and vomiting blood when he was seven. He was diagnosed with jaundice, but later it was found he had chronic liver disease and liver transplant was the only solution,” she said. The mother was a matching donor and volunteered to donate a portion of her liver. Doctors retrieved 300gms of her liver and transplanted it in an 18-hour surgery on August 23, 2008. Even as the family was recouping from it, the boy’s health issues surfaced again. In 2017, there was swelling in his legs as well as weakness and he was rushed to the hospital. A detailed examination revealed he was suffering from End Stage Kidney Disease, a progressive condition. Though initially his condition was managed with medicines, he had to be gradually shifted to dialysis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-gifts-liver-then-kidney-to-her-ailing-son/articleshow/88232009.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||Aryan faces Yuvraj in final||Bengaluru: Aryan Roopa Anand moved within one win of joining a select few who have successfully defended their IGU All-India Amateur Golf Championship titles.In the semifinals of the 120th edition of the prestigious event at the Pune Club golf course on Saturday, the 19-year-old from Mysuru scored a 3 & 2 win over Bengaluru’s Vrushank Balu to set up a title showdown with the in-form Yuvraj Singh, who accounted for Arjun Puri 1-up.Having survived by the skin of his teeth in the semifinal against Pranav Mardikar, Aryan, a full-time residential student of the Tarun Sardesai Golf Academy (TSG) at the Zion Hills Golf County in Kolar, looked much more comfortable against Balu. One down after five holes, a poor tee shot costing him the second hole, Aryan turned things around in the space of three holes. He birdied the sixth, where he holed a five-footer, and seventh, a brilliant 4-iron low shot from the right trees set him up for another birdie. He won the eighth as well when Balu conceded it. The 23-year-old Balu, who ousted second seed Akshay Neranjen in the quarterfinals, needed to come up with something special to check Aryan’s progress. He did so with a birdie on the ninth but failed to take the momentum forward.Bogeys on the 10th and 12th, where he found the hazard, saw Aryan go 3-up. The two halved the next three holes and Balu needed to win the 16th to stay alive. Unfortunately, he missed a 10-foot putt for birdie to let the reigning champion move into the final. Yuvraj looked on course for a comfortable victory, leading 3-up with three holes to go against his West Bengal rival. Puri, however, made a last-ditch effort with birdies on the 16th and 17th holes to put pressure on the Eastern India winner. On the final hole, Puri duffed his chip, his third shot, short of the green to bow out. The final will be a 36-hole affair.Results (Semifinals): Yuvraj Singh (Pun) bt Arjun Puri (WB) 1-up; Aryan Roopa Anand (Kar) bt Vrushank Balu (Kar) 3 & 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/aryan-faces-yuvraj-in-final/articleshow/88232014.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Despite growth of electric vehicles, Karnataka lags in subsidising consumers||BENGALURU: While an increasing number of electric vehicle (EV) firms have launched battery-run two-wheelers, consumers in Karnataka are not getting any government subsidy, unlike their counterparts in other states. In Karnataka, only road tax exemption with no registration fee is given to EV customers. Many other states/union territories offer financial subsidies for electric two-wheelers to go with road tax exemption. Delhi offers a maximum subsidy of Rs 30,000, while Maharashtra provides up to Rs 25,000. The limit is Rs 20,000 in Meghalaya, Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, and Gujarat (see box). Karnataka is a hub of EV manufacturing, housing Mahindra Electric, Ather Energy, Ola Electric, Bosch and Sun Mobility. It was also the first state to launch an e-vehicle policy in 2017. According to sources, the industries department is pushing for subsidies for customers, but the finance department is not in favour because of cash crunch. “While there is competition among states for promoting EVs, Karnataka is only focusing on investment and R&D in the sector. The decision to provide subsidies to EV owners has to be taken by the finance department,” said an industries department official. No transfer of benefits Officials say they are now giving incentives to EV makers and investors so they can transfer the benefits to consumers by reducing vehicle base price. However, prospective EV customers say they are not getting any discounts. “The industries department is subsidising manufacturers. Although the government thinks this will reduce the cost of EVs, benefits are not being transferred to consumers. Investors in the EV sector will get 15% capital subsidy on fixed assets, including land, production-linked subsidy of 1% on turnover for five years, 100% stamp duty exemption, 0.1% registration fee, and 50% subsidy on effluent treatment plant costs (up to Rs 2 crore). There is also 25% capital subsidy on equipment for charging stations (up to Rs 10 lakh a station),” the official said. He said there are already more than 45 EV startups in the state and over 400 R&D centres. “We are now considering subsidising companies that convert petrol vehicles to EV,” he added. Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari told Rajya Sabha on Wednesday there are 8.7 lakh EVs in the country. Uttar Pradesh has the most with 2.5 lakh, followed by Delhi (1.25 lakh) and Karnataka (72,544). “While GST on EVs has been reduced from 12% to 5%, that on chargers/charging stations has been slashed from 18% to 5%,” he said. box||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/despite-growth-of-evs-karnataka-lags-in-subsidising-consumers/articleshow/88232015.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

Association president Sushanth Rai told STOI: “The flu cases that have been reported in Kerala are in ducks and not chicken. Karnataka primarily breeds chicken when it comes to poultry and the demand for ducks is very low here. There are no cases of bird flu in the state and there is absolutely no need for breeders or consumers to panic.” KPFBA, however, asked breeders to continue with biosecurity measures, which include not allowing strangers into the farm and keeping the number of outsiders to a minimum. Any vehicle that goes inside to deliver chicken feed or other raw material must be sanitised thoroughly. Most importantly, the birds should be given their vaccines on time. “Breeders sometimes call their relatives and friends to show them around the farm, which is a big mistake. Outsiders shouldn’t be brought in contact with chicken. Further, those who enter the farm for maintenance should be asked to take a shower and wear clothes and footwear provided by the breeder,” Rai said. Although it is a daunting task, breeders should also not let wild migratory birds into their farms. Inayathulla Khan of KPFBA said, “Bird flu is usually caused by virus brought in by wild migratory birds. Farmers must be vigilant and take measures to keep such birds away from their poultry.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-bird-flu-scare-in-state-breeders-assn/articleshow/88232016.cms||---

The study was conducted by Karnataka Child Rights Observatory (KCRO) — a consortium of NGOs and individuals working for children and child rights — to understand the situation of children (health, immunisation, education, nutrition, protection, etc,.) and their families during the lockdown period and submit recommendations to the government and other stakeholders. The study, supported by UNICEF, Hyderabad, and NGO partners, was conducted across 20 districts in Karnataka with a focus group that included 513 adolescents (12-18 years), 501 men and 510 women (19 to 56 years). Though the survey underscored the fears expressed by experts about inefficiency of online studies, it showed some positive trends regarding distribution of midday meals. According to it, 85 per cent of the respondents received midday meal ration during lockdowns, while only 15 per cent didn’t. Almost 81 per cent said they got eggs and balamrutham (weaning food prepared from wheat, chana dal, milk powder, oil and sugar) as a part of supplementary nutrition food supplied from anganwadis to homes, while the rest didn’t. Almost 77 per cent said even after lockdowns were lifted, anganwadis ensured nutritious food reached children at home. Eighty-three per cent of households surveyed confirmed that even during these phases, monthly immunisation drives for children were on. The shutting down of anganwadis forced 91 per cent households to leave their children alone at home while the other members were out on work. Nine per cent of the respondents said neighbours took care of their kids.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/30-kids-attended-online-classes-during-lockdowns/articleshow/88232017.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: 104-year-old UVCE wears new look but not without the heritage feel||BENGALURU: A red structure resembling the Greco-Roman architecture of the Karnataka high court, granite flooring, sound-proof classrooms and a sprawling amphitheatre — that’s the revamped look of University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (UVCE). The 104-year-old iconic building at KR Circle got a facelift at a cost of Rs 50 crore and, with a few minor works nearing completion, is all set to be unveiled by January-end.  In 2017, after several complaints, a government-appointed special task force conducted an inspection of the dilapidated building and reported that ‘almost every corner of the building needed urgent repair’. Following this, the government allotted the necessary funds and renovation work was taken up. For the 4,500 students of the institution, the redoing of the building means relief from roof and wall collapses, non-functional electrical fittings and damp walls, among other things. The newly renovated campus, spread over 12.5 acres, includes the main building with a historical look, granite flooring and new walls, a small seminar hall, a two-storey cafeteria and an amphitheatre which can accommodate 1,500 people, among others. The classrooms facing the busy Nrupathunga Road are now equipped with triple-glass windows making them soundproof. Hostel building coming upFurther, a seven-storey hostel building is under construction, which will accommodate 600 to 1,500 students. This will also include a two-storey dining hall. When STOI visited the place, the reporter noticed students sitting in an open verandah for lunch. The old hostel was covered with moss and had a dingy dining hall. “It is a pity that we won’t be able to enjoy the new facilities. But I am glad my juniors won’t have to stay like we did,” said a fourth-year engineering student. The new hostel building will be ready by March. Prof Venugopal KR, vice-chancellor, Bangalore University and former principal of UVCE said the next leg of renovation work includes revamp of the mechanical block (near Bangalore City University). According to sources, the Rs 70-crore proposal for the seven-storey mechanical block will be presented before the cabinet by next week. “The block will host aerospace, space technology and mechanical departments, with a digital wall for display on the road,” said Prof Venugopal, adding that the old structure includes a horse stable from 1913, which was converted into a workshop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/104-yr-old-uvce-wears-new-look-but-not-without-the-heritage-feel/articleshow/88232018.cms||Farheen Hussain

Five of them have been produced before CWC and three are on the way to the city, said officials of BOSCO Rainbow Home, Hombegowda Nagar, Wilson Garden, against whom a police complaint was filed. Sleuths from Central Crime Branch’s women protection wing filed a complaint against the staff of the juvenile home saying eight girls supposed to be residing there were not present on the premises and there were no proper records to show they had been sent back. The police complaint, filed with Wilson Garden station, read, “The register at the home shows the names of 56 girls as occupants. Of them, only 48 were present at the centre. Eight were mentioned as absentees and the staff said they were sent back to their parents or guardians. But the staff failed to provide proper documents to prove this.” The matter came to the notice of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which directed city police to investigate. Fr John of BOSCO Rainbow Home told STOI the confusion arose because the documents with CWC pertaining to the eight girls were not closed. “These girls were sent with their parents and guardians during the lockdown this May. At that point, we had intimated the committee about it. However, we hadn’t closed the files on these girls and that led to this confusion,” he said.Cops said they will close the case after getting written statements from the juvenile home and CWC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/missing-juvenile-home-girls-traced-to-parents-guardians/articleshow/88232020.cms||---

The injured suspect is Lohit Kumar alias Rohit, a resident of HSR Layout who is facing 17 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder, robbery and kidnap for ransom. He and his associates were arrested in December last year on charges of kidnapping former minister Varthur Prakash. This time, Ulsoor police were looking for Lohit for his alleged role in the kidnap and murder of Vijay Kumar, an auto driver-cum-financier, near a dry lake bed in Tamil Nadu, in July. Police had arrested nine persons in the case and were looking for the absconding rowdy-sheeter. Police said they received information that Lohit would be near Challaghatta at Jeevan Bima Nagar. A team of cops reached the spot around 5.15am and found him. “The team directed Lohit to surrender, but he attacked constable Syed Mohinulla and sub-inspector Amaresh. Sensing danger, inspector Harish Kumar fired a round in the air as a warning. When Lohit continued to attack, Harish shot at his left knee,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/murder-suspect-attacks-team-of-cops-shot-at/articleshow/88232022.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Congress, BJP spar over anti-conversion bill||BENGALURU: A political discourse in favour and against the proposed anti-conversion bill has kicked off ahead of the winter session of the state legislature in Belagavi, which starts Monday, though the government is still undecided over tabling it. Right-wing organisations on Saturday upped the pressure on the government and demanded that the bill be tabled in this session itself. “If not, we’ll launch a statewide agitation from January 1,” said Sri Ram Sene president Pramod Mutalik. He said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai assured a delegation of seers that met him a few months ago that a law against forceful conversions would be enacted in the Belagavi session. “The government must fulfil its assurance. For no reason it should be deferred,” Mutalik said. The anti-conversion law introduced by other BJP-ruled states has proved to be effective in curbing forceful conversions, he claimed. Countering KPCC president DK Shivakumar’s statement that the party would oppose the bill if it’s placed in the Belagavi session, the state BJP launched a counter attack on social media. “There is a competition within the Congress over opposing the anti-conversion law. If the law is enacted, one section of society will be hurt. More than anything else, it may hurt your supreme leader. Political gains are important for you over the interests of Hindus,” the party’s official twitter handle said. Meanwhile, rural development and Panchayat Raj minister KS Eshwarappa reiterated that the government will enact the law and none should have any doubt about it. “Whether to table the bill in the Belagavi session or in the next session is the only question. But our government is very serious about the issue.” “The BJP has planned to table the bill from the government or in the form of a private bill through its members. Let them bring it in any form, our party will oppose it,” Shivakumar said, referring to the decision of BJP MLC Tulasi Muniraju Gowda to table a private bill. “This matter is not something related to only Karnataka. It has drawn international attention. It will have far-reaching implications, including the investment flow to the state,” he added. Christians meet CM A delegation of Christians also met the CM and urged him to reconsider the government’s decision, claiming the move had already created a sense of fear among the minority communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cong-bjp-spar-over-anti-conversion-bill/articleshow/88232023.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: BJP’s internal survey shows it will win 11-14 MLC seats||BENGALURU: The BJP is on its way to get absolute majority in the legislative council if the party’s internal survey is anything to go by. This will enable the party to push some contentious bills and have its own chairman and deputy chairman in the upper house. The election to 25 seats in the 75-member council was held on Friday. The results will be out on Tuesday. A BJP minister, quoting the survey, said they are expected to win 11-14 seats. “We are bound to win a minimum of 11-12 seats. Our survey predicted 3-5 more seats for us because we got JD(S) support in some key constituencies where the fight is between the Congress and BJP,” he added. According to him, the survey estimated that Congress would get 8-10 seats and JD(S) has chances of winning 2-3. The BJP and RSS are known to conduct pre- and post-poll surveys. While chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has claimed BJP would win a sizeable number of seats, former CM BS Yediyurappa predicted around 15 seats. Congress chief DK Shivakumar and opposition leader Siddaramaiah have expressed confidence of winning 13-15 seats. If this survey comes true, there will be a change in the council composition as seven more seats are set to fall vacant on June 14, 2022, giving BJP a chance to gain complete control by mid-2022. Since it came to power in 2019, the party has been desperately hoping to gain a majority mainly to push through some contentious bills as they believe it will help boost the party’s prospects in the 2023 polls. The government has also obtained the intelligence department’s inputs on the results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bjps-internal-survey-shows-it-will-win-11-14-mlc-seats/articleshow/88232024.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||BMTC may slash Vajra AC bus fares up to 50%||BENGALURU: In what could bring relief to commuters who are tired of surge pricing and arbitrary cancellations by app-based taxis and autorickshaws, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is likely to slash Vajra AC bus fares by 20-50%. BMTC sources said regular fares and daily/monthly pass rates of Vajra Volvo buses are set to go down. However, there will be no change in fares of ordinary buses and Vayu Vajra airport services. BMTC has 860 AC buses, including Vajras and Vayu Vajras, but only 190 of them are now operational due to reduced demand. “We are thinking of further reducing Vajra fares (up to 50%) since most AC buses have been lying in depots for nearly two years due to fall in demand after Covid-19. We are spending 14 lakh a month per depot (total six) on maintenance of AC buses. The BMTC board will take a final decision shortly,” said a BMTC official. “We are hoping more people will shift to AC buses after the fare reduction. The plan is to increase the number of AC buses to 400 from the existing 190 by March. At present, occupancy rate of Vajra buses is very less,” he added. This will be the second fare revision of Vajra buses in the recent past. The corporation had reduced Vajra AC bus fares by 20% from January 1, 2021. Ridership of Vajra buses, which were mainly running on IT corridors, reduced ever since the pandemic struck. Techies, a regular on these buses, are mostly working remotely now. In pre-pandemic times, BMTC used to provide 300 AC buses for chartered services, mainly tech parks on Outer Ring Road and ITPL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-may-slash-vajra-ac-bus-fares-up-to-50/articleshow/88232026.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

However, as she failed to execute a lease-cum-sale agreement, the allotment came to be cancelled on June 8, 2004. Kalluraya contended that the alternative site was allotted in 2009 and therefore, the eligibility criteria prescribed as on 2009 would have to be applied. Thereafter, BUDA passed a resolution on September 2, 2009 and told her to pay Rs 3,27,090 for the alternative site.She challenged these orders claiming she had already paid the sital value when the original allotment was made. During pendency of the litigation, the authorities passed an order on February 22, 2017, cancelling allotment of the alternative site made in 2009.BUDA claimed the original allotment was contrary to the law as Kalluraya’s husband was also allotted a site. On the other hand, she claimed the site allotted to her husband had been sold a long time ago, thus as on the date of giving the alternative site, none of her family members owned a site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-to-get-alternative-site-31-yrs-after-original-allotment/articleshow/88232027.cms||---

The party sought a CBI probe monitored by a retired judge into the deaths. Party advocates’ wing joint secretary and law advisory committee member R M Babu Murugavel, who petitioned the acting Chief Justice, sent the representation to President Ram Nath Kovind, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana and CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal. In his petition, the AIADMK functionary alleged that Venkatachalam, who was appointed chairman of the Pollution Control Board during the AIADMK regime, refused to cooperate with the present government, because of which the officer was threatened and coerced to resign from his office. The government, using the DVAC, initiated searches on his premises and said that 11 lakh and a few gold and silver items were recovered from there. Murugavel also alleged that Santhosh Kumar killed himself by jumping before a running train due to pressure from DMK members and contractors. The sub-collector and superintendent of police of Tirunelveli district were also transferred while they were discharging their duties. “As the police department, which includes CB-CID and DVAC, is acting as a puppet to the present government, an independent body such as CBI should alone investigate the suicides of Venkatachalam and Santhosh Kumar,” the AIADMK functionary said, urging the court to direct the state government to restrain from tampering with evidence in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/order-cbi-probe-into-deaths-of-2-officials-aiadmk-urges-hc/articleshow/88232031.cms||---

His wife Dorothie Shah is the founding president of the Indo American Museum, at Chicago, now called the National Indo American Museum.“According to the United Nations, more and more people are moving to the urban environment. We need more infrastructure. But, we have to do it in a smart and environment-friendly way,” said professor Shah who is a presidential distinguished professor at the University of Texas in the US.“We have to see how the concrete can absorb the carbon dioxide and make it better instead of it being released into the atmosphere,” he said.The 15-member research group at IIT Madras is working on developing new construction material and technologies that would absorb carbon to be more eco-friendly, less wastage in construction, and faster, efficient construction. They have also been instrumental in the first 3D-printed house in the country.Shah said the IIT Madras research group is rightly poised for facing challenges of India, the US, and the world. “They have already started looking to reduce carbon,” he said.Professor Shah is one of the foremost global experts in material in civil and infrastructure engineering, is responsible for the development of high-performance concrete, fiber-reinforced concrete, self-consolidating concrete, shrinkage reducing admixtures and extrusion processing of concrete. IIT Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi announced appointment of professor K Ramamurthy as the first chair professor to guide the research on construction material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/carbon-footprint-can-be-reduced-using-contruction-material/articleshow/88232032.cms||---

GCC officials visit, clear the sludge and leave whenever we raise a complaint. But what we need is a permanent solution,” said J Raja, joint secretary of Shantiniketan Owners Welfare Association (SOWA).Every year sewage reversal and related issues leave at least 10% of the residents with diseases like Diarrhoea, he said.“We want the storm drains to be cleared. We are ready to reconstruct our drainage network. If the Greater Chennai Corporation and Metrowater come up with a plan we could coordinate and put an end to this problem,” said M K Padmanaban, executive member of SOWA.The road connecting Race vVew colony, Guindy and Brindavan Nagar is also inundated every monsoon making it difficult for the residents and commuters. When asked about these complaints, a corporation official told TOI: “A proposal to build a storm water drain was given last year and it has been sanctioned. A drain (4×4)linking the City Link road and Velachery Lake will be constructed soon”. A Metrowater official said that during monsoon there was no flow in storm water drain and hence there was reversal. The issue is been rectified and flow is normal now. “We are responsible only for the terminal chamber and we’ve been clearing it whenever there is an issue,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/sewage-reversal-poses-health-risks-to-adambakkam-residents/articleshow/88232033.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: High groundwater levels flood basements||CHENNAI: Replenished groundwater table across the city after recent rain has become a challenge for several buildings with basements. The high groundwater level is causing flooding of basements and water pumping motors have to be kept running round the clock to prevent inundation. Since last month, some commercial buildings in Kodambakkam, Vadapalani, T Nagar, and Amijikarai have been flooded. Metrowater officials, who inspected some of these buildings, said it was due to groundwater table saturation and since basements are at least 10ft below ground level, it has caused cracks or openings leading to groundwater entering the basement. One such automobile commercial building on Venkatnarayana Road in T Nagar has been pumping out water from its basement for the past 30 days through six hose pipes. A worker there said if the motor is stopped for 10 minutes, the whole basement would get flooded. The scene is similar in another private building in Aminjikarai that had been letting out water into the Nelson Manickam Road and a building near Kamala Theatre had been letting the water out into the Virugambakkam canal. Subramanian P, hydrogeologist with Chennai Metro Water and Sewerage Supply Board (CMWSSB), said since the city’s underground water table was at a depth of 2.5m, it is natural for basements that are 3m to 4.5m deep to get affected now because of higher groundwater levels. “Areas like T Nagar may have shallow aquifers as it was a lake once upon a time. So, the locality is a potential aquifer catchment area,” he said. He said in some wells in T Nagar, the water is at the ground level. “At Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya, the water in the well is almost upto the brim. It is a natural phenomenon for recharge sources to get filled,” he said. As per metro water data, as on December 11, in T Nagar the underground water level is at 2.5m, while in West Mambalam it is 1.8m, Kodambakkam is 3.4m and Anna Nagar is at 2.1m. Sekar Raghavan, director of Rain Center, said the 2021 flooding has been unusual compared to 2005 or 2015. “The previous ones were caused by excess water being let out from reservoirs but this one is because the northeast monsoon has pushed water up to the ground level,” he said, pointing out that usually, the water table is at 4.5m to 6m depth, but in August it was at 2m. Now, it is at ground level in many places. The reason for the basements being inundated is because the groundwater is like a pond that will overflow. GIS consultant and civic engineer Dayanand Krishnan said Metro Water must conduct a survey across the city. “Through a survey we can find the long-lost recharge wells and ascertain the sources and aquifers,” he said. Krishnan said the buildings with the basement, instead of wasting the water, can set up tubewells to divert the water to the next water table.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/high-groundwater-levels-flood-basements/articleshow/88232034.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Tambaram residents want railway station upgraded||CHENNAI: In addition to civic work, residents of newly formed Tambaram Corporation have started pushing for development of Tambaram railway station and stoppage of Chennai-Madurai Tejas Express at the station.  The residents who have come together under a federation of more than 100 residents’ associations have petitioned the state government and railways to introduce stop for the train and improve the station as it is used by several who travel to southern districts. Tejas express had a stop in its original schedule but was not allotted when the service started. Southern Railway is developing the railway station into a terminal to ensure that more trains can have stoppage and more trains can be operated fron the station like Egmore or MGR central railway station. The yard work has been completed and platform work is going on to develop the station. The station handles around 3.5 lakh passengers per day. M Govindarajan, president, Federation of Residents Welfare Associations (FORWA) said that more trains need to be operated from the station as there was good patronage for services to the southern towns of the state. "As the area is going to be developed as a corporation like Chennai, we need more trains and passing by trains from Egmore needs stops. We have petitioned railways and the state government to ensure that Tambaram railway station can be developed as a hub in the south." More than 25,000 people are living in the area and a lot of people travel from Tambaram to Trichy, Madurai, Thanjavur and further south. People from the area have to travel to Egmore by suburban trains to board express trains that do not stop at Tambaram. As the government has decided to develop the area as a corporation, residents want express trains to have stops at the station. Railways is considering to operate trains from the station to decongest Egmore railway station. A railway official said that the station was being developed into a third terminal for the city. More express trains would be operated and the number of suburban trains also will increase after the doubled line between Tambaram and Chengalpet is commissioned, he added. A railway official said that Tambaram railway station is being developed and more amenities will be added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tambaram-residents-want-railway-station-upgraded/articleshow/88232041.cms||---

---||India||Anti-vaxxers who gave in are now scrambling to 'undo' their jab||At 44, Vishal Hiwale, bravely states that he neither believes in Covid-19 nor the anti-Covid vaccines. Even as two waves of the coronavirus swept through the country, Hiwale held his ground and refused to wear a mask or get inoculated. Fast forward to November, he stands one jab down, one more to go. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Marian Mashraki, whose parents raised her to believe that the best medicine is all natural, after months of deliberation made peace with the needle and is currently jabbed with two doses of the vaccine. In a surprising twist in the pandemic tale, some anti-vaxxers like Hiwale and Mashraki are either getting vaccinated or are planning to. Not because of a change of heart but begrudgingly given the social pressure, stricter curbs and workplace mandates that warn of severe action against the unvaccinated. "I got caught for ticketless train travel. Neither me nor my wife were getting train passes or entry into malls for being unvaccinated. We have children and it was getting difficult to take them to school or go shopping... Also, I heard that the state may bar the unvaccinated from availing government schemes," rues Hiwale, describing what drove him to the vaccine camp. For a newly graduated Mashraki, taking the jab was about getting herself out of a sticky wicket. "When you're brazen about not vaccinating, your peer group ostracies you. Also, access to malls, restaurants, movies and trains are a huge issue. I can't boycott these activities. My life got really restricted," says the Vashi resident, for whom the stakes of trading foreign university prospects with her anti-vaccine stance were also high. "My parents still don't want it but my brother, who recently got into engineering college, will soon get vaccinated." But even as many vaccine deniers yield to the Covid shot, anti-vaxxers are a hardened bunch who continue to cling to their fixed ideologies. "I don't believe in Covid-19. It's an international conspiracy to create fear and vaccines are a way of genetically modifying humans," insists Hiwale while Sudhir Madan, 41 continues to spout anti-vax sentiments ranging from "mRNA vaccines contain aborted babies" to "Covid is a way to profit pharmaceuticals" even as he gears up for his jab out of fear of losing the job that he recently found after a year of being without one. Carl Pereira, 28 and his family in Mulund have been taking turns to get vaccinated even though they don't fear the virus, they say. "My mother's a school teacher so vaccine was compulsory. For me, planning international travel became a headache," says Pereira. Ashwini Tamde, a 37-year-old government employee has been holding out on vaccination until her salary was under threat. "See, I don't trust the authenticity of these vaccines but I'm left with no option." Consequently, the Covid world that was divided into pro-vax and anti-vaxxers is now seeing a third category of vaccine sceptics who caved but are now scrambling to 'de-vaccinate' or 'undo' their shots with alternative remedies that they claim would "cleanse" their body of the alleged "metals and toxins". Madan, who managed to dodge BMC marshals and ticket checkers during his maskless-ticketless travels, has found a way to deal with his post-vaccine anxiety. "I put my wife on a vegan diet but I plan to use detox foot pads on my body to absorb chemicals from the blood through the skin." Refusing to let go of her "natural resistance" Mashraki put herself on a self-administered diet after the jab. "It didn't feel good," she says after being fully vaxxed. "As a family we've never been pro-medication. So, I ate raw food instead of cooked food for a few days to clean my blood."Madan and Mashraki aren't alone in their attempts at trying to "purify their body of vax content". Some practitioners of alternative medicine such as Madan Dubey of the Azadi Bachao Andolan also recommend arguable detox regimens including "once-a-week enema" and "blood thinners" for anxious anti-vaxxers-turned-vaxxed. "They did it out of coercion and now want a fix. Only if they promise not to take further shots, we prescribe ways to neutralise the effect of the vaccine," he says. Bioethics expert and one of the founders of Forum for Medical Ethics Society Dr Amar Jesani says, "One's need to do shuddhikaran or purify their body is more of a cultural and psychological concept than a medical one." While these so-called cures - eating raw food or colon-cleansing enema - he believes, draw from naturopathy that are harmless "unless one overdoes it", they certainly "won't make the vaccine disappear from the body" he says while calling on the Drugs Controller and government to play their part, "if alternative remedies without scientific base are being peddled."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/anti-vaxxers-who-gave-in-are-now-scrambling-to-undo-their-jab/articleshow/88232085.cms||Mohua Das
---||Bengaluru||Demand for dedicated Karnataka-Rera secretary grows as compensation cases pile up||BENGALURU: Thousands of homebuyers have been left in the lurch as they wait for compensation from defaulting builders for several months and revenue officials dither on recovery. Karnataka Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-Rera) listed 120 apartment projects whose promoters have failed to deliver flats within the agreed date. It asked deputy commissioners of respective districts to recover a cumulative amount of Rs 238 crore from builders and pay consumers. However, only around Rs 6.8 crore has been recovered since April and only 14 out of 5,800 consumers were fortunate enough to receive compensation. The sorry state of affairs is being attributed to the absence of a dedicated secretary to K-Rera among other reasons. The government had posted K Nagendra Prasad as K-Rera secretary in April after transferring KS Latha Kumari. But this is a concurrent charge given to Nagendra Prasad, who is director of the horticulture department. According to officials, enforcement of Rera rules is taking a hit because of this. “K-Rera needs a full-time secretary considering the workload and the nature of service that entitles protection of consumer interest. We have written to the government to post a dedicated secretary and response is awaited,” said K-Rera chairman HC Kishore Chandra. “We have made some internal arrangements to ensure routine works are not hampered. While regulation issues demand dedicated attention, we are managing it with some extra working hours,” said Nagendra Prasad. Monitoring apartment projects to see whether developers are complying with the rules and ensuring defaulters pay compensation to homebuyers demands regular field work and perpetual interaction with revenue officials. The stakeholders, including civil society organisations, argue that Rera rules cannot be effectively implemented without the presence of a full-time secretary at the real estate watchdog. According to Rera rules, a developer who fails to deliver a flat within the deadline declared in the agreement of sale has to pay compensation — the amount decided by K-Rera adjudicating officer, and 8.5% interest on the amount paid by the customer for the delayed period. The recovery from developers is done by the revenue department and it can even attach the property in question following orders of the adjudicating officer. In Bengaluru Urban district alone, about 600 recovery cases are pending. “A long process is involved in recovering compensation money from defaulting developers and it takes more time if it is a case for attachment. We are at it,” said Bengaluru Urban DC J Manjunath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/demand-for-dedicated-k-rera-secretary-grows-as-compensation-cases-pile-up/articleshow/88232086.cms||---

Justice C Saravanan passed the interim order on the plea moved by the university challenging the demand. Senior advocate Isacc Mohanlal representing the university said granting affiliation to colleges will not come within the ambit of service and no service tax can be levied on that basis particularly when the university is a state university. The petitioner said the university’s roles as stated in the Periyar University Act, 1997 include devising curriculum, prescribing training modules, regulating admission of faculties, prescribing standards and infrastructure norms for colleges to be affiliated and granting of recognition and affiliation to courses conducted by the affiliated colleges. “The authorities ought to have seen services provided by an educational institution to its students, faculty and staff are exempted. The fact that the provision includes faculty and staff too and not just the students, makes it clear that the objective behind the provision is not only to exempt purely the activity of providing education to the students, but to include all kinds of services provided by an institution to its faculty and staff as well, apart from the students,” the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-stays-notice-of-5-crore-service-tax-to-periyar-varsity/articleshow/88232091.cms||---
---||Chennai||8-year lifespan rule for vehicles of driving schools stayed by Madras high court||CHENNAI: A Tamil Nadu transport department’s circular directing driving schools to replace vehicles older than 8 years, has been stayed by the Madras high court. “Registration certificates given to any vehicle other than a commercial vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act will be valid for 15 years. When that being so, can this kind of restriction can be put against the driving schools?” Justice R Suresh Kumar wondered. The court passed the interim order on a plea moved by Tamil Nadu Driving School Owners Federation challenging the validity of the circular dated November 11, 2011. “This court is inclined to grant an order of injunction for four weeks restraining the authorities and their men, from insisting upon the members of the petitioner federation to replace their existing vehicles being used or pressed into service by the members of the petitioner federation merely because those vehicles have completed eight years life period,” said Justice Suresh Kumar. As per the circular, at no point of time the age of the motor cycle and light motor vehicle shall be more than 8 years. Heavy motor vehicles shall not be more than 10 years and it should be complied with on or before September 30, 2012. In view of the circular, most of the vehicles ensured compliance of the condition within the deadline. Now, eight years have passed since 2012, the authorities are insisting the schools change their vehicles. Aggrieved, the federation has moved the high court and submitted that due to Covid-19 first wave as well as the second wave, both in 2020 and 2021, most of the period these driving schools were closed and therefore, the new vehicles which were pressed into service in 2012 were not put to use during the said period. “Therefore, the eight years period prescribed under the circular itself cannot be strictly put against the members of the petitioner federation by compelling them to replace the existing vehicles by bringing in new vehicles,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/8-year-lifespan-rule-for-vehicles-of-driving-schools-stayed-by-hc/articleshow/88232092.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Central square to be ready by December-end||CHENNAI: By 2022, passengers heading to Central to either board a long-distance train or a suburban could take a pitstop, relax by the concrete benches or the lawns with their luggage for some time before proceeding with their journey, as developmental work to beautify the area in front of Central Railway Station and Moore Market Complex will be completed by end of this month. The work underway for the last six months is part of the Central Square project. The project estimated to cost 400crore also involves construction of other passenger amenities for multi-modal integration to link suburban trains, MRTS and metro rail with outstation trains and buses with pedestrian subways, underground parking and a 20-storey central plaza with bus bays.  Earlier this week, workers were seen planting trees near the pruned lawns even as the frames to set up the canopies were installed near the benches. “Hard and soft landscape works including public seating benches in progress. The work will be completed by the end of December 2021,” a CMRL official said. The beautification work in front of Central station and MMC involves building new walkways, seating areas with concrete benches and tables with canopies, water fountains and grass lawns. CMRL has completed similar work in front of Ripon Building. “Our plan was to have landscaping from Raja Muthiah Road up to Central railway station covering Ripon Buildings and Victoria Hall. Part of it is done and opened. Once the renovation is completed across the whole planned stretch, the features that we are adding are really going to make the area lively,” an official said. CMRL took over the area in front of Ripon Buildings and Victoria Hall in 2012, during the construction of the Central metro underground station and its tunnels. Earlier this year, Southern Railway had refused approval for the beautification work in front of Central Railway Station and Moore Market Complex citing obstruction to passenger flow. While CMRL was completing similar work in front of Ripon Building, Southern Railway gave permission to CMRL to carry out the developmental works, which began in July. Other works planned as part of Central Square are a three-level underground parking space that can accommodate nearly 800 cars for which construction is underway. Four pedestrian subways including one that will link Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital with Central Railway Station and evening bazaar road, which according to CMRL is nearing completion. The highlight of the project, CMRL officials said, will be the Central Plaza building that will soar 20 floors above the ground, work for which may be initiated next year. The plaza is expected to have office space, a shopping area and hotel, and a waiting lounge for passengers and bus crew. The plaza will have bus bays on the front for local and outstation buses to pick up and drop off passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/central-square-to-be-ready-by-dec-end/articleshow/88232093.cms||---
---||Chennai||Chennai: Despite NGT order, Chitlapakkam lake continues to be a dump yard||CHENNAI: Despite an NGT ruling to not dump garbage in the Chitlakappam lake, the town panchayat continues to do so with impunity. Residents rue that this is happening despite the town panchayat now coming under the Tambaram Corporation and 25crore being spent on restoring the lake. Sunil Jayaram of NGO Chitlapakkam Rising said despite the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board slapping a fine of 8 lakh for operating an unlicensed garbage incinerator, the local body continued to dump waste along the lake boundaries. “They have closed the incinerator now but the waste is still being dumped. The waste also is unsegregated,” said Jayaram. The town panchayat does not have a permanent waste segregation spot. Waste is dumped on the lake boundaries before it is removed the next day. The NGT had asked the local body to identify a permanent site to segregate its waste and to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. Sudhakar, another activist with the NGO, said, despite Chitlapakkam now having corporation status, the ground reality has not changed much. “The garbage pile along the lake now reaches the road; they have not collected it for the last five days. The Corporation Commissioner must give a full-time solution,” he said.  An official with the Tambaram Corporation said measures to find a permanent segregation spot were being discussed. “The commissioner will inspect the locality and we have already received requests from the residentss group. We are looking for a segregation site near Oragadam,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/despite-ngt-order-chitlapakkam-lake-continues-to-be-a-dump-yard/articleshow/88232095.cms||---

DM Chandrashekhar Singh, at a meeting with district officials here on Saturday, has directed them to form five flying squads to check people without masks at market places, public spots and overloaded buses in the city. The Corona control room/telemedicine centre has also been asked to resume in two shifts from Monday. “Any person can go to any of the 52 health centres and give their samples and get reports in 24 hours.

Naidu said the YSRC has not made a concerted effort at the Centre to secure SCS in the two-and-a-half years since it has come to power. Asking chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to speak on the issue, Naidu said YSRC MPs quitting Parliament would mount pressure on the Centre.

A convoy with hundreds of four-wheelers from across Maharashtra gathered in Aurangabad city and then started for Mumbai. The convoy, led by Jaleel, halted at Kaygaon Toka on the Aurangabad-Ahmednagar district border where the participants paid their respects to the statue of Kakasaheb Patil, who was the first person to commit suicide during the Maratha community’s statewide movement demanding reservation. The police teams rushed to the spot and briefly prevented the convoy from proceeding. While the media closely followed the movement, Jaleel alleged that on the directives of the state government, the police were preventing them from holding a rally while carrying the Tricolour. As his statement started getting political reactions, the police allowed the convoy to go ahead. “The rally was very much within the rights granted to us by the Constitution. We want educational reservation for the deprived class in the Muslim communit, and this has also been suggested by the High Court and a series of central and state government committees formed from time to time,” said Jaleel. He added, “This is just the beginning of our struggle to get reservation for the community, which has been systematically sidelined over past several decades.” Echoing him, party’s Aurangabad city president Shareq Nakshbandi said that in the coming days, a movement will be revived to get the rightful share.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aimim-takes-out-rally-without-police-permission/articleshow/88229359.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Police solved the mystery within two hours of receiving the complaint and recovered Rs 60 lakh in cash and other valuables. Kranti Rana Tata, city police commissioner, explained details of the theft at a press conference here on Saturday. Sirikonda Jaya Chandrasekhar (25), resident of Ranigari Thota area in the city, was employed with the main branch of the Attica Gold Company at MG Road. Faced with mounting debts, he thought of looting the gold and valuables in the shop and prepared a duplicate key, evading the notice of other employees and the manager. On Friday, company officials brought Rs 60 lakh cash from other branches and placed it at a locker at the MG Road branch. Chandrasekhar opened the lock of the showroom at around 1.30 am on Saturday and removed Rs 60 lakh, 42 grams gold and 1.5 kilos silver. Chandrasekhar tried to divert the attention of the police by portraying the incident as a theft and broke the key of the locker using an iron rod. He later went to his house and placed the bag full of cash at his friend’s house. In the morning, he went to the showroom and pretended to be shocked at the theft. City police under the leadership of DCP Harshavardhan Raju and city crime stopper (CCSL) inspected CCTV footage and identified that an employee at the showroom was involved in the theft as he opened the door with a duplicate key and seemed to know his way around the place.

---||Patna||Four from Bihar among top 5 aspirational districts in country||PATNA: Four districts of Bihar have figured among the top 5 aspirational districts in the country for the improved performance in the education sector in the month of October 2021. Releasing the ‘delta rankings’ on Friday, the Niti Aayog placed Muzaffarpur at second spot, followed by Aurangabad, Banka and Sheikhpura as third, 4th and fifth on the list. Dumka in Jharkhand has topped the list in education sector. The delta rankings are considered as a measurement of progress made by over 112 aspirational districts in the country across six developmental areas. Health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion, skill development and basic infrastructure were the development areas taken into consideration for the rankings. “Education is the key to champion the cause of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Presenting the top five most improved aspirational districts in the sector of education for the month of October 2021. Congratulations to champions of the change,” Niti Aayog tweeted. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in state education department, told this newspaper on Saturday that the topmost priority of the department is to ensure that every high school has its own building and infrastructure. “We are assessing the HR issues as to the availability of teachers, especially in the secondary schools. Library books, smart classes and ICT centres have been put up for effective and quality education in schools,” he said. “Sometimes back, we had decided to directly recruit teachers, headmasters and head teachers in all the primary and high schools. In the coming week, we will be sending the requisition to Bihar Public Service Commission for recruitment. Directly recruited headmasters will be a part of the government and not reporting to the panchayats. He/she will be more answerable and display better leadership quality. So, the department is working on different areas to improve the education system in Bihar,” Kumar said. Abdus Salam Ansari, district education officer (DEO) of Muzaffarpur, said teacher-pupil ratio, overall infrastructure, teaching quality, e-learning and other parameters have improved in the district. “The teacher-pupil ratio in Muzaffarpur has reached 50:1. The dropout rate of students from class V to VI and VIII to IX has declined. As far as infrastructure is concerned, most of the schools have separate toilets for girls. Other services like electricity, water supply and sanitation have also improved,” he said. The aspirational districts programme, launched in January 2018, aims at transforming the districts that have shown relatively lesser progress in key social areas. The ranking of aspirational districts is done every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-from-bihar-among-top-5-aspirational-districts-in-country/articleshow/88230037.cms||Faryal Rumi

IGIMS medical superintendent Dr Manish Mandal on Saturday said it took seven to ten days to confirm the virus strain and no case of Omicron has been detected so far. The genome sequencing process is going on uninterrupted, he said. The state government on Thursday sent Rs30 lakh as advance for the reagent being used for the viral strain test. The genome sequencing technique is a big step in healthcare facility as it would ascertain the strains of a host of diseases causing virus and help in deciding the proper line of treatment, Mandal said. Meanwhile, two patients of the 20 brought to IGIMS with serious complications after botched-up cataract surgery in Muzaffarpur, had their vision restored after successfully transplanting cornea. “All the 20 patients had serious eye infections. While 15 of them were discharged after undergoing the treatment by injectable and local methods, the doctors were hopeful they would regain their vision after completion of the prescribed doses. They would revisit the hospital for check-up after ten days. However, they are continuously being monitored by senior eye specialists and given a helpline number for contact in case of any difficulty. Two patients are still undergoing treatment for infections in their eyes,” Mandal said.

---||Chandigarh||HCMSA blames government of double speak, says ACS arrogant||Chandigarh: While accusing the state government of double speak, the Haryana Civil Medical Services Association (HCMSA) on Saturday accused the ACS (Health) of being rude to them and reiterated that the medicos will go on strike as per call on December 13. Besides closing all OPDs on December 13, the HCMSA also announced not to conduct any autopsy in government hospitals from December 14 onwards. HCMSA president Dr J S Panwar said that during a meeting convened by ACS Rajeev Arora, his conduct with the representatives have angered the medicos further. Panwar said that the delegation has genuine demands, which are in principle agreed upon by the minister and other authorities as well. “We had two rounds of meetings. The first round was held with the the DGHS and it was held in a very congenial atmosphere. Later, a meeting was fixed with ACS (Health) Rajeev Arora. He did not even allow us to speak. He outrightly refused to consider our demand related to withdrawal of decision related to direct recruitment of SMOs,” said Panwar. Similar was the fate of the other two demands, creation of sub cadre for specialists and revival of old system of PG reservation for HCMS doctors of the state. “The situation was such that we were left with no options but to leave the meeting. Now, a strike is imminent,” added Panwar. Panwar admitted that the strike shall derail the entire health system and put patients and their attendants to inconvenience. “We are forced to take this route. We are doctors, not criminals. Why don’t government give a humanitarian approach to our demands,” said Panwar Notably, for the past one year, medicos of government hospitals and health centers have waged a war against the health authorities to press for their demands. FInally, the HCMSA has given the call for strike on December 13, and only then the health authorities called HCMSA for the meeting on Friday. As the meeting was inconclusive, DGHS Dr Veena Singh had made a personal appeal to all the medicos of the state to not to participate in the strike called by association. Dr Singh had reasoned the requirement of doctors and their duties during the pandemic days as the main reason and had assured to reconvene the meeting of medicos to sort out the issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hcmsa-blames-government-of-double-speak-says-acs-arrogant/articleshow/88231090.cms||---

The Hasanpur MLA also dared Sadhu, the brother of his mother Rabri Devi, to face him in Patna. “Ruk hum awatani Bihar, tab garda udao tani tohar (wait for me to come to Patna and I will teach you a lesson),” Tej tweeted in Bhojpuri without taking any name. He termed his maternal uncle as ‘Kans mama’ (a character in the Mahabharata) and even threatened Sadhu to be in his limits or face the consequences. रुकऽअ हम आऽवतानी बिहार तऽ गर्दा उड़ाऽव तानी तोहार..!बुढ़-बुजुर्ग बाड़ऽअ, तनिक औक़ात में रहल सिखऽ। पाजामा से बाहर… https://t.co/NiLl6ylxWL— Tej Pratap Yadav (@TejYadav14) 1639212593000In another tweet, he uploaded some photographs of his newly floated Chhatra Jan Shakti Parishad members burning the effigy of Sadhu in Patna. हत्यारे साधु यादव का पुतला दहन छात्र जनशक्ति परिषद द्वारा किया गया।हमारी माँ-बहनों की इज़्ज़त को सरेआम बेइज़्ज़त… https://t.co/w1dXIf40KF— Tej Pratap Yadav (@TejYadav14) 1639220788000“It is an open invitation to that Kans, who is openly defaming our mothers and sisters, to have one to one with me in the battlefield, if he has consumed his mother’s milk (agar maa ka dudh piya hai). Or else just stand in front of me, if you have the capability,” Tej tweeted. Reacting to Tej’s aggression, Sadhu told ANI: “These people have been mentally torturing me for 10-12 years. Tejashwi are free to marry whoever you want, I’ve no objection... There’ll be serious repercussions if Lalu ji or behan ji (Rabri Devi) don’t control their children...I will expose Lalu, Tej and Tejashwi if they don’t control themselves.” Sadhu, while alleging torture, was referring to Tej’s allegation that he was a murderer of Shilpi Jain and Gautam Singh. The lovebirds had been killed in July 1999 and Sadhu had to undergo a DNA test in that case. This tussle between Mama-Bhanja erupted after Sadhu publicly spoke against the wedding of Tejashwi and asked the Yadavas and the people of Bihar to boycott him for marrying a girl from outside the community. Apart from Tej, even BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav, who was once a Lalu loyalist, showered all his love on Tejashwi and came in his support. Ram Kripal told a news portal that choosing a life partner is a personal matter and others should accept it and bless the couple. When asked if there is some dissent in the Yadav community against Tejashwi for choosing a Christian girl, he replied, “Such marriages are quite common nowadays. This is nothing new and we should accept it and bless the couple.” Ram Kripal even got emotional while recalling Tejashwi’s childhood and said, “He is like a son to me and my blessings and love will be always with him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tej-threatens-maternal-uncle-over-remarks-against-tejas/articleshow/88230181.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has placed special focus on food supplied at schools and fixed specific menus to ensure that children get complete nutrition. Boiled egg, peanut chikki and other nutritious items are included in the menu and nodal officers appointed to ensure the implementation of the scheme. Mid-day meal agencies started their agitation, demanding the government release the pending dues and increase the food preparation charges in view of the skyrocketing prices of essential commodities. "The government is providing rice for us. But the cost of vegetables has crossed 75 in wholesale markets. We are overburdened and not in a position to continue supply," said K S Prasad, a food contractor from Prakasam district. Agencies are requesting the government to increase the charges by 20 per cent and release dues that have been pending since July 2021. Meanwhile, education minister Adimulapu Suresh has taken a tough stance on the issue and directed officials to initiate action against the agencies that fail to implement the scheme. The minister told officials to give an explanation on the delay in uploading the pending bills on the online portal. He said the government will look into the issue and soon release the bills. Suresh added that strict action will be initiated against teachers who spread misinformation about the mid-day meal scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/mid-day-meal-agencies-demand-pay-hike-threaten-to-stop-supply/articleshow/88229944.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Passing love test, man marries blind girl for whom he wrote exams||AHMEDABAD: Never in her wildest dreams had Payal Sharma thought that she would find love in an examination hall of all places! The 26-year-old, who was pursuing her MA in Sanskrit, had sought an exam writer as she was visually-challenged. She met Hardik Dave, who first won her heart then convinced both their families to bless their union. And, on November 28, the two finally tied the knot. What makes this love story unusual is that Hardik and Payal met each other over a period of four years, mainly within the four walls of the examination centres before they confessed their love for each other. It all began with Payal looking for an exam writer. She met Hardik who has done his BA with Sanskrit as the main language and assisted blind students as an exam writer. He stayed her writer till she completed her BEd. While Hardik’s love for Payal grew every time they met during exams, Payal nurtured feelings for him too. “It was his touch that moved me. The way he held my hand while picking me up from the bus stop and accompanying me to the exam hall or while dropping me back showed his concern for me. I was not sure of his feelings so I waited for him to make the first move,” says Payal, who was a visiting faculty member at the Blind People’s Association till recently. Interestingly, Payal and Hardik rarely kept in touch outside examination centres, other than occasionally greeting each other during festivals. An astrologer, Hardik says he received over 10 marriage proposals in the past. “Some of them wanted me to quit my passion for astrology and do something else for a living. I was also deeply in love with Payal and she liked me for who I was. Her warm nature and strong will caught my heart,” said Hardik, who is a year older to her. Finally after four years, Hardik gathered the courage to propose to Payal in September 2020. While she said yes, he still had to convince their parents. It took some time for him to convince his parents. The second wave of Covid also delayed their plans for marriage. Recalling an incident, he said that Payal’s parents initially told him that she did not do any household work. “I told them not to worry and assured them that I will take care of everything. To my pleasant surprise, I got to know after marriage that she could cook well," says Hardik. Hailing from a village, he has now settled in Narol with Payal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/passing-love-test-man-marries-blind-girl-for-whom-he-wrote-exams/articleshow/88230678.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Photo by Punit LalTalking to TOI, Aaradhya said, “My father was my ideal. He always advised me to focus on my goals. I will follow his advice and achieve my dream, just like he did.” The final rites of Chauhan, who was killed along with CDS General Bipin Rawat and 11 other military personnel in a chopper crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district on Wednesday, were performed amid the chanting of patriotic slogans and state honours with the customary gun salute. The mortal remains of the late officer arrived at the Agra airport around 10 am and was later brought to his residence where hundreds of people had gathered to pay their tributes. Union minister SP Singh Baghel and senior defence personnel were there at the airport to receive the casket. Chauhan’s son Aviraj saluted his father after wearing his cap and later lit the pyre along with his sister. Outside the crematorium, huge crowds of mourners had gathered and people showered flower petals.

---||Ahmedabad||Slumdog millionaire: Amdavadi boy’s dark web of deceit||He dropped out of Class 12 because he wasn’t academically inclined and his family pressed him to take up some work. He was fond of digital devices, began surfing the internet and grew addicted to social media ‘likes’. One fateful morning, his virtual path crossed that of a man from Karachi, Jia Mustufa, who went on to mentor him on his path to swindling people of millions. He mastered the tricks and intricacies of this dubious work in three short years. It has fetched him nearly Rs 50 crore so far, which investigators estimate is the value of goods he has fraudulently bought and sold off. Police say he has 12 cryptocurrency accounts that they know of, with each holding $25,000 to $30,000. This is the story of 22-year-old Harshwardhan Parmar, a resident of Narayannagar Society in Isanpur, the son of a contracted sanitation worker who worked in the Covid-19 ward at SVP Hospital. Harshwardhan did not do well in school, barely passing the Class 10 exams. By Class 11, his family was pushing him to either study properly or start working. Fed up with their constant pressure, he started spending time on social media. He did some photo and video shoots, which gained him appreciation in terms of ‘likes’ on social media. In 2018, Parmar was added to a Telegram group named ‘Dark secrets’, where he came across people who used to sell active bank account details in bulk. Parmar also tried his hand at a few deals and earned around Rs 2,000 in his first one. While active on such groups, he came into contact with Mustufa, who advised him not to deal on the open web and to move to the dark web. Mustufa taught him the tricks of the scammer life and advised him to approach Russian hackers who run websites where active debit and credit card details of people from some 50 countries are sold. Parmar followed the instructions, bought credit and debit card details and began emptying the accounts of people in countries ranging from the US to Uganda. According to police, Parmar takes less than half a minute to get a victim’s credit or debit card, check the balance, and buy some valuables or jewellery, which he later sells for cash. According to an estimate, he bought and sold items worth Rs 50 crore in about a year. His racket was busted when the cops caught him and two others, after he placed an order for 30 refrigerators at a shop on Ashram Road. He was arrested and later released on bail. Even after his release, he has been continuing to make purchases from the dark web, by which his IP address cannot be traced. He also takes care of his friends. "If his friends wanted to have a party, Parmar would book a deluxe suite at a five-star hotel for them, pay for their wining and dining, and in some cases also for the services of sex workers of foreign origin," said a police officer investigating the case. Police say they are unable to act against him because he has not left a digital footprint of his racket. They say he has now graduated to running a syndicate of some 10 youths, who he is mentoring in scamming people. They now use the dark web to get debit or credit cards from Russian hackers and empty accounts, splitting various aspects of the ‘work’ and the proceeds. Parmar, now the mentor, gets the lion’s share. All these youths are school dropouts and are scamming wealthy people across the globe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/slumdog-millionaire-amdavadi-boys-dark-web-of-deceit/articleshow/88231103.cms||Ashish Chauhan

These technological devices will also help in the prevention of atrocities on women in the countryside,” Chaudhary said, adding that the CCTV cameras will be installed at 50 nodal points in every village. Similarly, street lights will also cover most parts of a village. He was talking to mediapersons at the state BJP headquarters as part of the party’s Sahyog programme. The state has over 8,000 panchayats and around 48,000 villages. He said the technological surveillance of every village will be done as part of the move to have smart villages in the state. Chaudhary said the installation of CCTV cameras and street lights in every village will begin after the completion of the ongoing panchayat elections, whose results will be out by December 14. After the results, the gazette notification will be made, followed by the formal constitution of the three-tier panchayati raj bodies – panchayats, panchayat samitis and zila parishads. “Once all this is completed, the installation of technological devices and street lights in every village will begin,” Chaudhary said. He said that pooling in the required finances for the purpose will not be difficult, as every mukhiya has at his or her disposal Rs1-2 crore to spend under central assistance. The green fund will also be used to improve the environmental conditions in the villages, like recycling of plastics and solid waste management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/50-cctv-cameras-in-each-village-after-panchayat-polls-bihar-minister/articleshow/88230736.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Jaipur||Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to attend Congress rally in Jaipur today||JAIPUR: Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will take part in the party’s mega rally against inflation here on Sunday, but there’s no confirmation yet on Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s presence, said state party in-charge Ajay Maken on Saturday. “Whether she will attend the rally will only be known on Sunday,” said Maken. Briefing reporters, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said the party’s ‘Mehangai Hatao Maharally’ on Sunday will be a decisive fight against the Central government. He alleged that the “anti-people Modi government” has given a double blow to people by first scuttling their livelihood opportunities and then throwing them in the fire of inflation. He alleged that while a select few got ‘mauka,’ people at large bagged ‘dhokha’ under the Modi govt.  “On December 12, Rajasthan will witness a great war against inflation. It will be a decisive fight against the Modi government, which is driven by overweening arrogance of power and is in deep slumber. The echo of the rally will be heard in the entire country,” Surjewala said. The rally was earlier proposed to be held in Delhi, but was shifted to Jaipur after it was denied permission by the Centre.According to last year’s labour ministry’s findings, the country faced the worst unemployment rate in the last 45 years with the numbers touching as high as 10 per cent at a point. He said for the last seven years, the Modi government had only created opportunities for the capitalists and cheated the common man. Necessities such as petrol, diesel, LPG, vegetables, pulses, edible oil have gone out of reach of the common man, he said. “In 2014 when the Modi government came to power, the price of LPG cylinder was Rs 400, diesel was Rs 56, petrol Rs 70 and crude oil USD108 per barrel,” he added. “Today, the price of domestic LPG cylinder has almost touched Rs 1,000, commercial cylinder beyond Rs 2000, petrol and diesel cost over Rs 100 per litre, cooking oil beyond Rs 200 per litre and even tomatoes Rs 100 per kg,” said the party general secretary. He also alleged that in the last seven years, the Modi government had “looted” the public of Rs 24 lakh crore by increasing excise duty on petrol and diesel. During UPA government, excise duty on petrol was only Rs 9.20 per litre, which was hiked to Rs 32.90 by the Modi government, he said. He said after its defeat in the November 4 by-elections, the BJP brought down excise duty on petrol to Rs 21.80 per litre, but it was still 512 per cent higher than what it was during the Manmohan Singh government. Citing a recent RBI report, the Congress leader said according to a report ‘Demonetisation and wrong GST,’ the Modi-government ruined the small and medium industries of the country. Despite demonetisation, the amount of cash in the economy increased by 64 per cent, he said. Just before demonetisation on November 8, 2016, cash in circulation was Rs 17.74 lakh crore, which increased to Rs 29.17 lakh crore on October 29, 2021, he said citing a RBI report. According to the recent ‘Global Hunger Index Report’, India was behind Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh ranking 101 in a list of 116 nations, he said. Surjewala also cited the ‘World Inequality Report’ issued this month to say 57 per cent of the total income of the nation rests with only top 10 per cent of people, while the bottom 50 per cent possess only 13 per cent of it. He cited an NSO report saying that under Modi government average income of farmers in the country was reduced by Rs 27 per day — less than MGNREGA wages. Far from doubling the income, the farmer's income was reduced ten times, he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rahul-priyanka-to-attend-cong-rally-in-jaipur-today/articleshow/88231108.cms||---

According to experts, multiple reasons are responsible for the degradation including lifting of Covid-19 lockdown, rampant increase in construction activity, wind flow and the increasing trend of burning bonfires in open air hotels. The data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reveals that in November and December last year, the air quality of Nagpur was under ‘satisfactory’ category. Usually, the air quality during winter season deteriorates due to temperature inversion. Due to this, the atmosphere’s mixing capacity decreases and particulate matter does not get dispersed during winter. After having a clean winter last year, the air quality has now gone to ‘poor’ and ‘moderate’ category this month. The latest CPCB data shows that on most of the days, the air quality index has been over 100, which can cause breathing discomfort to people with lungs, asthma and heart diseases. December 4 saw the dirtiest air when AQI level reached 174. Experts have attributed various reasons for the dip in air quality. “Last year during this time, the city had a lockdown which led to improvement in its air quality. Now with increase in vehicular movement, construction activities and other sources, the air pollution levels are high,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil Foundation. Pointing out towards climate change, founder of Centre for Sustainable Development (CFSD) Leena Buddhe said, “Also, though many people in Nagpur including civic officials believe that the thermal power plants are not contributing to the air pollution levels in, I differ from this opinion as I have seen this up close. The pollution is alarming with no check on the old plants which are still running. 20% fly ash is being released through the stacks.” Apart from this, open burning of garbage in many areas is also contributing to pollution. “The main contributors are particulate matter 2.5 and 10 and open burning is one of the main sources. Nowadays, most of the open air restaurants in city are offering small bonfires for every table which is also adding up to the particulate matter,” said environment activist Surabhi Jaiswal. As is being reported by TOI, the AQI is calculated based on air quality data of only one location – Civil Lines. “This is the cleanest and greenest area of Nagpur. The AQI of other polluted areas will be almost twice,” said Chatterjee, adding that meteorological conditions also play a role in air pollution. “Last year, the flow of winds was calmer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nov-dec-air-quality-worse-than-same-period-last-year/articleshow/88231105.cms||Manka Behl

The pilot phase of the project titled ‘Kochi Ithile’ has been completed and mayor M Anil Kumar and MLA K J Maxi will launch five digital signages and 20 physical signages at open space in front of Folklore Theatre, Ro-Ro Jetty Junction, at 4.30pm on Monday. It has been developed under the transformative urban mobility initiative (TUMI) in collaboration with Smart SUT for the corporation. ‘Kochi Ithile’ is an innovative wayfinding portal for both tourists and residents to navigate Fort Kochi. “The wayfinding signages developed through a consultative process aims to provide localized information both for residents as well as tourists. This information can be beyond architectural and heritage landmarks and can also provide local landmarks, public spaces, activity generators and other aspects which residents and tourists associate to. It has information both in Malayalam as well as in English,” said Rajeev Malagi, project manager, urban development - world resources institute (WRI)-India. A website and application for mobile phone and digital signages with additional information on navigation, tourist attractions, events etc are being readied. Yet another project being launched is ‘Kawaki’ initiative, which seeks to address the urban heat stress in the backdrop of Kochi’s vulnerability to climate change hazards. A study by WRI-India for Kochi corporation had shown that more than 30% of the city population is exposed to very high temperatures and more than 25% of the population live in flood plains. The Kawaki initiative focuses on increasing the city’s green cover by developing urban grooves of native trees in a data-based approach focusing on the most heat stress vulnerable regions. The project will be launched at Edward Memorial Government School Ground, Veli, Fort Kochi, at 3.30pm. A total of 100 trees belonging to 30 native species will be planted at this site. In addition, 400 trees will be planted at Cothalango brothers’ care home for disabled people at Palluruthy and 100 trees at SRV Higher Secondary School in Ernakulam South.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fort-kochi-to-get-wayfinding-signboards/articleshow/88244506.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Dehradun||For several cadets, it was a family legacy of military service||Dehradun: The Indian Military Academy’s Passing Out Parade (POP) on Saturday was a low-key affair with no celebrations as the country mourned the death of chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others in a chopper crash in Coonoor on Wednesday. Of the 387 gentlemen cadets who passed out on Saturday, some were among those carrying on the legacy of the families who served or are serving in the military. “My brother is a third-generation Army personnel. My father served for 24 years in the Kumaon regiment, my grandfather before him served as well. And now my brother has become an officer and we couldn’t be prouder,” said Tara Chandra, elder brother of cadet Suresh Chandra of the Dogra Regiment. The family was also looking forward to having their son back home for a mini vacation before he reports back for duty next month. “We hadn’t seen him for the past 16 months because of Covid-19 restrictions. It would have been good to have him home for a couple of weeks,” said Chandra, a native of Jaspur, Almora. Family members also reflected on how their sons had wanted to pursue a military career from the very beginning. “He grew up surrounded by military personnel on both his maternal and paternal side. Ever since he was a little kid, he had wanted to serve so he enrolled as a jawan after class XII and then made it to the IMA. He has done us proud,” said Captain (retd) Gyan Chand, father of cadet Harpreet Dogra (27), natives of Jammu. Saturday’s ceremony saw a total of 387 gentlemen cadets of 149 Regular Course and 132 Technical Graduate Course, including 68 gentlemen cadets from ten friendly foreign countries successfully pass out from Indian Military Academy, overcoming all challenges of Covid-19. However, for some, a military career had not always been the dream. “He was pursuing his graduation from Mumbai university and was planning to go for Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) when he came in contact with a lieutenant who was a guest lecturer at his college a few years ago. Later, he changed his mind and said he wanted to become an officer and serve the country. It was an adjustment for us in the beginning but we couldn’t be happier about his decision to pursue this career. He was one of the top cadets in his company and he has done the whole family proud. We come from a humble farming background and the whole family is rejoiced at the idea of having an officer in our midst,” said Vikas Choudhary, brother of cadet Pratham Choudhary, a native of Ringnod, Madhya Pradesh. Most of these families are now looking forward to having their sons home for a while before they report back for duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/for-several-cadets-it-was-a-family-legacy-of-military-service/articleshow/88230539.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Mangaluru||Movement of more than 1k aircraft at MIA in November||Mangaluru: Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) has crossed the movement of 1,000 aircraft in November. The movement of a total 1,030 aircraft have been recorded in the month. MIA touched this milestone for the first time, after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Besides, there is also an increase in passenger traffic at the airport. In October, MIA handled a total of 987 aircraft, including 196 international aircraft. The number of passengers flying from the airport has also grown, from 81,583 domestic passengers in October, to 89,387 passengers in November. International flights increased to 204 at the airport, with 27,053 passengers, from 196 aircraft in October. Both passenger and aircraft movement suffered after the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country in March 2020. The aviation sector started to see positive growth once flights resumed, but witnessed a dip due to the second wave. “The domestic sector picked up quickly, as the ministry of civil aviation announced that airlines can operate without any restrictions, starting from October 18. Restrictions were imposed for about one-and-a-half-years. This is also one of the major reasons for the increase of domestic air traffic and passenger footfall at the airport. Besides, air traffic has gone up with the implementation of winter schedule from October end, and an increase in operations by Air India Express and low-cost carrier Indigo,” a source added. A senior executive from a low-cost airline explained that aircraft and passenger movement were expected to go up in December. However, there was a setback after the Omicron variant scare. The domestic passenger numbers, especially to Mumbai, witnessed a dip in the first week of December, but is currently stable. All the domestic flights are flying at full capacity during weekends. “During our interaction with passengers, we realised that many were worried about producing RT-PCR negative test report, that is mandatory to fly to Mumbai. The RT-PCR test costs extra, and it is time consuming for many travellers who are on a short visit,” said an executive. Another airline company executive added that the industry was expecting more international flights to resume from this month.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New Town walkers find trees hacked, sludge dumped||KOLKATA: For the last few days morning walkers and birdwatchers in New Town have been noticing cutting of trees, dumping of cement mixed sludge on barren and marshy land and haphazard dumping of waste on dead end roads around Silicon Valley area early in the morning. The matter was raised by residents in the local Whatsapp groups on Saturday for NKDA to take notice. Early on Saturday, a morning walker and avid bird watcher, spotted a person cutting off thick branches of a tree and stacking them on a ricksaw van. “When I approached the person, he said NKDA had apparently engaged him to cut a few trees for some work. He hurriedly left the place with the cut branches,” said Kunal Majumder, a local resident. Such unscrupulous activities will damage the rich bird ecology of the place, point out residents. “Many birds are seen here. Only recently a rare Eurasian Scops owl was sighted close by. Stubble and biomass burning which was earlier rampant in this area have reduced so far due to campaigning, but dumping of construction sludge from nearby places and tree cutting have become the new nuisance,” said Arindam Dutta Chowdhury, another resident. Residents said after entering from Owl’s Junction a dead end road has become a garbage dumping spot. “There are small waterbodies near Owl’s Junction that are slowly getting filled up,” said Anuradha Biswas, a resident of Mallika Malancha housing complex. “Any complaint of tree felling or garbage dumping will be definitely looked into,” said an NKDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-walkers-find-trees-hacked-sludge-dumped/articleshow/88230550.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Bhujbal had written to Scindia urging him to start more flights connecting Nashik with other destinations in the country under the UDAN scheme. Bhujbal had stated that the central government had launched the UDAN scheme to enhance the air connectivity between tier I and tier II cities. The Nashik HAL airport was also included in the bidding for various sectors under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS). Nashik airport was awarded 9 air routes by different airlines under the scheme. However, even after 3 years, the airlines have not started services in the sectors awarded to Nashik airport during the bidding in RCS Udan-I, II and III. Bhujbal had requested Scindia to look into the matter on a priority basis and do needful for enhancing the air connectivity. Scindia informed Bhujbal that his ministry would share Bhujbal’s concern with all domestic airlines. At present, Nashik has air connectivity with Ahmedabad, Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Belagavi. Alliance Air and a small private airline are operating flights from the Nashik airport. Another private airline has stopped its Nashik-Ahmedabad flight due to operational issues. Another low-cost private airline, which had stopped its flights from Nashik to Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad after the second outbreak of Covid-19 in March, is yet to restart operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pvt-airline-to-start-nashik-goa-flight-in-january-scindia/articleshow/88229395.cms||Tushar Pawar

Launching a scathing attack against the Congress, Bawankule who was BJP contestant for the polls, said Patole came under pressure of two ministers from the city for withdrawing support to Ravindra Bhoyar, who switched over from BJP to Congress. “Due to the two ministers, the MPCC chief had to change his decision at the last moment. It shows that he is incapable of leading the grand old party as he cannot take his own decisions. Due to him, the party faced acute embarrassment for changing an imported candidate and supporting an independent one. He lost the right to lead the party,” Bawankule told the media. Patole couldn’t be contacted for comments on the issue. Expressing confidence that he will win the elections, the former power minister said BJP had 318 votes and no other candidate could have won the polls. “All votes beyond this figure would be of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). There is no point in saying that Bhoyar was sent as a Trojan horse to the MVA camp. He himself went here and decided to remain with the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-should-resign-over-mlc-poll-candidate-debacle-bawankule/articleshow/88231109.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nashik||Nashik: Active cases below 400 first time since May ’20||Nashik: The number of active cases in Nashik district ha dropped below 400 for the first time since May last year, when the cases were rising before the first wave of the pandemic. After registering the first Covid case on March 29 last year, the number of cases started rising sharply and in May 2020, the total number of active cases had crossed 400. “This is the first time the number of active cases has come down below 400 since then,” Dr Anant Pawar, the nodal officer for Covid, said. The infection is reducing. There are 147 active cases in Nashik city, and 148 in the rural areas. Active patients in Malegaon and those from out of district account for 14 more cases. The total comes to 309 cases. It may be noted that the first wave of infection peaked around August-September 2020 when there were more than 13,000 active cases. After that, the number dropped in January-February to 1,000. The number of active cases again shot up to 48,000 in the month of April 2021. “Thereafter, the number has been declining steadily. The larger reason is that people have been vaccinated. The vaccine is cutting down the severity of the infection. This is the reason to focus on vaccination,” another senior officer from the civil hospital said. The current rate of positivity is pegged around 0.9% and the number of deaths has also fallen when compared week-wise during the past fortnight period. “This week, there were four deaths as compared to seven during the earlier week,” the officer added. The officials, however, have cautioned against rejoicing over the current situation given the threat of the spread of Omicron variant and the possibility of third wave still being on the horizon. “We have to stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour if we do not want repeat of the situation in first or second wave. The people should get vaccinated at the earliest and also continue to wear the masks properly when they are moving in public places,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-active-cases-below-400-first-time-since-may-20/articleshow/88229405.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Inspector Sunil Rohakale said no arrests have been made so far. The case was registered by an official of the MSTDC against the trio — for not carrying out the recruitment process of 389 posts in a transparent manner — under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. An investigation will be carried out and further action will be taken accordingly, Rohakale said. The police said the case pertains to the recruitment process. After objections were raised, then chief minster Devendra Fadnavis had ordered an enquiry chaired by divisional commissioner Eknath Dawale. The commissioner’s report submitted to the state government had indicted two officials. The police complaint was registered on Thursday.

Forest officials after primary investigations have concluded that the leopard had died in a fight with a tiger. The carcass of the around 7-year-old male leopard was found in the forest near Chargaon Badge during routine patrolling. A team of foresters led by ACF (Tendu and Widlife), RM Wakde, with the help of honorary wildlife warden Vivek Karambdekar, livestock development officers Dr Vinod Surpam and Dr SS Gavhare inspected the spot. Officials have ruled out poaching claiming that all the valuable body parts of leopard were intact. There were signs of a scuffle with a higher predator. Hence officials inferred that the beast might have died in a fight with a tiger.  The carcass was shifted to the timber depot in Sindewahi where postmortem was carried out. Veterinary doctors have collected the viscera sample to confirm the cause of death. The carcass was later incinerated before witnesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/leopard-killed-in-fight-with-tiger/articleshow/88231112.cms||Mazhar Ali

The Union government launched ‘Startup India’ as a flagship initiative in January 2016 to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship, and provide employment opportunities.  According to the official statistics, these 950 startups have generated about 9,600 jobs in Andhra Pradesh. The state has so far developed five business incubators in Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Kakinada, Anantapur and Tadepalli. However, Andhra Pradesh pales in comparison with the employment created in other major states through the startups recognised by DPIIT. Maharashtra has topped the table with 1.21 lakh jobs, followed by Karnataka (92,444), Delhi (75,784), Uttar Pradesh (54,500), Gujarat (43,313) and Haryana (41,533). Andhra Pradesh is nowhere compared to its neighbouring Telugu state Telangana that provided jobs to 37,202 people since January 2016. Former chairman and managing director of the National Research Development Corporation and DPIIT-IPR chair, Andhra University, Prof Hanumanthu Purushotham said the state government is taking a lot of initiatives to encourage startup ecosystem in the state. “Due to the same, several youth are taking a plunge into startup territory. Seed funding, infrastructure and mentoring support need to be improved to further the startup culture in the state. Andhra University, on its part, constructed a separate building for incubation centre on the campus,” said Prof Purushotham.  As per the existing provisions of the Income Tax Act under the Startup India initiative, the startups are exempted from taxation on the profits and gains derived from their businesses for three consecutive assessment years out of 10 years beginning from the year in which they are incorporated. Based on their growth cycle, these 950 startups in state are in various stages of development – from ideation and validation to early traction and scaling. For example, the Visakhapatnam-based School Radio, founded by Aruna Gali, is in the scaling phase. The startup is working on enhancing the capacities of children and youth to communicate, participate and voice effectively. The ‘House of Tribe Private Limited’, the startup from East Godavari which is also in scaling phase, manufactures chemical-free Ayurvedic products for skin, hair, health and wellness. Agritech is the focus area for the ‘Spectrum Forages’ startup from Krishna district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-startups-created-10k-jobs-in-last-5-yrs/articleshow/88229963.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Instead of stopping the SUV, the driver sped up his vehicle and hit Mukesh. “He fell on the road and received injuries on both his legs. The errant driver fled the spot with his vehicle towards Badarpur,” the complainant added. The victim was rushed to the hospital for further treatment. A case under sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and 119/177 MV act was registered in Pul Prahladpur police station.

Police said that she was hit with a brick on her head and that the suspect might be a known person as the entry to the deceased’s house was friendly. The deceased was identified as Kusum Singhal, who lived alone at her residence. “Her husband, who had a business of auto parts, expired a few years ago. The couple has two daughters—one lives in South Delhi with her husband, while another lives in Switzerland,” an officer said. Deputy commissioner of police (central) Shweta Chauhan said, on Saturday afternoon, when her daughter was not able to reach her over the phone, she called a neighbour to check on her. “When the neighbour reached the residence of the woman around 2:10 pm, he found Singhal lying on the floor,” Chauhan added. Later, a PCR call was made about the incident and the victim was rushed to hospital where she was declared dead. While inspecting the scene of the crime, police found that the suspect had a friendly entry. Things were, however, lying scattered on the floor. “She was living alone in the house so we were not able to find out if something was missing. We have questioned a few people in the case,” the officer said. “She was hit on the head with an old brick. An FIR has been registered at Rajinder Nagar Police Station under relevant sections and an investigation is on to nab the culprit,” the officer added. Police are scanning CCTV footage of the area to get a clue about the incident. Several teams from the central district have been formed to investigate the case from all possible angles, including robbery, personal enmity and family dispute, said another officer. According to police data, till October 31, about 380 murder incidents were reported. Sources said crime-related murders were fewer and a majority were the fallout of personal enmity and sudden provocation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/79-yr-old-woman-killed-at-home-in-rajendra-ngr/articleshow/88231129.cms||---

The Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) is likely to cut around 60 big trees, including some historical ones transplanted at Trimurti Nagar, for development of hospital on design, built, finance, operate and transfer basis.As per residents and traders of Trimurti Nagar, a team of NIT has measured and demarcated the area to be handed over to a private company for development of the hospital.Confirming the development, NIT officials told TOI that they did not count trees on land proposed for hospital. “Priority is to demolish encroachments on the land and hand it over to the private company,” they said.As per documents obtained from the NIT, an area of 33,213.22 sq ft (3,086.73 sq m) will be handed over to Zest Multicare Hospital Private Ltd, erstwhile ABCP Health Care.TOI found that majority of the 60 big trees standing on the land are very old. This is the same place where NIT had transplanted trees removed for widening roads under Integrated Road Development Project (IRDP) in 2001.According to local residents and traders, majority of the trees couldn’t but around 10 transplanted trees have survived. “The NIT or Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had planted other trees many years ago which are not yet fully grown,” they said.Green crusader Shrikant Deshpande termed it as unfortunate that green spaces are being targeted in the name of infrastructure development. Already process is under way to cut over 4,000 trees for inter-model station at Ajni, over 600 for road, commercial buildings at Empress Van, Metro Rail Station related works on Wardha road and Futala Redevelopment Project.“NIT should redevelop hospitals like Nagarik Sahakari Hospital on North Ambazari road, Devadiya Hospital at Lakadganj, Dik dispensary on VIP road, Buty Hospital at Sitabuldi etc or construct new one if needed,” Deshpande said.He said it is important to reserve places having trees as green belt. “We cannot compensate the loss of big trees in any way,” Deshpande said.The NIT has been for long planning to hand over the sprawling space located between Gajanan Maharaj Mandir and Shankar Saoji but it has come to fore now due to measurement and demarcation of the land.As per NIT documents, the land was acquired on March 29, 1984, and reserved for public and semi-public purpose. It was leased out to three social organizations in 1991. Due to litigations, the lease was cancelled.Despite transplanting many trees there, the NIT had revised the land reservation to dispensary and maternity home in 2001. In 2014, tender was floated for leasing it out for development of hospital.

The MSEDCL employees and officials conducted surprise raids and meter checks across Nashik and Malegaon circles in the district that fall under the Nashik zone. The checks were carried out at premises of 2,850 consumers – residential, commercial and even industrial. Accordingly, action has been taken against 423 consumers for violating section 135 of the Electricity Act by using power illegally and fiddling with the energy meter. The officials said that some of the consumers were engaged in power thefts by tapping the power from open source using hooks to draw the electricity in the premises from the overhead electricity supply lines. In other cases, the consumers had altered connections in and out of the meter, which ensured that the power supplied to the consumers was unaccounted for. In case of such alterations to the energy meters, power consumers are billed for the past one to two years, depending upon the assessment, levied penalty and compounding charges if the person has been booked for the first time. If it is a repeat offence, an FIR is filed with the police station. No FIRs have been registered this time, but the consumers were issued penalties and bills to the extent of Rs 2.5 lakh. In Nashik rural division, 213 persons have been booked for the offence, similarly, 128 consumers have been booked in Chandwad, 74 in Nashik City – 2 division, and 8 consumers in Nashik City – 1 division have been booked under section 135. Besides, some people were either using the power illegally in two houses, or were using power despite the connection being already cut for not paying dues, or had drawn lines to provide the power to some other establishments like a laundry shop, a small kiosk, etc. All such persons have been booked under section 126 for illegal use of power. Under this section, 30 consumers in Nashik city – 2 division, 18 in Chandwad, 13 in Nashik Rural and 1 in Nashik city – 1 division have been booked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/488-consumers-booked-for-power-theft-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/88229421.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Dehradun||For several cadets, it was a family legacy of military service||Dehradun: The Indian Military Academy’s Passing Out Parade (POP) on Saturday was a low-key affair with no celebrations as the country mourned the death of chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, his wife and 11 others in a chopper crash in Coonoor on Wednesday. Of the 387 gentlemen cadets who passed out on Saturday, some were among those carrying on the legacy of the families who served or are serving in the military. “My brother is a third-generation Army personnel. My father served for 24 years in the Kumaon regiment, my grandfather before him served as well. And now my brother has become an officer and we couldn’t be prouder,” said Tara Chandra, elder brother of cadet Suresh Chandra of the Dogra Regiment. The family was also looking forward to having their son back home for a mini vacation before he reports back for duty next month. “We hadn’t seen him for the past 16 months because of Covid-19 restrictions. It would have been good to have him home for a couple of weeks,” said Chandra, a native of Jaspur, Almora. Family members also reflected on how their sons had wanted to pursue a military career from the very beginning. “He grew up surrounded by military personnel on both his maternal and paternal side. Ever since he was a little kid, he had wanted to serve so he enrolled as a jawan after class XII and then made it to the IMA. He has done us proud,” said Captain (retd) Gyan Chand, father of cadet Harpreet Dogra (27), natives of Jammu. Saturday’s ceremony saw a total of 387 gentlemen cadets of 149 Regular Course and 132 Technical Graduate Course, including 68 gentlemen cadets from ten friendly foreign countries successfully pass out from Indian Military Academy, overcoming all challenges of Covid-19. However, for some, a military career had not always been the dream. “He was pursuing his graduation from Mumbai university and was planning to go for Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) when he came in contact with a lieutenant who was a guest lecturer at his college a few years ago. Later, he changed his mind and said he wanted to become an officer and serve the country. It was an adjustment for us in the beginning but we couldn’t be happier about his decision to pursue this career. He was one of the top cadets in his company and he has done the whole family proud. We come from a humble farming background and the whole family is rejoiced at the idea of having an officer in our midst,” said Vikas Choudhary, brother of cadet Pratham Choudhary, a native of Ringnod, Madhya Pradesh. Most of these families are now looking forward to having their sons home for a while before they report back for duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/for-several-cadets-it-was-a-family-legacy-of-military-service/articleshow/88230575.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Cabinet reshuffle likely after budget session in February-March||VIJAYAWADA: The much-awaited cabinet reshuffle is likely to happen only after the budget session in February-March next year. It was earlier being speculated that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy will reshuffle his cabinet in December. The chief minister is expected to drop 50% of ministers and induct new faces in their place when the reshuffle happens. However, Balineni Srinivasa Reddy, the minister for energy, forests & environment, science & technology who is also known to enjoy the chief minister’s confidence, has hinted that there would be a 100 per cent replacement of ministers in the cabinet. He also asserted that the chief minister himself has given indications on going for a 100 per cent revamp of the cabinet. While the aspirants have already started lobbying to get a berth in the cabinet if the revamp or reshuffle is taken up, sources say the chief minister has already readied the list of new cabinet ministers. He is believed to have taken all factors into consideration, and plans to give representation to every section and every social group. Jagan himself had announced he would drop 50% of his ministers after two-and-a-half years when he constituted the cabinet on June 8, 2019. Accordingly, the reshuffle is due in December which raised the hopes of aspirants. However, it now seems the chief minister is having second thoughts on the reshuffle as some of the ministers have argued against having new faces when the party has to prepare for the 2024 elections.

Technical issues would not come in the way of the court or the authority concerned, in recognising the said benefits,” justice Prathiba M Singh noted recently while dismissing a petition filed by an educational institute that coerced a professor to take online classes after she went on maternity leave. The institute had challenged Delhi government labour department’s order to compensate the woman. The high court remarked that an organisation is expected to be empathetic to the cause of a pregnant woman rather than making bald allegations against her, especially when it knew the woman professor was at an advanced stage of pregnancy. “The impugned order also shows clearly that in fact, after she proceeded on maternity leave, she had been asked to take classes online, which she did take on November 27, 2018,” the court observed. It added that since the awarded amount is yet to be paid since 2018 and three years have passed, in addition to the awarded amount, litigation expenses of Rs 50,000 be paid to the woman. “The entire awarded amount along with the litigation expenses shall be paid on or before December 30, 2021. If the amount is not paid by December 30, 2021, interest @ 9 per cent per annum shall be liable to be paid with effect from August 13, 2020, i.e., the date of the award,” the court said. In its appeal against the compensation order, the institute claimed it was not aware that the woman was pregnant and intimation was received by it only after she was served with the relieving letter. However, the woman maintained that an email was sent to the institute on October 17, 2018, prior to the time the relieving letter was received by her, where she informed the organisation of being at an advanced stage of pregnancy, and informed that she would be required to go on maternity leave from the first week of November 2018, on the advice of her gynaecologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/technical-grounds-wont-stop-maternity-benefits/articleshow/88231148.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The MMLPs will come up under public private partnership (PPP) mode. The government has already proposed Visakhapatnam and Ananthapur for the two logistic parks and sent proposals. While works on the MMLPs in Bengaluru, Chennai, Nagpur and Guwahati have already started, the other MMLPs are at the proposal stage, including the two proposed for Andhra Pradesh. The logistic parks, which are supposed to reduce goods transport expenditure and minimise the risk involved in cargo transport, have been jointly proposed by the Union ministry of surface transport and National Highways Authority of India to minimise freight costs, warehouse costs, reduce vehicular pollution and traffic congestion. Each MMLP will come up in minimum 100 acres area having access to various modes of transport. They would also have specialised storage solutions, besides providing customs clearance, quarantine zones, testing facilities and storage. According to Centre,over 13% of cost of any product in country comes from transport expenditure. The government has proposed these MMLPs to reduce this transport cost to 8%. The MMLPs would facilitate the manufacturers or distributors to shift their products in large quantity to these places from where distribution would start in respective MMLP sector, which would minimise transport cost of the products from the manufacturing place to the distribution place. Meanwhile, the government has also sent a second proposal to the central government requesting it to consider two more MMLPs in the state. The state has proposed the two additional logistic parks at Kakinada and Krishnapatnam, where ports are available. Over 13% of the cost of any product in country comes from transport expenditure.

The patient told doctors that he turned 18 on November 20 and so couldn’t take the vaccine. He had travelled to Kolkata and became symptomatic on his return. On December 1, he was admitted to Orange City Hospital & Research India with complaints of fever and cough for a week and difficulty in breathing since day one of infection. His oxygen saturation level (SPO2) too had dropped to 85%. These symptoms, predominantly seen during the second wave in most mild to critical patients, are now rarely seen among Covid positive patients, especially those who are partially or fully vaccinated. The youth’s Covid report was found positive on December 2 morning. “He was put on non-invasive ventilator for six days. Timely treatment helped him recover fast. He is off oxygen support for the last 24 hours and is likely to be discharged by Monday. He is maintaining 98% O2 level without any support,” said chest physician Dr Sushant Muley who led the clinical team. The patient’s CT severity score was 15/25 beside high D-Dimer. “In view of hypoxia and non-maintaining of oxygen level with high concentration mask, he was put on non-invasive ventilator support. Looking at his investigations and condition, remdesivir and tocilizumab injections too were given to him,” Dr Muley said. As per Dr Muley, treatment of the unvaccinated youngster was a challenge due to obesity, deranged blood parameters and severe chest infection at time of admission. “Yet, we managed to treat him successfully. Recent evidence has shown that obesity weakens the immune system and, therefore, making the host vulnerable to infectious diseases.” Dr Milind Pande, pathologist, Dr Nishikant Lokhande, radiologist and their teams offered diagnostic support. Dr Muley was assisted by clinical assistants Dr Aves Hasan, Dr Kushal Narnawre, Dr Nilesh Pidhekar and Dr Akash Jaiswal. Nurses Sangeeta Ahirwar, Sheetal Chandekar and Shilpa took care of the patient. Dr Muley said obesity has emerged as a strong risk factor for severe disease in the current pandemic. Several independent studies have demonstrated that obese subjects with Covid-19 have a higher risk of severe disease, hospitalization and increased probability of death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/critically-ill-112kg-unvaxxed-youth-recovers-from-covid/articleshow/88229829.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

On several occasions, officials have noticed a failure on their part to adhere to the quarantine rules laid down by the district administration. Though the inter-state students studying in various medical, paramedical and other colleges in the district have been asked to remain in quarantine for seven days in their rooms, after their return from Kerala, most of them have been found to be roaming around and attending classes. As many as 20 students, all from Kerala, tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 10 days. Similarly, in the past few months, during the second wave of the pandemic, several students on campus tested positive for Covid-19. In August, 58 cases were reported on a campus in the city, and a majority of them were students from Kerala. Dr Jagadeesh, district surveillance officer, told TOI that at present two institutions have been declared as containment zones in the district. “All the students who tested positive in the two institutions hail from Kerala. We have sent swabs of all these students for RT-PCR tests, and the results of many are still awaited. We have increased surveillance on campuses amidst the Omicron variant scare. There will be no threat of the virus spreading, if all the students returning from Kerala, strictly remain in quarantine for seven days. They are restricted from entering even the dining hall of the hostels during the quarantine period. However, many students do not follow the guidelines. They should undergo the RT-PCR test on the eighth day,” he added. Dr Ashok H, district nodal officer for Covid-19, said that if an infected student comes on campus, then all his primary contacts may get infected, in case they do not remain in quarantine for a week. “I have sent letters to all medical, paramedical and engineering colleges in the district, directing their managements to insist on seven days’ mandatory quarantine for students from Kerala. Institutions have been told that just checking students’ RT-PCR negative report is not sufficient. They should ensure that all students who return from Kerala remain in quarantine,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/kerala-students-frequent-visits-to-hometown-a-cause-of-concern/articleshow/88229999.cms||---

However, to ensure smooth vehicular movement, the NMSCDCL has cordoned off the existing traffic island so the vehicles can go around it from Saturday. Sumant More, the CEO of NMSCDCL, said, “The plan is to make a circular traffic island at the chowk. What would be set up at the centre of the traffic island would be decided later. The current exercise is to determine the size of the circular traffic island for the vehicles to drive around it smoothly.” More said they have decided to conduct a trial run for 10 days to observe the traffic flow at different hours of the day. NMSCDCL has also sought suggestions and objections from the people. After the 10 days of observation and the suggestions received from the citizens, a meeting of the area corporators would be called to spell out the further plan. Raviwar Karanja is one of the oldest places in the city. Surrounded by a huge market, the flow of vehicles through this place is constant throughout the day. The trial run around the proposed traffic island is to check if the movement of the vehicular traffic is more coordinated. ACP Seetaram Gaikwad of the city traffic branch said that traffic personnel have been deployed at the junction to streamline the vehicular traffic. Meanwhile, some motorists have expressed displeasure over the proposed plan of increasing the size of the traffic island.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmscdcl-to-beautify-nashiks-iconic-raviwar-karanja-chowk/articleshow/88229458.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Ahmedabad||Deserted’ hubby files FIR against wife who settled in Canada||Ahmedabad: Police complaints against men who desert their wives to migrate abroad are a routine affair in India. Here, a husband has filed an FIR against his wife for leaving him behind after he spent Rs 30 lakh on sending her to Canada, but she now refuses to have him join her after having settled there. The FIR was registered at Mansa police station in Gandhinagar district on November 25, in which Vishwas Patel accused his wife Palak Patel of cheating and breach of trust. He stated that they got married in November 2014 and since Palak wanted to go to Canada, he and his family spent a huge amount to help her clear the IELTS and go abroad. The woman and her parents promised that once she got to Canada, she would get him to join her in Canada. The woman went to Canada in November 2016. Earlier this year, she initiated the process to get Canadian citizenship, for which she required a police clearance certificate (PCC). Her request for a PCC remained pending as Mansa police did not respond in time. When her husband and in-laws came to know about her plan to secure Canadian citizenship, they filed a complaint with Mansa police claiming that by not calling the husband to Canada and not returning the money spent on her migration, she was committing breach of trust. Her parents were also named as accused for abetment. While the process to obtain the PCC was stuck, the woman moved the Gujarat high court against the police inaction. The cops immediately issued the police verification certificate to her. As she is settled in Canada and was running against time, she applied to the Indian Embassy in Toronto for completion of clearance. On October 29, the high court directed the Regional Passport Office and the consul general of India to complete the process for her PCC within 15 days so that she could pursue the citizenship process in Canada. Patel did not receive her PCC for the next 26 days. On the other hand, Mansa police registered an FIR against her and her parents for cheating, breach of trust and abetment. She moved the HC again through advocate Nilay Patel and urged the HC to punish the RPO and consul general for contempt of court for wilful disobedience of the court order since it not only delayed the citizenship process, but in the meantime she was booked by police due to the delay. A bench of Justice A J Desai and Justice S J Dave issued notices to the RPO and consul general in Toronto, seeking an explanation as to why action for contempt of court should not be initiated against them. They have been asked to reply by December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deserted-hubby-files-fir-against-wife-who-settled-in-canada/articleshow/88230593.cms||---

On one hand, they were happy at having successfully completed their grueling training at the elite academy while on the other, they were worried as an uncertain future stares at them. “We are currently at a dead end. The academy has informed us that we can leave, now that our training is over. But where do we go? Our country is under Taliban rule. We can stay back in India but that will have to be at our own expense,” an Afghan cadet, requesting anonymity, told TOI. He added that all the 40 cadets were going to Delhi on Saturday evening, where they will take a decision on the plan ahead over the next couple of days. According to sources, a total of 83 Afghan cadets were undergoing training at IMA when the Taliban took over the country in August. Since then, there had been speculations on the fate of these cadets. On Saturday, the uncertainty continued, with academy officials saying that the ministry of external affairs (MEA) will decide on the matter. Meanwhile, even as the Afghan cadets fretted about their future, they made sure that their passing out day was a memorable one. They could be seen enjoying the moment with their course-mates and reveling in the excitement of the last day of the academy. Echoing the sentiments of many, one of the Afghan cadets, posting pictures of the IMA parade and the ceremony on his social media profile, wrote, “Our story ends here. And it has been fulfilling. From one day to day one.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nowhere-to-go-40-afghan-cadets-stare-at-uncertain-future/articleshow/88230592.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

In terms of money, state discoms face a revenue shortfall of Rs 10,345 crore. Official data indicates that the average cost of supplying power to a consumer in the state is Rs 6.92 per kWh, while the projected revenue of the utilities on a per unit of electricity basis after considering all revenue sources such as tariff income, cross subsidy surcharge, etc. is only Rs 5.25. The gap between expenditure and income is Rs 1.67 per kWh, which in total translates to a gap of Rs 10,345 crore. The tariff income for the year is Rs 30,148.29 crore, which translates to Rs 4.88 per kWh. The real gap between the cost associated with supplying power and revenues realized is Rs 2.04 per kWh, translating to a gap of Rs 12,630 crore. Sources said there is no choice but to undertake deep structural reforms to undo the profound systemic damage to the power sector. Officials also blame the previous regime for the power sector’s liabilities. The debt in the books of power sector corporations has more than doubled from Rs 33,587.98 crore to Rs 70,254 crore over the five-year period (2014-19). Dues by discoms to power generators have increased more than seven-fold, from Rs 2,893.23 crore to Rs 21,540.96 crore during 2014-19. Sources said the interest burden alone is about Rs 8,000 crore per annum, which translates to Rs 1.33 per kWh of power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/discoms-stare-at-a-revenue-gap-of-rs-10345-cr/articleshow/88230005.cms||---

There was a huge shortage of oxygen during the second Covid wave in March, April and May this year. People had to rush to private hospitals or other government hospitals like the Nashik civil hospital, Bytco Hospital and Dr Zakir Hussain hospital. So after the second wave subsided, an LMO plant was set up in the cantonment hospital with the help of a few donors. The CEO of DCB Rahul Gajbhiye said infrastructure-wise they are prepared to treat patients and currently, they are focused on ensuring everyone in the cantonment board area are vaccinated. Medical officials of the hospital said currently, the cantonment hospital is operating as a non-covid hospital. If the cases start increasing, the hospital will be converted into a dedicated covid health centre (DCHC) as per the decision of the Nashik district administration. However, now that the hospital is equipped with an oxygen plant and over 60 of the 80 beds will have oxygen supply, the hospital is better placed to provide treatment to patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/o2-plant-installed-at-deolali-cantt-hosp/articleshow/88229463.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The so-called kings of the con call centre racket — Sagar Thakkar alias Shaggy and Nirav Raichura — are back and operating like never before, from the eastern parts of the city, say sources in the police. Acting against these players has been a herculean task for the police. They have to first zero in on their illegal business and then book them for duping thousands of foreign nationals, mainly from the US and Canada. Sources in the police said that these two kingpins seem idle, but have groomed entire gangs who have been getting leads (contact details) of foreign nationals and cheating them. "These aides have recently been operating from the eastern parts of the city, mainly out of industrial estates, from where they call foreign nationals and coerce, trick or bait them with the promise of money, and dupe after getting their account details," said a source. These new-age call centres have also left their old tricks of duping people by threatening them with registration of drug cases or luring them with easy loans. They now know that people can be cheated even by showing a bit of sympathy, posing as government representatives in times of Covid. "As they use the dark web and devices such as MagicJack for calling, they cannot be traced easily," said a police officer. Though they are being tracked using human intelligence, it will be difficult to establish cases against them as they do not leave adequate digital footprints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/old-con-call-centre-players-rise-in-east/articleshow/88231164.cms||---

TOI approached zonal officers of the south west zone to seek a clarification. Though the official concerned did not deny the incident, he said that the video was old and the line was dysfunctional. The video clearly shows the worker being asked to enter the manhole without any protective gear. A little later, when light is shone inside the manhole at least three people are seen in the drainage line. “The line shown here is dysfunctional and is being rehabilitated. There is no sewage,” said a senior AMC official. “Frankly, guidelines and laws have grey areas on the matter of protective gear being mandatory during drainage rehabilitation work when the line is dry.” Over the past five days, at least three such videos from various parts of Ahmedabad have gone viral. The AMC has already begun an inquiry into a series of incidents and is examining the circumstances under which contractors ask workers to enter manholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/another-video-emerges-of-worker-ordered-into-manhole-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88231153.cms||---

The suspect has been identified as Mahadev Pote. Pote has been accused of killing Haribhau Dhembre by hitting him on the head with an axe on December 8. Police revealed that about a decade ago, Pote had been accused of murdering Dhembre’s younger son. However, he was acquitted in that case four years back. The police swung into action after the family members of the deceased man refused to perform the last rites till the accused was arrested. Authorities said the victim and the accused have been at loggerheads over their respective stakes in a piece of land for over a decade. The ongoing friction took a violent turn and the elderly man was killed.  According to the victim’s son, Kailash, Dhembre was returning home from the farm when the accused waylaid him and asked him to transfer the farm to his name. When the elderly man refused, the accused, who was carrying an axe, hit Dhembre hard on the head. Dhembre died on the spot. His body was taken to the Ambajogai-based government rural hospital, where an autopsy was performed. A case of murder has been registered against the accused, who, after being produced before the court, was remanded for 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-accused-of-killing-80-yr-old-was-let-off-in-murder-case-of-victims-son/articleshow/88229498.cms||---

After a drama that lasted for a few hours, the minor finally revealed that unable to cope with the pressure of studies he had run away from his home. The boy, a Class XII student, was spotted by the SHE team of Vastrapur police station when he was roaming near Doordarshan tower, said PI S G Khambala. As the team tried to make the boy talk about his family details, they were in for a shock. The boy told the cops that he was kidnapped and left at Ahmedabad railway station by some unknown persons. The SHE team brought the boy to Vastrapur police station where he was made comfortable. As the boy repeated the kidnapping story, the cops felt something amiss. On further questioning the boy revealed that he had left his home. The youth said that his parents used to put too much pressure on him for studies. Not able to cope up with the pressure, he left his home.

Directions have already been sent to the higher education department from the CMO to set up an UOU campus in the state capital. Currently, it has only one proper campus which is located in Haldwani while all its administrative work in Dehradun is carried out inside the few rooms located in another state university. "The university needs a centre in Garhwal zone. We are unable to cater properly to the students of Garhwal zone which is 50% of our total students' strength," said an official from UOU . Notably, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has personally shown interest in this particular project and is keen to allot the land for Dehradun campus before the assembly election. The state higher education department has been asked to release the related government order (GO) in this regard. Also, the UOU students are supposed to visit Haldwani for administrative related works or for submission of their assignments. So, UOU having a campus in Dehradun will be a major relief for nearly half of the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-open-university-to-establish-campus-in-dehradun/articleshow/88230624.cms||Mohammad Anab

Of the eight accused, two or three always used to stand at the circle and extort money, the complaint added. Moreover, these people used to extort money for every trip from the outskirts of the city. On Friday morning taxi driver Asif Ganchi, a resident of Sarkhej, came to collect passengers when one Dhawal Patel asked him to pay Rs 200. The complainant stated that when Asif refused to pay the amount, Dhawal called up Sanjay Bharwad, Manish Patel and Nikhil Bharwad. The four abused Asif and forced the passengers to get down from the taxi. Later, Asif along with other drivers came to the complainant’s office. They asked Rasul to file a police complaint.

These patients, who were either asymptomatic or had mild disease, had tested negative for the Covid-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus at the hospital. Experts, however, cautioned against taking the Omicron variant lightly because the number of ‘Omicron suspects’ has been steadily increasing. While 40 more suspects are admitted in Seven Hills Hospital, Andheri, two more men were admitted to Bombay Hospital on Saturday, taking the number of suspects in the private hospital to four so far. Anticipating a further increase in the number of infected travellers from the high-risk or at-risk countries, the BMC has allowed Breach Candy Hospital to set up a separate Omicron ward. The state government’s Omicron update said seven Omicron patients had been discharged till Saturday morning, but BMC officials in Mumbai said that two more patients were discharged from Seven Hills Hospital by evening, taking the total to nine. The other discharged patients include four in Pimpri-Chinchwad and one each from Pune and Kalyan-Dombivli. “We don’t have more cases reported today as the genetic sequencing takes time,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate on Saturday. On Friday, the Omicron caseload had jumped from 10 to 17 with the discovery of three patients in Mumbai and four more in Pimpri-Chinchwad. Since December 1, samples of 133 travellers who tested positive for Covid-19 have been sent for genomic sequencing. Of these, 26 travellers were identified as Covid-19-positive right at the airport while 107 others were identified during field surveillance for travellers who had arrived from at-risk or high-risk countries between November 1 and 30. “Results of 51 samples are still awaited,” said Dr Awate. In Mumbai, Seven Hills Hospital dean Dr B Adsul said there are 40 Omicron suspects kept in isolation. “Of the five Omicron patients with us, three have been discharged while two are still with us,” he said. He said they will be tested once again on Monday when they complete 10 days of testing positive for the first time. Regarding the two new patients in Bombay Hospital, Dr Gautam Bhansali said: “They are both 32-year-old men who arrived from Australia and France earlier in the week. While one is asymptomatic, the other one has loss of smell but no other symptoms.” Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s Covid task force, said although Omicron remains mild so far, “many studies are needed in India to understand how effective our vaccines are”. He said people have to continue wearing a face mask and maintain physical distance. KEM Hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the Omicron variant has the potential to cause the third wave in the state and country. One of the latest studies from the UK, one of the three countries where community spread of Omicron has started apart from South Africa and Denmark, expects the Omicron wave to build up in January and continue till April. The study, conducted by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine experts who also advise the UK government, came up with a range of possible outcomes: the pessimistic scenario anticipates 34.2 million infections and 74,900 deaths between December 1 and April 1 while the optimistic one anticipates 20.9 million infections and 24,700 deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-9-of-17-omicron-patients-in-state-go-home-virus-free/articleshow/88231209.cms||---

Her parents had registered an FIR under sections of "abduction and unlawful conversion". She told cops on Saturday that she continues to feel threatened and persecuted by her family. The woman then requested police to record her statement in court and close the case against her husband as she had married the man as well as embraced Islam willingly.  Speaking to TOI, the woman said, “I married the man of my choice. My parents lodged a fake complaint that I was kidnapped and forced to marry, which is incorrect. I got married on February 22 in Bareilly and I'm happy with my husband and want to spend the rest of my life with him." She added, "We filed a petition in the Allahabad high court for relief and I got protection (from arrest of her husband and his family members) on September 21. But my husband’s family members are still being harassed by police and my family. I am pregnant. My husband and in-laws receive threats from my father and brother regularly and we want police protection. This is why I came here and met the SSP." Additional SP (rural) Rajkumar Agarwal said, “The woman’s family had alleged that their daughter was sedated, kidnapped, married and converted to Islam. An FIR was registered under sections 363 (abduction) and 366 (abducting a woman to compel her marriage) of IPC and the anti-conversion law at Bhuta police station. Police had to take action as per law and only those who were made accused in the complaint were questioned." The ASP added, "Once the matter was raised before HC, police had followed its directive. The woman never came forward until today and now we have recorded her statement and forwarded an application in court to record her statement under 164 CrPC. We'll take further steps as per the court's order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-in-interfaith-marriage-comes-out-of-hiding-after-10-mths-seeks-police-protection/articleshow/88229512.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The complainant stated that she got married in 2020 and shifted to her in-laws house on Sindhu Bhavan Road. She stated that she was happy for about six months, but after that the family began to abuse and torment her over trivial household chores.

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC plans jabs at night in some areas, shots in office||MUMBAI: In a bid to make vaccines more accessible, the BMC plans to start night vaccination drives in select areas within the next few days. There also is a plan to kick off a ‘My office, a safe space’ campaign to target workplaces to encourage 100% vaccination among their staff. BMC officials believe such drives will help increase the second vaccination rate. At present, 105% of the city’s 92.3 lakh adult population have taken the first vaccine while only 79% are fully vaccinated. On Saturday, 83,657 people took the Covid vaccine across the city. “During the pulse polio drive, our healthcare workers would walk with vaccines until late in the evening to vaccinate children who could not go to the centres on Pulse Polio Sunday. We are trying a similar method to push the Covid vaccination numbers,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. The idea is to reach out to those people, especially the floating population, who are unable to take a break from their work to get themselves vaccinated, she added. At present, most Covid-19 vaccination centres operate between 9 am and 5 pm, but BMC officials are working out ways to stretch this drive up to 10 pm. “A decision has been taken to start the night vaccination drive, but it will take a few days to fine tune the plan and start,” said Dr Gomare. A couple of months ago when the daily vaccination numbers started dropping during the Navratri and Diwali festivals, the BMC started mobile vaccination centres that operate near residential areas. Vaccination picked up in the past 10 days, ever since the news of the Omicron variant emerged from South Africa. The BMC health department has also written to healthcare establishments to fully vaccinate their healthcare workers. “We have also written to non-healthcare establishments to ensure that their staff are vaccinated,” said Dr Gomare. This is being done as a part of the new campaign called ‘My Office, a safe space’ on the lines of the ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign last year. The BMC will also start an awareness drive in which mobile vans fitted with mikes will give vaccine-related information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-plans-jabs-at-night-in-some-areas-shots-in-office/articleshow/88231213.cms||Malathy Iyer

Dealing with 114 complaints, Chankankar managed to resolve two at the redressal camp, instructed officials to register offences in eight, and put the wheels in motion to resolve the other issues.Out of the 114 complaints, some 50 complaints were from the district’s four women grievances redressal cells at Gadchiroli, Desaiganj, Aheri and Chamorshi, while the rest were related to various benefits from government schemes for Covid widows.Chakankar, whose visit was part of the programme ‘Rajya Mahila Aayog Aplya Dari’ or state women’s commission at your door step, also reviewed the applications filed under ‘Manodhairya schemes’ meant for monetary assistance to rape survivors and victims of other sexual violence. She also urged concerned authorities to expediting work on applications. The commission chairperson also urged officials to include maximum Covid widows under ‘Mission Vatsalya’ and extend support to them.Chakankar said the objective behind her visit to the state’s remotest district was reaching out to the local population, going beyond the limits of her Mumbai office and urban people. “With all the higher officials from various government agencies, like executive and judiciary, on one platform, the commission attempted to address the delayed grievances. Justice delayed is justice denied. We tried to zero down on various cases and tried to identify hurdles blocking their progress,” said Chakankar. She added that rising cases of domestic violence, child marriage and such social evils were a cause of concern for the society, and she aimed to extend a feeling of security and self-assurance among women.Chakankar said she visited Gadchiroli with her entire team from Mumbai to ensure cases are being adequately followed up and monitored from her office. “We will ensure cases registered with us are taken to their logical conclusion,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/womens-panel-chief-gets-confidential-plaints-in-gadchiroli/articleshow/88229522.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Mumbai||Over 50 per cent of adult population in Maharashtra fully vaccinated now||MUMBAI: On Saturday, when 7.55 lakh people took the vaccine against Covid-19, it resulted in more than 50 per cent of the state’s adult population of 9.14 crore getting fully vaccinated against the coronavirus infection. Almost 85 per cent of the state population has taken at least one shot so far. In the state capital of Mumbai, the corresponding percentages are higher: 79 per cent of the city’s 92.3 lakh adult population are fully vaccinated. Over 105 per cent have taken the first vaccine in Mumbai, but health officials said the reason is people from neighbouring municipal areas taking their shot here. On Saturday, state additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said that “more than 50 per cent of the estimated adult population of Maharashtra is fully vaccinated against Covid”. In terms of absolute numbers words, 4.59 crore adult individuals have achieved full vaccinated in the state. Maharashtra achieved the 100 million mark on November 9 and crossed 110 million on November 25. On December 7, the state reached the 120-million mark. Although the Covid-19 vaccination numbers have been going up steadily since the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, health officials are worried about the slow pace of the second vaccine and are drawing up strategies to improve this number. Uttar Pradesh has more double-vaccinated people at 5.78 crore, but that is only 38 per cent of the state’s population.

---||Nagpur||Mahendri Conservation Reserve Or Wildlife Sanctuary?||The focus is on 68 sq kms of blemishless forest in Warud of Amravati district. There are two groups arguing for and against. Widlife experts say conserving the area is important as it is a link to other sanctuaries in Maharashtra and Madhya PradeshMahendri Conservation Reserve or Mahendri Wildlife Sanctuary? While the first nomenclature came on record on September 13, there is support as well as opposition to the second. The ayesayers have the backing of environmentalists who emphasise that the 68 sq km of pristine forest in Warud forest range of Amravati district will be a big boost for tiger conservation and create a protected dispersal corridor. The naysayers say those who are likely to be displaced are only interested in the lucrative relocation package and the price their farmland will fetch.Mahendri used to be a hunting block during the British Raj. The reserve forest still has rich flora and fauna. Fed up with the permanent nocturnal vigil in farms to ward off animal attack which destroys their crop and the impending threat from the free-moving tigers, people of 10 villages realise that a mere conservancy reserve is not a solution to their problems. They are keen to be relocated and start farming afresh in land that is more conducive than the current which they claim is not generating much yield. A Mahendri Sanctuary Supporters’ Action Committee has been formed to demand the sanctuary status. Usually villagers oppose relocation and this may perhaps be the first case where locals have been protesting for the cause of tigers.The rival group Mahendri Abhayranya Virodhi Kruti Samiti, mostly consisting of Gond tribals from the same villages, has been formed under Kamalnarayan Uike who say that the other group is hardy interested in conservation and is eyeing the Rs 15 lakh per family relocation package.Hirakant Uike, sarpanch of Zhatamjhari and five villages under it, said, “The supporting group leader Vijay Shrirao himself owns farmland adjoining Mahendri forest. Others too want their farmland to be given four times the ready reckoner rate and relocate the 11-odd villages by first including them in the sanctuary proposal and then relocating them by offering a Rs 15 lakh package. However, 80% of the tribals, who too face crop damage, are opposed to the sanctuary.” “Many who are supporting the sanctuary are not in majority and have come from MP and settled here. They want sanctuary status for economic gains and have nothing to do with conservation. We are living here for generations and most of the village gram panchayats have tribal members. We are convincing people through meetings against the sanctuary,” said Uike. Pusla’s Vijay Shrirao, head of the support committee, says, “Initially, we did not know the difference between a conservation reserve and a sanctuary. Some vested interests played politics and were successful. The problems like crop depredation and threat by wild animals will not be solved with a conservation reserve. We want the forest department to expand the proposal by including an area of 10-11 odd villages and their farmland.”“The problem of crop damage is so grave that if we don’t do ‘jagli’ in our farm even for one night, the entire crop is destroyed by wild animals. We are marginal landholders and grow crops to fulfil our food needs all round the year,” said Pandurang Iwnate of Mahendri.According to Amravati deputy conservator Chandrashekhar Bala, from April to November, 13 cattle kills and 111 cases of crop depredation have been reported in Warud range. “Rs 8.63 lakh compensation was paid,” he said.“As Mahendri is connected to forests towards Betul in MP, there is regular movement of big carnivores. A few days ago, I sighted a tiger at 8 pm near Pandhri lake when I was returning from work from Warud,” recalls Krishna Kawdeti, a civil worker.Shrirao says, “It’s a win-win situation for wildlife and people and hence there is demand to include the vulnerable villages of Jamthi, Ekalvihir, Linga, Karwar, Lohdra, Pandhri, Mahendri, Jamgaon, Piplagarh, Karli, Khaperkheda, Urad and Pedoli villages on the fringes of the reserve in the sanctuary proposal.”However, Shrirao says, “Only 10% people are opposing sanctuary. Villagers have learned that they won’t get the benefit of Rs 15 lakh per family relocation package unless Mahendri status is upgraded and their villages included. Apart from the package, the PAPs get 4 times the cost of farmland as per ready reckoner rate.”“We are ready to move out voluntarily with a golden handshake. We know that relocation is a long-drawn process and would take time, but first at least include these villages in the revised proposal and relocate them as per fund availability,” says Zummak Bhade, Jamthi, where he claims there is the presence of tigress with cubs and people are living in scare.Kishor Rithe, state wildlife board (SWBL) member, feels Mahendri is a vital link between Melghat and Bor tiger reserves and also towards the Satpuda mountain ranges. “Mahendri will be a stepping stone in long-term tiger conservation in Central India as it helps in maintaining the genetic continuity of critical tiger habitats (CTHs),” he said.The sanctuary proposal was first mooted by Rithe’s Amravati-based Nature Conservation Society in 1994-95. Since then it was discussed several times at SWBL meetings but for the first time the issue got political support as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has kept the option open to declaring Mahendri a sanctuary.The real momentum to notify Mahendri started after Thackeray on August 7, while chairing the 15th SBWL meeting, gave the in-principle approval. However, due to infighting between forest officials, the proposal was finally was confined to a conservation reserve.Over 100-125km from Nagpur via Pandhurna and Warud, the lush green Mahendri with dense forest and tall trees on both sides of SH10 in Warud range resembles the NH7 sight passing through Pench. The 68sqkm reserve is divided into two contiguous blocks – Linga-Wai and Shekhdari.“There is huge biotic pressure on Mahendri. It is virtually free for all now and hence sanctuary status is the only solution. Those opposing know once it becomes a sanctuary grazing and illicit felling will stop. Even if we get the package, we will continue to remain farmers by procuring alternative farmland elsewhere,” says Dadarao Salame, a farmer.Salame said, “Orange-dominated Warud is known as ‘California of India’. Sanctuary status to Mahendri doesn’t only mean protecting wildlife and tigers but also increasing the water table of the region. Already the water table of the tehsil has gone down to 1,000-1,200 feet. Upgrading the forest status would mean conserving the eight water bodies whose catchment area lies in Mahendri.”“Apart from tigers, Mahendri has a good diversity of mammals. This is evident from a camera trapping exercise conducted in 2015 & 2017 by NGO Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT), Mumbai. It revealed good diversity of mammals like tiger, leopard, sloth bear, wolf, jackal, hyena, chinkara, sambar, and many more. On October 10, for the first time a long-billed vulture was recorded by bird watcher Prashant Nikam,” says ex-honorary warden Vishal Bansod, Amravati.Amravati CCF Jayoti Banerjee says, “Mahendri has a huge potential and we have an open mind on it, but including so many villages in the sanctuary and relocating them is a daunting task. Already existing relocation process has slowed down due to insufficient funds. Secondly, at present priority is to relocate villages in tiger reserves.”Current MLA from Morshi Devendra Bhuyar says he is okay for a sanctuary status “only if the state makes a one-time provision for funds to relocate these villages”. “I’ve made my stand clear with the government,” he said. Earlier, Wardha MP Ramdas Tadas too had given his consent for the sanctuary. Amravati honorary warden Sawan Deshmukh says, “Relocation will take time but locals can widely benefit from direct and indirect employment through ecotourism. The forest has a presence of 3-4 tigers, leopards, hyenas, wolves, wild dogs, over 200 species of birds, and 60 species of butterflies. With some wildlife and habitat management inputs, tourism can start immediately. With water bodies like Shekhdari, there is scope for water tourism too.”Why A Sanctuary* Mahendri links cluster of PAs together with Melghat-Bor tiger reserves. This continuity further goes up to Satpuda Tiger Reserve, Hoshangabad, Pench and Kanha* Its role in long-term tiger conservation in Central India will help maintain genetic continuity* Apart from carnivores, it supports species like chital, sambar, blue bull, barking deer, chinkara, hyena, wolf, jackal, and a variety of birds. * Can bring direct and indirect employment through eco-tourism* Locals can benefit from Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan Van SchemeConservation Reserve Disadvantage* No strict enforcement against tree felling, illegal grazing etc* No regular fund allocation from state and Centre* Category was added to Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 later and such areas cannot be declared as critical tiger habitats as per Section 38V of WPAHow To Reach* Nagpur-Saoner-Pandhurna | 100km* Nagpur-Katol-Warud | 125km* Amravati-Morshi-Warud | 120km* Nagpur-Katol-Jalakheda-Mowad-Pusla | 105km||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahendri-conservation-reserve-or-wildlife-sanctuary/articleshow/88229538.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Caught after 37 years, man is acquitted in murder case||MUMBAI: Over 37 years after he was accused of murder, a now 60-year-old Cuffe Parade labourer has been acquitted for lack of evidence. A sessions court acquitted Prakash Ratan on Friday. He was arrested earlier this year after he was absconding for decades. “The entire evidence adduced against him, even if accepted as it is, it still has nothing incriminating the accused. This being so, the accused cannot be held guilty for the offence he is charged with,” the court said. The prosecution’s case is that on September 29, 1984, a cop on patrolling duty in Trombay saw an injured man and boy lying on the road. The boy, Ankush Dhone, said that six men had assaulted him and the man, Akhtar Kazi. The duo were rushed to hospital, but Kazi was declared brought dead. It was alleged that Ratan was also among the accused. Over the years, one accused was discharged, another died and three were acquitted. During the trial, only a cop deposed. “It is to be stated that despite many chances, the prosecution could not secure the presence of injured Ankush. Even during the earlier trials he was not examined, being not traceable. The evidence of most crucial witness is thus not available,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-caught-after-37-yrs-man-is-acquitted-in-murder-case/articleshow/88231239.cms||---

The woman registered a complaint under the Dowry Prohibition Act against her husband and her in-laws. In her complaint, the woman stated that though she got married to a Jivraj Park resident in 2013 she is presently staying with her parents due to differences with her husband. The love marriage went smoothly for the initial period but soon the in-law’s started torturing her over petty issues, the woman claimed. Complaints to her husband proved futile as he always sided with his parents. The complaint also stated the woman suspects that her husband was having an extra-marital affair. Despite the harassment, the woman continued to live with her in-laws. But when her husband moved out of the house around two months ago, she too shifted to her parent’s place in Ranip. She left behind her two children at her in-law’s house. The woman claimed that later her husband came to her parents’ house and assaulted her after which she had filed a complaint with Ranip police. As Saturday was her son’s fourth birthday, she visited her in-law’s house with cake and gifts for him. However, her husband did not allow her to meet her son and even abused and assaulted her. She said that her husband threatened her of dire consequences following which she lodged a complaint against her husband and her in-laws at the Vejalpur police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/24-yr-old-from-vejalpur-files-complaint-against-husband-in-laws/articleshow/88230645.cms||---

---||Vadodara||Vadodara: Refund investors’ money lost in postal scam, says court||VADODARA: If a government approved agent cheats investors, then the government agency is liable to refund the money invested to the customers. This was an order issued by the district consumer forum asking the postal department in Vadodara to return a complainant the money he had invested along with interest. Complainant Rajnikant Shah and his wife Vinoda had approached the consumer forum in 2011 after the postal department rejected their claim for refund of the money they had invested in postal schemes. The senior citizens had invested Rs 4 lakh in the monthly income scheme of the postal department a decade-and-half ago. However, some agents that the department had approved committed fraud worth crores of rupees and siphoned off the investors’ money from the postal schemes in 2010. The CBI had conducted investigations into the scam amounting to over Rs 2 crore and also arrested two agents. The agents had fraudulently withdrawn money from the postal scheme accounts by closing them down. But credits of the amounts were shown in these accounts on the computer with the help of some postal department employees. The Shahs were also among the duped victims and they approached the postal department to get their money back. However, they were told that they lost their money because of their own negligence. “The postal department argued that the complainants showed blind faith in the agents and gave them their passbook. This helped the accused in forging signatures of the complainants and withdrawing all the money outside their knowledge. So, the postal department said that it is not their responsibility,” said Montu Pandya of Vadodara Grahak Suraksha Mandal, a co-complainant in the case. “But we argued that the agents, who committed the fraud, were approved by the government. Also, before releasing the money, the postal officials have to verify the signatures of the investors. But in this case, they didn’t verify the signatures that were forged by the accused. So the postal department is responsible to return the invested money,” Pandya added. The consumer forum has directed the postal department to return the invested money with eight per cent interest. The forum has also ordered the insurance firm of the postal department to give Rs 5,000 towards mental agony and Rs 5,000 towards litigation expenses to the complainant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/govt-agency-liable-to-pay-if-its-agent-cheats/articleshow/88230127.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Ahmedabad||PM Modi fearlessly reviving Hindu temples: Amit Shah||AHMEDABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday said that for many years the centres of faith for Hindus were lying in a state of humiliation and nobody restored its glory until 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government came to power. There was a time when people were ashamed to go to temples but all this has changed under the new leadership of PM Modi, Shah said adding that the Modi government is working fearlessly to renovate and restore such ‘forgotten’ centres with complete devotion and respect. He was speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of Umiyadham temple at the Sola Umiya campus on Sarkhej-Gandhinagar highway in Ahmedabad. PM Modi will attend the three-day foundation stone-laying ceremony for the temple project virtually on December 13. “Today, as the foundation stone laying ceremony of a grand temple is being performed by Arya samaji (Governor of Gujarat) Acharya Devvrat, I would like to say that Modiji has worked fearlessly and with faith and respect for the renovation of our forgotten centres of faith,” Shah said.  The temple is dedicated to Maa Umiya, the reigning deity of the Kadva Patidar sect. It is being built for a project cost of Rs 1,500 crore, said Shah. “We have seen a time when people felt ashamed to visit temples. But a new era was ushered in from the time PM Modi, having won 2014 elections with full majority, performed Ganga aarti after applying sacred ash on his forehead at Kashi Vishwanath temple,” he said.  Shah said the Kashi Vishwanath temple at Varanasi that was demolished during the time of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb has undergone renovation and restoration process that will be unveiled by PM Modi on December 13. In his 15-minute speech, he also mentioned how the PM unveiled the statue of Adi Shankaracharya and revived the faith of crores of Hindus at Kedarnath temple after the region was devastated by flash floods in 2013. Shah also spoke about the Rs 3,000 crore Vindhyachal Corridor Project (VCP) in Mirzapur where he performed the foundation stone-laying ceremony in August this year.  He said temples have not just been religious centres, but they are also centres of social service and sources of energy that revives hope in people who are disappointed with life and facing difficulty in moving ahead. He praised the Patidars and said the history of development and progress in Gujarat and India goes hand in hand with the community. He also said that other organisations should learn from the Umiya Mata temple trust, which has set up a social and scientific system, where contributions from donors from the community are used to construct temples and ensure that nobody remains deprived. Apart from the Umiyadham temple, the Umiya Mata Temple trust, which runs the main temple in Unjha, will also build a complex adjacent to the temple to provide training as well as hostel facility to Patidar youths preparing for civil services entrance tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pm-fearlessly-reviving-hindu-temples/articleshow/88230670.cms||---

While the airport boasts of a massive car parking space, on any given day, zones A and B stand filled up with the entrance to these parking areas barricaded and sporting a ‘parking is full’ sign. Even to find an empty slot in zones C and D — much behind the first two zones — is often tough, say locals. In fact, in a bid to avoid the hassle of finding a car parking spot — at times even to avoid paying the hefty fee — scores of vehicles can be seen parked along the road leading to the arrival ramp, with their hazard lights on. They get inside only once the guests exit the airport and are ready to be picked up. Speaking to TOI, Ravi Rathore, a resident of Madhapur, rued how on several occasions he had to circle around the airport for more than 10 minutes to find a parking spot. “That is why if there is a family member who needs to be picked up during peak hours, I try to reach much earlier just to ensure parking space,” he said. Karthik S, who drove to RGIA to pick up his son on Friday, also had a similar experience. “For atleast 20 minutes I went around looking for parking. It was frustrating. Also, I saw many cars that looked like they have been parked there for days. Maybe people going on short trips are leaving them there. That’s also adding to the crisis,” he said. Raju (name changed), a ground staff with a private airline, said that employees too are faced with a similar crunch. Though they are allotted a separate parking zone, even that is overcrowded. “Instead of making people drive around looking for space and charging them an exorbitant fee, there should be a system wherein the machines stop issuing tickets after a point so that people know there is no space in the parking area,” said Bandla Krishnamurthy, a TCS employee, who was seen looking for a spot at 6 pm on Saturday. He had come to see his friend off. Private security sources say the issue is rooted in the disparity between the number of vehicles vacating the parking space and those driving in. However, GMR officials say the ‘parking full’ barricades are immediately removed even if one vehicle leaves the premises to ensure that full parking space is utilised. “Parking is not at all an issue. Space is provided for different vehicles. It is quite rare for such situations to arise,” a GMR official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/motorists-battle-parking-woes-at-rgia/articleshow/88230674.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Sounding triumphant, MIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel from Aurangabad announced to the rally at Chandivali on Saturday: “Mumbai, lo main aa gaya (Mumbai, I have come).” Led by Jaleel, the morcha members left Aurangabad in the morning and despite attempts by the police to stop them at several places, they reached the rally ground at Chandivali near Sakinaka. Reacting to the MIM rally, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, said: “In order to maintain law and order and control the spread of Omicron, the Mumbai police have issued Section 144 in the city today. No morchas, rallies or large gatherings are allowed. We appeal to everyone to not violate the law... I am willing to talk to Jaleel if required. We can understand their sentiments but a rally at this time is not appropriate.” MIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi attacked the Uddhav Thackeray-led government for stopping the “tiranga rally”. He asked if Section 144 would be imposed when former Congress president Rahul Gandhi visits Mumbai. Owaisi also claimed some comparative figures about Muslims and Marathas. Justifying Muslim reservation, he said there were only 4% Muslims graduates in Maharashtra while only 22% children from the community take admission in primary schools. Quoting data, he claimed 83% Muslims are landless against 8% landless Marathas in the state. He claimed there were 14.5% Maratha IAS officers against zero per cent Muslim IAS officers in the state. Attacking the state government, Jaleel said, “Some people didn’t want us to reach here. We were allowed to come when we threatened that our people from across Maharashtra would catch trains and storm Mumbai. The officer spoke to someone at the top and we were allowed,” Jaleel said. He reiterated the demand to return 93,000 acres of Wakf land to the Wakf board. Without naming former minister Arif Naseem Khan who had represented Chandivali area in the assembly, Jaleel said, “He (Naseem Khan) lost because of MIM and still he asks who is Owaisi.” Jaleel also ran video clips of many political leaders backing the demand for Muslim reservation. Former MLA Waris Pathan said this was just a trailer but MIM activists would fill big maidans. MIM city president Faiyaz Khan claimed MIM had become stronger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mim-morcha-in-city-despite-section-144-over-omicron/articleshow/88231256.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Ahmedabad||7,000 engineering goods makers to hold daylong shutdown in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: Some 7,000 engineering goods manufacturers across Ahmedabad will keep their factories shut on December 20. The Ahmedabad Engineering Goods Manufacturers’ Association (AEGMA) has extended support to the nationwide call for shutdown of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) by the AICA (All India Council of Association of MSMEs), to protest the unprecedented increase in raw material costs. Manufacturers have alleged that production is getting adversely impacted due to a steep surge in prices of pig iron, iron ore, steel and other metals. Even foundries have extended support to the closure. Ahmedabad is home to some 7,000 units that manufacture engineering goods in addition to some 1,500 foundries. Extending support to the nationwide strike, AEGMA president Ashok Patel said, “Raw material prices have nearly doubled over the past six months. These include prices of pig iron, iron ore, steel and even coal which is widely used by engineering goods manufacturers. This has pushed up our cost of production by at least 40%.” “Earlier, we used to get raw materials on credit for 45 days. However, now we are compelled to make immediate payments if we must procure raw materials and also pay higher price. This is causing industry’s working capital to dramatically shrink, further affecting production,” said Patel. Even foundries are reeling under similar difficulties as manufacturing cost of metal castings has dramatically increased. “Most foundry units are MSMEs and do not have deeper pockets and therefore, don’t have adequate working capital to procure raw materials at a higher cost. Moreover, with freight costs going through the roof and payment cycles getting stretched, the realisation on fulfilled orders is slow. Consequently, foundries too are operating at 50% or even lesser capacity utilisation,” said Subodh Panchal, former president of Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF). Industry associations have sought for credit availability for the industries to sustain increased input costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/7k-engineering-goods-makers-to-hold-daylong-shutdown/articleshow/88230680.cms||---

Currently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is working on two sets of CBDCs – one wholesale account-based and the other retail-based. “While crypto currency would be an asset class… I think CBDC is eventually going to transform how cross-border transactions take place…my reading is that it is only a matter of time , there is no way countries across the world can stay away from CBDC,” Setty said while addressing participants at the ISB Leadership Summit 2021 on the ‘Future of banking’ here on Saturday. He pointed out that the introduction of CBDC is expected to throw up many questions such as -- what happens to the intermediation role of the bank and also how it will impact the monetary as well as fiscal policies of the country. In July 2021, RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar had stated that introduction of CBDC has the potential to provide significant benefits, such as reduced dependency on cash, higher seigniorage (difference between the value of currency and the cost of producing it) due to lower transaction costs, reduced settlement risk. In fact, central banks across the globe are engaged in exploring CBDCs and a few countries have also introduced proofs of concept as well as pilots on CBDC. Meanwhile speaking on the future of banking, the SBI senior official also stated that the banking sector has to focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) norms and will even have to remodel their lending policies by focussing on lending to green businesses, electric vehicles, waste management players, renewable energy players, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbdc-will-play-a-key-role-in-cross-border-transactions-sbi-md/articleshow/88230682.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ayushman Bharat not viable for private healthcare players||Hyderabad: The country’s universal health insurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat, is not going to take off because the tariffs are not sustainable and private healthcare players are losing money on it, said some of the top honchos of private healthcare players on Saturday. Ayushman Bharat, a flagship scheme, was launched by the Centre, as recommended by the National Health Policy 2017, to achieve the vision of universal health coverage (UHC). As part of Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), an eligible family is provided Rs 5 lakh per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation across public and private empanelled hospitals in India. Stating that despite political pressure private healthcare players are shying away from being a part of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, K Hari Prasad, president, Apollo Hospitals, said, “…many private hospitals have not become a part of it because they cannot be losing money for treating a patient. Not making money for treating patients is fair enough but when it comes to losing money… it means the money is coming from another patient who has to be charged more to subsidize another patient and I think this is a non-sustainable model.” Participating in a panel discussion on, ‘Healthcare - Making quality healthcare accessible to everyone,’ at the ISB Leadership Summit 2021, Prasad said that though a universal insurance scheme is the need of the hour, the government has been unable to bring all the stakeholders onto the same platform and therefore this scheme is bound to fail. Even Riyaz Khan, CEO, Continental Hospital, said, “As a private healthcare player, I feel that Ayushman Bharat is not a viable model because the tariffs are very low…” He however, added that the intent of the programme is good as a large number of families are getting covered. While stating that many needy people do get the benefit of such schemes, Manjula Anagani, clinical director & HoD, women & child care, Care Hospitals, stated that there are cases where patients try to go for procedures that may not be required for them just because they are covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ayushman-bharat-not-viable-for-private-healthcare-players/articleshow/88230679.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Anti-vaxxers who gave in are now scrambling to ‘undo’ their jab||MUMBAI: At 44, Vishal Hiwale, bravely states that he neither believes in Covid-19 nor the anti-Covid vaccines. Even as two waves of the coronavirus swept through the country, Hiwale held his ground and refused to wear a mask or get inoculated. Fast forward to November, he stands one jab down, one more to go. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Marian Mashraki, whose parents raised her to believe that the best medicine is all natural, after months of deliberation made peace with the needle and is currently jabbed with two doses of the vaccine. In a surprising twist in the pandemic tale, some anti-vaxxers like Hiwale and Mashraki are either getting vaccinated or are planning to. Not because of a change of heart but begrudgingly given the social pressure, stricter curbs and workplace mandates that warn of severe action against the unvaccinated. “I got caught for ticketless train travel. Neither me nor my wife were getting train passes or entry into malls for being unvaccinated. We have children and it was getting difficult to take them to school or go shopping… Also, I heard that the state may bar the unvaccinated from availing government schemes,” rues Hiwale, describing what drove him to the vaccine camp. For a newly graduated Mashraki, taking the jab was about getting herself out of a sticky wicket. “When you’re brazen about not vaccinating, your peer group ostracies you. Also, access to malls, restaurants, movies and trains are a huge issue. I can’t boycott these activities. My life got really restricted,” says the Vashi resident, for whom the stakes of trading foreign university prospects with her anti-vaccine stance were also high. “My parents still don’t want it but my brother, who recently got into engineering college, will soon get vaccinated.” But even as many vaccine deniers yield to the Covid shot, anti-vaxxers are a hardened bunch who continue to cling to their fixed ideologies. “I don’t believe in Covid-19. It’s an international conspiracy to create fear and vaccines are a way of genetically modifying humans,” insists Hiwale while Sudhir Madan, 41 continues to spout anti-vax sentiments ranging from “mRNA vaccines contain aborted babies” to “Covid is a way to profit pharmaceuticals” even as he gears up for his jab out of fear of losing the job that he recently found after a year of being without one. Carl Pereira, 28 and his family in Mulund have been taking turns to get vaccinated even though they don’t fear the virus, they say. “My mother’s a school teacher so vaccine was compulsory. For me, planning international travel became a headache,” says Pereira. Ashwini Tamde, a 37-year-old government employee has been holding out on vaccination until her salary was under threat. “See, I don’t trust the authenticity of these vaccines but I’m left with no option.” Consequently, the Covid world that was divided into pro-vax and anti-vaxxers is now seeing a third category of vaccine sceptics who caved but are now scrambling to ‘de-vaccinate’ or ‘undo’ their shots with alternative remedies that they claim would “cleanse” their body of the alleged “metals and toxins”. Madan, who managed to dodge BMC marshals and ticket checkers during his maskless-ticketless travels, has found a way to deal with his post-vaccine anxiety. “I put my wife on a vegan diet but I plan to use detox foot pads on my body to absorb chemicals from the blood through the skin.” Refusing to let go of her “natural resistance” Mashraki put herself on a self-administered diet after the jab. “It didn’t feel good,” she says after being fully vaxxed. “As a family we’ve never been pro-medication. So, I ate raw food instead of cooked food for a few days to clean my blood.”nMadan and Mashraki aren’t alone in their attempts at trying to “purify their body of vax content”. Some practitioners of alternative medicine such as Madan Dubey of the Azadi Bachao Andolan also recommend arguable detox regimens including “once-a-week enema” and “blood thinners” for anxious anti-vaxxers-turned-vaxxed. “They did it out of coercion and now want a fix. Only if they promise not to take further shots, we prescribe ways to neutralise the effect of the vaccine,” he says. Bioethics expert and one of the founders of Forum for Medical Ethics Society Dr Amar Jesani says, “One’s need to do shuddhikaran or purify their body is more of a cultural and psychological concept than a medical one.” While these so-called cures — eating raw food or colon-cleansing enema — he believes, draw from naturopathy that are harmless “unless one overdoes it”, they certainly “won’t make the vaccine disappear from the body” he says while calling on the Drugs Controller and government to play their part, “if alternative remedies without scientific base are being peddled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/anti-vaxxers-who-gave-in-are-now-scrambling-to-undo-their-jab/articleshow/88231259.cms||Mohua Das

Khan who shot a strongly worded letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday, expressing his willingness to step aside as the chancellor of state universities, told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday that he was forced to write the letter as he had run out of options to ensure autonomy and integrity of universities. He said he tried to best to avoid a confrontation with the government, but the latter refuses to get along. When it comes to the matter of selection of candidates to the post of university vice-chancellors, the government tries to tie the governor’s hands in order to push political agenda, he said. “The chief minister has nothing to do with universities. While the school education in the state if fine, higher education has gone to the dogs. Even appointments are made against the rules,” Khan said. The governor, who is also the chancellor of state universities, said he did really mean it when he advised the chief minister to bring in an ordinance to assume the role of chancellor by himself. “Chancellor is not a constitutional post. That’s why I asked Vijayan to bring an ordinance wherein CM can take over as the chancellor,” the governor said. Khan said he felt a lingering pain when the government decided to reappoint the incumbent vice-chancellor of Kannur University, despite the chancellor raising pertinent questions regarding the appropriateness of such a decision. “It was after signing the order that I decided to write to the CM, asking him to take over as the chancellor,” Khan told reporters. The governor said he was deeply saddened because the government refused to correct its course despite repeated requests. “Governor was made chancellor of the universities with an objective to ensure transparency,” he said. Khan added that students were forced to leave Kerala for quality higher education. The governor explained that the government tried to tie up his hands by giving the name of only one candidate of government’s choice for appointment to the post of vice-chancellor in Sanskrit University, Kalady. “If there were more than one name, I could have selected the person best suited for the job,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/guv-firm-accuses-govt-of-pushing-political-agenda/articleshow/88232963.cms||---

But MS University’s famed Faculty of Fine Arts gave an artistic farewell to a generation of teachers who retired from the faculty in 2020-21. The faculty on Saturday inaugurated an exhibition titled ‘Farewell Party’ displaying works of NG Vijay Bagodi, Vasudevan Akkitham and Jayanti Rabadiya. The three belong to what many refer to as ‘third generation’ of artist-teachers of the faculty. All of them were trained under the second generation artist-teachers — Gulammohammed Sheikh, Jyoti Bhatt, Nasreen Mohammedi, Jeram Patel, P D Dhumal and Ratan Parimoo among others. “The shadow of the towering first generation Baroda artist-pedagogue K G Subramanyan had touched them all one way or the other,” said Dr Jayaram Poduval, officiating dean of the faculty. The trio had joined the faculty in early 90s. While Vasudevan headed the painting department, Bagodi led the graphics section while Rabadiya took charge of the mural section. “Their contribution in shaping and steering the faculty in rather challenging times cannot be overstated. They continued their own studio practises and grew in stature as artists over the years,” Poduval said. “We felt that there is no better way to pay tribute to their teaching careers, during which they trained and nurtured many young artists, than by celebrating their own creations,” said Poduval. Around 30 art works of the trio are on display at the faculty's exhibition hall till December 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/unique-farewell-for-fine-arts-teachers/articleshow/88230171.cms||---

To begin with, the minister inaugurated the CIMS-Hebatpur crossroad railway overbridge, which is the 23rd railway overbridge in the city. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation officials said that Shah inaugurated projects worth Rs 113.9 crore which included two swimming pools-cum-gymnasiums in Gota and Thaltej, a water distribution station to solve the long-standing issue of water pressure in Thaltej and an underpass at Vastrapur crossing.

---||Delhi||Meter reading: Delhi Jal Board acts against 30 staff||NEW DELHI: Delhi Jal Board has suspended 10 of its employees and sacked 20 outsourced employees due to erroneous water meter readings. Earlier, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal directed the officials concerned to ensure full transparency in the billing system. DJB has ordered FIR on all those involved in the irregularity. The outsourcing agency has been issued showcause notice and asked by the Delhi government to explain why it shouldn’t be blacklisted. Kejriwal has also directed DJB chairman Satyendar Jain to ensure full accountability and tighten vigilance. As per the CM’s vision, DJB is completely committed towards working for the public interest, Jain said. “It has come to our notice that some meter readers engaged through an outsourced agency have been found taking wrong readings of several consumers of DJB. The director (revenue) is hereby directed to terminate the services of all such meter readers involved in such illegal activities,” a government order stated. Earlier, the government received a complaint in which it was claimed that meter readers were taking wrong readings due to which the water bills of the consumers were arbitrarily inflated. As soon as the information was received, an audit was launched to identify the culprits. After that, DJB caught 10 meter readers employed with them taking wrong meter readings and suspended them with immediate effect. 20 outsourced employees were also found to be engaged in the same and their services were terminated immediately. Recently, in view of complaints of wrong meter readings, the Kejriwal government has taken a decision that the water bill of the customers cannot exceed 1.5 times the previous month. If it exceeds this, they will be given an explanation from DJB and the customer will be able to file a complaint on the same lines. Apart from this, ‘Meter Reading Image Audit’ will be done daily in the system by the revenue officers on a random basis. Due to this, the possibility of manipulation in the system will become negligible. This will also remove all the loopholes related to the existing billing system. “This is a revolutionary step taken by the Kejriwal government to eradicate corruption and solve the discrepancy existing in the current system. This will also help provide a smooth and transparent billing system for the people of Delhi,” Jain stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/meter-reading-djb-acts-against-30-staff/articleshow/88231290.cms||---

The order was passed by Gujarat Real Estate Regulatory Authority. The case involved Gaurav Desai who had purchased a flat in Maruti Amrakunj-2, a scheme floated by Bhanushri Realties, for Rs 30 lakh. According to Desai, he faced delayed possession by five months and use of substandard material in construction. He complained that gas line, which had been promised during the time of booking, was not provided, the elevators malfunctioned and promised parking was not allotted. He also claimed that the builder did not give him the GST payment receipt and BU permission letter. He took up these issues with the builder. However, when his complaints were ignored, he approached GujRERA. After hearing the case, RERA has partly allowed his complaint and ordered the builder to pay Rs 93,000 compensation to Desai with interest since he filed the complaint. The builder has also been asked to pay Rs 11,000 to the unit owner towards mental agony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pay-rs-93k-to-owner-of-flat-rera-to-builder/articleshow/88230717.cms||---

State education minister Jitu Vaghani had earlier this month announced that the cabinet has decided to allow appointment of visiting teachers at grant-in-aid schools. “The government has not issued any notification and hence the hiring process cannot be started. The government seems to have put in on the backburner again,” said Bhasker Patel, president of Gujarat Rajya Shala Sanchalak Mahamandal. He alleged the government has backtracked after announcing that their monthly remuneration could go up to Rs 27,000 per month.

The complaints were registered by Shilpa Shah and Rajal Rayka, residents of Pratapkunj Society, against one another.  In her complaint, Shilpa — who stays on the first floor — claimed that she had gone down when Rajal stopped her and asked her why she had thrown a letter outside her house. “Other women who did not stay there also came out and began shouting at me. Rajal asked me to vacate the flat and stay somewhere else. The women threatened to break my limbs if I did not do so,” she claimed. Shilpa stated that she called up the control room, then went to Vasna police station to lodge a complaint against Rajal and an unidentified woman. In the cross-complaint, Rajal stated that, on Saturday afternoon, she realized that Shilpa who stayed above her flat, had thrown a chit and garbage outside her house.”When I questioned her about the garbage, she began abusing me.

---||Goa||Important to control transitions for our style of play: Ferrando||Panaji: After three straight defeats at the start, FC Goa now have two wins in a row. From bottom-place, Goa have now moved to seventh on the table with six points from their first five matches. It’s a much-improved show from the initial disaster. During the hard times, Goa coach Juan Ferrando stayed true to his style of football and the club’s philosophy. They played possession-based football throughout and kept faith in their attacking style, even if it meant conceding goals. The results are now showing. The 2-1 win against Bengaluru FC at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim on Saturday would have done the team’s confidence a world of good. The former champions have always been difficult opponents and Goa had won just twice in nine meetings. “The transitions are very important in football when our style is to play in attack. At the end, it is very important to control the transitions. Sometimes, we make mistakes, because our focus was not in place, sometimes when the reactions of the players are not good and on time and then this is the problem,” Ferrando said after the game. Although Ashique Kuruniyan’s own-goal put Goa ahead, they definitely earned it after exerting pressure on Bengaluru in the first half. But when Cleiton Silva levelled terms before the break, it looked like the momentum would drift towards Bengaluru. However, Goa showed grit and determination to remain focussed even after Jorge Ortiz’s red card in the 55th minute. “After the red card the team was in a very difficult situation, but I think they changed the score because of the spirit of the team, the character was very good,” said Ferrando. “In this case, I am very happy for the players, and also the line-up and also the players in substitutions, because they looked after the team.” Ortiz is among Goa’s most influential players. He already has one goal and three assists in five matches. Goa’s defence may have leaked in more goals than expected, particularly from dead ball situations. But Goa worked a set piece of their own which saw hard-working Devendra Murgaonkar score his first goal of the season. Goa will now face Hyderabad FC on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/important-to-control-transitions-for-our-style-of-play-ferrando/articleshow/88244783.cms||---
---||Delhi||N corpn selling properties at throwaway prices, alleges AAP||New Delhi: AAP functionary Atishi on Saturday said a proposal had been brought to the standing committee of North Delhi Municipal Corporation to sell Shalimar Bagh municipal school at throwaway prices. In a press conference, the AAP MLA claimed that 2,800 sqmtr land worth over Rs 500 crore is being sold for a mere Rs 126 crore “to benefit BJP’s own people”. Atishi called it an anti-poor move and stated that the sale of the school would hamper the right to education of underprivileged students. “The BJP has realised that people of Delhi are going to oust them from the corporations in the upcoming municipal elections. Thus, the sole remaining aim of the BJP functionaries these days is to make as much money as possible in the few months left. The north corporation is selling off the corporation's assets and properties to private players. Not just this, these properties are being sold at odd rates below market prices. This makes it clear that there’s definite collusion or tie-ups among the BJP functionaries and buyers,” said Atishi. The list of the properties being sold by the north corporation includes Gandhi Maidan Parking at Chandni Chowk, Shiva Market Parking in Pitampura, Qutub Road Parking at Sadar Bazar, Novelty Cinema, Nani Wala Bagh, Moti Nagar Shopping Complex, 22 shops next to Delite Cinema, 132 plots in Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, five parking and shopping complexes in Karol Bagh, 34 school buildings, vacant health centres, town halls, and vacant land at Rajendra Babu Institute of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, the AAP functionary claimed. AAP has announced that it will investigate all of BJP’s “scandals and favouritism” when it comes to power in the corporations. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called AAP’s allegations “baseless and totally false”. “The plot in question stands allocated for car parking construction after land use change 5 years ago in 2017. The north corporation is not selling the plot but has gone in for joint lease agreement with a private party for construction of 354 vehicles car parking. Under the lease agreement, the corporation will get Rs 126 crore and half share in constructed car parking,” Kapoor said, claiming that it was also a demand from RWAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/n-corpn-selling-properties-at-throwaway-prices-alleges-aap/articleshow/88231295.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Authorities to reconsider move to take over part of Maharaja’s ground||Kochi: Finally, authorities have decided to reconsider their decision to take a portion of Maharaja’s College Ground for rehabilitating vendors from Fashion Street on Mullassery Canal Road. The move comes following protests against taking over land from the college for the purpose.  TOI had carried stories regarding the authorities’ decision to take over the land and its implications. Authorities had been planning to rehabilitate vendors for facilitating the work on renovation of Mullassery Canal. “We are scrapping the plan to use the college’s land for rehabilitating vendors. Our objective was to avoid waterlogging in the city. It is for a short period that a small portion of the ground is needed for rehabilitating vendors. But, the college authorities and others objected it following misunderstanding. Once the canal renovation is over, the land would have given back to the college,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. Cultural leaders, teachers, students and the college development council, who had been demanding the land of the college should not be taken over, welcomed the authorities’ move to reconsider the plan. “We are not against handing over adequate land for widening, if needed, of Mullassery Canal so as to avoid waterlogging in the city. We are of the view that the land of the college also can be used for widening the canal. The same extent of land which is being taken over from others should be handed over to widening of the canal,” said Maharaja’s College governing body chairman N Ramakanthan. “On the other hand, Maharajas College’s land should not be used for rehabilitating vendors. They can explore other alternatives for the purpose,” Ramakanthan said. “The move to reconsider taking over the college’s land is certainly a welcome move. We appreciate the mayor for the immediate response. Authorities should find out other places where vendors can be rehabilitated. We can help them identify other places where the vendors can be rehabilitated,” said CICC Jayachandran, member of college development council. District collector Jafar Malik said that the move became a controversy due to misunderstanding. “The plan was to use the land for rehabilitating vendors for three months. By that time, the renovation of the canal can be completed and vendors can be shifted back to the Mullassery Canal area. But, those opposing the plan misunderstood it. Maybe, the past experiences of alienating college’s land fuelled their objection,” Malik said. “The canal renovation will help avoid waterlogging in all areas, including Maharaja’s College Ground. We would think of convening one more meeting to discuss the issue and convince them. However, we won’t be able to force them to fall in line with our decision. Operation Breakthrough, under which Mullassery Canal is being renovated, is a project being monitored by the court. So, we wanted to complete the work at the earliest,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/authorities-to-reconsider-move-to-take-over-part-of-maharajas-ground/articleshow/88230183.cms||---

Police said that it was not clear if its a case of suicide or there was foul play. Sabarkantha superintendent of police Neeraj Budgujjar told TOI, “A team of doctors completed the postmortem of the girl. The samples have been sent for testing at a forensic lab in Ahmedabad. The results from the forensic lab will give a clear picture of what was the cause of death.” The body did not have any injury mark other than the rope marks around the girl’s neck, said police. Her duppta was found lying near her body. When asked if there was suspicion on someone who could have instigated the girl to take such an extreme step, police inspector AV Joshi replied in the negative. He, however, said that they are questioning the family to ascertain if there was some domestic issue in the family. The girl’s father had come to Himatnagar recently and was living in a rented house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/9-yr-old-girl-hangs-to-death-in-himmatnagar/articleshow/88229619.cms||---

During his questioning, it emerged that bank accounts, digital wallets and OTT access credentials are being sold illegally. Police personnel investigating the sim card racket, which has roots in north Gujarat, found that the fraudsters had some 500 active cards which were being used by two people simultaneously: the proper owner and the cyber crook. It was a startling revelation as cyber crooks were earlier using inactive sim cards to dupe people. The accused steal data on active numbers from telecom companies or banks using the dark web. They clone sim cards and use them either in call centre rackets to dupe foreign nationals or to extort money from people. They use these cards for a day or two and the real owner is usually none the wiser, said a police officer. Apart from the threat of personal information being misused through access to the sim card, this also represents a threat to national security because calls can be made and there will be no tracks to follow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/illegal-sim-card-sales-a-major-security-threat/articleshow/88231297.cms||---

In view of this, MHRD has to take a decision and fulfil the demand,” Sayanna added. Currently, the central government allots 10 seats per academic year in KVs to Members of Parliament (MPs). The TRS MLA has requested that he be provided the same number of seats every academic year. There are six KVs, a chain of central government schools run with the support of MHRD, in the Cantonment limits. “There is a huge demand for KV seats. Children of personnel of armed forces get admission in KVs, but children from below poverty line (BPL) families can’t get seats,” MLA G Sayanna told TOI. Meanwhile, in another plea to Union defence minister, Rajnath Singh, the MLA sought defence land for widening a sharp curve near a graveyard at Tadbund Circle to prevent road accidents. In a span of a year, four people died in accidents at the blind curve, he said. “In the recent inspection by defence personnel and local police, they proposed to cut trees. Instead of cutting trees, I suggested acquiring the defence land (GLR survey no: 596). The Union defence minister must direct the local military authority (LMA) to look into the proposal,” Sayanna suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/allot-kv-seats-to-bpl-families-cantt-mla/articleshow/88230738.cms||Sunil Mungara

The illegal structure was also found falling within 200-500ms of the high tide line (HTL) in CRZ area and the premises was being exploited for commercial gains. While the restaurant was operated from the ground floor, the top two floors were used as residential apartments by the offender. The authority found that the structure was constructed without any permissions and that the violator had applied for permissions from the Town and Country Planning department and the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA), after the building was already constructed. GCZMA had received two complaints from locals about the illegal structure and a showcause notice was issued to the offender in February 2019. An inspection of the building was also carried out by expert members of the authority. “The expert members noted that the Candolim panchayat did not grant occupancy certificate to the illegal structure constructed at the site. It noted that the respondent (violator) had submitted documents to the member secretary NGPDA with letter dated February 22, 2016 for development permission. However, the member secretary had rejected this proposal by citing reasons that there were no ownership title documents, no setback from the main road, and FAR permissible limits,” GCZMA noted. It also said that the very fact that the violator moved an application seeking permission in 2016 proves that the construction is a recent one. “It is admitted that GCZMA’s role is to check if the structure is prior to 1991. The respondent has miserably failed to justify/prove that the structure was constructed prior to 1991,” the authority said in its decision. “The authority noted that the respondent has relied on the house tax receipt to prove the existence of the structure. The house is existing from the year 1999-2000 which is way after the CRZ came into force. The same was used for commercial purposes with neither approvals nor permissions obtained from the office of GCZMA, and hence the entire structure in dispute is considered to be illegal,” GCZMA noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gczma-orders-demolition-of-illegal-restaurant-at-candolim/articleshow/88231492.cms||---

As per latest reports, it has been predicted that UK is likely to face a major omicron wave next year. With this, three samples (two sent on Friday) are awaited for genome sequencing results. On Saturday, a total of 532 passengers landed at the airport. So far, 3,767 passengers have arrived at the Shamshabad airport from high-risk countries. Meanwhile, Telangana saw 188 new cases of Covid-19 and one death on Saturday. A total of 4,761 reports are awaited. The number of active cases in the state stands at 3,891.

Clicked by forester Yasin Juneja a few days ago on the outskirts of Vadal village, the picture shows that despite the young lions’ devil-may-care attitude, the pride couldn’t resist the inviting warmth of a comfortable bedstead while hunting for water in the chilly night. Lion movement is common in Dhari, Rajula and Savarkundla areas where the big cats frequent the places in search of easy prey and water. Once they venture out of Junagadh forest, lions usually find the neighbouring Amreli district their first ideal choice for a stopover, experts claim. Guesstimates peg around 130 lions to be moving in the Amreli district, majority of its land being revenue areas. Experts believe the easy prey base in the district’s primarily agrarian setting is what makes it a major attraction for the prides. Lions may have also made their habitat near human habitation despite its proximity to port Pipavav, which witnesses major movement of heavy vehicles and is fraught with risks for the straying wildlife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-lions-on-a-cot-one-gets-lower-berth/articleshow/88229635.cms||---

Chaudhari had applied for regular bail after the police filed a detailed chargesheet in the case recently. Chaudhari, in his bail application, stated that he was being falsely implicated in the case and that there was no prima-facie evidence against him. “I opposed the bail as Chaudhari is accused of committing a heinous crime like rape and murder. The accused’s application seemed to be of discharge and discussion of the entire evidence in this much detail is not permissible,” said Ramesh Gianchandani, assistant government pleader. “The court observed that there is prima-facie evidence against the Chaudhari. Also, it was observed that the case falls in the category of exceptional case where bail can’t be granted as a rule. Hence, the court rejected the bail application of the accused on Friday,” Gianchandani added. Chaudhari and five other men are accused of raping and murdering a 37-year-old woman in Dethan village of Karjan taluka in August this year. The woman had gone to a nearby field on the evening of August 16. The six accused, who work as labourers, were hanging out near the rail track. They followed her into the field and then allegedly gang raped her. The accused then used her dupatta to strangle her. Within hour of finding the woman’s body, the cops tracked down all the accused and arrested them from nearby makeshift huts. ‘Java’, the tracker dog of the police, sniffed the girl’s dupatta at the crime spot and headed straight towards the hutments about 500 metres away. The police questioned Lal Bahadur Girjaram who was present in the hutment and he confessed to the crime. He also revealed the names of the other five accused.

An MRI machine and Cath lab facility will also be inaugurated at the hospital over the next few days. Harish Rao said that the cath lab facility at Osmania General Hospital (OGH) is ready and will be launched soon. The CT scan machine worth Rs 2 crore, which is used to capture an array of cross-sectional images of the body for various medical departments, is the first to be inaugurated in a list of high-end medical equipment worth Rs 19 crore as part of developmental works that have been initiated at the tertiary care centre. “Patients at Gandhi Hospital will be able to access free diagnostic services with a Rs 12.5 crore worth MRI machine and Rs 6.5 crore worth cath lab facility in the next two months. These are vital for conducting emergency heart procedures including angiograms,” said the minister. Further, work on the 200-bed Mother and Child Health (MCH) facility in Gandhi Hospital campus has been expedited. It is expected to be complete within the next six months. The minister pointed out that these are vital for the overall development of healthcare facilities at Gandhi Hospital and to provide free quality tertiary healthcare services to urban poor. The minister said that civic works worth Rs 100 crore have been completed while works worth Rs 76 crore are underway. The minister visited emergency block after inaugurating the CT scan at Gandhi Hospital and interacted with patients there.

---||Gurgaon||A year on, normalcy finally returns on Delhi-Jaipur highway||GURUGRAM: Cops busy removing barricades, shopkeepers gearing up to reopen their outlets shut for over a year, and petrol pump owners eagerly awaiting vehicle footfall to increase. These were the scenes that played out on Saturday morning in Shahjahanpur on the Haryana-Rajasthan border that had become an agitation site for protesting farmers since December last year. Later in the evening, the entire Delhi-Jaipur highway near the Haryana-Rajasthan border was thrown open for the public. Last year, on December 13, scores of farmers from the neighbouring states of Haryana and Rajasthan blocked the Jaipur-Delhi carriageway of the high-speed corridor near Shahjahanpur of Alwar district. Several attempts were made to vacate the site, but the resilient protesters had stood their ground. The farmers had started leaving the agitation site since late Friday night. By early Saturday morning, the site was gone. Leftovers of tents, food packets, a poster of Bhagat Singh lying unattended, and an old farmer bidding adieu to people from the Sikh community that offered langar at the site marked the end of the protest and the resumption of normal traffic movement and business activity on the highway. “I’m going to reopen my food joint on Sunday. Today, I’m cleaning my premises and setting things up. My shop was closed by cops during the Covid lockdown and when I reopened, it had to be shut as this entire stretch was captured by the farmers,” said Ashok Kumar, a local dhaba owner. While villagers and locals had pledged support to the farmers’ cause, they recalled the commuting woes that they had to brace. Commuters, too, breathed a sigh of relief as they were forced to grapple with hour-long jams on a daily basis and long detours. “There were jams throughout the day and on days there were several hours of congestion. At times, we diverted vehicles to village roads but to constrained width of those stretches, villagers would complain about jams and chaos there,” said a traffic cop stationed at the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/a-year-on-normalcy-finally-returns-on-delhi-jaipur-highway/articleshow/88231298.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

This is an increase by almost 50 per cent. “We have earmarked a number of additional beds as Covid-19 beds although these are currently in use for regular emergency cases as Covid-19 beds require a lot of space. Once the number of Covid-19 cases increase, all the earmarked beds will also be put to use,” said an official from a corporate hospital. According to the health department, there are a total of 3,897 patients in the state of which 1,500 are hospitalised and the remaining are recovering at home. “Although the number of cases may increase and Omicron cases will also be recorded sooner or later, the good thing is that these cases are not likely to be severe in nature. This means that most patients will not require hospitalization but patients with comorbidities and compromised immunity will need hospitalization,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-increases-covid-beds-to-over-55k/articleshow/88230741.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Regional forensic science laboratory in Hubballi to start operations soon||Hubballi: Experts and personnel in law enforcement agencies have repeatedly pointed to the need for more units for the examination of forensic evidence in the state. Police personnel across the state often have to endure an agonising wait for the results of tests on forensic evidence, which they have to dispatch to Bengaluru or the other five other regional centres. Now, the state government has finally initiated the process to set up a regional forensic science laboratory (RFSL) in Hubballi, which is expected to help police expedite investigation in various cases. The RFSL centre is slated to be equipped with all the modern equipment, along the lines of the centre in Bengaluru. The government has already identified a building on Gokul Road, which will house the RFSL unit. A team of officials recently visited the building and inspected the same. Hubballi-Dharwad police commissioner Labhu Ram said, “We have identified a building belonging to North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation on Gokul Road. The building earlier housed the office of the police commissioner. Among others, senior officials including additional director general of police (crime and technical service) and director of the forensic science laboratory, Bengaluru, inspected the building recently.” The RFSL in Hubballi will be the sixth, in addition to the facilities in Mysuru, Belagavi, Mangaluru, Davanagere and Kalaburagi. Preparations are under way to set up another such laboratory in Ballari. FSL director Dharmendra Meena said, “We want to begin operations at the RFSL in Hubballi by the end of this month. The sanctioned strength for the RFSL in Hubballi is one deputy director, six assistant directors, as many senior scientific officers, 12 scientific officers and six laboratory attendants. So far, we have posted one deputy director, four senior scientific officers and one attendant, while the remaining staff are being trained.” The RFSL centre in Hubballi will be equipped with machinery to analyse DNA, examine data and other physical evidence. Some of the facilities at the Hubballi centre are not available at the existing regional centres. Welcoming the development, Hubballi-based advocate Sanjeev Badaskar said, “Investigation of many cases gets delayed owing to the burden on the laboratory in Bengaluru. Once the laboratory in Bengaluru starts operations, investigation in various cases can be expedited.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/regional-forensic-science-laboratory-in-hubballi-to-start-operations-soon/articleshow/88230488.cms||J Abbas Mulla

In fact, there was hectic activity at the protest site as dismantling of tents continued at a rapid pace. But the crowd had become conspicuously larger as more farmers, as well as relatives and family members arrived from several districts to help with the unwinding and the return home, and also for an experience of the upbeat mood at the site after a year of uncertainties and hardship. One of the youngest visitors was four-month-old Samrit Singh, a resident of Delhi’s Dwarka, who wasn’t born when his grandfather reached the protest site earlier this year. “We live in Dwarka but Samrit’s grandfather keeps visiting and on Saturday we decided to take Samrit to UP Gate,” said Navjot Kaur, the baby’s mother. Ram Singh, another farmer from Amroha, just had food at one of the prominent langars at UP Gate. “Even while I was having food, half of the tents that once housed langars were being dismantled. But we are going with a sense of contentment that we have achieved our goals — the repeal of the three contentious farm laws.” Sonu, a scavenger from Khoda, unmindful of what was going around, was busy assorting and scanning trash that the farmers were leaving behind. “I, along with our friends, are frequent visitors to this place particularly for free meals,” he said. The stage was set for the final act as BKU leader Rakesh Tikait and others participated in a prayer meeting with hundreds in attendance. Away from the stage under the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME) flyover, young protesters were dancing and shouting slogans to the music blazing from loudspeakers. “We are the first batch of farmers from Bijnor who are heading back home. In the next couple of days, more will follow. Before leaving, we are just enjoying a bit,” said Harkirat Singh, a young protester.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/protesters-leave-up-gate-with-apologies-to-locals/articleshow/88231311.cms||Abhijay Jha

At 88 too, he was very keen to listen and never displayed any haste to show off the wisdom acquired over his six-decade-long political career, according Tirumalagiri Surender, former chairman, AP Press Academy. Surender, who chronicled Rosaiah’s life into a book, said that Rosaiah was the lone Congress chief minister who never faced any corruption charges during his political life. But, if he was upset with the opposition’s attitude in the House, even TDP would find it difficult to face him on the floor of the assembly, as he used to deploy choicest chaste Telugu words and proverbs that loom on rivals like an avalanche. Rosaiah was made AP chief minister after the sudden demise of YS Rajasekhara Reddy on September 2, 2009. He led the state for a little over a year during a turbulent period. When YSR’s padayatra was progressing like a juggernaut and entered East Godavari in 2003, a majority of Congress leaders were hesitant to join him as party high command did not approve. Rosaiah travelled to Rajahmundry, met YSR and extended support, Surender said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rosaiah-lone-cong-cm-to-not-face-graft-charges/articleshow/88230774.cms||---

Inaugurating an awareness campaign to ensure human rights to tribespeople at Kerala Institute of Local Administration (Kila) in Agali, the chairperson said the tribespeople “are getting enough food from community kitchen and anganwadis”. “These programmes have been found to be working very effectively,” she said. “However, it is painful to know that infant deaths are still taking place in Attapadi. The commission will recommend the government to conduct a survey on health problems faced by the tribespeople,” she said. She said that the commission is aiming to set up Jagratha Samithis at the ward-level to monitor human rights violations and domestic violence. “The tribal welfare schemes are being very effectively implemented in Attapadi and there are no serious problems here that cannot be solved,” she claimed. “The lifestyle of tribespeople should also change. The commission members have found that most of them, including women, are addicted to liquor and tobacco. They should be brought back to agriculture to ensure supply of traditional food like millets,” she said. The commission chairperson was accompanied by members MS Thara and Shahida Kamal and district panchayat president K Binumol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kwc-chief-no-malnutrition-in-attapadi-lifestyle-to-be-blamed/articleshow/88230781.cms||---
---||Goa||No action against rd contractor yet, senior citizens tell Gadkari||Panaji: Senior citizen residents of Palmar Colony in Bambolim have written to Union minister for road transport and highways (MoRTH), Nitin Gadkari, reminding him that officials in Goa have not taken any action against the highway works contractor, nearly three months after Gadkari had directed PWD to look into their grievance. The senior citizens have been running from pillar to post to get the highway works contractor at Bambolim initiate corrective measures. They had submitted RTI documents pointing to violations by the contractor. The citizens said that the highway work has resulted in nuisance of traffic and air pollution in their colony, as vehicles are being diverted through the narrow lanes, due to the ongoing expansion work. They allege that the contractor has changed the highway expansion alignment only to save one commercial structure, at the cost of inconveniencing residents of Palmar Colony. “We, the senior citizens of the residential Palmar Colony, near Goa Medical College (GMC) complex, Bambolim, highly appreciate your gesture dated September 17, 2021, giving direction to the authorities to resolve our long pending issue on account of the national highway widening. However, it is very much regretted to state that despite lapsing of about three months after your direction, the authority concerned, PWD, contractor nor consultant, have not resolved the issue and the inconvenience inflicted upon us by the authorities and contractor years ago continues till today,” the residents have stated in their letter to Gadkari. The residents said that the highway work was ill-planned. The contractor has excavated side of the present highway road to a depth of nearly 12-15m to extract earth to use for filling of the highway road project and has left this excavated stretch in a dangerous condition, locals said. “In constructing 4-lane highway; EPC contractor and consultant have encroached the existing Santa Cruz-Bambolim MDR road reducing its width from 8 to 4.5m. Hence, traffic from Santa Cruz-Bambolim GMC, particularly ambulances, passes through our private residential colony road which creates nuisance and unsafe condition to the residents,” the senior citizens had stated. The residents’ petition has been pending with Goa State Human Rights Commission and the chief minister’s office, besides PWD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-action-against-rd-contractor-yet-senior-citizens-tell-gadkari/articleshow/88230765.cms||---

Police commissioner V Satyanarayana said they had decided to impose the ban to prevent possible misuse of drones by ‘terrorists and antisocial elements.’ Satyanarayana on Saturday said the ban on use of paragliders, remote-controlled drones and remote-controlled microlight aircraft would be enforced till January 1, 2022. “The decision has been taken for security reasons,” Satyanarayana said. He pointed out that in recent times, drones were being used extensively during weddings and other occasions. “If at all, anyone wants to use a drone, they can do so only after taking due permission of police,” he said. Those found violating the order would be prosecuted under IPC section of causing disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant, he warned. The section provides for imprisonment up to six months with or without fine. In addition to the restrictions on operating drones, the CP said no one should carry any weapons. The commissioner also said no music shows, singing of songs or giving speeches will be allowed at public places. The restriction on DJ sound and music has also been extended up to December 23. “The sound particularly causes a lot of disturbance to children, students, aged and the sick,” he said. For using a public address system, if so necessary, at a gathering, permission will have to be first taken from the assistant commissioner of police concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/karimnagar-police-ban-drones-till-january-1/articleshow/88230762.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

The deceased Yuvrajsinh Ghanshyamsinh Chudasama turned the television volume to the maximum so that no one from his family could hear the gunshot. Ghanshyamsinh, who works as a security guard with a bank after his retirement, had a licensed gun. Police said that on Friday night the deceased along with his father, mother and sister was watching television at his residence near Bhaktinagar circle. As the family members went to sleep Yuvrajsinh told them that he will watch television for some more time. Thereafter, he turned the television volume to the maximum and shot himself in the chest. As Yuvrajsinh did not join the family on the first floor of the house, his father came down and found him lying in a pool of blood. They called an ambulance but the staff on duty declared Yuvrajsinh dead and informed the police. “We are investigating the matter. Prima facie it looks like he took the extreme step due to one-sided love. We are checking his mobile data. The family is understandably shocked and they have no clue as to why Yuvrajsinh committed suicide,” a police officer told TOI. According to police he shot himself in the left side of the chest.

Dr Samiran Panda, head of ICMR's epidemiology department, told TOI that as of now the apex biomedical research body would underscore the importance of attaining greater coverage with two-dose vaccination. "With Omicron cases being mild not only in India but the world over, there should not be any knee-jerk reaction like introducing a third dose or recommending any change in the interval of Covishield doses," he said. "A decision on whether a third dose would be required for immunocompromised individuals would be taken later," Dr Panda said. He said scientific evidence of booster dose for the Indian terrain was being evaluated and the technical advisory group would make an announcement regarding it. Dr Panda said public health focus should be on double vaccination and completing the adult immunisation programme now because the two-dose vaccine strategy seemed to be working well in the Indian context. On the demand from states like Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka to reduce the gap between the two Covishield doses, the ICMR scientist said scientific evidence from in-country reality was showing that the interval was fine. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said a booster shot would increase the number of circulating antibodies and it had shown to increase the protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron. "We don't know how well two doses continue to protect against severe disease. In the UK, those who got the AstraZeneca vaccine are getting a booster of the mRNA Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. A third dose of AstraZeneca will not be very effective because of its nature," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/icmr-focus-on-two-dose-vax-is-fine-with-current-covishield-gap/articleshow/88232203.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The roads at Tikri and Ghazipur will open by Sunday morning, while it will take around two days to remove the cemented dug-in barricades/nails and to fully carry out the repair work at Singhu. At Tikri border, the removal work of barricades, roadblocks and cemented barriers started on Saturday morning. Around 3-4 cranes were called in for removal of roadblocks. “Most of the farmers have left. There are minor road repair and cleaning work which needs to be completed and the road will be open for commuters from Sunday morning,” a senior police official said. At Singhu border, it will take around two days to completely open the road for commuters, as there are three kinds of barricade layering placed there, including the yellow movable barricades, roadblocks such as containers, and cemented barriers. “Some of the yellow barricades have been removed, but the remaining work will be carried out on Sunday morning. Hydraulic cranes will be required to remove the cemented barricades. After the barricades are removed, the road will have to be repaired from some parts. Most of the farmers have left, however, around 1,000 are still there. Some people have also left behind their materials that need to be cleaned before the road is finally opened,” said another official. At the Ghazipur border, cops TOI spoke to said that they were in talks with their senior officials and UP counterparts for removing the barricades from the protest site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/farmers-gone-now-the-turn-of-barricades/articleshow/88231348.cms||---

CFR in the PMC limits stood at 0.6% in the previous week (November 25-December 1) and 1.8% during November 18-24. City hospitals involved in treating Covid patients said for weeks now, they have recorded no new deaths due to Covid-19. PMC’s assistant medical officer Sanjeev Wavare told TOI, “CFR during the second wave in the Pune municipal limits started dropping from July this year, but the drop has been significant during the second half of November and further in December. Weekly CFR in the city limits has fallen below 0.5% in December, which is an average of one or two deaths per week. There are a few days in a week when the city records no Covid death.” A district health department official said, “0.3% CFR is akin to just three deaths in a thousand Covid cases, which is a very low mortality rate. As cases have reduced, deaths have also reduced, with 1-2 Covid deaths in the PMC limits per week off late. Though the PMC limits have been recording lower CFR than the PCMC and rural areas, the difference is only minor as Covid mortalities have reduced across the district.” Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, told TOI, “For weeks together now, we see no Covid deaths at the hospital, which is a stark contrast from the past. This trend has been brewing since four to six weeks, becoming more pronounced during the recent weeks. For instance, there is an average of 0-1 Covid death in a four-week period at the hospital.” Dr Kelkar said Covid mortalities have gone down so significantly now, that such low CFR was never observed in the past even when the first Covid wave had subsided. “High vaccination rate in the population and the virus taking on a milder version have a role to play in this,” he said. Experts said most Covid deaths now were being reported from severe unvaccinated cases or elderly patients with higher number of comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/with-2-deaths-weekly-cfr-dips-to-0-3-in-pmc-limits/articleshow/88230771.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Oppn rallies behind guv, seeks CM’s reply||Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leaders have expressed solidarity with governor Arif Mohammed Khan on his outburst against the alleged political interferences by the LDF government in higher education sector and asked for remedial measures to set free higher academic sector from the clutches of petty politics. Opposition leader V D Satheesan on Saturday said the LDF government was in a hurry to convert universities into party cells. “It may be the first such letter written by a governor to any chief minister in the country. Backdoor appointments are rampant in universities. Not the chief minister, but the party secretary would be more suitable for the chancellor post,” Satheesan said. The opposition leader said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan should react to the charges raised against him by the governor. “People of the state want to know what the CM has to say. The higher education sector is ailing as a result of government using universities to ensure job security to political nominees and leaders’ relatives,” he said. Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala said Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravidran should step down and higher education minister R Bindu should be ousted from the state cabinet in view of the serious revelations made by the governor. “Opposition has flagged several anomalies in the higher education sector in the past five and a half years. I had given several complaints to the governor regarding the rule violations by former education minister K T Jaleel. The governor who refused to take actions so far has now ratified all the allegations,” Chennithala said. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said the strong reaction of governor Khan was a slap on the face of the chief minister. “The governor has exposed Pinarayi Vijayan government’s repeated attempts to undermine the constitution,” he said, adding that all illegal appointments in the universities should be cancelled. “Action should be taken against all, including the vice-chancellors who carried out the government diktats to appoint the relatives of Left leaders in important posts,” he said. Surendran said BJP would give all support to the governor in his fight against nepotism and corruption. He said BJP would launch protest programmes against the political interferences in universities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-rallies-behind-guv-seeks-cms-reply/articleshow/88230259.cms||---

He told TOI on Saturday, “I had applied for transfer during the general transfer in the last three years. Last year, the superintendent of Pattambi taluk hospital Dr Mohammed Abdul Rehman, who replaced me now, had requested for a transfer to Attapadi. He was denied and he even went on appeal. Not only that, I was planning to leave Attapadi as my promotion as district medical officer is 6th in the list.” He said that the transfer order reached him on Friday night and on Saturday morning he left Attapadi and joined the new assignment as the superintendent of Tirurangadi taluk hospital. “The medical and non-medical staff of tribal specialty hospital worked to help the tribespeople fighting all odds. We had no specific working hours. We did not do any private practice. In many cases, we spent money from our salary to help the poor tribespeople and I am happy that we could make some changes, and brought down the tribal infant deaths and malnutrition problems to a great extent in Attapadi.” Dr Prebhudas came to Attapadi as a temporary service doctor at Agali public health centre in 1995 and in 2000 he was appointed by public service commission at Pudur public health centre. In 2007, he won the best doctor award. He was brought back to Attapadi after an agitation by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the tribal organizations in the wake of large-scale deaths of tribal infants in 2013. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-nodal-officer-hails-his-transfer-from-attapadi/articleshow/88230792.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Four of five cargo crew test negative for Omicron variant||PANAJI: Four of the five samples of Russian and Georgian crew members of a cargo vessel sent for genome sequencing have tested negative for the new Omicron variant of Covid-19. The one sample that failed during processing will be re-tested. With this, Goa’s eight Omicron suspects are now down by half. “The Russian embassy is in touch with Goa after its nationals tested positive for Covid-19,” a health official said. Goa’s four Omicron suspects who are awaiting results of genome sequencing from the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, were all asymptomatic on Saturday. One of the crew members who was symptomatic and was treated at SMRC in Chicalim, was moved to the isolation facility at Cansaulim health centre where the other four crew members and three UK returnees are being isolated. Should the UK returnees test negative for the Omicron variant, they will be permitted to continue their isolation at home since they provided local addresses. They will be treated as any other Covid-19 positive person in the state, state epidemiologist Dr Utkarsh Betodkar said. The contacts of the three UK passengers who tested positive include fellow travellers on the same flight. As per health protocols, passengers who were seated three rows behind the three UK passengers, three rows in front of and in the same row are also being tested. Any passenger testing positive will be moved into state isolation facilities until they test negative for Omicron. Meanwhile, the health department has also begun reaching out to persons who returned from at-risk countries and tested negative on arrival. Any such travellers will be sent for testing on the eight day as per central government guidelines. Travellers who arrived in the state have already gone to health centres. In addition to passengers from UK flights arriving in Goa, health services is also tracking those who have arrived in Goa from at-risk countries via other airports. “The number is huge and running into 1,000s. We receive details of those arriving from high risk countries from other airports. The health services and the collectorates are tracing them. They are facing difficulties in some cases where people have shared foreign phone numbers,” state epidemiologist Betodkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/four-of-five-cargo-crew-test-ve-for-omicron/articleshow/88230782.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Goa||Goa: Daily Covid vaccination timings increased by 4 hours to hit 100% target||PANAJI: With Goa having missed multiple deadlines to fully vaccinate its population, the directorate of health services has decided to extend vaccination timings at the two district hospitals and two sub district hospitals, on a trial basis. From Saturday, vaccinations will be conducted from 8am to 8pm at the South and North Goa district hospitals as well as the sub-district hospitals at Ponda and Chicalim. The previous timings were from 9am to 5pm. “This is our initiative to give citizens who face difficulties getting vaccinated during office hours, the privilege of getting vaccinated early morning or late evening. This is being done on an experimental basis,” state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar told TOI. Although vaccinations don’t take place at health centres on Sundays, district hospitals are trying to work out a system wherein they can administer vaccines in the casualty ward. The health department will incorporate feedback from the district and sub-district hospitals on Monday and streamline the initiative accordingly. “We require people to come in numbers. If one person comes in at 8pm for the vaccine, we cannot afford to waste nine doses. There are many difficulties that have to be worked around,” Borkar added. Each vaccine vial contains at least 10 doses and must be used within four hours of opening. On Saturday, another 2,870 persons took their second dose of the vaccine and 690 persons the first dose. Goa’s doubly-vaccinated population is 10.6 lakh and partially vaccinated 2.1 lakh. Earlier this week, chief minister Pramod Sawant had appealed to the people to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that the government can declare the state fully-vaccinated by December 19 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits. As on date 91% of Goa’s eligible population set at 11.7 lakh, is doubly-vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/daily-vax-timings-increased-by-4-hrs-to-hit-100-target/articleshow/88230784.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Pune||Garbage clearance fees to be paid to waste pickers||Pune: Citizens need to pay the monthly charges of Rs75 per home for door-to-door waste collection to trash collectors. The new rates for waste collection were announced by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently. The civic body gave an extension to SWaCH agency, which is involved in doorstep garbage collection in the city. SWaCH members are allowed to collect user charges from households from whom they collect waste. Besides individual flats, the user charge for waste collection from slum houses has been fixed at Rs55 per month, while the monthly charge is Rs150 for commercial establishments. Earlier, the charges for individual flats / homes, slum houses and commercial establishments were Rs70, Rs50 and Rs140, respectively. According to SWaCH over 3500 waste pickers in the city are involved in garbage collection from about 8.5 lakh properties, which includes individual houses, housing societies, shops and commercial establishments. The waste pickers visit individual houses, slums and housing complexes to collect the segregated garbage. At bigger housing societies or complexes the waste is collected on the premises and then it is handed over to waste collectors. Amogh Bhongale of SWaCH said, “The waste collection system is working effectively in the city for the last 13 years. The house owners pay charges to the waste collectors directly. The payment system may differ as per the situation. Such as in some bigger housing societies the waste collectors are paid by the societies collectively, instead of payment by individual flats. The waste pickers play a vital role in the city’s waste management.” Harshad Barde, director, SWaCH, said, “Increase in user charges was scheduled from the beginning of 2021. But due to the delay, it was pushed till October 2021. So, waste pickers have lost out on one year’s increase in rates. The increase is absolutely nominal. We welcome the final move to increase the rates but want to point out that waste-pickers have lost out on this amount for a whole year and they still remain one of the cheapest waste collection fees for doorstep service in the country.”  A PMC official said, “The charges have been announced for benefit of citizens. We want maximum citizens to segregate wet and dry waste and hand it over to collectors separately.” The PMC announced the charges for citizens after elected representatives raised issues about overcharging for waste collection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/garbage-clearance-fees-to-be-paid-to-waste-pickers/articleshow/88230790.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||It’s about changing mindset, says Tharoor||Hyderabad: Congress MP and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor on Saturday said defeating the BJP government was no longer enough to change the mindset of a large section of Indians. He said their minds have been infected so much through social media that it goes beyond the process of merely acquiring power and retaining it administratively. “An equally efficient work needs to be done on social media to correct the perspectives that could change the nature of our country and public for a long time to come. What has changed in the last 10 years is the insidious role of social media indoctrinating the way people think and what they believe they know. In the past, a change in the government was enough as the new incumbent would set the agenda and discourse for the nation,” Tharoor said while responding to a query that right-wing politics was often blamed as the root cause for oppression of religious minorities. “People are getting a bulk of their information on WhatsApp, most of which is actually untrue about history, facts and figures. These kinds of things have actually begun to influence the way people think,” he said. From stating that Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP tie-up which was initially looked upon as an opportunistic alliance had gradually emerged as a successful model thwarting BJP’s ambitions to come back to power in Maharashtra and also providing good governance to the efforts being made to stitch up a formidable alliance of like-minded opposition parties at the national level to beat Narendra Modi-led BJP in 2024, Tharoor was at his eloquent best answering to questions at Gitam University, Hyderabad as part of its annual “changemakers” programme held on Saturday. Stating that the Congress in many ways was an embodiment of values, pluralism and democracy, he made it clear there was simply no common ground between the BJP and Congress on agendas such as a ‘Hindu rashtra’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/its-about-changing-mindset-says-tharoor/articleshow/88230788.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Pune||Kashmiri businessman hangs self in Ghorpadi||Pune: A 30-year-old businessman from Baramulla in Kashmir was found hanging from a ceiling fan in the first-floor room of his childhood friend’s home at Ghorpadi village on Saturday morning. The cause of his death is still being investigated, police said. “Based on the initial statement by his wife and friend, we suspect it to be a case of suicide. For now, we have registered a case of accidental death,” Bramhanand Naikwadi, senior inspector, Mundhwa police said. “The man, his wife, and their five-month-old-son had moved to Pune a few days back owing to extreme cold in the Kashmir valley. They were staying in the rented house of his childhood friend who works with a call centre,” Naikwadi said. He said, “The deceased runs a business of CCTV cameras and other electronic gadget installation in Baramulla while his father is employed with the public works department of the J&K administration.” The house where the incident occurred is a ground-plus-one structure. “His friend had gone out for some work and his wife (30) was in the kitchen on the ground floor. On returning home, his friend went to the first-floor room, but realised that the deceased was not responding to repeated knocks on the door. His friend then alerted people in the neighbourhood and together they broke open the door and found him hanging from the ceiling fan. He used a chaddar (bedsheet) to hang himself,” said Naikwadi. “We spoke to his wife and friend and they told us that the incident took place within a matter of 10 minutes. The couple had spoken with each other a few minutes before she left for the kitchen and he bolted the room from the inside,” the police said. “We searched the room looking for any note, but did not find any,” he said. Naikwadi said, “He got married about one-and-half years’ ago. We have informed his parents and they are coming to Pune.” “A preliminary post-mortem report stated ‘death due to hanging’ as the cause,” Naikwadi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kashmiri-businessman-hangs-self-in-ghorpadi/articleshow/88230796.cms||---

The incident left more than 100 passengers stranded and led to cascading delays for the private airline. SpiceJet finally accommodated the passengers on another schedule flight later in the afternoon, but not before irate passengers protested at the departure terminal. The incident began in the early hours of Saturday when flight SG476 was set to depart for Mumbai at 5.25am. After the passengers had boarded the aircraft and the flight was cleared for take-off, the pilots detected a snag and the aircraft, a Boeing 737-85R, was brought back to the apron. The passengers were asked to disembark and wait in the departure lounge till a replacement aircraft could fly in. “SpiceJet arranged an alternative aircraft in the afternoon to take the passengers but that flight unfortunately also had a technical issue. Those passengers could not be sent in the second flight also,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. Several flights operated by SpiceJet witnessed delays across the country, particularly Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bagdogra. “In the air transport sector flights are rescheduled, cancelled, delayed and diverted to other fields due to operational reasons and regulatory directions. They accordingly form its terms of carriage. We apologise for this experience,” SpiceJet said in a statement to passengers who took to social media to vent their ire. SpiceJet accommodated the passengers on a flight to Mumbai around 3.30pm but by then irate passengers had started creating a ruckus and demanding answers from the airline. Similar scenes were witnessed at Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. On Thursday, a Boeing 737 Max operated by Spice-Jet made an emergency landing at Mumbai following an inflight engine shutdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/flyers-stranded-for-10-hrs-as-spicejet-plane-suffers-snag/articleshow/88230791.cms||---

A door-to-door survey with a questionnaire to understand the socio-economic living standards of residents is being carried out. Ravaged by frequent sea surges and inundation, which led to residents protesting in large numbers against the lackadaisical attitude of authorities, the state government has authorized Kufos to adopt the coastal village and bring about an overall change in their livelihood. In the interim report submitted to the government, the university states that it was looking to bring in bioshields using mangroves and other plants in the region. Aquaculture and agriculture are the two aspects that are being looked into by the university. As part of the study, awareness programmes were conducted and different options of shore protection. Officials said that they would be working with the agriculture department and Kerala Agricultural University for revamping the agriculture sector at Chellanam. The report has also suggested re-establishment of canal and drainage systems by evacuating encroachers and unauthorized constructions, including those of the government. The report also suggested that efforts be taken to utilize the dredged sand for beach nourishment and heaps of sand near shore waters (Holland model) for coastal protection and depth abating of the shore line water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kufos-begins-survey-on-model-fishing-village/articleshow/88230267.cms||---
---||Pune||Be cautious, don’t panic over new variant: Experts||PUNE: The state’s Covid task force members and public health experts stressed on masking and vaccination but told people that they should not panic over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. They claimed that there was a need to be cautious after the detection of 32 cases of the new variant in the country though the patients’ symptoms were mild. The state task force member, Dr Shashank Joshi, said Omicron was still an understudy virus. “We cannot let our guard down for the next two months,” he said. He said currently, the cases were sporadic and travel-related. “We have to keep a close watch on any community transmissions, as happened in three countries now -- South Africa, Denmark and the UK. Also, there is a need to closely follow the outcome of hospitalisations, treatment in ICUs and deaths. Currently, all the trends seem to be reassuring though there is a threat of Delta being replaced by Omicron. But still it is premature to jump to any conclusions,” said Dr Joshi. On the same note, Dr Lalit Kant, former scientist and head (epidemiology and communicable diseases division) of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said it was too soon to comment conclusively about the transmissibility and the nature of disease caused by the new variant of the SARS CoV-2. “It would take about a month’s time for the global experience to emerge. Till then, everyone should be on alert and practice Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he told TOI. He said the preliminary reports gave an impression that it caused mild disease, but all precautions should not be thrown to the wind. “The infection is still around, and we need to be careful. Those who have not taken the vaccine yet should do so, and those who have taken the first dose but the second is due, should go for it,” he said. Everybody should be cautious about any new variant of concern and think about responses in different scenarios. “Vulnerable continues to be vulnerable. A small proportion of a large number will still be a lot of affected people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/be-cautious-dont-panic-over-new-variant-experts/articleshow/88230798.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||ICMR advises against third vaccine dose||Pune: The Indian Council of Medical Research has advised against suddenly introducing a third Covid vaccine dose or recommending any change in the time gap of Covishield shots in the wake of Omicron cases. Dr Samiran Panda, the head of the epidemiology department at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told TOI that as of now ICMR would underscore the importance of attaining greater coverage with two-dose vaccination. “With the Omicron cases being mild not only in India but world over, there should not be any kneejerk reaction like introducing a third dose or recommending any change in the interval of Covishield doses,” he said. Many states, including Maharashtra, demanded a booster dose, besides seeking shorter gap between two shots of Covishield to speed up the immunisation. “A decision on whether a third dose would be required for the immunocompromised individuals would be taken later based on scientific evidence and on case-to-case basis. Nothing has been decided on it so far,” Panda said. He said the scientific evidence of the booster dose for the Indian terrain was being evaluated and the technical advisory group would make an announcement regarding it. He said the public health focus should be on double vaccination and completing the adult immunisation drive as the two-dose vaccine plan seemed to be working well in the Indian context. On the demand to reduce the gap between the two Covishield doses, the ICMR scientist said the scientific evidence from in-country reality was showing that the interval was fine. He said the need of the hour was to appreciate the decision-making process followed in our country with public health priorities, involvement of community in ensuring the use of mask in public places and avoiding mass gathering. In contrast, virologist Dr Shahid Jameel said the Covishield gap should be reduced to 8-12 weeks from 12-16 weeks. A state health official said, “If the gap between two Covishield doses is reduced, we can speed up the vaccination of those awaiting the second dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-advises-against-third-vaccine-dose/articleshow/88230813.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Delhi||After brisk business during protest, Delhi-NCR vendors again stare at uncertainty||NEW DELHI: As the agitating farmers began heading home marking the end of the year-long protest at Singhu border, the local vendors were a disappointed lot. In contrast to the local traders whose businesses were affected by the sit-in, the crowd at the protest site formed a welcome customer base for vendors from Delhi and Haryana’s Sonipat. Clothes seller Chandra Bhan said he felt bad at the farmers returning home because his earnings had almost doubled due to the large number of customers among the farmers and visitors. “I sell clothes in weekly markets and barely earn Rs 1,000 per day. However, after coming to the Singhu border, my daily income almost doubled,” said Bhan. To add to that, he also got three free meals from the langar at the protest site, which helped him cut down his expenses. Sahil, a dhol-seller, said, used to sell his drums at Paharganj, but his business was badly hit by the Covid lockdown. “Even after the lockdown was lifted, there were hardly any customers. However, when I came to Singhu in December last year, my sales picked up and I covered up my earlier losses,” said Sahil, adding he had realised that the farmers will one day return home. Amzad Khan, who hawks clothes on his motorcycle at Singhu border, said he was feeling happy for the farmers who were returning home after a long struggle, but he would miss them much. “Every day, I come on my bike from Sonipat to Singhu border to sell clothes. Earlier I would go to different villages, but the protest site was profitable as my sales went up significantly,” said Khan. Similarly, footwear vendor Raju said, “I usually sell footwear at different markets in Delhi. In the past few months, being at Singhu did not make much of a difference in sales because the number of people had reduced. However, free meals helped me make up for the loss in income.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-brisk-business-during-protest-vendors-again-stare-at-uncertainty/articleshow/88231392.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

A wreath-laying ceremony was organized at the Hut of Remembrance in their memories at the academy. The ‘Hut of Remembrance’ (HoR) at NDA is a sublime cenotaph that commemorates the sacrifice of ex-NDA officers of the Armed forces who lay down their lives in the line of duty. The HoR’s book read, “Rarely a General goes with his boots on. General Rawat etched his name in the Hut of Remembrance at NDA as the senior-most soldier to die in the line of duty. That’s his glory.” General Rawat was an alumnus of the 53rd NDA course. He was from the ‘Charlie’ squadron and served the nation as the 27th Chief of the Army Staff (COAS). He rose to become the first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in January 2020. Commandant of the NDA Air Marshal Sanjeev Kapoor laid a wreath at the HoR on behalf of the NDA fraternity. All senior officials of the academy were present to pay their last respects to the departed souls. General Rawat’s NDA coursemate Lt Gen Satish Nawathe (retd), who served together in the northeast region in 2015, described him as an ‘extremely frank’ and ‘focused’ Army officer. “I was posted as the area commander then while Rawat was posted as the Corps Commander of III Corps headquarters at Dimapur in Nagaland. We met on several occasions and attended meetings together. He was articulate as well as very focused on what he had planned in the operational areas of the corps. Once we had dinner together at our residence in Shillong. He had a unique personality,” Nawathe told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nda-pays-homage-to-general-rawat-2-officers-killed-in-chopper-crash/articleshow/88230806.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Lucknow||Bone-rattling ride: No end to trauma on home stretch||Lucknow: More than 50 families living in and around Surendranagar near new high court campus are having a tough time for the past two months for just even entering their houses. As the District Urban Development Agency (DUDA) laying sewer pipeline network in the area, the roads are dug up. A TOI reality check found that even roads leading to houses were unusable. While people agree that the development work will improve civic amenities, they complained that construction should have been carried out in an orderly and planned manner. Most of them said that they have been confined to their houses because their entrance road is dug up. Some cannot even park their vehicles outside their homes. According to DUDA officials, the development agency had hired a private agency to lay a network of sewage pipeline in the area and build a permanent road network. Officials said the work started in October and was slated to complete by November-end, but stopped midway due to lack of funds. Now, work has resumed and would be complete by December-end. “The work is being conducted to overcome the situation of waterlogging. However, we are facing a lot of trouble to get our vehicles inside. The workers should have first installed the pipelines in and around the area before damaging our house slope,” said Brijesh Singh, a resident. Avinash Tiwari said, “The contractor should have made some temporary arrangements before removing the slopes in front of our houses. We are using wooden planks to move in and out from our houses. We also have to be extra cautious for kids and senior citizens, as they might get injured.” Mohammad Faiq added, “The suspension of my vehicle is taking a heavy toll while riding on these pathetic roads. Construction work has been going on for more than two months. ” DUDA project manager Arvind Singh said, “The repair work was halted for some reasons, but directives have been given to the private agency to complete the work within the next 10 days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bone-rattling-ride-no-end-to-trauma-on-home-stretch/articleshow/88231407.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The girl’s family wanted to take her to a dentist, who sought an RT-PCR negative certificate. The RT-PCR test revealed that she was Covid positive. A PCMC official said the respective zonal medical officers received notifications about the daily positive cases.  “The notifications are followed by tracing and testing of the close contacts of people testing Covid-19 positive. The same procedure was followed in the girl’s case,” the official said. Preliminary inquiry revealed that the girl had returned from Nigeria to the twin town a few days before testing Covid positive. “Four family members had tested negative in the first test, A second test was conducted on them and the results were ‘Covid positive’. All of them are quarantined at Jijamata hospital,” he added. “If an RT-PCR test reveals a Covid positive case, we visit the person’s home. Depending on the symptoms, we tell the patient to opt for either home or institutional quarantine. In the girl’s case, we conducted the RT-PCR tests of her close contacts. Five family members, including the two who had accompanied the girl from Nigeria to Pimpri Chinchwad via Mumbai, tested positive,” the official said. “We sent their samples to the NIV in accordance with the norms related to people returning from the nations categorized as ‘at-risk’ following the emergence of the Omicron. Among the family members testing positive for Omicron is an 18-month-old child. All of them are asymptomatic. A regular dose of multivitamins has been prescribed for them,” he said.

Called Pind California for Dr Swaiman Singh, a heart specialist from California who had started a free medical centre there, it was finally vacated on Saturday. Leaving behind a three-year fellowship in New Jersey, US, Dr Singh had camped at Tikri border for a year. “I learnt about the Punjab farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders and joined it thinking I would spend just five days there,” said Singh. But after reaching Tikri, I decided to stay on. With the help of some volunteer doctors, we started with free check-ups and medicines distribution. But when Covid struck the city, our role became crucial. We distributed masks, provided oxygen concentrators, and guided people in getting the right treatment when they showed Covid symptoms. We also helped the farmers get vaccinated.” Photo by Tarun RawatExplaining the name Pind California, Singh said that Punjab politicians often promised people civic amenities like those in the US state of California. “But such promises were never fulfilled. Here, we attempt to do so, keep the facilities clean and up to date,” said the doctor, who was born in Amritsar and moved to New Jersey with his parents at the age of 10. A resident of New Jersey now for 24 years, Dr Singh head the 5 Rivers Heart Association, which organises medical camps and distributes educational material. “On January 26, after the violent incidents, we treated the injured farmers as well as policemen.

---||Pune||Hallelujah! Open mall on Laxmi Road turns into carnival for shoppers||PUNE: For once on Saturday, between 11am and 4pm, a 400metre-stretch between Nagarkar Talim chowk and Umbrya Ganpati chowk on Laxmi Road looked absolutely transformed from a cluttered and congested mess to a paradise for pedestrians. The one-day initiative was the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s attempt at an open, pedestrianised “street mall” on the busiest shopping destination in the city. For ordinary shoppers, the experience could not have been less delightful, with a new paved road, brightly-painted surfaces, potted plants, and an overall carnival atmosphere, with well-spaced street vendors, next to high-street outlets selling knick-knacks, as well as cotton candy sellers doing brisk business. To them, it was space reclaimed from traffic. However, coming as it does in the midst of prevailing concern posed by the Omicrcon variant of the Covid-19 virus, there were murmurs about the timing of the initiative. Also, there were mumblings of discontent with complaints regarding heavier-than-usual traffic on adjacent streets, such as Kumthekar Road and Tilak Road. Also, there were complaints about heavy footfall during the day, especially on a weekend. “Honestly, I could not believe that this is Laxmi Road. This set-up should be done at least once or twice a month, especially during the festive or wedding seasons. Earlier, I would not think of bringing my children or my elderly mother here to shop, because it is so congested with traffic and parked vehicles. However, it has been really nice seeing chairs arranged for the elderly, and children having a wide and open road to enjoy,” said Arun Borde out with his family for some last-minute wedding shopping. Even for the ones who work at the many apparel and jewellery outlets on the stretch, the sense of freedom and the almost festive atmosphere was a welcome change. “This feels really good for us, with lack of cars and parked vehicles. Even though the number of people coming in are slightly less, those who visited our shop were in a happy mood,” said Sharda Bahingade, an employee at a jewellery outlet on the stretch. “The concept is not bad, but I have seen that less people have come to my outlet. Because this is a jewellery shop and my customers are concerned about safety, they prefer to drive up to the outlet and drive out quickly after making their purchase,” said the manager of a jewellery outlet on Laxmi Road. For the ones helping implement Saturday’s initiative, it was a starting point and a learning curve, but they received an appreciative feedback from the shopping public. “People effectively reclaimed their streets due to this measure. A lot of people have told us that this set-up was good for their children to enjoy, with wide-open street, and being able to move from one outlet to the other without having to dodge traffic. We are conducting surveys to figure out the footfall during the five hours. But this is still a trial phase. Not just global cities, but even other Indian cities have pedestrianised shopping streets. We are only just starting,” said Aditya Chawande, an urban designer associated with the thinktank Parisar, which helped the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) implement the open street concept.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hallelujah-open-mall-on-laxmi-rd-turns-into-carnival-for-shoppers/articleshow/88230820.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

---||Pune||Pune: Demand for smart appliances shoots up among working professionals||PUNE: Amid the festive sales last month, traders and industry experts noticed a greater demand for ‘smart’ appliances, artificial intelligence-incorporated household gadgets and virtual assistants. A leading air-conditioner brand initiated a nationwide poll recently to gauge the shift in the preferences of Indian consumers triggered by the pandemic. It revealed that in the home appliance segment, comfort, convenience, cooling, health and technology are priorities. Around 82% of the respondents felt smart home appliances can save time while preparing for festivities at home, while 55% said they considered buying these appliances during this festive season to manage household chores. Rajiv Bhatia, who purchased a washing machine online last month, said appliances now come with specific settings, such as for hard water, which ensures low internal damage. “Paying a little more while purchasing can prove beneficial in the long run. With a little bit of research, it is possible to find a product that meets the exact specifications wanted,” said Bhatia. According to Rakesh Shinde, an employee at an electronic store, customers prefer appliances with specific settings. “There is a high demand for washing machines with sanitising or allergen-free modes. For induction stoves and microwaves, many ask for expansive pre-set cooking modes for all types of cuisine,’ said Shinde. The poll findings echo these preferences. Around 52% of the respondents said they use the auto-cook option in microwaves to quickly prepare meals while 69% said they prefer a refrigerator that keeps food fresh for up to 30 days. At a brand store with multiple outlets in the city, an employee said that since the lockdown began, dishwashers have emerged as a popular new entrant in the consumer durables space. “Customers are do not mind the increase in price if the appliance comes with technological upgrades that will make simplify household chores and save time. Customers look for bluetooth compatibility and app support in case of appliances such as air purifiers and humidifiers, which have been in demand over the last year and are selling even more than air conditioners and coolers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/demand-for-smart-appliances-shoots-up-among-working-professionals/articleshow/88230842.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Pune||Pune-based techie fakes Canada visa to convince parents of job||PUNE: A city-based engineer, who had lost his job during the pandemic-induced lockdown, has been arrested on the charges of cheating and forgery after he made fake airline tickets and a Canadian visa to convince his parents that he has bagged a job in Vancouver. The 30-year-old software engineer from Aundh had lost his job with an IT company and was desperate to find one. He landed in police custody after security officers at the airport here found him moving around with forged Pune-Delhi and Delhi-Vancouver airline tickets and a fake Canadian visa on the evening of December 9. The officers later handed him over to the Airport police, who arrested him and registered a case of cheating and forgery on the basis of a complaint lodged by Arvind Singh (41), an officer with the Central Industrial Security Force that is in charge of airport security. The police have registered a case for offences under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), and 471 (knowingly using as genuine any forged document) of the Indian Penal Code. Preliminary investigation revealed that he had forged the airline tickets and visa by using his laptop, internet link and a printer. “The arrested man, a BTech graduate from a reputable college in the city, comes from an educated and well-off family. His father had retired as a senior engineer with a highly recognised tech company and his mother is a home-maker,” assistant inspector Milind Pathak of the Airport police told TOI on Saturday. “The man was working with an IT company that has an office in Pune. He lost his job during the lockdown between March and June, 2020. The techie was unemployed since then and his parents would put pressure on him to find a new job,” he added. Pathak said, “In his statement recorded with us, the techie said he wanted to see his parents happy. His plan was that after they see him off at the airport, he would leave the facility and go somewhere else in search of a job. He had already applied for jobs with a few companies, but was yet to get one. He then made fake air tickets and visa after conducting online searches of similar-looking documents, and managed to convince his parents that he has secured a job in Vancouver, Canada.” Around 4.30pm on December 9, his parents accompanied him to the airport to see him off and left the place after he entered the departure terminal building. “Like most passengers show printouts of the airline tickets, the guard at the departure entrance did not notice his fake ticket and let him in. But instead of proceeding towards an airline counter, he spent some time inside the terminal and then tried to walk out around 7.20pm from the same gate, catching the attention of the security officials. They checked his documents and spotted the forgery,” Pathak said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unemployed-techie-forges-ticket-visa-to-impress-parents-with-a-job-abroad-held/articleshow/88230840.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Currently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is working on two sets of CBDCs - one wholesale account-based and the other retail-based. "While crypto currency would be an asset class... I think CBDC is eventually going to transform how cross-border transactions take place...my reading is that it is only a matter of time , there is no way countries across the world can stay away from CBDC," Setty said while addressing participants at the ISB Leadership Summit 2021 on the 'Future of banking' here on Saturday. He pointed out that the introduction of CBDC is expected to throw up many questions such as - what happens to the intermediation role of the bank and also how it will impact the monetary as well as fiscal policies of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-digital-currency-to-play-key-role-in-cross-border-deals/articleshow/88232223.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana high court junks MBBS students’ plea on exam pattern||HYDERABAD: Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana high court dismissed a batch of petitions filed by MBBS first year students who were failed in their annual examinations and hence were retained in the first year. Students in their pleas contended that the National Medical Commission (NMC) changed the pattern of examinations from 2019 onwards and according to this new pattern, a portion of the questions should be in the form of multiple choice questions (MCQs). As many students could not cope up with the online class mode, the authorities should have included MCQs in the question paper. But unfortunately, the university authorities chose to skip MCQs and went in for complete descriptive mode, they said. “They did the same thing in the annual exam and also in the instant exam resulting in a huge failure percentage,” they alleged. The judge, however, did not agree with this line of thinking. “To give MCQs or not is the discretion of the university. Even the guidelines on the pattern of question paper issued by the Medical Council of India, now known as the National Medical Commission (NMC), are only advisory and not mandatory. Hence, we cannot direct the university to conduct a second supplementary exam for the failed candidates,” the judge said. Agreeing with Gorantla Pujitha, counsel for NMC, who said that the students came to court only after failing in the main and instant exams as an afterthought, the judge said that the failed candidates should have come to court immediately after they found that the pattern was not in tune with NMC guidelines. The judge also described skipping MCQs as a minor deviation. “It is not the case of the students that the questions given were not from the syllabus,” the judge said, while stressing the point that the students should be able to answer questions regardless of their form. The court also refused to give any direction to the university to grant five grace marks to each of the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-junks-mbbs-students-plea-on-exam-pattern/articleshow/88230844.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The flyover is expected to decongest traffic movement in the area and provide approach roads for easy entry and exit of local vehicles to and from the bypass. The Pune Municipal Corporation officials said that they intend to approach the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and the city traffic police to discuss a plan to divert the traffic flow at the bypass to assist construction of the flyover’s girder. An official from the PMC’s project department said, “We have expedited the project work following the ease of pandemic restrictions. The old bridge used by vehicles to cross the bypass will be replaced by a new flyover with a wider carriageway and capacity to cater to more vehicles. To launch the slab and other work, it is necessary to divert traffic for a few days. We are preparing a plan which will be discussed with the NHAI and traffic police department so that vehicular movement on highway is not affected.” The PMC is planning the work of launching of slab and related work from the first week of January. “The work will be initiated only after making necessary arrangements for traffic movement. As of now, it appears that adequate space is available for diversion of traffic without much disruptions. However, a final call is yet to be taken on it,” an official said. Civic officials said that they have expedited the work of approach roads, ramps and other facilities. Most land required for the project is in the possession of civic administration. The project was expected to be ready by November, however, pandemic restrictions led to the delay. “We are hoping for completion of the work by March or April next year,” a PMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pashan-sus-flyover-likely-to-be-ready-by-april-next-year/articleshow/88230848.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cyber police issues advisory over online work from home scams||MUMBAI: With an increase in work-from-home scams, cyber police have issued an advisory for citizens on do's and don'ts to keep their finances safe online. Work from home scams typically involve sending a text or WhatsApp message with a link to potential victims. The link is accompanied with an offer to work part time or full time and earn anywhere between Rs 9,000 to Rs 12,000 per day. On clicking the link, the victim is taken to a WhatsApp chat window with the cyber fraudster. After explaining a little, the fraudster sends across another link. On clicking it, a web page opens and the victim is asked to register on it. A fee is charged via QR coded messages. The victim is then sent a link to join a Telegram app chat where they are invited to invest in products such as jewellery, bags, masks, shirts etc., with e-commerce portals. They are told that every time they invest an amount, anywhere between 15% to 50% of it will come back to them for their own expenses. This amount gets collected into a virtual account. As the victim watches the returns increase virtually, they are tempted to invest more. Only when they are unable to withdraw the returns from the virtual account, does the victim realise that they have been duped. Police said all transactions occur via QR-codes. At times, fraudsters offer to help the victim empty their virtual account if they invest a little more. According to the police, several people were duped in such scams during the pandemic induced lockdown when many were looking for jobs. “Do not click any suspicious links received on WhatsApp or email. Be alert while registering online for jobs and sharing personal information. Never respond to messages from unknown senders on WhatsApp before verification. Never scan barcodes sent from unknown senders. If you have been added to a suspicious WhatsApp group, exit immediately and block the numbers. Do not fall for advertisements offering work-from-home opportunities without verifying their offers thoroughly,” the police advisory said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cyber-police-issues-advisory-for-citizens-on-online-work-from-home-scams/articleshow/88231454.cms||---

Elderly women flashed the victory sign as they danced, while other ecstatic farmers distributed fruits to people around and showered flower petals on their leaders. The locals stood by, capturing the scenes on their mobile phones as they waved goodbye to the protesters. Near the main stage of the protest, young farmers danced to folk tunes amid sounds of firecrackers bursting. By 12 noon on Saturday, almost all the temporary shelters had gone. People who remained were keenly looking for help to dismantle their dwellings of the past year and clear the way for motorists. Kartar Singh a farmer from Sri Muktsar Sahib, a district in Punjab said, “We fulfilled our promise and as assured, we cleared the site on December 11. We never had any intention to cause any inconvenience to anyone and jammed the borders only when the situation turned ugly and the government refused to hear us. The three anti-farmer laws could have ruined our futures, if implemented.” The farmers were scheduling their departures from Tikri to be able to be in time for the celebrations planned in their villages. “Folks back home are waiting to welcome us back. There will be elaborate celebrations and folk events in every village in Punjab and Haryana,” said Kalvinder Singh Soni, Pradhan of a village in Ferozepur district, Punjab. Wearing big smiles on their faces, the farmers declared that they held no grudges against anyone, not even the government. “We only request the central government now to finalise the minimum support price norms to benefit the farmers. This movement has proved that with unity and cooperation, one can achieve anything,” smiled Baba Tek Singh, a farmer from Sri Muktar Sahib, Punjab. The civic authorities also wasted no time in getting down to the task of clearing up the road after the farmers left. Labourers demolished the makeshift cement wall erected at the border around six months ago to stop the agitating farmers from entering the capital. The four barricades of cemented bollards, containers, fences and trolleys were all removed one by one by cranes under the supervision of the local police. A house made of mud and bricks with doors and windows located at the very start of the protest sites was also demolish soon after the farmers from Haryana vacated the area. On one side of Rohtak Road leading to Bahadurgarh Chowk from Delhi, sweepers cleaned the stretch and removed the accumulated debris in preparation for the opening of the road segment to the general public. “Though many farmers vacated the site and gave the stuff they weren’t taking back home to the locals and waste pickers, we need to clean the roads. There are big potholes at places and we will repair these in a day or two,” said a municipal worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kept-our-promise-say-farmers-leaving-tikri/articleshow/88231432.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Pune||Pune: Christmas Eve & New Year events put on hold in view of fresh strain||PUNE: Many clubs, bars, restaurants, hotels and event organisers are putting Christmas and New Year’s Eve events on hold in the wake of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. With a few Omicron cases found in the city, event organisers and venue owners are apprehensive about another lockdown being imposed during the peak party season of the year. The founder of an event management company in Pune said that last year, they suffered a loss of over Rs5 lakh as a Holi event had to be cancelled at the last moment due to the lockdown. “This year, we planned a New Year’s Eve party with guest artists but we are keeping it on hold till we get some clarity on the Covid-19 situation in the city; if there might be a lockdown or implementation of strict regulations, it might not be feasible for us to go ahead with the event,” said the company founder. Rohen Antony, another event organiser, feels that events may not be cancelled completely, but they preparing to wrap things up early, like last year. “Clubs are anticipating an early curfew in light of cases of the new strain found in the city, but till we get information on regulations through an official order, everything is on as usual. Event companies are hesitant to invest in hiring big artists as they are unclear about the travel restrictions and quarantine regulations,” said Antony. “We will wait for another week to decide whether to go ahead with the event and on what scale. If there are timing restrictions, early curfew and capacity is further decreased, then we will not be able to afford performances by outstation artists,” said a restaurant-club owner from Koregaon Park. DJ Yogesh Patil said more than artists, event organisers and venue owners, patrons will be scared to come out to parties if the situation deteriorates and there is another wave caused by the new strain. “The police are taking extra precautions and checking that all clubs and bars follow safety precautions and that they are not operating over the allowed capacity,” said Patil. Event managers and venue owners are also expressing concern over the panic among patrons ahead of the party season. “People go for parties in groups, mingle and have fun. With the panic caused by the new strain, people will not want to gather in groups or attend such parties. Patrons have been robbed of proper New Year’s Eve parties last year due to the early curfew, so they want to have fun this year,” said a bar manager from Balewadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/christmas-eve-new-year-events-put-on-hold-in-view-of-fresh-strain/articleshow/88230854.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

Coal production in Telangana-owned SCCL came to a halt on Thursday as the employees launched a three-day strike to oppose the Centre’s move to auction the four coal blocks,” he said in a letter to the PM.

---||Nagpur||Genome sequencing results of 3 positive international flyers awaited||Nagpur: All the three international flyers who had tested Covid positive are doing well at the AIIMS-Nagpur special ward where they were shifted nearly a week ago. AIIMS officials said the three patients have mild symptoms. As per protocol, their RTPCR samples have been sent for genome sequencing. The sequencing results will take some more time to come, they said. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said that the civic body too is taking a daily update of these patients. “No other flyer has tested positive. Another Sharjah flight is expected on Sunday morning,” he said. A 40-year-old man, a 39-year-old woman and her 9-year-old daughter had tested positive after NMC traced and tested people with recent foreign travel history amid the Omicron variant scare. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing on December 7, officials said. The man had returned from West Africa while the woman and her daughter are UK returnees. Till the sequencing results come, another RTPCR test will be performed on these patients on 10th day as per norms. The patients will be discharged only if they test negative. They would be completing the 10th day on December 14. It is not clear how many institutes are carrying out the genomic surveillance. The NMC has sent around 64 samples, including those of these three patients, for genome sequencing to Neeri’s environmental virology cell. The results are expected in a couple of days. But administrative officials claimed the samples were sent to NIV, Pune. Civic officials said that the state government has given directives to send the Omicron suspect samples through sentinel centre ,which is IGGMCH. Sources said that IGGMCH took over three days to forward the samples. While Neeri’s lab has facilitated genome sequencing of over 800 samples from Nagpur, results of those sent to NIV Pune or other centres have never been disclosed to even the sentinel centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/genome-sequencing-results-of-3-positive-international-flyers-awaited/articleshow/88230239.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Blunder got rectified, party morale now on a high, say Cong workers on Bhoyar||Nagpur: While the flip-flop over Congress’ MLC (local constituencies) Nagpur candidate Ravindra Bhoyar may have caused major embarrassment for the party, its cadres claim a “blunder has been corrected” leading to a high morale ahead of the civic polls. A senior Congress party leader, who did not wish to be identified, said, “I know what every media outlet is saying today, regarding Congress being ridiculed about the fiasco. It’s half true. Withdrawing Bhoyar’s candidature did make us look bad, but it was the right thing to do as far as the morale of the party cadre is concerned. Now the grassroot workers are feeling rejeuvenated that their voice is being heard by top leaders of the state.” Bhoyar was a surprise candidate and his profile was not something which inspired confidence among party cadres. A Congress corporator said, “Bhoyar’s candidacy was foisted upon us by the state party unit leaders. A hardcore RSS man with almost zero politcal clout in BJP gets the MLC ticket when Congress itself has a dozen worthy candidates. This was something that rubbed many of us the wrong way.” After Bhoyar being announced as an MLC candidate, several Congress party workers expressed their displeasure. Another Congress leader, whose name was on the probables’ list for the ticket, said, “Over the last 10 days, strong feedback started coming from our grassroot workers that a BJP man, who could not even bring a single corporator along, gets the ticket. That feedback came to corporators and ZP members and eventually to senior party office bearers. And it became clear to us that Bhoyar may not even get Congress’ votes, so cross voting from BJP side is out of question.” This feedback got intertwined with reports that Bhoyar was not being able to keep his side of the promise. A party functionary, whose family member is a corporator, said, “We saw no signs of any BJP corporator joining our party or giving signals that they may eventually do so. Ultimately all Congress corporators, regardless of which group they belong to in the city, started giving clear signals that Bhoyar won’t get their votes.” Party leaders told TOI that the decision to drop Bhoyar may appear like a “defeat”, but that’s not the case. “It was a blunder by one or two top decision makers, and it got rectified. In fact all different factions came together in Nagpur because they were united in their opposition to Bhoyar. Of course, Patole was left red-faced, but then as the state party president he has to take both the credit and flak for the decisions made,” said the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/blunder-got-rectified-party-morale-now-on-a-high-say-cong-workers-on-bhoyar/articleshow/88230864.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fateh march takes them back home from ‘home’ at Singhu border||NEW DELHI: Happiness was visible on the face of Kulveer Kaur, a widow, as she drove a tractor bedecked with colourful flowers back home to Patiala after a year-long protest at Singhu border. With two garlands around her neck, the 51-year-old said it was no less than a festival for her, having made just a single trip home in the past one year when she tested positive for dengue. Kaur was among the farmers who took out a fateh (victory) march as they left the Singhu border on Saturday. Hundreds of tractor-trolleys, small trucks and private vehicles rolled out of the protest site, loud music in the air. Sitting in the trolleys, men and women sang songs and loudly shouted Kisan mazdoor ekta zindabad. While some danced to Punjabi songs, others showered petals on each other. Nihang Sikhs performed sword fights during the procession to mark their victory. Driving a tractor-trolley loaded with mattresses, utensils and other belongings, 70-year-old Sukhwant Singh felt sad at leaving Singhu. “The year we stayed here seems like a few months. Time passed away so quickly. We got so much love from the people,” he said. His villager mate, Gurdeep Singh, added there was no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion and everyone came together to fight for justice. Gurmej Singh, who was part of the ‘fateh march’, triumphantly exclaimed, “A large number of tractor-trolleys are part of the procession. Many farmers left Singhu border early on Saturday but will join the processions at Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway to prevent traffic jams at Singhu.” The farmers were welcomed at different spots on their way home. At some places, langars and tea with snacks had been organised for them. Nihang Sikhs who left the border astride their horses said the day was special to them as it “marks their victory after a long battle”. Nihang Kripal Singh said, “We will take a halt at nights on our way to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which we hope to reach by December 15 to pay our obeisance there.” Though most of the farmers left the protest site at Singhu, some who are running langars said they will go home only in a couple of days. Jaspreet Singh of Patiala said, “We were able to create a small city at Singhu border in the past year and we cannot uproot it entirely in just two days. Many of the agitators have left, but some tents or huts are still standing and need to be dismantled.” His friend, Lakhwir Singh, added that they would continue to run the langar till all the farmers had vacated the protest site. The farmers who remained behind, having decided to go from Singhu in the next two days, said they would clean the area before leaving for home. Bhupinder Singh, a farmer, said Singhu border was their home for a year and they would not think of leaving a dirty home behind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fateh-march-takes-them-back-home-from-home-at-singhu/articleshow/88231450.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Kolkata||With highest Rs 2.4 crore offer, 1,600 placements, Kharagpur beats other IITs||KOLKATA: Be it the highest offers made, the number of students placed or the shortest time taken to achieve that, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, is right on top of all IITs this time. IIT-Kharagpur stunned the others in the chain when the highest offer of Rs 2.4 crore was made to a student. There is one more in the Rs 2 crore club and 20 more who have bagged offers beyond Rs 1 crore. The figures that were revealed by the institute at the end of the first phase of a 10-day period on Saturday showed that more than 22 students were in the cost-to-company (CTC) range of Rs 9 lakh to Rs 2.4 crore, out of which, more than 10 offers were made by domestic companies. The total number of international offers are more than 35. Naturally, the faculty and the students are celebrating, albeit virtually. The placements that concluded on Saturday were conducted online with the career development cell co-ordinating from the Kharagpur campus and the students joining the process from their homes at the designated times. The companies that hired also joined from their respective locations. The campus described this as the biggest satisfaction it got in the pandemic times. “The online system has worked wonders for our students. They were able to get groomed one-on-one by their mentors, so they were confident while facing recruiters. I also feel that the online regime has helped our students get the best internships, and hence, they got better exposure,” said A Rajakumar, the head of CDC. On Saturday, when the placements finally closed, 1,600 students were placed, which the institute described as a “historic record” since no other IIT has placed such a large batch. The institute was ahead of the other IITs in the race from the very beginning and completed placing the first 1,100 students by the third day of the process itself, much faster than any other IIT, confirmed Rajakumar. “We feel on top of the world. No one placed as many, as fast and as high as us this time,” he said, relieved that despite the pandemic, the recruiters have asserted their faith on the students. The Rs 2 crore-plus packages are international offers, whereas, of the 21 students who have bagged the Rs 1 crore-plus offers, 11 are domestic offers from companies like Graviton, Rubrik and Quantbox. The past-placement records were surpassed on Day One itself, when 235 offers were made. More than 100 companies offered on the first three days and they include names like Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, Uber, Intel, American Express, Honeywell, EXL, HUL, Graviton, Samsung, IBM, Quantbox, Accenture Japan, Rubrik, Rakuten Mobile, and others. This year’s placements have covered sectors like software, analytics, consulting, core engineering companies, banking and finance. The average number of hires per company has also increased this time, leading to an overall increase in the number of offers per day. Rajakumar drew attention to the fact that the institute had achieved a remarkable industrial relationship, witnessing more than 400 pre-placement offers this year, not to forget the 800 internship offers too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/with-highest-rs-2-4cr-offer-1600-placements-kgp-beats-other-iits/articleshow/88230313.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Swab of man back from Bangladesh sent for ‘O’ testing||KOLKATA: A second Omicron suspect — a 76-year-old from Duttapukur in North 24 Parganas who returned from Bangladesh via land border two days ago — was quarantined in a government hospital on Saturday after the swab collected at the border checkpost tested Covid positive. The sample has now been sent for genome sequencing to check if he is infected with the Omicron variant. On Friday, an 18-year-old girl returning from the UK was admitted to a private hospital for isolation and treatment after she tested Covid positive in the test done at the airport. Her specimen, too, is being analyzed to detect if the infection is by Omicron. The septuagenarian who is asymptomatic was transported to the Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital after the test results arrived late on Friday. Doctors said his condition is stable. He does not require oxygen support and is under conventional treatment. “The patient is admitted in the GB 3 male ward which has been kept ready to isolate and treat Omicron suspects. He will undergo all required treatment and will be closely monitored by our medical team,” said ID&BG Hospital principal Anima Haldar. The elderly man had visited Bangladesh to attend a social function in the first week of December and had returned to India via the Ghojadanga border on December 9. It was here that his swab samples were collected. The samples were then sent to the laboratory at College of Medicine & Sagore Dutta Medical College. When the patient’s Covid-19 report from the hospital reached the district health officials on Friday evening, Swasthya Bhawan was informed. Afer getting instructions from Swasthya Bhawan, a district health team picked up the septuagenarian from his Duttapukur home and took him to the Beliaghata hospital around 1am on Saturday. “The patient is asymptomatic. But he has certain comorbidities like hypertension and hypothyroidism for which he has been on medication for the past few years. The anxiety and insomnia had pushed up his pressure. This problem is being resolved with medication,” said pulmonologist Kausik Chaudhuri, nodal officer for Covid-19 at ID&BG Hospital. Like the 18-year-old, this patient, too, is fully vaccinated. The health department has put two members of his family under home quarantine. Their samples will be tested to find if they have contracted the infection. “He was in his home for about 18 hours on his return from Bangladesh. So we have to screen his family members for the infection,” said a health department official. This patient’s specimen will also undergo genome sequencing at the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics at Kalyani. Meanwhile, sources AMRI Dhakuria said the 18-year-old girl, currently at an isolated cabin, was completely fine. Her symptoms remain mild, which is only low-grade fever, cold and cough and is on a normal diet. She is allowed to speak to her family via video call. Sources said her fear and trauma has lessened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/swab-of-man-back-from-bdesh-sent-for-o-testing/articleshow/88230309.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Accompanied by AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan and senior leaders, Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy visited the site of martyrs’ memorial to check the status of construction. He said that the cost of the martyrs’ memorial project was escalated from Rs 60 crore to Rs 180 crore and that the TRS assigned the works to a contractor from Andhra Pradesh. “There are allegations that 6% commission on total cost of the project is being given to those involved in the scam and only an inquiry can bring the culprits to book,” he said. “KCR had accused Ap contractors of robbing Telangana. But now KCR himself is assigning all big projects to AP contractors,” he alleged. As per the original agreement and the extension given later, the construction of the martyr’s memorial should have been completed by December 31 this year. “But as on date, not even 50% of the construction has been completed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-demands-probe-into-martyrs-memorial-scam/articleshow/88230857.cms||---

Talking to TOI, former chief instructor of Special Forces Lt Gen Goswami said, “As a paratrooper there was no other appropriate way to pay respect and homage to CDS Bipin Rawat. I was a brigadier when I met Gen Rawat. He was sharp, polite and a determined officer of colonel rank,” said a septuagenarian who commanded the engineering battalion, the Sappers. Goswami was the captain of Para Field Company which participated in the Bangladesh liberation war. Major Gen (retd) Shiv Jaswal, who drove from Gorakhpur to Agra for the airdrop, said: “Our task was to capture enemy positions in eastern sectors. Since we were an engineer brigade, we also trained Mukti Bahini on how to use explosives and carry out ambush. Today’s jump was to commemorate fallen soldiers and CDS Rawat.” Col (retd) Thomas Kochappan (78) from Secunderabad, eldest among the four veteran paratroopers, said, “In the Bangladesh liberation we lost at least three paratrooper officers and a dozen others. Our commanding officer Col RP Singh was a father figure to me. He took three bullets before eliminating two Pakistanis, while Captain Ramdas charged with his weapon inside a bunker and killed Razakars before succumbing. Today’s air jump was to remember CDS Bipin Rawat and others.” On December 11, 1971, a successful airdrop of the Indian Army’s 2nd Parachute Battalion was carried out at Tangail. The battalion group, led by Lt Col Kulwant Singh Pannu, was tasked to cut off the retreat of the Pakistani troops from the north towards Dhaka. “Saturday’s airdrop was dedicated to our first CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, Madhulika Rawat and the soldiers and air warriors who lost their lives in the line of duty,” he said. Gen Rawat envisioned jointmanship amongst the services. The parachute jump today was marked by precise coordination between the Army and Air Force in the best spirit of jointmanship.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1971-war-veterans-dedicate-airdrop-to-gen-rawat-others/articleshow/88231446.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The accused tehsildar Khatke had sought the bribe for granting permission to excavate red soil for a brick kiln. A brick kiln owner had formally applied at the Bhadrawati tehsil office, seeking permission for excavation and transport of red soil necessary for making bricks. Khatke withheld the permission and sought a bribe of Rs25,000 to provide the licence for excavation and transport of soil. The kiln owner ostensibly agreed to pay the bribe, but filed a complaint with ACB Nagpur. Deputy police superintendent Yogita Chafle confirmed that tehsildar Khatke did indeed make a bribe demand and then laid a trap at tehsil office on Saturday. The complainant was sent to meet the tehsildar with the bribe amount. Khatke sought the bribe before a witness and took Rs25,000 from the complainant. Soon after the bribe amount was handed over, the lurking team of ACB Nagpur arrested Khatke with the bribe. Khatke had taken over the reins of the Bhadrawati tehsil office just two months back. His previous stint as tehsildar of Pombhurna had remained controversial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bhadrawati-teshildar-caught-accepting-rs25k-bribe/articleshow/88230880.cms||Mazhar Ali

The notice was issued to the professor for not turning up at a selection committee meeting. On Thursday, LUTA had given 24 hours to the authorities to revoke the notice. As the notice was not revoked, LUTA on Saturday decided to stage a week-long protest in two phases. In the first phase, which will begin from Monday, teachers will observe ‘Teacher Harassment Day’. Tuesday will be ‘University Act Defence Day’ and Wednesday ‘Save Lucknow University Day’. All teachers will take classes with a black band on their arm on all these days. In the second phase, LUTA and Lucknow University Associated College Teachers’ Association will jointly protest and stage a dharna at LU’s Saraswati Vatika on Thursday. On Friday, LUTA members will march from the university to the residence of deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma and submit a memorandum. On Saturday, teachers will march till Raj Bhavan. “We will not tolerate this injustice. If any teacher talks about the university Act or statute, will they be served show-cause notice? The dean arts had only questioned if the university Act was being followed,” said LUTA general secretary Prof Vineet Verma. He added, “If the notice is not taken back by Saturday, then from next week, we will be forced to boycott classes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-teachers-to-protest-all-week-with-black-bands-to-meet-dycm/articleshow/88231460.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid Care Network helpline flooded with calls on Day I||KOLKATA: It was a hectic first day first show at National Covid Memorial – Legal Aid Services, a project undertaken by Covid Care Network (CCN). The initiative is aimed at helping kins of those who died of Covid-19, with free legal services in matters related to Covid. Two helpline numbers have been launched where people can call and seek help. The numbers were flooded with calls on Friday with anxious family members of the deceased enquiring about how to go about claiming the ex-gratia amount that the government has announced for each family of people who died of Covid-19. TOI on Saturday had reported on the launch of the two helpline numbers. “Since morning, I have attended to more than 100 calls. While 80% of the callers wanted to know how and from where they can claim this ex-gratia amount, about 30% said they were facing hurdles in getting legal heir certificates,” said Arindam Das vice-president, CCN, and a practising advocate of Calcutta High Court. Each family of the Covid-19 deceased are supposed to get an ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000. A few days ago the Supreme Court came down heavily on those states that have a poor record of disbursing this amount. One of the documents needed for applying for this amount is a legal heir certificate. Sources said that such certificates are usually issued by local councillors. But with most civic bodies defunct/dissolved with elections due, callers to the helpline numbers said their councillors did not want to issue such certificates. These callers said it was tough for them to get access to MLAs or and MPs who could also issue them such certificates. CCN is planning to take this issue up with the state government’s relevant department in the coming week. The numbers of callers who dialled the helpline numbers and who could not get immediate answers to their queries on Saturday had their numbers noted down. The organisation said they will get back with solutions to their problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ccn-helpline-flooded-with-calls-on-day-i/articleshow/88230325.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Mumbai||‘Not pre-planned’: Mumbai court acquits man of murder||MUMBAI: Observing that death was caused due to the drunk victim’s sudden and grave provocation, as he clicked pictures of a female friend of the accused while they were sitting at Dadar railway station in 2016, a sessions court this week acquitted a 35-year-old man of the murder charge and found him guilty only on the lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Sentencing Kiran Gaikwad to five years of rigorous imprisonment, the court said that the incident occurred due to the trifle reason that the victim, Harish Pawar, was taking pictures of Gaikwad’s female friend. “It is not the case wherein accused has pre-meditated or pre-planned. It is not the case that there was any previous animosity or intention of the accused to cause the death of the deceased,” judge Urmila S Joshi-Phalke said. Gaikwad, a manager with a private firm, had punched and kicked the victim in the stomach inside a train compartment. Two hours later, the victim died.  The court also said that the district legal services authority should determine the quantum of compensation to be paid to the victim’s wife, Jaya, who was left to fend for herself and their two minor children. “This is a fit case wherein wife of deceased has lost her husband. She has to lead her life without support of anybody. The loss of family members of the deceased cannot be compensated in terms of money,” the court said. Among the nine witnesses cited by public prosecutor Vijay Malankar to seek the conviction of the accused was an eyewitness, Santosh Bhusara, the victim’s friend who was with him at the time of the incident. Two vendors from the railway platform were also witnesses. It was the prosecution’s case that on January 25, 2016, after finishing work, Bhusara and Pawarwent to CSMT at 2pm. They consumed alcohol and later boarded a train to Dahanu from Churchgate station. When the train halted at Dadar, Pawar took photographs of a woman sitting on the platform. The accused was present with the woman and was angered by Pawar’s actions. He entered the coach and assaulted Pawar, before leaving. Pawar could not get up and had difficulty breathing. When they reached Palghar, his friend Bhusara tried to wake him up. Pawar did not wake up, so Bhusara took him to the hospital, where he was declared dead. An FIR was then lodged. The accused was traced with the help of CCTV footage and arrested. He was later let out on bail. “The evidence, ie, analysis report of [victim’s phone’s] memory card shows photographs of the accused with one lady. Thus, because of which such incident has taken place is established by the prosecution by producing the evidence of analysis report,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/not-pre-planned-court-acquits-man-of-murder/articleshow/88231466.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Surat||Gujarat: Modi jackets dictates fashion trend at Hunar Haat||SURAT: The dominant flavour at the ongoing Hunar Haat fair was ‘Modi Jacket’ — a waistcoat popularized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has a specific cut in the collar. Such is its popularity that even Union minister for minority affairs, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi too was seen in the fair on Saturday donning Modi Jacket! Not only are multiple sellers stocking the jacket, a stall put up a tailor from Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, was selling only the specific winterwear. “We stitch and sell the special jacket. We call it a jacket, but people have many names for it. While Modi Jacket has become a popular name now, the same jacket was earlier called the Nehru or Jawahar Jacket,” Saddam Hussain, the Amethi tailor told TOI. Hunar Haat, organised by the minority affairs ministry, aims to provide a platform to artisans manufacturing traditional products. The fair at Vanita Vishram Ground will be inaugurated by Acharya Devvrat, governor of Gujarat on Sunday. In another corner of the fair, Abdul Habib from Chawdi Bazaar of Delhi had named his stall as Modi Jacket. “Anything that Modiji wears becomes a style statement. Hence, we have named this product as Modi Jacket. It has a specific cut in the collar that is comfortable to wear,” Habib said. The same style of jacket in wool was being sold by Sonu Pal, a seller from Haridwar in Uttarakhand, albeit with a different moniker — Sadri Jacket. “This type of jacket has been popular as the Sadri Jacket for decades. It is simply called Sadri in the UK and it is a must in every household,” said Pal. 300 sellers at fair The fair will continue till December 20 in the city wherein 300 sellers from across the country are participating. Besides traditional art, craft and textile, other items including perfume, crockery, toys and wood products and food from different states are being set up. “Hunar Haat fairs provided employment to over 7 lakh people. It is an attempt to give a platform to those who are preserving our heritage,” Naqvi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/modi-jackets-dictates-fashion-trend-at-hunar-haat/articleshow/88229777.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Patna||Rs 1.75 crore in cash seized from Vaishali labour officer’s house||PATNA: The Vigilance Investigation Bureau unearthed movable and immovable assets worth more than Rs8 crore disproportionate to the known sources of income of Hajipur block labour enforcement officer Deepak Kumar Sharma in simultaneous raids on his two locations on Saturday. The vigilance sleuths recovered Rs1.75 crore in cash, 988gm gold, including 15 biscuits and jewellery worth at least Rs 47.53 lakh and documents of 25 immovable properties worth Rs7 crore as per deed value, from Sharma’s two-storey private residence at Bajrangpuri Colony under Alamganj police station area in Patna City. The bureau sources said the worth of his disproportionate assets (DA) will increase above Rs10 crore after further scrutiny of papers seized. Sources said documents related to deposits in 42 bank and post office accounts also recovered during raids were yet to be examined. This is one of the biggest raids conduced in a disproportionate assets (DA) case in the last few years. The vigilance bureau had recovered Rs2.5 crore in cash during such a raid in 2019. Raid was also conducted at Sharma’s paternal residence at Chandmari Colony under Town police station area in Motihari, East Champaran. But sources said all recoveries took place from his Alamganj residence. Looking at the amount of cash and jewellery, the raiding team had to requisition a currency counting machine and a government certified evaluator at his Alamganj residence. Sources said the vigilance had registered a case against Sharma on Friday after preliminary inquiry in which his DA was found to be worth at least Rs1.06 crore. “The initial DA of Rs1.06 crore was calculated after taking into values of 12 immovable properties, including his Alamganj house worth around Rs2.33 crore as per deed value. During raids, the documents of 13 new immovable properties worth Rs4.66 crore deed value were recovered. This brings his rough value of DA after raids to Rs8 crore,” a source said. “Besides, papers related to investment in 14 separate life insurance policies, 17 debit and credit cards and documents of other investments were also seized. They need detailed scrutiny,” a vigilance source said. “The market value of his immovable properties is estimated to be ten times more than what has been calculated on the basis of documents,” a source said. Sharma entered into service in 1999 and his wife Seema Kumari is working with postal department. Sharma earned Rs70 lakh and his wife Rs 80 lakh from their salaries. Their total earnings were calculated at Rs1.69 crore and expenditure at Rs31.33 lakh. Against their estimated Rs 1.37 crore savings, the couple had movable and immovable properties worth Rs 2.44 crore and the vigilance lodged an FIR of DA worth Rs1.06 crore before procuring a search warrant against Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs1-75-crore-in-cash-seized-from-vaishali-labour-officers-house/articleshow/88230888.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The mini-truck fled after the accident. Sk Aryan received severe head injuries and died on the way to hospital. The cops have registered a case and are trying to trace the vehicle. A preliminary investigation fixed the blame on a number of issues. While the dangerous driving by the truck driver was the primary concern, cops said the unplanned elevation of the bump along with cyclists not using reflectors at night have also been identified as possible reasons behind the incident. A stretch of the road is also not properly lit, claimed the local cops. The victim’s father Sk Jamshed and mother Rehana Bibi are daily wage earners. Aryan was the youngest of four children. Their eight-year-old daughter Ruksana was unwell and the three had gone out to buy medicine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-yr-old-falls-off-cycle-crushed-by-mini-truck/articleshow/88230334.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

On Wednesday, ED conducted searches at four premises related to office bearers of PFI in Kerala, including the residences of Shafeeque Payeth, a PFI member based in Kannur, Abdul Razak BP, PFI divisional president of Perumpadappu at Malappuram, Ashraf M K at Muvattapuzah in Ernakulam and the office premises of Munnar Villa Vista Project at Mankulam in Munnar. “The seized documents indicate the money laundering activities of PFI through various projects in Kerala, including the Munnar Villa Vista project which is being built by the PFI leaders to launder proceeds of crime generated in India and abroad,” the ED said in a press release on Saturday. The agency further said its investigation from the seized documents have revealed acquisition of foreign properties by PFI leaders, including a bar and restaurant in Abu Dhabi. TOI sought comments from PFI’s senior leader Prof P Koya who refused to comment on the searches and ED claims. The ED has accused PFI leaders of an attempt to “disrupt the search operations”. The ED officers, assisted by a contingent of CRPF, conducted the search operations successfully and seized incriminating documents, digital devices and evidence related to foreign funding and acquisition of properties abroad, the ED said. Last year, after a series of raids on the organisation and its functionaries, the agency had questioned top office bearers at ED headquarters in Delhi. The interrogation included Parvez Ahmed, PFI’s Delhi unit president, Shahid Abookacker, trustee of its Rehab India Foundation (RIF), Abdul Muqeet, PFI Delhi secretary, Remiz Muhammed, general secretary of RIF, Anis Ahmed, national secretary of PFI, Afsel Chandrankandy, secretary of RIF and KP Jaseer, PFI’s national headquarter accountant.

Moreover, a government spokesperson said, tehsil and development block headquarters are also being connected by two-lane wide roads. “The government has worked to reduce the gap between the village and the city by connecting main roads with link roads to villages. This has reduced migration from villages and also improved employment and development in villages. Farmers have easier access to godowns as well,” said the spokesperson. Public works department data shows that about 1,557 revenue villages are getting a network of 1,763-km long roads at a cost of Rs 1,114 crore. More than 1,546 revenue villages have already been covered with 1,740.24 km of roads. The government has also released Rs 1,407 crore to connect 2,275 habitations out of which 1,717 habitations have already been linked with 2,173.60 km of roads. “Under the chief minister’s Samagra Gram Vikas Yojana, work has been completed on a 29-km long road for 33 revenue villages at a cost of Rs 14.35 crore.

"It has made people say 'farq saaf hai (the difference is clear)'," he said, tossing up a catchline for the party's campaign for the 2022 assembly elections. Inaugurating the Saryu Canal scheme in Balrampur, a project on which work originally started in 1978, the PM used "farq saaf hai" to emphasise that BJP had completed projects that previous governments had slept over and that the party, in the process, had made life easier for the people by cracking down on the mafia and empowering women. "I have seen the work of many governments, and in this long time what upset me the most was the misuse of the country's time, money and resources. This same thinking also delayed the Saryu Canal scheme," the PM said, stressing on the cost escalation to remind people that they should not forgive those who caused such a massive loss to the state and the public. Work on this project started about 50 years ago, the PM said, when its estimated cost was less than Rs 100 crore. Now, its cost is Rs 10,000 crore, he added, saying that not only did its cost escalate 100 times but had it been completed on time, it would have brought much needed relief to farmers about 20-30 years ago. In a veiled attack at SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, Modi said that he was expecting a tweet from an opposition leader claiming credit for the ribbon-cutting of this project also, adding that previous governments are concerned only with ribbon-cutting whereas the current double-engine government of UP believes in completing projects on time.  The PM said that after Yogi Adityanath became CM long-pending projects, like the Ban Sagar scheme, Arjun Sahayak Nahar, Gorakhpur AIIMS, and Kushinagar airport, etc., were launched. Referring to Yogi as an energetic, dedicated and popular CM, the PM said that the previous government used to protect the mafia but now the Yogi government was carrying out a campaign to clear the state of the mafia. "UP daughters used to think 100 times before moving out of their homes earlier. Now criminals think 100 times before committing a crime; earlier daughters used to sit at home, now the criminals are sitting in jails in fear," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farq-saaf-hai-pm-inaugurates-78-project-slams-past-up-govts/articleshow/88232238.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Sabarmati banks laden with toxic heavy metals, says study||AHMEDABAD: For almost three decades, the use of industrial waste water for irrigation to grow vegetables has contaminated the soil with heavy metals. There are 43 villages along the Sabarmati downstream from the Vasna-Narol bridge that use “untreated” waste water. A study published in January 2021 by researchers from the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram; Physical Research Laboratory, SAL Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad and PDEU, Gandhinagar, found that soil samples from a few villages had high levels of metal contaminants, which exceeded WHO and Indian standards. TimesViewIn 2018, the state government brought out a waste water policy for municipal corporations across the state concerning reuse of municipal treated sewage for irrigation and industrial use. the policy, however, does not lay down standards for heavy metal contamination, quality of waste water before it is disposed of, and frequency of quality monitoring. the state government should keep in mind wider public health implications in the use of waste water.Soil samples closest to and farthest from the point-of-discharge near Vasna-Narol bridge, Gyaspur and Khada, respectively, were more alkaline. At Saroda, almost 20km downstream, the soil was acidic, the study reported. Now when the researchers tested eight soil samples from various villages, the concentration of metals such as zinc was 421 microgram per gram of soil, while in the case of manganese it was 336. Copper was 201, chromium, nickel was 51, lead 42 and cobalt 9. In all, the study claimed that almost all heavy metals were found in concentrations twice the permissible limit according to WHO and Indian standards. “A closer analysis of the soil data reveals that all the metals exceed the upper limit of WHO or European Union standards,” states the report. The researchers were Bibhabasu Mohanty, Anirban Das, Reema Mandal and Sukanya Acharyya from PDEU and SAL Institute of Technology, and Upasana Banerji was representing PRL and NCESS, Thiruvanthapuram. The study further added, “Among the eight soil samples, the sample collected from Gyaspur had the maximum concentration of all analysed metals compared to other sites. Gyaspur is where effluents from the Vasna treatment plant get disposed off, which leads to maximum accumulation of these metals in agricultural fields compared to all other sites.” The study suggested that there be efficient treatment of wastewater and monitoring of heavy metals in vegetables to understand the risks associated with the use of such water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sabarmati-banks-laden-with-toxic-heavy-metals-study/articleshow/88230909.cms||Paul John

DCP (traffic) Arijit Sinha said they have slapped culpable homicide not amounting to murder charges against Bapi Roy (28). Times ViewYet another life has been lost in an entirely avoidable manner. The guilty must be brought to trial followed by prosecution. A sustained crackdown, accompanied by re-education and sensitisation, is in order.“We raided a few places for Roy, a resident of Chak Raju Molla in Pailan, and arrested him from Thakurpukur around 12.35pm,” said Sinha. The cops told the court they want to interrogate Roy on why he overtaking was in such a fashion. “The accused has been sent to police custody till December 15. Apart from a mechanical test of the bus, we will investigate if there was any provocation by the conductor, too. If proven correct, appropriate legal action will follow,” said an officer, adding that they want to make an example out of the case. Cops said this was the sixth time this year where the stringent IPC 304 (II)/279 was slapped instead of the usual IPC 304A/279 in fatal accidents. “All severe cases where there is evidence of dangerous driving leading to accidents will be investigated by the fatal squad,” Sinha said. “We will be focussing on those violating the signal, those talking on phone while driving and those engaging in lane violations,” said an officer. The police also spent Saturday trying to inculcate better traffic habits among bus drivers, pedestrians and two-wheeler riders. “We challaned the jaywalkers and counselled them. Special drives on lane driving, too, were initiated from 11.30am. The idea is to show the violator at the spot where he or she is going wrong,” said an officer.  “Four friving licences were temporarily suspended for rash driving on Bypass on Saturday,” another officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bus-driver-held-a-day-after-running-over-woman/articleshow/88230338.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kochi||Chopper crash: Kerala bids tearful adieu to JWO Pradeep Arakkal||THRISSUR: The mortal remains of Junior Warrant Officer (JWO) Pradeep Arakkal, who died in the Mi-17V5 helicopter crash on Wednesday in which India's first Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat also lost his life, were consigned to flames on Saturday with full military and state honours at Ponnoorkkara near Puthur in the district. Thousands of people from various walks of life thronged the government higher secondary school, Puthur to pay their last respects to the departed junior warrant officer, who had studied in the same school, after the body was brought there in the afternoon. A large number of people had also assembled at Pradeep’s house at Ponnoorkkara, despite persistent efforts to reduce crowding in the small residential compound. A team of about 70 IAF officials led by Air Vice Marshal B V Upadhyay VM had come to Thrissur to take part in Pradeep’s funeral. Even when tearfully paying their last respects to the brave member of IAF who lost his life while performing his official duty, many of those assembled appeared to be sharing a sense of pride. This pride seemed to stem from the fact that a youth from a humble background and remote village could rise to the stature of being selected to be part of the helicopter crew accompanying the chief of defence staff. The only assets that Pradeep who is the son of a small farmer possessed to get elevated to this stature were his dedication, hard work and pleasing nature, recalled some of those who had assembled. There were several particularly moving moments during the funeral. One such occasion was when Pradeep’s ailing father Radhakrishnan was brought near his son’s coffin. Radhakrishnan, who was on artificial oxygen support at home, was informed about the death of his son only on Saturday. He was seen trying hard to control his sobs. His agony was further aggravated when he realised that he couldn’t even see the face of his son as the coffin was not opened and was taken to the funeral pyre. Radhakrishnan made one of his relatives lift Pradeep’s two-year-old daughter Devaprayaga so that he can give a kiss on her cheeks. “It is an irreparable loss to the family, but Pradeep died while working for the country and we have to bear it,’’ Radhakrishnan later told the relatives. Most of those present were unable to control their tears and looked away when Pradeep’s seven-year-old son Dakshindev lit the funeral pyre. The boy was seen shivering apparently because he was in wet clothes as part of rituals and was evidently obeying the instructions without knowing their full significance. Pradeep’s wife Sreelakshmi was sitting near the coffin in a numb state. His mother Kumari wailed as she bowed before the coffin. Prasad, the JWO’s brother, was seen trying hard to control his emotions as he was partaking in the funeral rituals holding Dakshindev. Even though hundreds of people had thronged to watch the funeral, a pin-drop silence prevailed when final rituals began. Earlier, the body was bought from Delhi to Sulur on a special aircraft. Union minister of state V Muraleedharan had accompanied it. The body was received there by Thrissur MP T N Pathapan and was brought to Thrissur via road. Ministers K Rajan, K Radhakrishnan, K Krishnankutty and R Bindu as well district collector Haritha V Kumar and city police commissioner R Aadithya were among those who received the body at the state border Walayar. Hundreds of people had lined up on the sides of the road to pay their last respects to Pradeep, as the funeral procession proceeded to Puthur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chopper-crash-state-bids-tearful-adieu-to-jwo-pradeep/articleshow/88230899.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Lucknow||UP: BJP taking credit for work done by our govt, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Putting a spin to the ruling BJP’s ‘Farq saaf hai’ (difference is noticeable) campaign, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said UP presently has a kanchijivi government which takes pride in cutting ribbons (inaugurating schemes) of projects of the previous SP regime. He said the SP delivered the projects that it started when it was in government and this difference was noticeable (farq saaf hai). “There are two types of people in the world. One who believes in working for the people’s welfare and others who only believe in taking credit for the work done by others. This difference is noticeable between the SP which belongs to the first category and the ruling kanchijivi BJP. Hence the BJP will be wiped out in the 2022 polls,” he said. Akhilesh’s ‘farq saaf hai’ jibe came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a public meeting after inaugurating the Saryu canal project in Balrampur, lambasted the opposition (read SP) for leaving the project incomplete for the last 40 years and how it was completed by the ruling BJP in last four years adding: “Farq Saaf hai” - the tagline of a campaign launched by the BJP to explain how the Yogi government in UP was better than those led by the opposition parties. “The SP government gave laptops to youths, ruling BJP gave them lathis when they asked for jobs – the difference is noticeable ... The SP government came up with a 1090 police helpline for women, BJP failed to curb crime against women … The SP gave free irrigation and Lohia Awas to farmers, BJP mowed down farmers … The SP gave metro trains, the BJP only made promises to start metros trains … The SP honoured women with RanI Laxmibai Awards, the BJP got sarees of women pulled off during panchayat elections,” he said, ending every sentence with “Farq saaf hai”. He went on to state that SP government provided land for AIIMS at Gorakhpur, while BJP had tried to scuttle it as one of its party members moved a PIL before the high court raising objections over it. “The BJP government knows the extent of work that was done during the SP regime under the Saryu canal project and for once the government has not denied it,” he said in a press conference at SP headquarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-taking-credit-for-work-done-by-our-govt-says-akhilesh/articleshow/88231483.cms||Pervez Siddiqui
---||Goa||Goa: Guirdolim, Chandor locals confront railway officials over filling of Nagozon lake||MARGAO: Tensions ran high at Guirdolim and Chandor on Saturday after a group of villagers confronted officials of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) over the work of filling of Nagozon lake and low-lying paddy fields for the double-tracking work. They stopped trucks carrying mud. Villagers accused RVNL of intruding on private properties without acquiring the land or without any authorisation. When an RVNL official argued that the land has been acquired, villagers demanded that relevant documents be produced. This escalated the dispute and led to police intervention. “Church authorities have objected to the work being carried out in its property. The matter is before the court of the deputy collector, Vasco, which is hearing the objections. We are awaiting the order pertaining to the matter. In any case, the Railways have no right to fill lowlying fields and water bodies. The Railways have filled the lake and low-lying paddy fields within just two days,” Agostine Antao, chairperson of Guirdolim Biodiversity Management Committee, told TOI. Antao, along with several villagers, has lodged a complaint against RVNL officials over the incident with the Maina Curtorim police. They have urged police to take action in the matter and to ensure that the water body is restored. Villagers are apprehensive that filling of the lake will block the natural flow of water into the Kushavati rivulet leading to the submergence of Folli ward during the rain, thus posing a threat to mudwalled houses of the ward. Following a similar incident nearly two years ago, the South Goa district collector had directed the railway officials that the mud be cleared and water flow restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/guirdolim-chandor-locals-confront-rly-officials-over-filling-of-nagozon-lake/articleshow/88231507.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BJP 'red-faced' as ruling, oppn MLAs corner govt over breach of privilege motion||Dehradun: The incumbent BJP was caught in an awkward situation as the issue of “taking no action” in matters of breach of privilege motion was brought to the notice of the House by legislators. The issue was raised by Congress MLA Qazi Nizam-ud-Din, who claimed that government had misled the House by giving wrong data on employment. Soon after, three BJP MLAs – Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion, Deshraj Karnwal and Rajesh Shukla – also came forward, claiming that the breach of privilege motion notice brought by them has been lying in abeyance. Champion even entered the well of the House and Shukla denied sitting down till the time a firm stand was taken. Congress legislators Manoj Rawat, Mamta Rakesh and Harish Dhami also raised their notice on breach of privilege motion, which they said was pending for a long time. “If the rights of MLAs are not safe and no action is taken against officials who have shown disrespect to us, then how can we safeguard the rights of others,” Shukla said. The House was adjourned twice. Deshraj Karnwal has warned to stage a protest in the state secretariat on Monday if a decision is not taken on his notice. The Uttarakhand assembly has a committee to look into the matters of breach of privilege motion and it is headed by Deputy Speaker Raghunath Singh Chauhan. Interestingly, Chauhan – who was heading the proceedings on Saturday in the absence of Speaker Prem Chand Aggarwal in the first half of the day -- himself had earlier moved a breach of privilege motion. “I would like to know the name of other members of the committee as without their report, it is not possible for the government to act in such matters. I doubt whether the matters of breach of privilege motion have been moved to the committee. And, if they have been, then what has been the development in these matters,” said Shukla, adding, “I would like to request the House to direct state government for a timebound action in all matters.” Deputy Speaker informed the House that legislators Furkhan Ahmed and Rajkumar Thurkral were among the members of the committee. On which, Ahmed denied having any information about his role in the committee. After hearing the views of the legislators, Deputy Speaker directed the state government to act promptly in all matters. Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh said, “This is not an issue of any party. Here even the chairman of the committee has moved a privilege motion and even his voice is unheard. I do not want to say anything against the Chair but it is shocking that all these matters related to legislators are lying pending for years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-red-faced-as-ruling-oppn-mlas-corner-govt-over-breach-of-privilege-motion/articleshow/88230341.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to sources, Patel returned from Delhi with women MLAs from Gujarat and Gujarat assembly speaker Nima Acharya on December 6. On her return, she had got fever which was diagnosed as dengue. She was treated at a hospital in Mehsana for two days but as her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to Zydus Hospital on Friday.

---||Kolkata||After edu campus reopening, boipara roars back to business||KOLKATA: Almost a month after campuses across the city reopened for offline classes after a gap of 21 months, sales of books and stationery in College Street’s boipara have surged, offsetting a portion of severe losses traders incurred during the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown, when educational institutions remained shut and classes shifted to the online mode. Other landmarks in and around the boipara, like the Indian Coffee House, Paramount, Food Junction and other eateries that depend on students and teachers from colleges and schools in the vicinity and those coming to boipara to purchase books have registered higher footfalls converting to sales. According to traders, examinations of some of the main school boards, internal examinations in schools and colleges and announcement of competitive examinations have led to a surge in sales of books, reference materials, exercise books and stationery. “Sales have gone up by almost 35% to 40% since colleges and schools reopened in the middle of November. CISCE and CBSE had already announced the dates of semester exams, so parents and students started purchasing reference books and stationery. Many students had not bought books and started only after the announcement of the reopening dates. Several colleges and universities, too, have started conducting their internal examinations, which has contributed to the sales,” said Pratap Das, secretary of the Sir Ashutosh Booksellers’ Association. The pandemic-induced lockdown and Amphan dealt a cruel blow to boipara last year, destroying books worth crores and damaging several stalls. “In online classes, everything was on the devices and students had stopped purchasing notebooks and pens. But now, with several boards conducting examinations and offline classes resuming in many colleges and schools, people are purchasing stationery and exercise books,” said Tarak Mondal of Central Stationery Store. Indian Coffee House, which reopened a few months ago after it was shut down during the second wave earlier this year, too, has started witnessing a full house in the past few weeks. “Most of our customers are students and teachers from several colleges and universities. Before campuses reopened, we would get only 50% of the crowd. But now, it’s a full house every evening,” said Tapan Kumar Pahari, secretary of Indian Coffee Workers Co-operative Society Ltd, which runs the Coffee House. College Street, where boipara is situated, was at the heart of Bengal’s renaissance with its leading lights Vidyasagar, Rammohan Roy and Rabindranath Tagore walking the iconic stretch steeped in history. It transformed into a hub of modern Bengal’s culture, education and ideology with several iconic institutions like Calcutta University, Presidency University, SanskritUniversity, Medical College, Hindu School and a War memorial inside College Square.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-edu-campus-reopening-boipara-roars-back-to-business/articleshow/88230343.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Pune||Maharashtra: 10 men assault driver, damage car for applying sudden brakes in Pimpri||PUNE: A verbal duel, resulting from a car driver applying sudden brakes to avoid a stray dog getting hit near Kalewadi bridge in Pimpri, led a 10-member group of men to assault him and damage the windscreen of his car around 11.15pm on Thursday. Wakad resident Nitin Shravan Patil (46) had to apply sudden brakes on spotting a stray coming in front of his four-wheeler, forcing the group right behind his car in five to six motorcycles to halt suddenly. A verbal exchange ensued and soon took a violent turn, as the group members abused, slapped, and punched him before damaging the front and the rear windscreens of the car using rods and stones. On Friday morning, Patil lodged a complaint with the Pimpri police for offences under sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentionally insults) and 427 (mischief) of the Indian Penal Code. The police cited the complaint and said, Patil was returning home from his brother’s house in Pimpri in his car. As he approached the Kalewadi bridge, a stray dog crossing the road came in front of his vehicle, prompting Patil to immediately slam brakes. The group of bikers behind him also had to apply brakes. Some of them questioned Patil if he knew how to drive a car and this led to an altercation, the police said. Before Patil could say anything, two men grabbed him and three others slapped and punched him, the police added. “The other men then damaged the front and rear windscreens of Patil’s car with stones and rods,” police said. A senior police officer told TOI, “The exact spot where the incident occurred does not have CCTV surveillance. We are scanning CCTV footages of other establishments in the vicinity to identify the assailants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-men-assault-driver-damage-car-for-applying-sudden-brakes/articleshow/88230907.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: NGT panel to study impact of blasting in quarries||NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a seven-member joint committee to study the impact of blasting in various stone quarry sites in Kerala with nonel detonation technology at distances of 50m, 75m, 100m, 125m, 150m, 200m and 250m. Nonel is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. The study will include the impact caused by vibrations on different soil strata or earth profile in the area, and noise and air levels, building human and wildlife. The study may be completed within three months and report furnished within four months, NGT said in an order dated December 9. Due to topography of the state, longer distance will obstruct the legitimate mining activities in violation of sustainable development principle. With the use of nonel detonation technology, 50m distance is adequate and does not cause any adverse impact, the tribunal added. The members of the joint committee comprising Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Indian Institute of Mines or IIT, Dhanbad, CSIR — Central Institute of Mining & Fuel Research, Dhanbad, CSIR-Central Building Research Institute, Roorkee, IIT Roorkee, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, and directorate general of mines safety will be coordinated by the CPCB. The committee may undertake visit to the relevant sites and except for such visits, conduct proceedings online if necessary. The committee will be at liberty to take assistance from any other expert or institution. The NGT’s order came while dealing with mining leasees undertaking quarry mining at various locations in Kerala which also involves blasting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ngt-panel-to-study-impact-of-blasting-in-stone-quarries/articleshow/88230914.cms||---

The party claimed that it would beautify all wards, especially those in rural areas, alleging that these had been ignored by the BJP and Congress. Addressing a press conference at Press Club on Saturday, AAP senior leader and Rajya Sabha MP Shushil Gupta said like they did in Delhi, AAP would provide 24x7 electricity, water and free health services to Chandigarh residents. He was accompanied by MP (Rajya Sabha) N D Gupta and AAP Chandigarh president Prem Garg. He assured that the party would not impose hefty taxes but would make world-class schools and hospitals in the city. “Parking is a major problem in the city; when AAP gains power in the MC; proper parking arrangements will be made not only in markets, also in residential areas,” said Gupta. Rajya Sabha MP N D Gupta credited AAP with introducing the politics of good governance in Delhi. He commended the new model of education in the capital saying that it would make students job providers instead of job seekers. Gupta said while the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation is hard-pressed for finances, the Delhi government managed additional savings every year. He also urged people to ensure the victory of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Speaking on the occasion, Prem Garg said that the biggest problems faced by the city included those of dumping ground, garbage collection and Lal Dora. He accused BJP and Congress of failing to resolve these issues during their tenure. If AAP comes to power, he said, the issues would be resolved on priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-taxes-only-devp-if-aap-comes-to-power/articleshow/88230349.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Birbhum peanuts seller, online sensation, hawks for votes in Kolkata||KOLKATA: From the obscure terrains of Dubrajpur in Birbhum to hobnobbing with political leaders and celebrities in the city, internet sensation Bhuban Badyakar — better known as the peanut-man — is now the hot property for every political party that are wooing him to be with them to use his popularity in their campaign. In the last two weeks, the biggest thing on social media has been a Bengali song called ‘Kacha Badam’ (untoasted peanuts) which has gone viral and has been making rounds on Facebook stories, YouTube, Instagram reels and Twitter. The creator of the song, Bhuban Badyakar, is a peanut seller from Kuraljuri village in Birbhum’s Dubrajpur who has been topping the charts with a number of celebrities talking about him and sharing his songs. The sudden popularity had hit Badykar hard initially but with more offers, he claims to be adjusting himself to celebrity status. “I am overwhelmed to find so many important people willing to be with me and hear my song. This is only my second visit to Kolkata ever and I am glad that I have been called here as a musician this time. My life has gone topsy turvy in the last one week. At times, the attention is getting painful but I am hoping for a better future for my family and me banking on my music,” said Badyakar, who was attending two political rallies in Kolkata on Saturday, one by Madan Mitra and another with ward 14 candidate Amal Chakraborty. Since his internet fame, a number of political parties had been making a beeline outside his home. BJP was the first to capitalize, sending senior leaders to his home but Trinamool didn’t lag behind as they lifted him from his home and brought him to Kolkata to campaign for their candidates. “I always wanted to become a singer and in my young days, I was also part of a Baul group. But while taking care of the family, I somehow couldn’t pursue singing as a career. But I never quit singing. I used to hum while working as a mason or while selling vegetables or peanuts. A few months ago, a scrap dealer in Dubrajpur told me that scraps like broken cell phones, human hair or old imitation jewellery sell at a good price. I thought of buying those from locals in exchange of peanuts and stitched a song. I never knew people would love it so much,” said Badyakar. Few weeks ago, one buyer recorded him singing and uploaded it on social media. The song is now everywhere. “I always appreciate raw talent and that is the reason I brought him as part of a campaign here with us. He is a brilliant artist and represents the raw talent hidden everywhere in Bengal,” said Mitra, who was campaigning for ward 2 candidate Kakali Sen.

While the family is yet to come to terms with the tragedy that occurred on Friday, Indian donors raised Rs 30 lakh in a few hours to ensure Jay’s final journey back home to Ahmedabad. “We learnt about his death on Friday afternoon from his friends in Melbourne. It seems he suffered a cardiac arrest,” said Bipin Patel, his uncle who is an ex-councillor from Asarwa. “We will get to know the exact cause after the postmortem exam. His body will reach us on December 16.” Jay’s father is an electrician in Ahmedabad. Jay had gone to Melbourne two and a half years ago to pursue further studies after earning a diploma in engineering. “Jay’s father is not well off. His friends managed to raise Rs 11 lakh in 45 minutes from the Indian community which responded quickly and generously,” said Bipin Patel. “The fundraising process was halted for some time. In all, about Rs 30 lakh was raised, thanks to Indians who offered support in such a tough time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amdavadi-dies-in-australia-rs-30l-raised-in-hours-to-get-him-home/articleshow/88230934.cms||---

We have been reading on massive raids on politicians involved in money laundering cases. ED’s action should be transparent, otherwise such a prestigious organisation will lose its credibility,’’ Malik said. Malik said BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, too, is making wild allegations. “Somaiya has made allegations of fraud and financial irregularities against me and the state waqf board. I wish to inform Somaiya that not me, but high-ranking BJP leaders are involved in the biggest ever waqf lands in the Marathwada region. We have set up an SIT to probe the scam. Do not be surprised if the BJP leaders are arrested by the SIT. I will suggest ED to appoint Somaiya as its official spokesperson. In the recent past, Somaiya has been making predictions almost on daily basis on the likely raids by the ED,’’ Malik said. “Today, Somiaya said ED will visit my house in the waqf land matter. I will ask the ED to speak to me directly,’’ Malik said, adding that he would soon expose Somaiya. “I have gathered adequate information, I will release it very soon,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dont-be-surprised-if-bjp-leaders-are-arrested/articleshow/88231497.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Locals said the problem occurred last week when a vehicle rammed into the electricity pole and the light fixture was detached. However the department is yet to undertake necessary repair work, locals said. An elderly resident of the area said it is the duty of the linesmen from the electricity department allocated to that area to see that such problems are taken care of on time. Meanwhile at the toll booth, which has been non-functional since the past two years, tin sheets are protruding and locals say these too could give way any time. The toll booth was set up three years ago to collect entry tax from vehicles coming from other states.

Stressing on the importance of marketing this potential to global investors, Gadkari said since the “product” itself is truly world class it should not be a big challenge. “The global director for Walmart once came to meet me. I asked him to taste an orange fruit jam made by NOGA (Nagpur Orange Growers Association). I offered him a teaspoon, but the Walmart top executive ended up having the entire bottle,” said the Union minister. For mining natural resources, Gadkari said the iron ore available in Gadchiroli is commendable. “Its grade is very high. After iron ore mining there is potential of finding gold deposits as well, which can be explored. Nearby regions will also benefit due to this. A corporate house is planning a Rs5,000 crore plant near Ashti,” said the road transport and highways minister. Wildlife tourism can also be taken to the next level by using environment-friendly decisions, said Gadkari. “We are the tiger capital of the world and Tadoba is a big draw. Currently there is a restriction on the number of vehicles allowed inside because of the noise and pollution they create. I have suggested to the authorities that nine-seater electric vehicles can be used in Tadoba, which generate neither sound nor pollution,” he said. Doing so will increase the number of flights coming into Nagpur as tourism booms, Gadkari added. “Another tourist attraction will be inaugurated in the city next month. Futala will have a water fountain whose water jet shooting capacity will be the tallest in the world,” he said. Appreciating the role of Nagpur First — the organizer of Global Nagpur awards — in pitching Nagpur as an investment decision to the world, Gadkari said the region’s export potential has to be highlighted. “We have a dry port here and today I have announced that it will be inaugurated soon, and from here direct exports can be done.” Cotton bales which used to go to Bangladesh via Jawaharlal Nehru Port (near Mumbai) will now be going through Haldia and cost of transportation will decrease, he added. “We have a logistics park here because of our central location,” said Gadkari. He added that the airport expansion which was planned for Nagpur is currently stuck as a new tender has not been floated by Maharashtra government. Nagpur First encourages national and international investors to look at the region as a potential destination for investment. For many years the organization has been holding focussed and intensive sessions for the benefit of all stakeholders. Gadkari said, “Nagpur First has a key role to play in showcasing the city to the world.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-has-major-investment-potential-gadkari/articleshow/88230911.cms||---

The order comes after Goa Paryavaran Savrakshan Sangharsh Samitee, a voluntary organisation, approached the NGT alleging that the GCZMA has been deliberately delaying the recovery of environmental compensation. The tribunal has also warned the GCZMA not to plead in January that the assembly election code of conduct has come into force in Goa due to which it could not act. “The tribunal is inclined to grant a final opportunity to the respondent no. 1 (GCZMA) to file an affidavit of compliance in this regard and it is made very clear that it is not open to the respondent no.1 to plead their inability on account of the election schedule, and other reasons,” the NGT said. The applicant told the NGT that the GCZMA was colluding with the violators and is deliberately avoiding exercise of its statutory powers and delaying the process as it intends to take advantage of ensuing assembly elections in Goa The GCZMA, however, told the tribunal that transfers of some officials had caused difficulty in assessing and levying environmental compensation. Finding merit in the submissions made by the voluntary organisation, the tribunal said that GCZMA was yet to do any kind of exercise to assess, levy and recover the environmental compensation from violators. The Samitee had first approached the NGT earlier this year stating that the recovery of environmental dues by GCZMA has been a pittance as compared to the violations in Goa. The GCZMA had told the tribunal that it has been unable to start the recovery of compensation from many violators, who approach the high court against their orders. The NGT then told the GCZMA that it should at least start recovery of environmental compensation from violators whose cases are not pending in the high court.  In October this year, the GCZMA told the NGT that it has begun discussing the modalities of recovering environmental compensation and that an expert committee has been formed for the purpose. The NGT had asked GCZMA to file a status report three months later on December 8. However, on the day of the hearing, the applicant told the tribunal that GCZMA has failed to recover environmental compensation even three months later. The tribunal has warned the GCZMA not to plead in January that the assembly election code of conduct has come into force in Goa due to which it could not act||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/recover-environment-dues-by-jan-25-ngt-tells-coastal-authority/articleshow/88230981.cms||---

Ajit Kulkarni, a resident of Arvind Society composts all the wet waste generated on his premises and has developed a kitchen garden on his terrace. The Dhantoli zone of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) felicitated Kulkarni after visiting his terrace garden. An awareness programme was organized by Dhantoli Zone in Suyog Nagar Park. The zone has also organized a workshop at the park on preparing vermicompost from kitchen waste and utilising the manure for developing kitchen gardens. Volunteers from Centre For Sustainable Development (CFSD) educated the citizens about waste segregation. They were told how to develop a kitchen garden by producing organic/vermicompost with the help of wet household waste. Later, assistant commissioner visited Kulkarni’s house and saw his kitchen garden where vegetables like brinjal, spinach, fenugreek and cabbage have been planted. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi claimed that between 50,000 and 60,000 households in Nagpur are producing compost from household waste. Their move will not only help keep the city green but also reduce the amount of waste generated in the city. “NMC is making efforts to encourage citizens to make compost at home. If a large number of citizens participate in this project, they will be able to grow organic vegetables at home itself,” said Joshi. The civic body also recognized Avinash Tembhurne, Hemraj Walade, Richa Hemant Chaudhary from Vinayak Nagar, Suhasini Gade, SM Katkwar, Chanchal Bhide, Vidhula Vinchalne, all from Vasant Nagar and Ratna Kandhari of Pandey Layout for producing fertilizer by using wet waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/citizens-making-compost-from-waste-earn-praise-from-nmc/articleshow/88229676.cms||---

He was in the city to attend a government function at Seelanaickenpatti, where several hundreds of people turned up to listen to him. Stalin inaugurated several completed projects and issued welfare measures to the tune of Rs 261.39 crore to 30,837 beneficiaries during the occasion. “Currently, we are ranked fourth among the least poor states in the country. Former chief ministers the late Annadurai and Karunanidhi had implemented various social welfare schemes, which have helped eradicate poverty to an extent. I will now turn Tamil Nadu into a hunger-free state by eradicating poverty and bag the top place among the least poor states,” he said while addressing the gathering. Referring to the state’s performance in draining out stagnated rainwater in Chennai and a few other districts, Stalin said he felt proud when common people told him that officials were quick to address their issues. Stalin said the government would set up underground drainage system in Salem corporation limits for 520km at a cost of Rs 530 crore, new water projects for uninterrupted potable water supply for Rs 158 crore, improvisation and desilting work at Bodinaickenpatty, Mookkaneri and Allikuttai lakes at a cost of Rs 69 crore, new rail overbridge to regulate traffic at Ammapet area for Rs 120 crore, indoor sports stadium at a cost of Rs 20 crore, centre for silver anklet business at a cost of Rs 25 crore and a tidel park for youths to create job opportunities. He also used the occasion to appreciate municipal administration minister K N Nehru for the work he has done in the district (Salem). “While he has received 35,217 petitions at the grievance meetings, he has addressed 10,623 of them immediately. The minister is determined to review the remaining petitions at the earliest.” The event was attended by ministers K N Nehru, K Ponmudi, M Mathiventhan, A V Velu, M R K Pannerselvam, K Muthusamy and N Kayalvizhi Selvaraj, Salem North MLA R Rajendran and MPs.

Claiming that illegal mining was rampant, he accused government and authorities of turning a blind eye to the issue. "A PRO of the chief minister office has been suspended. Did he write the letter himself or was he asked to pass the directions? If he was asked, then he was merely performing his duties and he should not be dismissed. I have been saying that the CM is inclined towards mining and no one listened to me. Now, it is in the public domain to check the facts," Rawat told TOI. He also requested authorities to find out about the owners of vehicles against whom challans had been issued. "Action needs to be taken against the main culprits and not only against those who are acting on their directions," said the former CM. Rawat further asserted that he was forcibly stopped by a police team at Rajeev Nagar gate. “I was not allowed to go ahead. There were a total of party members with me. I requested state chief Ganesh Godiyal that I will march alone, still I was stopped. Finally, I was successful in coming here on a two-wheeler. I have nothing against the police team as it was working on the directions of some people,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/harish-rawat-protests-outside-assembly-building-over-illegal-mining/articleshow/88230353.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Shiv Sena realised BJP is divisive in 2019, Sharad Pawar knew 25 years ago’||MUMBAI: NCP chief Sharad Pawar had said 25 years ago that BJP was a divisive party, but Shiv Sena realised this only two years back, said Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday, apparently referring to the Uddhav Thackeray-led party severing ties with BJP and forming a government with NCP and Congress after the 2019 Assembly polls in Maharashtra.  “Some 25 years ago, Sharad Pawar had said that BJP did not want unity in the country. Its methods are divisive. We realised this two years back. He had also said that BJP's policies were regressive which would take the country back. However, we took a long time to realise it,” the Sena MP said.  Raut was speaking at Pawar’s book launch event. Referring to the title, ‘Nemkechi Bolane’, roughly translated as ‘speaking with brevity’, Raut said, “The name of the book is so good that we all should gift it to PM Narendra Modi. He needs to know certain things.”  Raut said the Central Hall of Parliament used to be known for meetings between leaders across parties, and between senior journalists and leaders, who would discuss various issues. “However, in the last few years, we have seen that those who try to raise questions are being opposed and muzzled,” he alleged.  “Pawar had said this some years ago and now we have seen it being the reality,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-realised-bjp-is-divisive-in-2019-pawar-knew-25-yrs-ago/articleshow/88231502.cms||---

While he was convulsing, his 18-year-old sister, unable to understand what to do, tried to revive him and was also electrocuted. Both died. The incident took place at Gujjarhedi village in Muzaffarnagar on Saturday afternoon. Sompal Singh, the distraught father of Pardeep Singh and Pinki, alleged that after the deaths of his children, he tried calling up the electricity department but no one answered the phone. None dared to touch the bodies till the power was switched off. As news of the deaths spread, locals and members of the farm organization, Bhartiya Kisan Sangathan, gathered at the spot. They staged a dharna, demanding compensation for the victims’ family. Sompal Singh said, “We have repeatedly been complaining to the power department to remove the overhead high tension cables from the residential area but to no avail.” By the time the power department officials reached the spot, a sizable number of people had gathered to protest. Dharmveer Saini, an engineer in the electricity department, said, “The family of the dead would be given Rs 5 lakh for each victim.” He added that a date had been fixed to remove the high tension cables. Sources said Pradeep who was studying in class XII used to help his father in farming. The siblings are survived by another brother and sister. Though no case has so far been registered, investigations are on, said Mukesh Solanki, station house officer, Titavi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/brother-gets-electrocuted-sis-also-dies-trying-to-save-him/articleshow/88229805.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Upgraded Pinaka rocket system successfully tested in Pokhran||JAIPUR/JAISALMER: The Pinaka Extended Range Multi-Barrel Rocket Launcher System was successfully tested at the Pokhran range on Saturday. The system has been jointly designed by the laboratories of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), Pune, and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), Pune. The DRDO along with the Indian Army conducted a series of performance evaluation trials of these industry-produced rockets at field-firing ranges during the last three days. In these trials, enhanced range Pinaka rockets were test-fired at different ranges with various warhead capabilities. The DRDO, after establishing the performance efficacy of the enhanced range Pinaka, transferred the technology of the system to the industry. The industry partner has manufactured enhanced Pinaka Mk-1 rockets with DRDO’s handholding during the production and quality assurance. In continuation of the transfer of technology absorption, rockets developed by the industry have undergone the performance evaluation and quality certification process. The hand holding during the production, quality assurance, and launch coordination for bulk production is being provided by the DRDO design team and QA agencies nominated for the system. All trial objectives were met satisfactorily. A total of 24 rockets were fired for different ranges and warhead capabilities to meet the objectives of accuracy and consistency. With this, the initial phase of technology absorption of Pinaka-ER by the industry partner has successfully been completed making the industry partner ready for series production of the rocket system. The Pinaka-ER is an upgraded version of the older Pinaka version, which has been in service with the Indian Army for the last decade. The system has been designed in the light of emerging requirements with advanced technologies enhancing the range. The Area Denial Munition (ADM) variants of munition designed by the ARDE, Pune, for Pinaka, and manufactured by the industry partners under technology transfer were successfully carried out at Pokhran field firing ranges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/indigenous-pinaka-extended-range-system-tested-in-pokhran/articleshow/88230961.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Businessmen can travel overseas despite look out circulars: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: While allowing several people to travel abroad temporarily for business purposes, the Bombay high court has directed that look out circulars (LOC) issued against them at the instance of public sector banks will not come in their way. Among those granted interim relief by a bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar on December 9 are Rihen Mehta, promoter-director of Dubai-based Global Green Bridge FZC, and son of Harshad Mehta of the Rosy Blue diamond group. The company had taken credit of AED 10 million from Bank of Baroda’s Dubai branch and Rihen Mehta was also a personal guarantor. In 2019 he returned to India with his family. In December 2019, BoB declared the company’s account a non-performing asset and initiated recovery proceedings. On January 13, 2020, Rihen Mehta was stopped at Mumbai airport on his way to New York. The court heard petitions that challenged the LOC issued by the ministry of home affairs following an October 4, 2018, office memorandum (OM) where persons can be restrained from travelling if their departure is detrimental to the “economic interest of India”. The OM allows the chairman of State Bank of India, and managing directors and CEOs of all other public sector banks to request the issue of an LOC. The common complaint of the petitions is because an individual or corporate identity is indebted to a public sector bank, LOCs have been issued restraining their travel overseas. While some petitioners have civil or recovery proceedings pending and others criminal proceedings, the bench said none “can be said to be absconding or fugitive” evading an arrest or a warrant. While some petitions challenged the LOC, two questioned the Centre’s power to issue such an OM, saying curtailing fundamental rights must be by statute or constitutional amendment and not by an executive order. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, with advocate Rui Rodrigues, said it is for each bank to justify its action in requesting an LOC. “The fact that a particular bank may have been wrong in making that request will not vitiate the office memorandum itself,” said Singh, adding there is no reason to question the power to issue such an OM. He also said the OMs address security concerns, are not a blanket infringement of fundamental rights and have inbuilt safeguards. Since there is a complete challenge to even the first OM of October 27, 2010, the judges posted the hearing on February 4. In individual orders, they directed the petitioners to give their exact itinerary with contact details to the court. HC will not grant them further travel permission unless they return to India. Immigration authorities at all points of departure will permit the petitioners to depart the country “without regard to any Look Out Circular issued at the instance of the bank”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bizmen-can-travel-overseas-despite-look-out-circulars-bombay-hc/articleshow/88231522.cms||Rosy Sequeira

With this question, the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commissiosn, Ahmedabad (city) ordered insurance companies to pay Rs 40,000 to Shailesh and Bina Shah, who footed medical bills of Rs 93,900, but the insurers paid them Rs 53,900 and deducted the rest citing the terms and conditions of the policy to quantify the claim. The commission also termed the deductions a deficiency in service and unfair trade practice, and ordered full payment towards of the claim and Rs 5,000 extra towards compensation for mental harassment and legal expenditure. In this case, Bina Shah was hospitalized and was treated for stones, but when they claimed medical insurance, Oriental Insurance Co Ltd and Health Insurance TPA of India Ltd gave them Rs 40,000 less and said the deductions were made on doctor’s visitation charges, surgeon charges, anaesthetist’s fees and OT charges on the ground of them being ‘excess to reasonable and customary charge clauses’. When the couple sued the insurers through Grahak Suraksha and Pagla Samiti, the companies presented their defence. The commission was not ready to accept the argument and said the deductions were made without explaining what constitutes reasonable and customary expenses. The commission further said that charges for anaesthesia, surgery and OT are variable and depend on infrastructure at hospitals, skill, seniority and expertise of doctors and they cannot be compared with other hospitals in the surroundings. The commission asserted that there cannot be any straightjacketed formula to standardize such charges. Each hospital and doctor have their own rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/reasonable-charge-formula-questioned/articleshow/88230972.cms||---

The assailants chopped off the victim’s leg, causing him to bleed to death. The cruelty of the assailants did not end there. They took the severed foot of the victim and hurled it on the road while fleeing. These scenes were captured by the surveillance cameras installed in the locality. Sudheesh, 32, son of Sathyan and Leela, of Pananvila House at Kalloor near Pothencode and currently residing at Chempakamangalam is the murder victim. He is survived by wife and two kids. Police have identified two of the assailants as notorious criminals Ottakam Rajesh and Azhoor Unni, who have several criminal cases in their names, especially at Chirayinkeezhu police station. Sudheesh revealed their names to the police before losing consciousness while being taken to the hospital. According to the police, the crime took place around 2.30 pm. The gang cornered the victim at a palm field near Kalloor. Fearing for his life, he ran to his relative Sajeev’s residence nearby. But the assailants who followed him there hacked him using sharp weapons. They targeted the legs below the knees. His right feet got severed completely from the middle of the shin. While fleeing from the crime scene, the assailants grabbed the severed foot and threw it in the middle of the road around half a kilometer away from the crime scene. In the surveillance camera visuals released by the police, the assailants can be seen raising their hands in exultation after hurling the foot on the road. Police collected this foot while taking the injured to the hospital. But by 5 pm, the doctors at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College hospital pronounced him dead while under treatment. Apparently, Sudheesh was hiding from the police after committing a crime of attempted murder. He was allegedly part of a gang that attacked and injured two youths at Attingal on December 6. The Attingal police had arrested four persons, including Sudheesh’s elder brother Satheesh alias Bike Sathi, for attempted murder charges then. Sudheesh had been evading arrest since then.  It is suspected that Sudheesh was hiding at his relatives’ residences in Kalloor region. The injured youths in that case are learned to be close accomplices of Ottakam Rajesh and Azhoor Unni. Unfortunately for Sudheesh, the rival gang traced him before the police could, which eventually led to his death. The assailants came on two motorcycles and an auto rickshaw. Rural SP V K Madhu said that while the antecedence of the deceased is being probed, the priority of the police was to nab the assailants. There has been a spate of violent crimes reported recently under rural police, especially from the regions under Pothencode, Kadinamkulam, Mangalapuram and Attingal police station limits. It was only a few days ago two known criminals hacked several people at Kadinamkulam during an extortion bid. Before that, a habitual offender had publicly thrashed a young man on the road at Kaniyapuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/gang-chops-off-rivals-leg-leaves-him-to-bleed-to-death/articleshow/88230401.cms||---

This question has led the state information commission and Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to cross swords ever since July 2021. For three months, despite the state information commission passing an order that GPCB should provide the applicant information on banned chemicals, there has been no reply. The row began in January 2020, when a farmer from Vataman village in Ahmedabad district, Praful Mehta, sought information under the RTI Act from the regional GPCB office whether, “chemicals like vinyl sulphon, gamma acid, FC acid, NMJ acid, sulpho-tobias acid or 6-acetyl derivatives were being used by dyeing manufacturers along the golden corridor or units in districts like Ahmedabad and Surat and whether a report of GPCB flagging these banned chemicals being found in waste water existed.” For 18 months, the GPCB public information officer and board’s first appellate officer denied the information, claiming that such information lay with various districts if tests were conducted independently by regional offices. In March, the state information commissioner Subhash Soni ordered that the information be given to Mehta in a fortnight. “When GPCB did not respond the information commission reminded it in June again. Can’t the GPCB ask its regional offices for tests conducted by them,” says Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/information-panel-gpcb-cross-swords/articleshow/88230980.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 3 redeveloped flats are 30 sqft smaller, builder must pay Rs 34 lakh||MUMBAI: The national consumer commission has directed a builder to pay Rs 34.18 lakh to a family from Vile Parle whose three redeveloped flats were each around 30 sqft smaller in area than what they had been promised. The amount includes the market value of Rs 24,650 (2016) per sqft, along with 9% interest. The commission also directed the builder to pay a total of Rs 30 lakh for mental agony and compensation for a delay of eight months in handing over possession and costs of litigation. Also, the builder and the housing society will have to collectively pay them Rs 6 lakh towards litigation costs. “It is apparent from the record that the value of each flat was more than 2 crore in 2016, there was delay of 8 months to hand over the possession. The opposite parties made the complainants to suffer physical stress and mental agony, therefore they deserve a fair compensation,” the commission said. The court said that it would be just and proper for Hetali Enterprises, Builders and Developers to pay an interest of 9% per annum for the delay. “It is apparent from the agreement that the builder can claim the rate of interest 18% on the delayed payments from the complainant but in contrary, for the builder, the rate of interest on compensation for delayed possession comes to meagre rate of interest 0.24% p.a. Such a disparity in the rate of interest is both unfair and inequitable,” the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission said. Dr Vijay Kale, Dr Purshottam Kale and Dr Satishchandra Kale had submitted separate complaints in respect of each flat in 2017. The flats received from the builder were of 856 sqft, 840 sqft and 509 sqft carpet area respectively. The family had alleged that they were granted possession only in 2016 after their housing society, Andheri Nav Bahar CHS Ltd, and builder forced them into taking back police and other complaints. The commission said, “The case of the complainants is that the opposite parties are withholding the possession of flats; coerced the complainants to withdraw their pending cases filed before district forum, police and deputy registrar (Mhada). By any means we are of the considered view that the complainants have right to claim compensation...”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-redeveloped-flats-are-30sqft-smaller-bldr-must-pay-rs-34l/articleshow/88231533.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Act against auto drivers charging extra: Maharashtra Lokayukta||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Lokayukta issued notice to the Mumbai police commissioner and regional transport office (RTO) Mumbai, asking them to point out what steps have and are being taken to curb the issue auto rickshaw drivers in certain parts charging random fares instead of following the meter readings. Lokayukta Justice V M Kanade sought steps to undo a “menace’’ that affects ordinary public. The complaint was placed by a resident of Panvel, Ulhas Vajre, against the practice of auto rickshaw drivers in Panvel and Navi Mumbai not charging as per meter. The Panvel RTO said it began sting operations against rickshaw drivers in 2019 and, that year, fined 564 drivers, collecting Rs18.5 lakh. In 2020, despite lockdown, 202 auto rickshaw drivers were fine Rs8 lakh and, in 2021, only 45 drivers were fined and Rs2 lakh recovered. The Lokayukta is an independent statutory functionary to investigate and recommend steps to rectify any injustice done to a person through maladministration and to investigate allegations of abuse of position and corruption against public servants. On December 6, via video conference, Justice Kanade also heard Anil Patil, deputy commissioner, RTO, Panvel. Vajre’s grievance was that rickshaw drivers in the region charge unlawful amounts from commuters and do not use the meter. The Lokayukta had sought a detailed report from the regional transport office, Panvel. The report mentioned that there is a “regular blacklist’’ of drivers “published everywhere’’ and there is also a redressal committee for commuter grievances. Some drivers have their license suspended and a fine of Rs1,100 is imposed on drivers for each complaint. The Lokayukta expressed satisfaction at the action taken and initiated by the Panvel RTO but said, as rightly pointed out by the complainant, rickshaw drivers routinely charge random fares from commuters, unlawfully. He thus asked the RTO Panvel to renew its crackdown “against such errant rickshaw drivers.’’ Justice Kanade said since the matter is of public interest and since the grievance is not only in Navi Mumbai and Panvel, but also in the suburbs of Mumbai, the Mumbai police also needs to be issued notice. The Lokayukta will now hear the matter again on March 16, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/act-against-auto-drivers-charging-extra-lokayukta/articleshow/88231538.cms||Swati Deshpande

The Congress supporting gram panchayat members returned the gifts on Friday after the MLC election voting was over. The BJP district president of Ballari said he was unaware of the video circulating on social media. He denied that any party leader had given gifts to anyone in the run-up to the MLC polls. The BJP’s MLC candidate from here is Yachareddy Satish. He was unavailable when TOI tried to contact him. In the video, C Basavaraj, a gram panchayat member in Hampadevanahalli in Kampli taluk, is heard telling the gram panchayat president’s husband: “We are not foolish to sell our votes for saris and silver coins for the MLC elections. You couldn’t purchase us through gifts and we were never swayed by such lures.” Basavaraj has claimed that the gifts --- a silver coin and a sari each --- were given to 11 gram panchayat members. “We never expected any gift from the candidates and we are loyal to the Congress. The party is most important to us, not such gifts. BJP leaders should never underestimate Congress supporters,” Basavaraj was heard saying in the video. Basavaraj and the 10 other gram panchayat members are loyalists of Congress candidate KC Kondaiah. “BJP leaders have offered 11 sarees and 11 silver coins to cast votes for the BJP candidate in MLC polls. But we have returned these gifts to the BJP leaders,” confirmed N Mallikarjun, a Congress leader in the village. Pavan Kumar Malpati, the returning officer for the MLC poll and Ballari deputy commissioner, was not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/mlc-polls-ballari-gp-members-claim-bjp-tried-to-bribe-them-with-saris-and-silver-coins/articleshow/88230257.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

He was happy because the city civil court had passed an order on Friday, instructing the Khokhra police to ensure that he gets possession of his home. “I’ll soon be back in my home from where I was thrown out seven years ago,” reminiscences Valluvar. A native of Tamil Nadu, he had come to Ahmedabad to work as a technician at Calico Mills. After a few years, he got an opportunity to go to Africa to work in fledgling petroleum industry. He used to send money back home. From the savings, he not only got his son married but also bought a house. “The trouble started when my wife died in 2013. I would contain all my belongings to one room whereas two other rooms were used by my son and his wife. But they did not want me in home. When I protested, they even got my daughter-in-law’s relatives to threaten,” he said. “I would be subjected to mental and physical harassment. When I did not budge, I was thrown out to my own luck.” He sought refuge at Jeevan Sandhya old age home. Suketu Nagarvadiya, managing trustee of the organization, said that Subramani needed help with both mental and physical bruises. “Even at that age, he was determined to fight for the right thing. Even when his son would not appear in court, Subramani would diligently go to hearings, refuting claims of harassment by his daughter-in-law and never lose hope,” he said. He would have got the possession early with the hearing in February 2020 ordering the authorities to get his home back. But the pandemic delayed the process. What would Subramani do after his return? “The first thing is, I would spend some time there and put together life again. I would then think on how to sustain self,” said Subramani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/85-year-old-in-ahmedabad-wins-back-house-from-son-after-7-year-battle/articleshow/88230984.cms||---

So, is he saying that as a political organization in the assembly we shouldn’t talk? He can give his orders to someone else, not the League. He made these statements out of fear over the huge turnout at our demonstration the other day,” said Muneer. He said AKG centre need not issue any royal decrees about the functioning of Muslim League. “Our leaders very well know how to take decisions for the party. He cannot speak in such an arrogant tone to a party which has been democratically elected to the assembly,” said Muneer. Hitting out at Vijayan’s allegations against IUML, Muneer said Vijayan is not a communist. “What we must ask Pinarayi Vijayan, who asked whether League is a political outfit or a religious group, is whether he is a communist. As per conventional definitions of communism, we, and even a majority members of the communist party, believe that he is not a communist,” he said. He said if Vijayan is unsure about the credentials of a political party which was part of the cabinet headed by E M S Namboodiripad, then it has to be inferred that he is experiencing delusions. Muneer said that many of the things that Vijayan said were contrary to the truth. “He claimed that the decision on Waqf board postings was taken based on the board’s recommendations. It is not true,” said Muneer.  Meanwhile, Kozhikode city police has registered a suo motu case against Muslim League leaders and activists who attended the ‘Waqf protection meet’ at Kozhikode beach on Thursday. At least 10,000 persons who attended the gathering would become accused in the case. The case was registered by Vellayil police for violation of Covid protocol and for disrupting traffic. Case against IUML leader: Vellayil police have also registered a case against IUML state secretary Abdurahiman Kallayi under IPC Section that deals with ‘wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot’ over the comments he made during the protest gathering at Kozhikode on Thursday. While addressing the ‘Waqf protection rally’ Kallayi had made objectionable remarks referring to the marriage between PWD minister PA Mohamed Riyas and Veena T, the chief minister’s daughter. Without naming Riyas, he had said, “Who is his wife. Is this a marriage? It is prostitution. One should have courage and guts to say it.” The statement had faced strong condemnation from various quarters. Police have booked Kallayi under Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the IPC. After his remarks went viral on social media, police had received several complaints seeking to register a case against the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/iuml-hits-back-at-pinarayi-says-he-is-not-a-communist/articleshow/88230429.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Sextortion: New way of Rajasthan conmen to trap victims||JAIPUR: Blackmailing and extortion of Shiv Sena’s MLA from Kurla assembly seat of Mumbai by a conman from Sikari police station area of Bharatpur a few months ago is not an isolated case. From cheating and extortion of people through promise to sell items in cheaper rates on OLX, the criminals of Mewat region have now changed their modus operandi and several people across the country fell prey to their tactics. Now, they invite people randomly for intimate talks and even allure them to send their semi-naked videos by posing as women on the social networking platforms. After victims fell prey, they start blackmailing them. TOI on Friday spoke to police officers in Bharatpur to know details related to the activities of conmen in areas like Kaithwada, Nagar, Sikari, Khoh, Jurhera, Pahadi and Kaman. “We have facilitated police of various states, including Telangana, Maharashtra, Andra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and others, who came to arrest these conmen. Earlier, they were into cheating and extortion of people through selling items in cheaper prices. Now, they are also into this kind of extortion,” said Devendra Bishnoi, superintendent of police, Bharatpur. Elaborating more on the modus operandi, Bishnoi, said, “They will first send you a friend request on social media by posing as woman. Thereafter, they will start chatting and lure the person to start intimate talks. After that they will first send some vulgar videos and ask people to send any semi-naked or even a naked video. That’s how a person fell prey and sends the video. Thereafter, the conman will pose as a police officer and ask for money and will threaten if the money won’t be paid, they will make the video public.” “We call it sextortion which is extortion through talking about sex,” he added. Bishnoi added that more than 100 cases were registered in various police stations, including Kaithwada, Nagar, Sikari, Khoh, Jurhedra , Pahadi and Kaman which also included extortion through selling stuff on OLX. “We have sign boards in Bharatpur and other areas asking and urging people not to get allure with the OLX advertisements promising things on cheaper prices. Also, we have been issuing appeals to the public not to get indulge into social media to an extent that without knowing somebody you start approving the friend request and later get into intimate talks,” Bishnoi added. Senior police officers investigating various such cases stated that these conmen first visit the profiles of people on the social media and after noticing that a person is an IT engineer, manager and have good social profile, they start sending these friend requests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sextortion-new-way-of-mewat-conmen-to-trap-victims/articleshow/88230985.cms||Ashish Mehta

While 59 of them were expected to handle up to five tonnes of waste per day, 10 were expected to treat two tonnes. They were expected to be ready by September. But only 30 have been constructed.Activists are of the opinion that the MCCs were facing issues right from the inception as the public had misconceptions that they will lead to sanitation issues due to leachate flowing out of the facilities. “The civic body should have addressed the issue by creating awareness. Moreover, there was an inordinate delay in completing the work and bringing those that were completed, in use. The delay was one of the reasons for the poor ranking in the Swachh Survekshan survey,” an activist told TOI. “While the Vellalore dumping yard is struggling to cope up with the amount of garbage generated from the city, MCCs can play a vital role in disposing garbage.”Corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara said that works are under way to bring the completed MCCs to use. “While some have engineering issues that resulted in blockage of leachate, some are awaiting electricity connection. Correction works are under way and they will be handed over to the health department for operation soon,” he said.“Although the operating cost of MCC is high, we are determined to make full use of them,” Sunkara added.The civic body plans to issue retender for nine MCCs, a senior official said. Twenty-three of them are mired in problems as residents are against them, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/majority-of-micro-composting-centres-yet-to-be-operational/articleshow/88230967.cms||V Devanathan

President, NFB Vivek Monga said that they took to the roads as the assurance of a meeting with the principal secretary of the department to listen to their demands was not honoured. “We were called to discuss our issues on November 28 but none of the officials came to talk to us at the given venue. Again, we were given time to meet on December 1 but again, no one came to listen to our problems,” the protesters alleged. On Saturday morning, the protesters marched from Kharar bus stand towards their protest venue near the chief minister’s residence in Kharar. Our main demands are to increase reservation in government jobs, recruitment of well-trained staff and upgraded infrastructure at our sole school in Punjab and doubling of handicap allowance. The protesters alleged that when they started their stir in November, Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi came to meet them and scheduled a meeting but officers concerned did not come to listen to their demands and they had to return empty-handed twice. “We are forced to take to the roads as the government has not listened to our demands for a long time. We have given a memorandum in the name of the Punjab CM, listing our demands, to the local police and we will not end our protest till our demands are heard,” NFB member Amardeep Singh said. After sending the memorandum, Punjab CM on Saturday assured the delegation of blind protestors to take up their matter at the Chief Secretary level meeting on Tuesday and after discussion will issue the notification in this regard. Three protestors decided to go on hunger strike from Sunday till the decision will be made in their favour.

Directions have already been sent to the higher education department from the CMO to set up an UOU campus in the state capital. Currently, it has only one proper campus which is located in Haldwani while all its administrative work in Dehradun is carried out inside the few rooms located in another state university. "The university needs a centre in Garhwal zone. We are unable to cater properly to the students of Garhwal zone which is 50% of our total students' strength," said an official from UOU . Notably, chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has personally shown interest in this particular project and is keen to allot the land for Dehradun campus before the assembly election. The state higher education department has been asked to release the related government order (GO) in this regard. Also, the UOU students are supposed to visit Haldwani for administrative related works or for submission of their assignments. So, UOU having a campus in Dehradun will be a major relief for nearly half of the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-open-university-to-establish-campus-in-dehradun/articleshow/88230416.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Varanasi||KVD clears challenge of restoring 18thcentury KVT walls, 24 unearthed temples||With Box Varanasi: The artistic walls of the 18th century Kashi Vishwanath Temple, saved from the cancerous impact of enamel paint, are now donning a vibrant look, and so are the 24 other temples unearthed during removal of old buildings for the construction of KV Dham project. “Conservation of KVT walls was a challenging task as enamel paint had damaged them badly and figures carved on stones had decayed. We have completely removed the enamel paint from the walls. The work of restoring artistic designs carved at the time of the temple construction in 1777 has also been started. But, it is a time-taking process and will be completed after the opening ceremony of KVD,” said Dr Shivani Mishra, a conservator from Rajasthan who has worked for restoration of historical temples of different periods. Apart from KVT, the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board had also taken up the task of conserving 24 other temples unearthed during removal of old buildings or existed in the vicinity of KVT but were in a dilapidated condition due to improper maintenance. “Along with KVT, my company was tasked to restore 24 other temples in their actual shape and design,” said Mishra, mentioning that of these 24, work on 17 temples, including Chandragupt, Mandhateshwar, Dwadishling, Brameshwar, Gangeshwar, Bharmagupteshwar, Bhuvneshwar, Tarkeshwar, Chintamani, Samudra Manthan, Goyenka Chhatralaya, Shri Putlibai, Panchmukhi, Bhasma Gateshwar temples and Gyanvapi mandap has been completed. “The process of restoring the decayed carved design on the stones of KVT walls with a solution prepared with ‘gud’ (jaggery), ‘methi’ (fenugreek seeds), ‘guggul’ (Commiphora wightii), custard apple water, stone and stone powder will continue till all designs are revived,” she said mentioning that the work on remaining eight temples will also be started after the opening of KVD on December 13. “Expanded in 5-lakh square feet area, the KVD shrine is also being called a complex of temples due to restoration of all the temples found in the area covered under this project,” said SKVSADB chairman Deepak Agrawal, adding that bringing the temples including KVT in their original shape was a challenging task. He added that the selection of conservators was done after going through a long and complex series of presentations. “I had given a presentation before the SKVSADB and selection of my company was done on merit. Cost of work for conserving 25 temples including KVT was estimated at Rs 1.60 crore and we started our work in August this year,” said Shivani, expecting that her assignment of conserving all 25 temples would be completed by January end. Despite being a highlighted issue since 2009, finding a solution for saving the artistic stone walls of KVT from the cancerous impact of enamel paint repeatedly before 2008 had not been possible. The experts said that the temple is built with porous Vindhya stone, which absorbs water along with salt and mineral through capillary action, but starts decaying in case it is coated with plastic paint as it does not allow moisture to go out of the stone. Records show that the KVT Trust and UP government initially sought help from ASI, which recommended assigning the task to National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property (NRLC) in 2009. However, as the NRLC estimated a cost of Rs 2.19 crore for removing the enamel paint from the stone walls, in 2010 KVTT turned down the proposal. Another estimate of Rs 1.22 crore given by NRLC for the same work in 2013-14 was also not accepted. Later, the temple Trust engaged the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee by paying Rs 57 lakhs in December 2014 to find ways for removing the enamel paint apart from assessing the strength of the stony structure of KVT building. The CBRI also conducted a study in 2015, but its recommendations were not accepted by the Trust. In 2019, help from the Indian Institute of Technology-Roorkee, which conducted a 3D imaging and mapping of the artistic walls to assess the damage and decide ways of their restoration, was taken. Agrawal said, “As previous exercises done for conservation and restoration of damaged walls of KVT could not yield results, we included this work in the KVD project. After major civil work was completed, the process of conservation and restoration of artistic walls of temples started.” BOX Built in 1777 by the late Maharani Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore, the KVT dome was covered with gold donated by Punjab Kesari Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in 1839. The threat to KVT architectural marvel was generated after applying enamel paint five-six times on its walls before 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvd-clears-challenge-of-restoring-18thcentury-kvt-walls-24-unearthed-temples/articleshow/88230987.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

M G Ganesan, deputy field director, ATR, said, “Elephants often come out of these two forest ranges and roam around tea estates. There are also incidents of them raiding ration shops for rice. So, we have decided to map the two forest ranges with the help of drones.”He said the drone mapping would cover the entire reserve forest, villages along the forest fringes, tea estates, staff quarters, swamps and Valparai town. “The entire area will be captured with drones and the areas will be mapped. If elephants enter near a tea estate staff quarters at Valparai, officials can check the map on their computers at their offices and instruct frontline staff to chase them away to a particular direction.” Ganesan said they were having two drone cameras and another two would be hired for the mapping work. “It will take at least 30 days to complete the work. Once the mapping is done, it will be easy to identify the areas of the two reserve forests. This will help prevent man-animal conflict in future.” He said they had also formed a WhatsApp group 10 days ago to monitor the elephant movement at the two forest ranges in the ATR in Pollachi forest division. “Forest department staff, tea estate managers, environmentalists and various NGOs are part of the group that is intended to share details about elephant movements. There is another WhatsApp group for the anti-depredation squad, who will chase away elephants into reserve forests based on specific input.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/forest-department-to-drone-map-two-forest-ranges-in-atr/articleshow/88230971.cms||A Subburaj

The 15 structures are part of the 33 non-agricultural permissions granted between 2014 and 2018 by the incumbent sub-divisional officer or tehsildars that were found to be against the law at a hearing. The resort and bungalows include ones formerly owned by state transport minister Anil Parab and one demolished in advance by Milind Narvekar, the chief minister’s aide. “As per information from the public information officer at Ratnagiri collectorate, there are 33 sea-facing constructions granted non-agriculture permission between 2014 and 2018. All these constructions are hotels, resorts with few bungalows but none of them had obtained town planning permission and fall under coastal regulatory zone,” said activist Prasad Karve. Many have demanded action against those sub-divisional officers and tehsildars responsible for promoting illegal activities and not discharging their duty diligently. “During the course of appeal hearing challenging the NA [non-agricultural] permission, CRZ violations etc, 15 NA permissions granted earlier have been cancelled. The guidelines framed by the state were violated by officials.

His whole life is marked by discipline and dedicating himself for the country’s dignity,” he added. “In the coming days, Rawat will see his India moving forward with a new resolve. He worked for increasing security at borders, strengthening infrastructure, making forces self-reliant, strengthening coordination between the three forces, all of which will continue. India is in mourning, but we will not slow down or stop our progress,” he said, adding that all Indians would work together to make the country more powerful.

---||Varanasi||Varanasi: After centuries, world to see zenith of Lord Avimukteshwara on Dec 13||VARANASI: After the first seal of Lord Avimukteshwara (Vishweshwara/Vishwanath) belonging to the 9-10th century BCE was found during Rajghat excavations, the millennia-old city of Varanasi will witness the glory of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham at its zenith when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will open this 21st century pilgrimage marvel on December 13. Varanasi, the abode of Lord Shiva, continues to grow and follow its ageless traditions of religious discourses, learning, arts and crafts, while a number of cities and cultures have risen and disappeared. Though the city of Varanasi and its presiding deity are believed to be beyond history as well as geography, eminent scholar and professor of cultural geography, Prof Rana PB Singh has attempted to present a historical timeline of the ancient temple. “We can safely talk about the existence of this temple of Lord Shiva in the 9-10th century BCE after its seal was found in the archaeological excavation in Rajghat area,” said Prof Singh, adding that possessing the spirit of divinity, myths and traditions have maintained the vibrancy of life in Varanasi since time immemorial. “Of course, archaeologically it has been proven that since 1000 BCE the city has continuously been inhabited by humans; that is why the city is known as one of the oldest living cities in the world. In 8th century BCE, the Jain Tirthankara Parsvanatha was already born in Varanasi, later on Mahavira (599-527 BCE), the last Tirthankara, also made his imprint on the cultural arena of the city. The Jataka tales of 8th to 7th century BCE refer to Banaras as the site of manifestation of previous Buddhas, the last one being the Gautam Buddha,” he added. Prof Singh added that the city of Varanasi records its continuous settlement history since 800 BCE. The archaeological findings and the C14 dating of some of the wares excavated from Rajghat plateau confirm the existence of urban settlements in the period during 800-500 BCE. The archaeological remains (pottery, terracotta, iron implements, artefacts, seals, etc.) found in the area are datable to the 9th century BCE. He said that the Gupta period (320-550 CE) was a period of great religious vitality and transformation. During this period, many of the earliest Puranas were composed. In literature, the theology, symbolism and manifestations of Siva became prominent and the earliest Puranas like the Vayu, Markandey and Matsya speak of the greatness of Shiva, and the pilgrimage routes devoted to him. Varanasi was established and recognised as a great sacred place (tirtha). The association among the Shivlingas, the Ganga river and a few of the ghats was given religious meaning and ritual. During the first half of the 7th century the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hsuan-tsang arrived in the city and described it as thickly populated, prosperous and an important seat of learning. He mentions 20 important temples, and one of the Shivlingas was about 30m high covered with copper plate. This in fact, was the Mauryan pillar, the fragment of which is called the Lat Bhairava. According to him, in 1194, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the slave general of Muhammad Ghori, sacked and looted the city, destroying nearly 1,000 temples and raised mosques. The temples were destroyed again in the 1300s under Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1351-1388). In the 1400s, the city came under the rule of the Sharqi kings of Jaunpur, and temples were destroyed again. The city came under the rule of the Lodis (1451-1526) and again a major part of the city was destroyed by Sikandar Lodi. The Vishweshvara temple was rebuilt for the third time at a third place during 1584-85 under the supervision of Narayan Bhatt, the noted scholar and compiler of the ‘Tristhalisetu’. But it was demolished by the order of Aurangzeb in 1669, and converted into a mosque.

---||Madurai||Madurai corporation faces flak for poor upkeep of seized cattle||MADURAI: With Madurai corporation cracking down on stray cattle roaming on roads and causing accidents, the poor upkeep of the seized animals has come in for sharp criticism from their owners and animal rights activists. They said the seized cattle are being kept in very bad conditions with many of them falling sick. After cattle owners protested in front of the shelter at Sellur on Friday, the corporation let out the seized animals on Saturday with a warning to the owners of tougher action if caught again. "They are collecting Rs 3,000 from us for a cow and Rs 1,500 per calf and making the animals sick,’’ said A Manikandan of Alwarpuram, whose calf was among the ones seized. Sai Mayur Hassija, member of People for Animals, said Manikandan told him that when he visited the shelter, he found the calf very sick. As he filed a complaint with Sellur police, corporation officials told him that it was being treated. ``It was lying on the sludge of cowdung on the shelter floor, and the next day it disappeared,” he added. He says he is sure the calf died, but the authorities did not give him a post mortem report. The next day, he had found 40 cows tethered with short ropes in the shelter. "It can barely hold around 15 animals at a time and the conditions inside were very unhygienic which could make them sick,’’ he said. "We know that we shouldn’t allow cattle to stray, but the corporation should also keep the seized animals in a safer setup,’’ he said. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan had warned cattle owners that they would be slapped with a fine if caught on roads and if they did not retrieve it within three days of seizure, the animals would be auctioned. The owners and activists say the corporation should keep the impounded animals in areas from where they seized in open places till they come and retrieve them. Keeping them in closed shelter makes them sick, they said. They say deputing bull tamers to catch the stray animals was a wrong move. ``They do so very inhumanly, lassoing and pulling the animals, injuring them in the process,’’ said Manikandan. Commissioner Karthikeyan said they were in the process of improving the condition of the shelters and also establishing more. Many abandoned animals were sick when seized and were given medical attention, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/corpn-faces-flak-for-poor-upkeep-of-seized-cattle/articleshow/88230969.cms||Padmini Sivarajah

While he was convulsing, his 18-year-old sister, unable to understand what to do, tried to revive him and was also electrocuted. Both died. The incident took place at Gujjarhedi village in Muzaffarnagar on Saturday afternoon. Sompal Singh, the distraught father of Pardeep Singh and Pinki, alleged that after the deaths of his children, he tried calling up the electricity department but no one answered the phone. None dared to touch the bodies till the power was switched off. As news of the deaths spread, locals and members of the farm organization, Bhartiya Kisan Sangathan, gathered at the spot. They staged a dharna, demanding compensation for the victims’ family. Sompal Singh said, “We have repeatedly been complaining to the power department to remove the overhead high tension cables from the residential area but to no avail.” By the time the power department officials reached the spot, a sizable number of people had gathered to protest. Dharmveer Saini, an engineer in the electricity department, said, “The family of the dead would be given Rs 5 lakh for each victim.” He added that a date had been fixed to remove the high tension cables. Sources said Pradeep who was studying in class XII used to help his father in farming. The siblings are survived by another brother and sister. Though no case has so far been registered, investigations are on, said Mukesh Solanki, station house officer, Titavi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/brother-gets-electrocuted-sis-also-dies-trying-to-save-him/articleshow/88229833.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Cops have now confirmed syndicate rivalry and clash of business interests as reasons behind the incident. This is the third shooting in south-suburban Kolkata and Sonarpur in as many months and detective department has increased its presence as Lalbazar has arranged for special bike patrolling till the end of the election. Sources added that the top brass of detective department has asked its ARS unit to launch a drive in south-suburban Kolkata adjoining Sonarpur and Rania to nab all those supplying or carrying country made weapons in the areas between Bansdroni and Regent Park. Baruipur police is likely to be approached for crucial intel and help. Cops are surprised at the way country made weapons are being wielded by local criminals. So far, the police have arrested as many as 19 persons involved in these shootouts. At least three others — Sona Pappu, Sk Vinod and Mohd Tariq — were also arrested in this same period. “The best way to contain these operatives is to keep them behind bars. During Assembly elections, we had kept Pankaj and Victor under watch,” said a detective department officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/6-more-arrested-for-regent-park-shooting/articleshow/88230434.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The 373 non-academic junior resident doctors would comprise only one-fifth of the required strength, said representatives of Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association (KMPGA). This comes after health minister Veena George ruled out any talks, saying the government has done everything possible to address the demands made by the PG medicos. They wanted non-resident junior doctors to be appointed to lessen their workload. The government appointed 373 such junior doctors, whose placement will begin from Monday. Regarding the increase in stipend, the health department has taken it up with the finance department, she added. Veena made it clear that there is no scope for any more talks when PG students are continuing with the strike. The strike is affecting the functioning of the hospitals, and hence they should immediately withdraw from it. “The representatives of PG doctors who held talks with the government twice earlier, expressed satisfaction over the outcome and were willing to withdraw the strike. They are not part of the ongoing strike,” she said. Government has heeded their demands of appointing all those who had passed as senior residents and withdrawal of PG students deployed to family health centres and first-line treatment centres (FLTCs). House surgeons were appointed after expediting the announcement of exam results of the Health University, she said. However, KMPGA is adamant that they will not withdraw the strike until the government agrees to 4% increase in stipend and also place a demand before the Supreme Court to advance the first-year PG admissions. They also want the government to announce a deadline for the appointment of junior residents. The PG medicos have also alleged that the health department has threatened not to allow the striking students to appear for the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/jr-docs-appointments-will-not-reduce-workload-pg-medicos/articleshow/88233037.cms||---

After the condition of the internal & exterior part of the toilet started deteriorating the BMC through JSW foundation has begun repairs of it. Regular walkers on Marine Drive pointed out that currently a mobile toilet has been placed beside the existing toilet (which is being repaired) for the convenience of those visiting the promenade. TimesViewThe public toilet has been a boon for hundreds of daily visitors at this landmark promenade. Since the facility is near the shore, in less than three years, the structure got rapidly corroded. The BMC which built the toilet with CSR funds through a private foundation must ensure it is properly refurbished and renovated.Mahendra Hemdev, a local, said that it appears that the toilet being at close proximity to the sea may have taken a toll on the structure. “There is also a police chowky on the promenade, installed about a year ago which appears to have started corroding,” he said. Assistant municipal commissioner Shivdas Gurav- in charge of A ward said that as the condition of it started deteriorating a need for repairs was felt. “The repairs are being done by the JSW Foundation. We have asked for tiles to be placed inside the facility so that cleaning on a regular basis is also convenient. Currently there were weathering steel sheets that were placed and hence it was not convenient to clean,” said Gurav. Atul Kumar, Vice-president of Nariman Point Churchgate Citizens Welfare Trust (NPCCWT) who noticed the facility being reconstructed said that one of the problems raised by regular walkers was the stink from the toilet owing to it not having a sewage line connection. “It appears that they are replacing the complete structure, however the crux of the problem is the lack of sewage line connection,” said Kumar. Barely a few months after the toilet was inaugurated complaints about it stinking started to come. The toilet does not have a sewage line connection and the same is on the opposite side of the road. Therefore the septic tank in it is cleaned every alternate day through a suction tank. Civic officials however said that as Marine Drive is a VIP stretch laying a sewer line now and connecting it from across the road would mean disrupting traffic and therefore they are looking at newer ways to get the toilet a sewer connection done for instance by undertaking micro tunneling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-1cr-deteriorating-public-sobo-loo-undergoes-repair-again/articleshow/88231563.cms||Richa Pinto

It will host 3,000 religious, spiritual authorities and other dignitaries at the grand Mandir Chowk to witness KVD opening by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. Divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board Deepak Agrawal told TOI on Saturday that the first phase work of KVD shrine area is almost complete and ready to host the PM for the inauguration on Monday. “For the mega opening ceremony, decoration work from Jalasen Ghat to Mandir Chowk and Kashi Vishwanath temple premises has been started,” he added. Heavy machines brought to the KV Dham area for civil work were seen leaving the construction sites, especially near the Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats, from Friday night till Saturday morning. The PM and other invitees will enter the KVD shrine area through the same ghats, hence the area has been cleared following the inspection of SPG team and police. Except for minor finishing work at some buildings, only polishing of marble, granite floors were in progress. Regarding the project, Agrawal said that the Board will finally take over the KVD shrine area after completion of both phases of the project.

Vidarbha has a target of 1.81 crore. As on Saturday morning, the region has completed 1.51 crore first doses and 84.17 lakh second doses. In Nagpur division, 8.68 lakh persons are still unvaccinated while for Amravati the figure is 20.96 lakh. Local administrations claim that they are very close to the target in certain zones. Nagpur city, said additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, is just 7,000 short of its target of 19.73 lakh. “We are now focusing on second dose,” he said. In Bhandara, over 41,000 persons – lowest in Vidarbha — are still unvaccinated though the district had the second lowest target of 8.98 lakh. As per the administration there, migration of native population and many taking their doses elsewhere are reaons behind the graph not moving as quickly. Gachichroli district had the lowest target of 8.37 lakh but still 2.31 lakh persons are yet to take their first dose. Gadchiroli district collector Sanjay Meena said they are extensively pushing for last mile coverage but connectivity and accessibility is a major challenge. “West part of the district having seven talukas have given good response, taking the coverage to 90%. Five talukas which are interior parts have achieved 60% first dose coverage so far,” said the collector. Meena said much rest on door-to-door drive now “as villagers are not coming to the health centres”. “They are busy with farm works which is the priority for them over vaccine. So, we are reaching out to them in night camps which got good response,” he said. The collector further said that no new deadline has been set but daily 10,000 first and second doses are given. All districts have been able to steadily cut the backlog which was around 37 lakh at the start of this month. It has come down to 29.65 lakh. Nagpur district has 2.29 lakh doses due. Of this most are from rural parts. The administration has estimated that a sizeable number of eligible population took its first doses out of the district when vaccine shortage was common. At 5.51 lakh, Yavatmal has the highest number of unvaccinated eligible population. Amravati has considerably reduced its unvaccinated population to 4.78 lakh from a whopping over 10 lakh a month ago. The state government had set November 30 deadline for all districts to complete the first dose of eligible population but many couldn’t achieve it. It was expected that the people would continue to show same zeal but the footfall have dipped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-vid-district-achieves-first-dose-coverage-target/articleshow/88231063.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The collected waste was handed over to the local body for scientific disposal.R Manikandan, coordinator of Kovai Kulangal Padhugappu Amaippu, said that visitors, temple administration and the district administration are equally responsible for accumulation of banned plastic in public places. “The temple surroundings are ecologically-sensitive zones as a large number of wild animals visit the place frequently. Stringent restriction should be in place to prevent plastic waste being dumped there. The district administration should enforce the ban against single-use plastic. The temple administration should place sufficient bins and ensure that devotees use them. Elephants, monkeys and wild boars that visit the area may eat plastic that block their digestive system,” he said.“Temple authorities said that bins are damaged by wild boars. We are planning to install some bins that cannot be accessed by wild boars,” Manikandan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/marudhamalai-cleared-of-300kg-plastic-waste/articleshow/88230978.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Teacher beats Class XI student for altering uniform, booked||COIMBATORE: The city police have registered a case against a private schoolteacher on Saturday for beating a Class XI boy student on the school premises at Ganapathy here two days ago. The school management has placed the teacher, identified as 34-year-old K Sivaranjith Kumar, under suspension. A native of Alampalayam village near Annur, Sivaranjith was teaching physics at the private matriculation higher secondary school at Ganapathy for the past three years. “He was residing at KRG Nagar at Ganapathy,” a police officer said. The officer said the school management had provided uniforms to the students last week. “The boy in question had altered the uniforms, as the size was unfit for him. When the teacher found that out on Thursday, he reportedly thrashed the boy with his bare hands, leaking marks on his back and shoulders.” The boy informed his parents, who took him to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he was treated as an outpatient. Based on the boy’s complaint, the Saravanampatti police registered a case against the teacher under Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. “We will conduct an inquiry with the boy’s classmates on Monday,” the officer said.

The survey, which was conducted in the last two months, covered 3.5 lakh children across 1,400 villages. The survey revealed that a combination of factors such as child marriages, irregular health check-ups or inadequate facilities for the same and low hemoglobin levels among pregnant women, besides lack of awareness, contributed to the cases of ‘extreme’ and ‘moderate’ malnourishment among the 0-6 years age group children in villages across the Pune district. JB Girase, the ZP’s deputy CEO and head of the women and child welfare department, said, “We have asked the gram panchayats concerned to provide a special diet to the identified women and their children. The government is also providing diet kits to improve their health. Community health officers and anganwadi workers are regularly monitoring the health condition of these children.” On Saturday, Ayush Prasad, the ZP’s CEO, held a special meeting at the Aundh district hospital to decide on a strategy to find apt measures on the ground to address the issue. Prasad said, “We will conduct tehsil-wise special health camps across the district. A comprehensive plan is being formulated and it will be implemented effectively.” Experts and pediatricians said it was a bigger social issue and needed to be dealt with in a sensitive manner. Dr Sharad Agarkhedkar, head of the pediatric department of the Dr. DY Patil medical college, said, “The malnourished kids are usually from the low-income group families. They can’t afford apt nutrients-based diets. They will have the diets at hospitals, but once they return to their native places, they do not follow it due to their financial conditions.” Agarkhedkar, who has worked in this subject in Mulshi and slum pockets of Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad, for the last decade, said, “Asha workers and anganwadi workers have been doing sincere work. But, they sometimes go on strike due to various reasons. In the process, the programme gets hampered. The authorities need to consider this aspect also in their strategy.” Jyotikumar Kulkarni, secretary of the NGO Niramay, which is working for malnourished children in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits, said, “ To create awareness among anganwadi workers, we are going to conduct a special training session for 1,400 workers in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/zp-identifies-over-1800-malnourished-children/articleshow/88230431.cms||Sandip Dighe

Officials said a 35-year-old man, who was fully vaccinated and had a history of travel to Zimbabwe and South Africa, tested positive for the new variant. He is currently under treatment at Lok Nayak hospital, said a senior official. “The patient only has weakness. He is doing fine,” he added. Last Sunday, a 37-year-old fully vaccinated man who arrived in Delhi from Tanzania, became the first patient of Omicron in the capital. The patient, a resident of Ranchi, travelled from Tanzania to Doha and then came to Delhi on a Qatar Airways flight on December 2. So far, Omicron cases have been detected in Maharashtra, which has the highest number of patients, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Delhi. A senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital, designated for isolation and treatment of persons coming from at-risk nations, told TOI that a total of 38 Omicron suspects had been admitted to date. “Genome sequencing has been completed on 27 samples. Of them, two have come positive,” the doctor said. On Friday, the Centre warned about the decline in usage of face masks across the country amid the emergence of the Omicron. Dr V K Paul, NITI Aayog member (health), said people are operating at a “risky and unacceptable” level, stressing that both masks and vaccines are essential for protection against coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The number of cases of Covid-19 caused by the new variant is already on the rise across the world. Dr N K Mehra, an honorary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told TOI recently that all available information suggests that the new variant is more transmissible and, therefore, it has the potential to replace Delta as the predominant variant indeed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2nd-omicron-case-in-city-doing-fine-says-official/articleshow/88231040.cms||---

Official sources said that Prakash would look after route linings, traffic management and parking, while Shrivastava would be in charge of the control room operations. “Both officials were posted in the city in the past, their experience will come in handy,” said an official. Besides these two, additional commissioner, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba, will supervise security arrangements at the Vidhyadhar Nagar stadium. Lakhs of supporters are expected to gather at the venue including some of the top party leaders. Zaidi said that the city police have made adequate security arrangements for the rally. On Saturday, police officials attached for the task held a series of meetings at the venue and later debriefed inspectors about important tasks. Several police teams visited nearby high-rise buildings as a measure to enhance security arrangements. City police for the past several days had increased its night search, patrolling and checking at key areas in the run-up to the mega rally which is expected to be attended by lakhs of supporters and party workers. Police said that along with the VIP security arrangements, traffic and parking will also be a major priority. “We have directed all our officials posted for the duty to be in seamless communication with their seniors and subordinates. If there are any unexpected bottlenecks, it would be quickly resolved,” said the official. Police teams have already set up barricades and pickets all across the city to facilitate vehicular traffic movement throughout important arterial roads of Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tight-security-for-cong-rally/articleshow/88231009.cms||---

According to joint CP (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma, the complainant, Jhumur Kundu, a resident of Unique Park in Behala — employed at Nabanna claimed — that the accused had entered into a criminal conspiracy with others and contacted the complainant over phone and induced her to download the Any Desk app. “The accused, thus, managed to obtain the personal bank details, like card number, CVV and OTP and siphoned off an amount of Rs 27,000 from the account of the complainant and misappropriated the money. The fund was used to purchase a mobile and the delivery of the same was taken by the accused at Asansol. Accordingly, he was arrested on December 9 and brought to Kolkata. He is presently in police custody till December 14,” said Sharma. Meanwhile, the detective department has yet again warned WhatsApp users to be aware of the various cyber crimes that are being recently committed through WhatsApp.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyber-fraud-gang-leader-held-from-asansol/articleshow/88230448.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

When asked about the demand of Congress to suspend rallies in Bengal elections due to Corona, Gehlot said that there is a huge difference now. Replying to a question during the press conference he asked, “Is there any demand for oxygen today, is anyone on ventilator? There was an outcry at that time. There was no oxygen available, no medicines available. People were dying due to lack of oxygen. Today, the situation is not like that.” Gehlot said, the Prime Minister had no idea that this variant would later be called Delta. The Centre did not understand the intensity of the second wave, he said. PCC chief Dotasra reiterated that masks and Covid protocol will be followed in the rally.

Postal deliveries have been running late. Therefore, the postal department was forced to rope in private vehicles to deliver posts and parcels. Despite this arrangement, about 2,000 parcels and posts are being sent on alternate days. Top officials of the postal department said the state has a network of about 16, 000 post offices. The service in the rural areas is said to be most affected due to the ongoing strike. Aurangabad and Jalna districts have 87 post offices, of which, the services at 20 are significantly affected. Senior superintendent G Hariprasad, who heads the two districts, has confirmed about the services being affected due to the ongoing strike. He said efforts are being made to address the issue by roping in private vehicles. He said the postal department employees are walking the extra mile to ensure posts reach their destinations on time. Several employees in the rural areas are using their two-wheelers for the same. Authorities said the postal offices, which are connected to railway tracks, have not been affected as the posts are being sent in trains. In some cases, the post offices enroute railway tracks are sent additional posts and parcels from the neighbouring postal offices, that were otherwise sent in ST buses. Beed division’s assistant superintendent Asadullah Shaikh said they have hired three vehicles for the transportation of posts. “One vehicle has been deployed for delivery of outstation posts, while two for within the district,” he said. Senior officials said they were wrong in estimating that the ongoing strike will be called off within the first week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/msrtc-employees-agitation-causes-postal-delivery-delays/articleshow/88229301.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The CJ was addressing a three-day national seminar on ‘Religious Rights of Women and Human Rights in the 21st century’, organised jointly by the National University for Studies and Research in Law, University Grants Commission, the Women’s Studies Centre of Patna University and the Jharkhand High Court Legal Service Committee. He opined that apart from various acts and judicial pronouncements, there is a need for change in the society’s mindset. He added that real change will occur only when women start building their life and it has already starting happening to some extent. He stated, “For India to be truly democratic and a vibrant republic, it should address the issues of democratic and religious rights of women.” Former Supreme Court judge Gyan Sudha Mishra said that all sections of society must learn to express their views objectively and fearlessly on issues that have an impact on the society. She said that in many families, women discriminate against other female members because they cannot think dispassionately. Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh stated that changes in laws have been made to remove discrimination against women but several issues including unfavourable male female ratio and domestic violence are matters of concern. He said that education could be crucial in bringing about a change in status of women. He said it is the responsibility of everyone to improve their situation. Justice S N Prasad pointed out that despite the enactment of several laws, the concept of equality of women is at a nascent stage. He said that the discussion should deliberate upon reasons for the situation and what could be done to improve it. He said that women should also be bold and come forward to fight for their rights. The chairperson of National Commission for Women, Rekha Sharma, professor of Delhi University Alka Chawla and Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan were among the dignitaries who spoke on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lot-more-still-needs-to-be-done-for-womens-rights-says-cj/articleshow/88214245.cms||Sanjay Sahay

Amrut Ijari, Mahesh Pattar, NH Patil, Pundalik Badiger and other activists, who issued a statement to the press, cited the Mahadayi Water Dispute Tribunal’s order, which allotted 13.5tmcft of water to Karnataka. The project, which aims at diverting water from the Mahadayi River to the Malaprabha, once completed will supply drinking water to Dharwad and the neighbouring districts. “The BJP is in power in Karnataka, and at the Centre. Such being the case, any niggling issues must be resolved at the earliest,” the statement read. The activists sought to remind chief minister Basavaraj Bommai of his contribution to their fight – the CM had written a letter using his own blood a decade ago, to affirm his commitment to meet the drinking water requirements of North Karnataka. “He went on to become the water resources minister and is now the CM. He has much knowledge about this issue. The government must not defer implementation of the project anymore. Any further delay will only result in the people of North Karnataka launching another agitation,” the samiti warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kalasa-banduri-activists-want-resolution-on-dispute-in-belagavi-session/articleshow/88230466.cms||---

But she did not make it there – a pack of stray dogs surrounded and mauled her. By the time, villagers heard her screams and reached the spot, it was too late. The pack disappeared leaving the bleeding girl. She was taken to a private hospital where she succumbed to injuries. The attack took place on Friday at Husainpur village under Saidnangali police station area of Amroha. When contacted, Dr Narender Singh, additional chief veterinary officer, said, “We have not received any information about the death. In case it is true, we will take measures to catch the dogs.” According to villagers, this is not the first time an incident of stray dogs’ attack. Six months ago, a pack had mauled a farmer's son at Deeppur village. Rajesh Kumar of Deeppur village said, “Stray dogs have attacked several children in the past. But our pleas to the authorities to catch and take the strays away have fallen on deaf ears.” Not expecting any help from the authorities, this time, villagers have decided to deal with the stray dog menace on their own. A decision was taken that children will not be allowed to go out of their homes without the supervision of an elder person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/stray-dogs-maul-15-year-old-to-death-in-amroha/articleshow/88229868.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Dehradun||CM PRO directs police to release 3 trucks challaned for overloading; dismissed after letter goes viral||Dehradun: A letter issued by the public relations officer (PRO) of chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, to superintendent of police, Bageshwar, directing the latter to cancel challan of three soapstone-laden trucks has gone viral on social media, causing major embarrassment to the state government. Following the episode, the government dismissed the officer in question and ordered a probe. Besides, all PROs and coordinators working in the CMO have been restricted from using the official letterhead for writing letters to state officers. The letter was issued on CM's official letter head by Nandan Singh Bisht, PRO of CM Dhami, on December 8. It reads, “The CM has verbally directed me to inform you to cancel the challan of vehicle numbers -- UK 2AC 0238, UK02 CA 1238 and UK04 CA 5907 -- that had been issued by the traffic police of Bageshwar.” A copy of the letter was also sent to the regional transport office (RTO). The three trucks were issued challan for overloading. When asked about the issue, agriculture minister and government spokesperson, Subodh Uniyal, said, “Bisht has been dismissed from his post and a probe has been ordered to ascertain the authenticity of the letter. The CM has issued strict instructions to all employees to take action against illegal mining and corruption. Our government follows a zero-tolerance approach towards such crimes.” Meanwhile, SP Bageshwar Amit Srivastava, said, “I have come to know about this letter only through social media. I have not yet received any such letter from the CMO.” Sharing details of the case, the SP added, “Three truck drivers were penalised for overloading on November 29. Subsequently, on December 2, a copy of the challan was moved to the assistant regional transport officer's office. It has come to my attention that the truck owners have deposited the challan of Rs 45,000 in the ARTO office.” The officer pointed out that the three trucks were not impounded and only a challan was issued for overloading. However, the letter has given the opposition Congress a major issue before the upcoming elections. Attacking the incumbent government, deputy leader of opposition and Congress MLA from Ranikhet, Karan Mahra, told TOI, “The CM office is forcing top police officers to release trucks loaded with soapstone. It has now become clear that the BJP government is encouraging such activities in the state and sheltering criminals.” The Congress leader also claimed that two out of the three trucks belonged to a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM). “In fact, CM Dhami inaugurated a school owned by the BJYM leader, who owns two of these three trucks, on November 27,” Mahra added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cm-pro-directs-police-to-release-3-trucks-challaned-for-overloading-dismissed-after-letter-goes-viral/articleshow/88230469.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||No major dip in domestic footfall at Delhi's IGI airport||NEW DELHI: Domestic air travel was back to almost 90% of pre-Covid 2019 levels at India’s busiest airport — Delhi’s IGIA— when news of the Omicron variant surfaced in the last week of November. So far, while there has been no major dip in the number of domestic flyers to and from here, their steady post-second wave growth has plateaued, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar told TOI. “Pre-Omicron, international traffic was at 45% of pre-Covid 2019 levels through air bubble flights. This has not dipped so far due to reasons like international travellers fearing fresh travel restrictions globally and hence, preponing their planned journey to or from India. For instance, a number of Indian students studying abroad preponed their trip home this holiday season,” Jaipuriar said. IGIA — the world’s fifth busiest airport in terms of seat deployment by airlines this month according to UK-based air consultancy firm OAG — has seen a rollercoaster ride during the pandemic. It witnessed about 7 crore passengers in pre-pandemic 2019, with 5 crore being domestic and 2 crore international. Then Covid led to a two-month nation-wide lockdown last year and a continued suspension of international flights since last March. “Traffic was recovering well post the first wave and we were at 75-80% domestic and overall 60% in terms of domestic plus international (of pre-Covid level) by this February-March. Then the second wave came and we saw domestic plunging to 20-22% and international 10-12%, and overall drop to 20% for about 1-1.5 months this April-May,” Jaipuriar said. Later, as the second wave eased, traffic recovered quickly. That was till Omicron emerged. While to the aviation industry’s relief, there has so far not been a major drop in domestic traffic, the new variant has further delayed resumption of regular foreign flights. “International passengers are high-spenders at airports (duty free shopping leading to non-aeronautical earnings). Most international airlines fly in wide body aircraft (higher aeronautical earnings). So thanks to domestic traffic, numbers may look good but revenue-wise airports are a long way from pre-Covid levels. While the average per international passenger spend at the airport is back to pre-Covid level of $12-13, their low numbers keep non-aero revenues subdued,” the CEO said. In pre-Covid times, peak winter international travel used to last till mid-January. “The number of international passengers on bubble flights has plateaued. Their numbers may go down from next month,” Jaipuriar said. Regular international flights were supposed to resume on December 15, but Omicron has led to them remaining suspended till January 31, 2022, as of now. Domestic travel continues, as states have so far desisted from having different entry rules in terms of testing and quarantine. Only Maharashtra tried to have its own rules, but later did not go ahead with them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-major-dip-in-domestic-footfall-at-igi/articleshow/88231054.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Mumbai||Builders protest Mhada's 'rigged' redevelopment tender||MUMBAI: The city's largest redevelopment project, Motilal Nagar in Goregaon (West), is mired in controversy amidst allegations that the state housing authority (Mhada) has tailor-made the tender document to keep most builders out. Mhada has inserted a clause stating only developers with a net worth of not less than Rs 9,000 crore as on March 31, 2021, can qualify. TOI has learned that two top developers, Godrej Properties and Prestige Group, have shot off protest letters to Mhada. Monday is the last day to submit bids for the Rs 28,000 crore project spread over 143 acres, comprising Motilal Nagar I, II and III. There is already a flutter in Mumbai's construction industry as some of the city's leading developers told TOI they would not be able to participate due to this clause. State housing minister Jitendra Awhad said he had no idea about it. ‘Motilal Nagar tender will open avenues for monopolistic plans’Motilal Nagar redevelopment project in Goregaon is mired in controversy amidst allegations that Mhada has tailor-made the tender document to keep most builders out. A leading Mumbai-based developer, not wishing to be identified, said, “The tender conditions are engineered to exclude all Mumbai developers and seem to favour a firm that has no experience in redevelopment. This is nothing but cronyism at its best.” When asked about the controversial clause, state housing minister Jitendra Awhad, who had announced the redevelopment project recently, messaged, “I have no idea about it. Check on Monday.” Mhada vice-president Anil Diggikar did not respond to calls and messages from TOI. Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairman of Godrej Properties, said he would not like to comment. However, TOI has a copy of the complaint letter Godrej Properties sent to Mhada last week. “The financial capability of the tender, wherein the qualifying parameter for the construction and development agency is to have a net worth of Rs. 9000 crore, is not only discriminatory but will eliminate various intending bidders, including us, from participating in the bid. It will also act as an undue advantage to handful entities who may not even have requisite on-ground experience to provide housing, accommodation or rehabilitation,” said the Godrej Properties letter. It further said, “The Tender in its current form will open avenues for monopolistic endeavours, which is also against the public policy of India. It is a legitimate expectation from a government undertaking to provide a level playing field during the tendering process, which ensures healthy competition amongst bidders to yield results in the best interest of the general public. And in the instant case to ensure housing for slum dwellers/tenants for whom it is a matter of survival.” It requested Mhada to “reasonably reduce/relax the norms to enable more bidders to participate which will entail better prospects for existing dwellers and MHADA”. Bangalore-based Prestige Group too complained to the housing authority. The letter signed by Prestige Estates Projects CEO, Venkat Narayana, said, “…financial capability criteria as contained in the tender requires a single entity to have a net worth of not less than Rs 9,000 crore as on 31st March 2021. We submit that these criteria are not only onerous but also not commensurate with the size of the project. Despite being one of the largest real estate developers in the country, we are unable to meet the net worth criteria, which is far beyond what is required for undertaking a project of this size. We request you to kindly reconsider the net worth criteria in line with the size of the project and which will ensure effective competition.’’ The Mhada tender has been floated under the public- private partnership model to rehabilitate about 3,717 Mhada tenants and 1,600 slum dwellers. Motilal Nagar was built in the 1960s as a rehabilitation and resettlement colony of the residents who were displaced from different locations in the city and suburbs. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had laid the foundation stone of this resettlement colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-motilal-nagar-tender-will-open-avenues-for-monopolistic-plans/articleshow/88231599.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Chandigarh||Amidst fear of Omicron, Delta rules roost in region||CHANDIGARH: Even as Omicron (B.1.1.529), the highly infectious variant of the coronavirus, has generated much fear and panic among the health experts and public, Delta (B.1.6172) lineage of the virus is wreaking havoc in the region. No sample has so far been tested positive for Omicron in Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, while the Delta variant that fuelled the deadly second wave of the infection has been found in 3,273 samples and Delta Plus — a sub-lineage of Delta with three mutations in spike — in 10 samples examined for genome sequencing. In Punjab, the count of Delta and Delta Plus variants detected in Covid-19 positive samples stands at 1,427 and two. As many as 1,027 samples have been tested positive for Delta and one for Delta Plus in Himachal Pradesh, while 485 Delta and three Delta Plus in Haryana. A total of 334 Delta and four Delta Plus variants have found in samples examined in Chandigarh. According to initial research, the new strain, which was first detected in South Africa, has so far exhibited over 30 mutations in comparison to Delta’s 18 and is said to be over four-times more transmissible than Delta. As there is no evidence, at present, that Covid vaccines are not effective against new variants and are still considered as the safe method of gaining immunity, the central government has been asking the state government for ensuring rapid vaccination coverage for all eligible beneficiaries. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, a pulmonologist, said adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination were the two best ways of countering the threat emerging for variants of concern. “Vaccines generate a wide immune response and are likely to be effective against variants. Mutations are unlikely to make vaccines completely ineffective,” said Dr Bhaskar. Out of 2,06,55,301 eligible population, Punjab has managed to fully vaccinate around 40% or 81,70,450 beneficiaries. Over 81% of the targeted population have been given their first jab. Himachal has covered half of the eligible population with both doses, while Haryana is close to touching the halfway mark. Following an alert issued by the central government, the health authorities of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal and Chandigarh have ramped up precautionary measures against Omicron. Monitoring of international travellers in the community has been started, while all the positive samples are being sent for genome sequencing to INSACOG labs. Besides, ensuring early identification of cases through adequate testing and contact tracing, the central government has also asked the respective state governments for keeping the health infrastructure ready.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/amidst-fear-of-omicron-delta-rules-roost-in-region/articleshow/88231023.cms||Vinod Kumar

The unemployment rate is highest in the state, why you have not been given unemployment allowance?” reads the question. “I don’t have any hope that you would answer these questions, but you shouldn’t be missing entertaining the audience,” said Poonia. Deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Singh Rathore, asked Gehlot to tell people what all efforts he had taken to curb inflation and price rise in the past three years. “The Congress in its manifesto had promised to take measures to control the price rise. On the contrary, they have imposed the highest Value Added Tax on petrol and diesel, costly electricity and the highest mandi tax is spearheading inflation,” said Rathore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-asks-rahul-gandhi-to-fulfill-poll-promises-first/articleshow/88231043.cms||---

The road condition in these two prime areas is poor and has often generated angry reactions from residents as well as people visiting the bazaar area. Over the last few months, multiple locations have seen potholes emerging after rain and owing to traffic burden. Khadki cantonment’s chief executive officer Pramod Kumar Singh said, “We have released the work orders worth Rs20 lakh out of the total Rs60 lakh project and the actual work will start from Monday.” The Ambedkar Road connects the cantonment board with areas under Pune Municipal Corporation. The condition of the roads has deteriorated as the vehicular movement of the old Pune-Mumbai has been diverted through the Khadki Bazaar areas due to the ongoing work on the stretch from Harris Bridge to the All Saints Chowk.“The vehicular flow has increased by more than a double.

The PM will attend virtually the three-day function on December 13. "Today, as the foundation stone-laying ceremony of a grand temple is being performed by Arya Samaji Acharya Devvrat (governor of Gujarat), I would like to say that Modiji has worked fearlessly and with faith and respect for the renovation of our forgotten centres of faith," Shah said, underscoring that there was a time when people were ashamed to go to temples, but that changed under the leadership of PM Modi. He said "a new era has ushered in from the time PM Modi, having won the 2014 elections with full majority, performed Ganga aarti after applying sacred ash on his forehead at Kashi Vishwanath temple". Shah said the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi was demolished during Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's time and it has undergone renovation and restoration that will be unveiled by PM Modi on December 13. He also mentioned how PM unveiled the statue of Adi Shankaracharya and revived the faith of crores of Hindus at Kedarnath temple.

With this, he became the seventh President to review IMA's POP. The President began his address by condoling the death of General Bipin Rawat and 12 others in the chopper crash on Wednesday. He said, “We gather here today when the nation is yet to come out of the shock of the death of the chief of defence staff, General Bipin Rawat, and 12 others, including his wife. General Rawat was an extraordinary military leader and his death has created a void that cannot be filled.” He added, “Uttarakhand was his (Gen Rawat's) home state and he was trained at the IMA itself. Gen Rawat, who was awarded the Sword of Honour here, added to the glory of this institution.” The President underscored the need for the Army to embrace modern-day technology. “Advancement in technology is often driven by military dynamics. The battlefield, today, presents a multidimensional situation... Armed forces across the world are heavily reliant on the use of tech to deter or defeat the enemies’ fighting capability. As modern-day military leaders, you must embrace this technological shift and understand the seamless synergy required between men and machines. It is, therefore, imperative that you develop sound scientific temperament,” said Kovind. The passing out parade on Saturday marked the culmination of the training of 319 Gentleman Cadets (GCs) from India and 68 GCs from 10 friendly foreign nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/modern-military-leaders-must-embrace-tech-president-kovind-at-ima/articleshow/88230474.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Allahabad||New academic building with latest amenities at MNNIT campus soon||Prayagraj: State’s lone NIT- Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad- will soon get a brand new modern academic building, embellished with all the latest amenities, soon. The building would be constructed at a cost of Rs 37 crores. The Union Ministry of Education has sanctioned the budget for the building to the institute. According to director, MNNIT, Prof Rajeev Tripathi, “The institute has in turn now entrusted the construction responsibility to Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the central agency which has earlier too taken up vital construction work on its campus.” This three-floor building (ground floor + two floors), will be built near the existing library of the institute. Besides a library, washrooms and power backup, the building will have high-tech conference rooms and labs with state-of-the-art equipment, he added. As soon as the building is completed, some departments, such as humanities and social sciences, mathematics, and electronics and communication engineering, could move into it, and others facing space crunch could be given space on vacated sites, said Prof Tripathi. It is worth mentioning that in the year 2019, the Central government had directed the implementation of a 10 per cent economically weaker section (EWS) quota in educational institutions. Under this, 25 per cent of seats were increased in institutions, including at MNNIT. The new building is being constructed to alleviate the shortage of space and resources caused by the gradual increase of seats in the institute under the EWS quota. After increasing the seats, the need to increase the infrastructure was being intensely felt. With higher percentage of students, it had become imperative to increase the infrastructure too accordingly, the director explained. Prof Tripathi said that a detailed proposal was prepared and sent to the Union Ministry of Education for approval and sanction of the requisite funds. Now the funds worth Rs 37 crores have been sanctioned for it and the institute has accordingly entrusted the task of construction of this new building to CPWD, which would soon kickstart the construction on the selected site in the campus soon. It has already started the soil testing works, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/new-academic-building-with-latest-amenities-at-mnnit-campus-soon/articleshow/88231055.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Magh Mela 2022: Dist admin plans to curb wastewater from falling in Ganga||Prayagraj: All the drains emptying in river Ganga and Yamuna would be tapped and weekly sampling of the water of these drains would be done thrice a week, starting from January 1, 2022. This and many more important decisions were made at a progress review meeting of the works of Magh Mela 2022 held under the chairmanship of Divisional Commissioner Sanjay Goyal, on Friday. In the meeting, held at ICCC auditorium located in the Mela office, it was decided that given maintaining the cleanliness of the rivers, necessary guidelines be given to the authorities concerned to prevent 100% discharge of untreated sewage into rivers. Besides, samples of the water from drains would be collected and the same would be tested at labs of the pollution control board and Ganga pollution control unit as the lab located at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT) has limited resources. To stop the erosion due to the strong currents of river Ganga in various places of the Mela area, the irrigation department has been asked to take the necessary steps to check the erosion. While reviewing the works of the Public Works Department (PWD), it was directed that as the pace of construction of pontoon bridges, being built in the Mela area is slow, the officials were instructed to ensure that bridge numbers 1 and 2, being built on Mahavir and Triveni marg, should be completed by December 15 and the other three bridges, by December 25. Given the pandemic and the necessary precautions to be taken thereof, the health department has been instructed to arrange sampling centres and ambulances in sufficient quantity. The department is also making arrangements for 15 sampling centres, 30 ambulances and about 11 vaccination centres for the mela this time. For hygiene and cleanliness, it has been agreed to build 15,000 toilets in the mela area. Of these, there would be 1500 pre-fabricated steel toilets, 3000 tent toilets, 300 urinals, 9000 institutional toilets and 900 at government institutions. For the devotees, authorities would be constructing at least 10 ghats, stretching from Nagvasuki to Sangam. Because of these ghats, the number of devotees wanting to bathe at Sangam would be diverted. It has been made clear to all that consumption of non-veg, liquor or any other type of substance abuse is strictly prohibited in the mela area. Likewise, obscene or vulgar dance or songs will also be prohibited. Authorities have decided that like previous melas, there would be two central control rooms for the Bhule-Bhatke shivir (lost and found people). The entire mela area would be illuminated by several high-mast and proper lighting. Installing blowers or heaters in the camps would be prohibited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/magh-mela-2022-dist-admin-plans-to-curb-wastewater-from-falling-in-ganga/articleshow/88231047.cms||---
---||Delhi||BJP: Fix public transport issue to tackle pollution||New Delhi: Leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, on Saturday demanded that the AAP government should work on the fundamental problems of air pollution rather than resorting to knee-jerk reactions. “Till the time public transport is not accessible to the public, the people of Delhi will continue to be forced to travel in personal vehicles. In such conditions, it is impossible to control pollution in the city. Not a single bus was added to the DTC fleet in Delhi for seven years. All the buses that are running have completed their life. In this way, they are also playing with the lives of people. The central government had announced a subsidy for electric buses to Delhi in 2017 itself, but the Delhi government did not take any advantage of that scheme,” Bidhuri stated. In a statement, Bidhuri said the Delhi government must accept that most of the pollution in Delhi is due to internal reasons of the city. “When they accept this, only then will the Delhi government be able to formulate a policy to reduce pollution. The condition of the roads of Delhi has become very bad,” Bidhuri stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-fix-public-transport-issue-to-tackle-pollution/articleshow/88231058.cms||---

Speaking to media at the airport regarding the increased prices of petrol and diesel, Hooda said that the deal of agriculture in Rajasthan was expensive even earlier, it is expensive even today. Because VAT is high on petrol and diesel. Today, the situation is such that the cost of the farmer is increasing and the income is decreasing. Therefore, all the state governments should give relief to the farmers by reducing VAT. Giving the example of Haryana, he said that earlier diesel was the cheapest in the country in Haryana because VAT was 9.25%. Now, Haryana has also levied more than 18% VAT. States where VAT is high should reduce it so that farmers get relief on diesel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/former-haryana-cm-hooda-bats-for-reduction-in-vat-on-petrol-diesel/articleshow/88231051.cms||---

After landing at Pilani, a large procession carried the mortal remains to his home where the villagers had already made the preparations a day prior in anticipation of the arrival. Singh was one of the 13 who was killed in the chopper crash in the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. His mortal remains were handed over to the family after he was positively identified by DNA testing. Singh was a native of Ghardana Khurd, located 42km from the district headquarters. From Jhunjhunu to his native village, there was a complete procession with thousands of people gathered on the sides of the roads who raised slogans for the deceased officers as well as pelted the coffin with flower petals. “The entire stretch from Jhunjhunu to Ghardana was packed with people who had come to pay homage to the son of the soil. His sister who was in uniform and his wife were in front of the procession and there was not a single dry eye at the scene. We are proud of his sacrifice although it is still unbelievable that he is no more with us. His sacrifice will be a source of inspiration to other youth not just in Jhunjhunu but across Rajasthan,” said a local who was part of the rally for the officer’s last journey.

The passing out parade (POP) was reviewed by President Ram Nath Kovind. In light of the toned-down ceremony, the academy did away with the tradition of bringing the reviewing officer to historic Drill Square, where the parade is held, in a horse-driven carriage. The tricolour also few at half-mast as a mark of respect to the 13 lives lost in the chopper crash. The flower petal showering ceremony after the GCs are commissioned was also given a miss.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Railway pass forger let off on bond of good behaviour||MUMBAI: Observing that release after imprisonment decreases the capacity of an offender to adjust to normal society and association with professional delinquents often has undesired effects on their lives, a magistrate allowed a convicted 25-year-old city-based interior designer’s plea to be let off on a bond of good behaviour after she pleaded guilty to forging her monthly railway pass just to avoid the trouble of renewing it. The woman, Afrin Shaikh, had spent 21 days in jail after she was arrested in February 2015. She has been out on bail. Shaikh will have to pay Rs 3,000 as compensation to Western Railways. “It is needless to mention here that if the accused is put behind bars for this act, which she has committed in ignorance, it will not only destroy her career but also her life, which is already in a miserable state,” Metropolitan Magistrate J C Dhengale said. Shaikh was widowed two years into her marriage and her father had died when she was 9. She sought leniency, saying she was already leading a miserable life. Shaikh added she has the responsibility of her aged mother and two younger brothers who are studying. While the offences under which Shaikh was booked provided a maximum sentence of seven years’ imprisonment, the court let her off on a bond of good behaviour under the Probation of Offenders Act. The Act allows an accused to be released on a bond of good behaviour instead of her serving a sentence. “The accused shall execute a bond of Rs 50,000 to keep peace and good behaviour for the period of two years,” the court said. The court said there are no allegations of misappropriation of funds. “Furthermore, it is also not the case of prosecution that the accused is running the racket of forging travelling passes. It is the single case of forging the serial number of a travelling pass and that is of her own pass only. Furthermore, as mentioned above, this act is done by the accused in ignorance, without knowing the consequences of her act,” the court said. Imposing conditions, the court said she is to appear and receive the sentence if called upon during the two-year period. The court also directed her not to do any acts that may lead to breach of peace. “To be of good behaviour to the state government, Government of India and to all India nationals during the period,” the court said among its conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rly-pass-forger-let-off-on-bond-of-good-behaviour/articleshow/88231608.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: First brain aneurysm surgery performed at SRN hospital||PRAYAGRAJ: In a first, a team of doctors of neurosurgery department of Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital (SRNH), an associate hospital of MLN Medical College of the Sangam city, has successfully performed a surgery of brain aneurysm. Also known as a subarachnoid haemorrhage, brain aneurysm is a weak spot in the wall of a blood vessel inside the brain. Head of the Neurosurgery department of MLN Medical college, Dr NN Gopal said, “It is for the first time that in the field of neurovascular surgery in SRN Hospital, such a complicated operation has been successfully performed. Brain aneurysms are balloon like out-pouching of brain arteries, which bleeds easily and results in hematoma or blood collection inside the brain. This is a very dangerous situation as it can cause coma or even death.” He further added that since it has the tendency to bleed again and again, it needs either microsurgical clipping or endovascular treatment. Therefore, it is one of the most dangerous and complicated surgeries in neurosurgical domain, explains Dr Shabi Ahmed, head of the surgery department. The clipping of aneurysm was performed by a team, including Dr Pankaj Gupta, Dr SD Pandey and Dr SA Dubey, under the supervision of Dr NN Gopal and Dr Amit Singh. Dr Pankaj Gupta said patient’s condition was now stable and he was recovering satisfactorily. In this surgery, doctors explored the base of the brain, searched out the aneurysm and clipped it, which was a complicated task. In collaboration with neurosurgery department, ENT department head Dr Sachin Jain, anaesthetist Dr Vaibhav Singh, Dr Sachin Singh, Dr KC Gupta, Dr Ashish Singh and staff nurse Mamta, provided technical support to accomplish the job. In the past, there was no facility to operate such cases in SRN, but now this has become possible with all advanced equipment provided under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Principal, MLN Medical College, Prof SP Singh said that in the field of Neurovascular surgery, SRN has become just the fourth in state after Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), King George Medical University (KGMU) and RML Institute of Medical Sciences, where aneurysm surgeries are getting done. Prof Singh also congratulated the whole team on successfully performing this surgery at SRNH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/first-brain-aneurysm-surgery-performed-at-srn-hospital/articleshow/88231061.cms||---

They laid wreaths at Amar Jawan Jyoti in Jaipur and observed two-minute silence. "The whole country has been shaken by the helicopter mishap that happened with General Bipin Rawat and other military officers. There is a wave of mourning in the country," Gehlot told reporters. General Rawat, his wife Madhulika Rawat, and 11 other defence personnel were killed when a Mi17V5 helicopter carrying them crashed near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday. "General Rawat had a long experience in the Army that is why he was made the Chief of Defence Staff. He and other officers are not among us. We all pray to God to give peace to the departed souls and give strength to their families in this time of mourning," Gehlot said.

---||Delhi||Mercury dips a bit, minimum temperature in Delhi at season’s lowest||NEW DELHI: Delhi recorded the lowest minimum temperature of the season at 8.3 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, on Saturday. However, Jafarpur was the coldest station as the minimum temperature dipped to 7.6 degrees Celsius, followed by Lodhi Road at 8 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the air quality of the capital improved as it again touched the ‘poor’ category with an overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of 281 on Saturday. Delhi’s AQI was 314 in the ‘very poor’ category on Friday. Before this, Safdarjung recorded the season’s lowest temperature on December 9 at 8.4 degrees Celsius. A Met official said the absence of cloud cover makes the day warm, while the heat quickly dissipates at night, which causes a fall in minimum temperature. The maximum temperature on Saturday was recorded at 23.7 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. Track the pollution level in your cityAccording to the forecast of India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature is likely to touch 8 degrees Celsius on Sunday and Monday. However, the night temperature is expected to rise marginally from Tuesday. The Met department said the minimum temperature is predicted to hover around 9-10 degrees Celsius between December 14 and 16. “Under the influence of a western disturbance, the wind direction is predicted to change to easterly on the night of December 13, causing a rise in minimum temperature,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. However, Delhi’s air quality, which had turned ‘very poor’ on Friday, witnessed an improvement. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, “For the next three days (December 12 to 14), winds are likely to be low to moderate. Partially cloudy conditions and moderate mixing layer height causing moderate vertical mixing are likely to keep air quality within the ‘poor’ range during noon or ‘lower end of very poor’ during night and early morning hours for the next three days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mercury-dips-a-bit-min-temp-at-seasons-lowest/articleshow/88231082.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: 1.2 lakh traffic cases settled at Lok Adalats||NEW DELHI: Around 1.2 lakh traffic bookings were disposed of on Saturday during the National Lok Adalat organised at seven court complexes from 10am to 3.30pm. Unlike the chaotic earlier Lok Adalats, the process this time was smooth. To settle traffic and minor violations, people had to register themselves on the Delhi Traffic Police website and get a token. Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) said there were at least 1.2 crore challans pending and more Lok Adalats would be organized in the coming months. Most of the court complexes TOI visited on Saturday had one and, in some places even two, helpdesks to assist people on completing the court process and paying their fines. At Patiala House Courts, there was no rush or long queues because 10 courts were handling the challans while 16 courts were set up to dispose of petty offence cases. Mahesh Kumar, who had come to clear 113 challans, said “The process was smooth and there was no queueing up. In half an hour, my work has almost finished. We are a private company and have all kinds of vehicles plying on the roads, including buses and cars.” Sunil Bhandari had come from Paharganj to settle eight cases. “The last time, it was chaotic and I couldn’t resolve some of my bookings. This time, the process is easier, faster and more relaxed. Most of my challans for improper parking and red light jumping have been settled,” he said. There are around 1.2 crore challans pending, said Kanwal Jeet Arora, secretary, DSLSA, who was supervising arrangements at the Patiala Courts complex. “Given the number of pending cases, we will organize another Lok Adalat exclusively for traffic bookings in January. We are also in talks with other stakeholders to decide how the process can be speed up,” said Arora. At the Saket court complex, the scenario was similar with separate desks for South and South-East divisions. Some people returned disappointed after being told that they had to first register on the Delhi Traffic Police website. After getting a token then, they could settle their bookings at the court. Ankush, who had come from Chhatarpur and had five challans, could not resolve the cases because he had not registered and acquired a token number. “I wasn’t aware of this system,” he said. “Moreover, people that I met here told me they had tried to register but the website had crashed before they could do so. Now, I will approach an advocate and try to settle the traffic violation cases on my own. But I realised that the advocates are also charging more money in order to help dispose of the challans.” At the Karkardooma court complex, several lawyers volunteered to help people as they tried to make their way to the various court rooms. Advocate Rajesh Kumar Verma, who was at the helpdesk at the court, said several people had sought help since the morning. “DSLSA had advertised well in advance the holding of the Lok Adalat for traffic and minor offences so that people could register and reach their designated court complex. However, many people came without registering,” said Verma. “We have told them to log in for the next Lok Adalat as and when the date for that is announced. Each judge disposes of around 1,000 challans each.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-2l-traffic-cases-settled-at-lok-adalats/articleshow/88231078.cms||Sakshi Chand

The Air Intelligence Unit of customs on Saturday arrested Harshad Gajra, the proprietor of Harshida Impex, a resident of Koparkhairane in Navi Mumbai after his name cropped up in the investigations. Gajra, officials said, was produced before the custom court and was remanded to magistrate custody. Meanwhile the officials also carried out searches of some prominent businessmen in Mumbai. “It is a very deep rooted conspiracy and many big people are involved in the drug peddling case. Our investigations are in progress and it would not be proper for us to reveal anything at this stage as the main suspect may flee away,” said an officer. Another officer said that they arrested Harshad for his involvement and collusion in conspiracy of possession, transportation and attempt to commit offence under the provision of NDPS act by abetting and sponsoring the two foreign nationals for a business trip to India where they attempted to smuggle the contraband.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-240cr-heroin-kingpin-bizman-from-navi-mumbai-arrested-by-aiu/articleshow/88231611.cms||Ahmed Ali

For that, even the patient needs to remain strong. Here, the patient is Hindu society,” said Dr Singh. “Muslims were given a separate nation altogether along with funds to run it. A number of individuals belonging to that religion went to Pakistan. Yet some of them have stayed back,” said Dr Singh. Dr Singh, an orthopaedic surgeon and Padma Shri awardee, said this does not mean that Muslims should be asked to leave the country. “However, one must also understand certain other aspects,” he added. Dr Singh was in the city to chair the groundbreaking ceremony of VHP’s new building in Dhantoli. “It is not that I mean minorities are cancer. It was just an example. Since I am a doctor, I referred to a health condition like cancer to stress the point,” he said. “In Islam, there is a concept of ‘ummah’ which proscribes the concept of nation. How could you build the nation with a section of the society not believing in nationalism at all,” said Dr Singh. He said the minorities, including Muslims, should assimilate into the larger Indian fabric. “The river Ganga that flows in Patna has water from rivers like Yamuna, Sarayu and Gandak. Yet, it is called Ganga. The same way, those who would try to lock swords with us would end up merging into us,” said Dr Singh. On being asked whether there was indeed a threat to the country that Hinduism may vanish in 50 years, he said it may happen if steps are not taken soon. “Look at Kerala and Bihar. In Bihar, there are four districts with Muslim majority population where you cannot even perform Satyanarayana puja,” he claimed. “Initially, we were told that the minorities are our brothers and we need to live with them peacefully. Now they are slowly engulfing us and it’s time to say atithi kab jaoge (guest when are you leaving),” he said. He also expressed concern over Christian missionaries, saying as much Rs64,000 crore of foreign aid was diverted for conversion. The funding was plugged after 2014, said Dr Singh. For us, even a single person being converted is a matter of concern, he said. On VHP’s recent vigilantism in a school in Madhya Pradesh over alleged conversion, the VHP president said protecting the Hindu well-being remains priority. “It’s for the MP government to protect its political interests...we are here to protect the interest of the Hindus,” said Dr Singh. On Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s take on temples in Kashi and Mathura, Dr Singh said, “The focus is only on Ayodhya. What others say is not voice of the organization as a whole.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hindu-religion-may-be-extinct-in-50-years-says-vhp-chief/articleshow/88243187.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: State issues draft industry code, seeks feedback||Mumbai: If a trade union in an organisation has more than 50% membership, it will be the sole negotiating union for workers in that organisation. If, however, no union has 50% membership, then based on their strength, they will be provided representation on an organisation’s works committee. The state government has issued the draft notification for the rules for implementation of Industrial Relations Code, 2020. It has invited objections/suggestions from the public within 45 days. The government has passed the Social Security Rules and Wage Code Rules while the others are to be published . The Occupational Safety and Health rules are likely to be published in two weeks. The Industrial Code has not defined rules for Labour Courts and Industrial Tribunals. Officials said these are in the process of being framed and would take some time.  The draft Industrial Code rules provide for the setting-up of a Works committee with a maximum of 20 members. It also allows for setting-up of a grievance panel with adequate representation for women. A registered trade union or federation of trade unions with substantial representation in a sector can apply to the government for recognition at the state level. If there is no union, draft rules allow the government to convene a meeting of workers to choose three representatives for issuance of standing orders. It also prescribes manner of issuing notice for strike. It will be required to be signed by the secretary and five members of the trade union. Rules prescribe that any employer intending to effect change in service conditions applicable in respect of any matter specified in Industrial Code must serve a notice. Trade union leaders refused comment, saying they are yet to go through the Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-state-issues-draft-industry-code-seeks-feedback/articleshow/88231612.cms||Clara Lewis

They will now celebrate the repeal of these laws in their villages, said leaders of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). The Kisan Kranti Rath, a symbol of their longstanding protest, will also be taken to different villages as part of celebrations. It is a tractor modified by the BKU Agra unit and was used at the Ghazipur border protest site. It was used as a safe space for farmers to hold meetings and accommodate the elderly. “We will now take up local issues and meetings in villages to achieve our goals. A detailed plan will be prepared to ensure that the state government takes time-bound action on various issues concerning farmers of the Agra region," said BKU Agra division president Gajendra Singh Parihar. Some farmers were seen dismantling their makeshift homes. Others were seen dancing and waving green and white flags as they rode tractors and jeeps on the way back from the capital's outskirts, where they have camped since November last year. They said they were happy and relieved to return home. "I am glad we can finally go back. The fact that I am heading home after victory is what makes this moment even sweeter," said BKU Agra's district women wing leader, Savitri Chahar. BKU Agra district president, Rajveer Lawaniya, said, “We have made friends for life and our brotherhood with the farmers of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and other states has only strengthened. Over 700 farmers who died during this movement have inspired us to never give up. We will do everything possible to maintain this comradeship.” Lawaniya said that their next move will be to focus on local issues such as irregularities related to MSP, high electricity bills, lack of arrangements for irrigation of fields, and a short supply of fertilisers. "We will aggressively pursue our long-pending demand to set up a potato processing unit in Agra. For this, meetings will be held across the district," he said. Farmers from Agra participated in many events during the protest. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait had addressed a mega rally in Agra on February 24. Dodging the police, thousands of farmers managed to reach the Delhi border. They organised tractor rallies, burnt copies of three contentious farm laws at government offices, blocked roads, and observed a Bharat Bandh to mark their protest. Cases were registered against hundreds of these farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-farmers-leave-delhi-borders-head-home-to-celebrate/articleshow/88229914.cms||---

The incident left more than 100 passengers stranded and led to cascading delays for the private airline. SpiceJet finally accommodated the passengers on another scheduled flight later in the afternoon, but not before irate passengers protested at the departure terminal. The incident began in the early hours of Saturday when flight SG476 was set to depart for Mumbai at 5.25am. After the passengers had boarded the aircraft and the flight was cleared for take-off, the pilots detected a snag and the aircraft, a Boeing 737-85R, was brought back to the apron. The passengers were asked to disembark and wait in the departure lounge till a replacement aircraft could fly in. “SpiceJet arranged an alternative aircraft in the afternoon to take the passengers but that flight unfortunately also had a technical issue. Those passengers could not be sent in the second flight also,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik said. Several flights operated by SpiceJet witnessed delays at Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bagdogra. “In the air transport sector flights are rescheduled, cancelled, delayed and diverted to other fields due to operational reasons and regulatory directions....,” SpiceJet said in a statement. SpiceJet accommodated the passengers on a flight to Mumbai at 3.30pm but by then passengers had started creating a ruckus, demanding answers from the airline. Similar scenes were witnessed at Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. On Thursday, a Boeing 737 Max operated by SpiceJet made an emergency landing at Mumbai due to an inflight engine shutdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/passengers-from-goa-stranded-for-10-hours-due-to-aircraft-glitch/articleshow/88231620.cms||---

While one man was killed, two others were injured. As per the preliminary information, the villagers had started chasing the animal to shoo it away from the sugar cane fields. The bison then charged at the crowd. A 21-year-old named Sourabh Sambhaji Patil died after being impaled by the animal's horn. Two others -- Pralhad Pandurang Patil (55) and Shubham Mahadev Patil (21) -- were injured.  Earlier, the bison had returned to Kolhapur city on Friday evening after some miscreants had thrown stones at it in the Laxmitirth Vasahat area. However, later in the night, the bison had taken the Panchaganga ghat-Shivaji bridge route to move towards the Vadange village. The animal took the main Kolhapur-Ratnagiri highway to walk amidst vehicular traffic and onlookers. Devendra Bhosale, a member of the wildlife protection and research society said, “The bison had gone towards the farmlands on Friday evening. However, the animal returned after some miscreants threw stones at it. The animal was back within the city limits around 11pm. It then started moving towards the Shivaji bridge via Panchaganga ghat. Even though the traffic was heavy, the animal continued walking and then cut through sugar cane farms to reach Vadange. It then continued with its journey further. Our group followed the bison till 2.30am to ensure its safe passage. Only after making sure that the bison had safely left the urban areas did we return.” Bison researcher and expert Datta Morse said, “When a bison leaves the forest and enters the farmland, its smelling power is reduced due to pesticides sprayed on the crops. If miscreants somehow spook it, the animal starts running wherever it can and may often enter urban areas. In a group, the animals stay calm. However, when a lone bison gets separated from the group, there are chances of it getting aggressive. If people make loud noises, burst crackers or throw stones at such an animal, then the situation can turn dangerous for the animal as well as humans. I request every one to not disturb animals. A bison can return to the forest on its own if no nuisance is created by humans.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/1-killed-2-injured-in-bison-attack/articleshow/88229335.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Addressing media persons at her party’s state office, Karat said that it is very unfortunate that HEC workers and officers have not been paid salary for the past several months. She said that the state government should have raised its voice against the situation but it seems to be more interested in acquiring its land for Ranchi smart city project. She said, “ I visited one of the inhabitations where adivasi people told me that their houses were being forcibly broken without proper notice. It is inhuman. ” Alleging that the BJP and the RSS are turning the country into their sakha (branch), she said that people and public organisations in Jharkhand should unite to protect the Constitution and unity of country Karat was in Ranchi to attend a three-day seventh state level-meeting of CPI(M). During the meeting, the party decided to hold block-level demonstrations in January against the alleged delays in panchayat raj elections. A plan for agitation against the arbitrary charges fixed by public transport owners was also prepared. The party leaders said that the camps of government programme ‘Apke adhikar, Apki Sarkar, Apke dwar’ are being used for only distribution of forms under various schemes adding officials are saying that selection process would be completed after a survey. The party claimed that camps have turned into an occasion for picknicking for the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-govt-interested-in-acquiring-hec-land-not-resolving-crisis-brinda-karat/articleshow/88230780.cms||---
---||Ranchi||NGT fines two state pollution watchdog officials over mining ruling violation||Ranchi: In a first-ever crackdown against enviroment pollution in Jharkhand, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slapped a penalty of Rs 10,000 each on two senior officials of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JPCB). While slapping the fines, the NGT termed the JPCB officials as “incompetent” or unaware of what actions are required to be taken to curb the environmental abuse on the Damodar river because of the coal operations by the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) in the Piparwar area of Chatra district since years. The tribunal said the fine amounts have to be deposited with its registrar within one week and directed JPCB to file a fresh Action Taken Report within four weeks. NGT took the action after several rounds of hearing on a plea filed by an activist of the Damodar Bachao Andolan (DMA) and Khelari resident, Sanjay Chauhan, in June last year. Chauhan sought the tribunal’s intervention saying CCL is conducting mining activities in violation of prescribed environmental norms. On December 8, NGT’s eastern zone bench found faults in the action taken report submitted by JPCB and imposed penalties on JSPCB regional officer R N Kashyap and environmental engineer Sumit Kumar Jha. A copy of the NGT’s order was uploaded on its website on Saturday. After Chauhan’s petition, NGT formed a special committee comprising different experts for field visits. The committee undertook an extensive three-day tour of the region in September last year and submitted a report. In August this year, the state pollution watchdog filed its counter affidavit along with an action taken report. The tribunal, however, found several anomalies in the report. In its order, NGT said, “The committee constituted by the tribunal had submitted its detailed observations starting from page no. 102 of the report. Item No. 2 of the committee’s observation mentions that coal from Rohini OCP was being taken by road to Darka Siding which is an addition of 2.5km distance and this direction is not mentioned in the Environmental Clearance report. This also does not find any mention in the Action Taken Report dated 18.08.2021 filed by the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board.” Similarly, mandatory compliances as per the environmental clearance norms for coal operation and transportation such as installation of conveyor belts, three-tier green belts, covering of trucks while carrying coals were not followed, the order said. “As far as the development of the three-tier green belt is concerned, the committee mentioned that there is inadequate and sparse coverage of the area. Moreover, no three-tier green belt has been developed along the major approach roads. The Action Taken Report simply repeats that the three-tier green belt development has not been done and what action has been taken in this regard is not disclosed. The report mentions that the PM10 analyzer has not been installed. This is not an inspection report,” the order says. “The report also does not mention what action has been taken concerning the observations on ambient air quality monitoring apparatus which was to be set up within three months from the grant of the environmental clearance. However, it is not installed even after more than 11 years, ” it adds. One of the greatest potential risks to the river is the embankment/OB (overburden) dump on the north-eastern boundary of Rohini OCP. “The report is also silent in this regard,” the order says.  which shall be||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ngt-fines-two-state-pollution-watchdog-officials-over-mining-ruling-violation/articleshow/88230769.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Expressing concern over the situation, secretary of the department of agriculture, Abubakar Siddique, has urged Birsa Agricultural University to constitute a team of best scientists to prepare a strategy document for increasing area under cultivation and crop diversification in Jharkhand. While addressing the 41st Rabi Research Council at the university on Saturday, Siddique said the state government would provide required fund for preparing strategy document. He stressed that area specific needs, affordability of farmers and user-friendly aspect must be kept in mind while perfecting and recommending technologies. He invited suggestions for addition, deletion or modification in the ongoing schemes of the agriculture department and inclusion of some important projects for the region within a week so that it could be incorporated in the budget of next financial year. “Tangible solution should be suggested for different regions like Kolhan, Palamu, Chhotanagpur and Santhal,” he said. Vice-Chancellor, BAU, Dr Onkar Nath Singh, who chaired the meet, stressed on identification of climate smart lines for use as parents for crop improvement. “Special focus is also required on biofortification for improving nutritional quality of food crops through agronomic practices conventional plant bleeding or modern biotechnology as a sizeable section of Jharkhand population suffers from malnutrition and under nutrition,” he said. The officials seemed concerned about food safety of the increasing population at a time when demand for food grain is increasing every passing year but the increase in production has been marginal that too because of increase in productivity by use of high-end technology. Former chairman of the department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, Dr Z A Haider, suggested that extension machinery of the state government should provide feedback about the problems, priorities and preferences of farmers so that research efforts could be reoriented accordingly. Director research Dr A Wadood and Haidar drew attention of the agriculture department to vacancies in the university and non-payment of 7th pay package. “Seven new colleges established some years ago are running without any regular teacher affecting the teaching quality,” Haidar said. While Wadood pointed out that teachers and scientists of BAU have been deprived of the monetary benefits as it was the only university in the country devoid of new pay package.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/prepare-strategy-to-increase-area-under-cultivation-govt-to-bau/articleshow/88230836.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Officials of the urban local body (ULB) one sweeper vehicle and a tipper have already been delivered while the remaining vehicles will be received from the respective companies soon. “The mechanised vehicles will be rolled out once our sanitary personnel receive training under expert guidance on how to operate them,” JNAC city manager Ravi Bharati said. The CNG tipper will, however, be operational from Monday, Bharati said. The automated vehicle, Dulevo 6000 Euro 6, is a suction sweeper and washer suitable for roads, streets and pavements. The vehicle, which has up-to-date technology and top quality components, has four brushes on each side which are hydraulically assisted and can simplify complex manoeuvrers, the official said. The CNG tipper, manufactured by Ashok Leyland, has two separate compartments for dry and wet garbage and has a payload capacity of 1250kg. The tippers will be used for collecting door-to-door garbage. The vehicles were bought from the funds allocated by the 15th finance commission in 2020-21 fiscal. Notably, the Steel City produces 300 plus tonnes of municipal waste daily. After achieving an all India rank of 12 in the Swacha Survekshan 2021 in the 10-lakh population category, JNAC is aggressively pursuing its ambitious goal to make it to the top five in 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jnac-buys-mechanised-vehicles-for-city-cleaning/articleshow/88230797.cms||B Sridhar

Prominent leaders who have already left for Jaipur since Friday are cabinet ministers Rameshwar Oraon (finance), Badal Patralekh (agriculture), Banna Gupta (health) and Alamgir Alam (rural development). Former union minister Subodh Kant Sahay, all four co-working presidents of the state unit, over a dozen lawmakers besides several other party workers from all 24 districts have headed for the rally which will be led by AICC’s central leaders — Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi. The rally was originally scheduled to be held in Delhi but was later shifted to Jaipur after it failed to get permission for it in the wake of Omicron scare. Congress spokesperson Rakesh Sinha in Ranchi said that the rally (mehngai hatao) will be held at Vidhyanagar stadium in Jaipur. Talking to TOI, state unit chief Rajesh Thakur said, “The rally will be historic. The entire country is reeling under the pressure of inflation, be it fuel, essential commodities, travel or agriculture sector, the BJP government in the Centre has ensure that they go beyond the reach of common people. The rally will set the tone for anti-BJP mood in the country.” Lashing out at the Centre, finance minister Rameshwar Oraon said that the Modi government’s bad fiscal management has led to the chaos in the country. Rural development minister Alamgir said that the Congress has always been vocal against the bad policies of the Modi government. “At a time when the pandemic is far from over, one expected this government to be pro-people, but in the last two years since the outbreak of the virus, all-round mismanagement has pushed the country to deeper lows,” he said. Opposition BJP, however, took a dig at the Congress accusing it of double standards. Party spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “Congress’s rally is a sham. The party, which is part of the ruling coalition government in the state, is running away from reducing petrol and diesel prices despite demands from all quarters after the Centre reduced its taxes on it, but it is busy doing tamasha in Jaipur. If it was so concerned about common people, it must immediately reduce state VAT like many states have done in recent weeks.” Last week Oraon hinted that the state was not in favour of reduction of VAT stating that it never hiked the rates since it came to power two years ago.

NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said she met the state’s director general of police Niraj Sinha to seek an explanation on why the department “has failed to reply to the letters, issued by the commission, even after repeated reminders. “The NCW has received nearly 300 complaints from the state but no progress was made due to lack of cooperation of the police department,” Sharma alleged. “What can I say about the field officers of the police department and the SPs in the districts when the DGP himself was not prepared with any explanation,” she told media persons here. Sharma added that the DGP appeared “non-serious” and he met casually over tea. “We had already sent him the issues concerned but he was not prepared with any action taken report,” she added. A clarification by the DGP’s office, however, said, “The NCW chairperson met the DGP and the ADG (CID) at the police headquarters on Friday evening. There was no fixed agenda prior to the meeting, still issues related to women were discussed.”  It added, “Though no recent letter about issues pending with the NCW has been received, the DGP directed the ADG, CID to send a factual report within 15 days.” Sharma also said she had met governor Ramesh Bais and chief minister Hemant Soren on Thursday and discussed the issues concerning women in the state. “I shall write to the CM about the meeting with the DGP,” Sharma said. Meanwhile, the NCW chairperson also questioned state assembly Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto over a letter that he had written to the Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry & Allied Sciences on October 22, urging the institute management to admit one Sangita Devi, whom he had described in the letter as “mentally unfit”. “Devi was put in the hospital as the speaker had written that she is ‘mentally sick and should be put in a mental hospital. The speaker is not a doctor. How can he write in his official letter head that the woman is ‘mentally sick’?” she argued. Dher three-day visit to the capital, Sharma visited the state-run mental hospital on December 9 and found its infrastructure to be poor. “Maybe these women are forcibly locked up here with no one to give justice to them,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ncw-slams-dgp-for-being-casual-in-handling-state-womens-issues/articleshow/88230751.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Public connect prog a success, 2L complaints addressed: CM||Hazaribagh: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Saturday said around five lakh complaints have been received from the five divisions during the Sarkar Apke DwarAddressing a divisional level programme as part of Apke adhikar apke Sarkar apke dwar (government at doorstep) in Hazaribag on Saturday, chief minister said that they have so far received around five lakh complaints from all five divisions during this public connect initiative out of which 2.80 lakh applications were disposed off. “It’s a big achievement as this initiative aims to strengthen the rural areas by all round development. Since the establishment of Jharkhand no government tried to hear the problems of rural population in a large manner which I have achieved,” he said. He said that North Chottanagpur division is rich in mineral resources, particularly coal but despite that people could not get job and employment here. People are starved as due to Central government’s wrong policies as part of which all corporate sectors over-look local interests and of the displaced. “My government won’t tolerate this and hence we have decided that all companies must give 70% reservation to locals and displaced in jobs. We have also made a policy that all displaced must be properly rehabilitated and PSUs and big companies here must provide preference to local contractors for works up to Rs 1 crore. Government of India has agreed to consider this,” he said. CM said that since their coalition government came to power, big industrialists are showing interest for investing in Jharkhand. “Soon a big project of textile factory worth Rs 600 crores will come up at Bokaro and provide employment to local persons,” he announced. To boost self employment among locals, he said that his government will provide Rs five lakh loan for opening hotels, restaurants, poultry farms and dairy farms and create market for their products in the state itself. “During the last two years despite covid-19, Jharkhand government successfully controlled the situation,” he said. During the programme, CM distributed assets and schemes worth Rs 2,230 crores and handed over appointment letters to 500 persons. Ironically, throughout the programme, a large section of crowd kept hooting trying to create disturbances. Local administration failed to control the situation despite the instruction from the higher authorities including the chief minister to stop shouting and hooting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/public-connect-prog-a-success-2l-complaints-addressed-cm/articleshow/88230729.cms||Abhijit Sen

Kumar, who had started random police station visits, is learnt to have issued show cause notice of stoppage of increments of three years to a senior inspector in north Nagpur after he was unable to respond to his query regarding a goon whose name featured among the top criminals with several cases against him. The CP wanted to know the whereabouts of the goon and whether any preventive action had been initiated against him. The PI is learnt to have fumbled before the CP unable to furnish the required details. Kumar has also simultaneously started visiting the zonal offices of the DCPs besides police stations. This was the first time that the DCP offices and their functioning was being reviewed by the CP. Apart from cracking the whip against senior inspectors, the CP had also disbanded a number of existing sub-units within police stations by reshuffling the manpower. He mostly replaced the existing manpower strengths of most police station’s detection branch (DB) with fresh faces to avoid the old ones growing familiar with criminal syndicates and illegal activities. In another instance, Kumar is learnt to have served a similar show cause notice to the senior inspector of Zone-V after he was found faltering on knowledge about criminals enlisted in the categories of ‘Top-10’ and ‘Top-20’. It’s learnt that five senior inspectors were served show cause notices by the CP during his latest police station visits for failing to project their efforts to clamp down on goons who either have records or are out on bail. Kumar said action was initiated against some senior inspectors as they were found wanting in knowledge of criminals within their jurisdictions. “We have asked for explanations from senior officers as to why action should not be initiated against them for failing to provide basic information like the names and whereabouts of criminals,” said the CP, adding, he has instructed every police station incharge to take up even the simple assault case with utmost intensity and ensure bail of goons are cancelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cp-show-cause-to-sr-inspectors-for-not-knowing-criminals-in-their-area/articleshow/88227296.cms||Soumitra Bose

The state-of-the-art fish market will be spread across an area of 10,000 sqm. “We will construct a food fish market at Margao which will be a model for other states,” he said. Rupala said that it was a long pending demand of the state government to construct the fish market at Margao, for which a proposal was submitted to the Central government. Fisheries minister Filipe Neri Rodrigues said the fish market will have cold storage and other modern facilities. Rodrigues said that the land for the project is owned by South Goa planning and development authority which was handed over to the fisheries department to construct the market. To a question on how much funds have been sanctioned to Goa out of Rs 400 crore announced by his predecessor, Rupala said the Union government will expedite whatever proposals are received from the state government. He also said that two mobile ambulances for livestock farmers have been approved by the Centre for both the state districts. The Union minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched a scheme to make technology available to livestock farmers and provide mobile ambulances as well. Rupala held a review meeting with chief minister Pramod Sawant, Rodrigues and other officials on the implementation of central schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-38cr-fish-market-for-margao-gets-union-mantris-nod/articleshow/88231198.cms||---

---||Nagpur||‘60 young tigers dispersing, conflict is bound to happen’||Sunil Limaye (59) is Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife), Maharashtra. An IFS officer of the 1988 batch, Limaye took charge in July this year when man-animal conflict was, and continues to be, at its peak and the state is facing a tough challenge to create space for the increasing tiger and leopard numbers in shrinking habitats. He has spent most of his tenure in wildlife after starting his career as deputy conservator (wildlife), Kolhapur, from where he hails. Limaye used to trek and navigate through the jungles in southern Maharashtra during his college days and shares a close bond with nature. Limaye is the only forest officer with two species being named after him — the jumping spider Jerzego Sunillimaye and lizard Cnemaspis Limayei. TOI talks to him on critical issues. Excerpts... Q. What’s been the change in the last 4 months? A. Not as bad as many may think but, yes, many things to be done. Initiatives like tiger and leopard study group reports on man-animal conflict were approved in the state board for wildlife (SBWL) to curb road accidents and enforce speed limits etc. We approved the State Wildlife Action Plan (SWLAP), the first in the country. Official communication is awaited on it. and we are in all readiness to implement it. There are huge challenges like wildlife conflict, staff crunch, unified control, funds crisis et al. Q. There is a three-fold jump in tiger numbers in the state in the last decade. How do you convince people towards conservation? A. Tiger conservation is the conservation of biodiversity gene pool reserve. This is in the form of wild relatives of our crops, cereals and fruits. These facts need to be told to the villagers who are benefiting due to the wild genes of flora and fauna. Forests are also sources of rivers, rivulets and nullahs which contribute to farming in a big way and mitigate climate change. Villagers need to be convinced of this. Q. Man-animal conflict is raging and due to shrinking spaces tigers have been moving in city areas. A. Young tigers always try to move out, establish territories and protect them zealously. The increase in visibility of tigers is due to an increase in their numbers due to good management in the state for the last 6-7 years. Young sub-adults at times move in human-dominated areas trying to find some safe pockets for cover, water, and easy prey like it has happened in the case of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station. After breeding for a period their number increases and we feel that they have moved to cities. It is not like that. The conflict situation is increasing as there is an addition of more than 60 young tigers trying to establish territory in Chandrapur-Bramhapuri areas. During this movement, predominantly in a human-dominated landscape, conflict will happen. This is natural when there are hundreds of villages interspersed with tiger-bearing landscape. Tiger habitats are shrinking is not the perfect interpretation. Q. Any plans to prioritize tiger conservation in Gadchiroli where tigers are dispersing to? A. Gadchiroli is adjacent to Chandrapur which is having more than 200 tigers. So, naturally, tigers disperse to nearby Gadchiroli, especially in Wadsa and Armori ranges. Dense forests are present in Gadchiroli forest divisions but the prey base is not adequate to cater to dispersing tigers from Chandrapur. Hence, in the last few years, human-tiger conflict incidences are high there. However, improving wildlife management in the Kolamarka conservation reserve and Pranhita & Bhamragad sanctuaries will be addressed. Q. What has happened to the plan of translocating tigers? A. There is a plan to take up conservation translocation of tigers to curb human-tiger conflict and to create some space for sub-adult tigers in the Bramhapuri landscape. But You just can’t pick any tiger and translocate it to tiger-deficit areas. We are identifying young females in the Bramhapuri division and translocating them in deficient areas of the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR). We have identified spots having an adequate prey base and other factors. The females can be accommodated in the territory of male tigers too. The removal of young breeding females will check the addition of new cubs in Bramhapuri and help reduce conflict. We are planning the operation with Wildlife Institute of India. Hopefully it will be done in 4-6 months. Q. Now elephants too have entered Maharashtra. A. About 22 elephants have entered from Chhattisgarh. For a viable population (depending on the area) of elephants, the minimum number is 40. Currently, there is no plan to declare elephant reserve. Forest areas in Gadchiroli and adjoining areas are not very ideal habitat for elephants. Elephants tend to move for about 150km in a year and due to this the habitat used by elephants gets time for rejuvenation. If the group doesn’t find suitable areas to move to, it will tend to remain in a small area which will rapidly deteriorate, and sooner or later there may be a shortage of food availability. We will have to wait to see whether this group stays or goes back. or their number increases by some more animals coming from adjoining areas and then decide further course of action, but we are ready for it. Q. How do you propose to bring about a balance between tourism pressures and tiger conservation? A. Tourism is always subservient to tiger conservation. Now it is implemented as per the approved tiger conservation plan of tiger reserves. The number of vehicles is fixed and determined by the NTCA. It is true that the success of management is resulting in better tiger sightings, making areas popular and bringing in more visitors. Accommodation facilities too have improved. However, we can’t afford to be only tourism-friendly. Our top priority was and is wildlife management. It includes creating inviolate spaces for tigers, managing habitat, monitoring prey availability, ensuring protection from poaching, etc. Q. On the lines of Tadoba, why is buffer tourism not being implemented in other tiger reserves? A. The core area of Tadoba is around 625 sqkm and has a tiger population of around 80. Tiger disperse into the buffer which is around 1,100 sqkm. Naturally, sightings have increased. It is one of the best models being emulated by states like MP, Tamil Nadu and others. In other reserves, the potential of the core area is yet to be fulfilled. and hence tourism in buffer areas has not been expanded. Q. What is the floating zone concept? Are there any plans to implement it in Tadoba core? A. As per the guidelines of NTCA, a maximum of 20% of the core area can be used for tourism purposes. In order to improve tourism by opening new areas or closing a few areas we can think of a floating zone but only based on the existing guidelines and TCP. Q. Buffer zones of Bor & NNTR are still not under the administrative control of tiger reserves? A. We are committed to unified control of buffer with field directors and accordingly, Melghat, Sahyadri, Tadoba, and Pench have been unified. The proposal of NNTR is expected to be cleared soon. Bor's proposal is in pipeline. We are proposing a reorganization of staff as the buffer area of Bor requires additional staff, but it will be done soon. Q. What are the plans to strengthen tiger corridors which are threatened by infra development? A. We have identified corridors in Eastern Vidarbha. Apart from this, TCPs of tiger reserves have also identified them. Whenever any development project is proposed in identified corridors, wildlife clearance is mandatory as per Section 38 O(G) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. No proposals would be allowed to clear unless mitigation measures are approved. Besides, conservation reserves like Munia and Mahendri in the region, and 11 elsewhere in the state, have been declared to consolidate the corridors. Q. Of late, there is a spurt in tiger and leopard poaching. A. Yes, there is a threat to wildlife due to poisoning, snaring, and electrocution. But in most cases, big cats become targets when farm fences are electrified to protect crops or revenge killings or when locals lay snares to kill herbivores for bushmeat. There is no organized large-scale poaching of tigers for the last 4-5 years. However, efforts are taken to control these incidences too by holding anti-electrocution drives with the help of MSECDL, anti-snare drives in sensitive areas, regular and timely payment of compensation for crop damage, and coordination with other agencies through tiger cell meetings and monitoring crime cases through wildlife crime cell. Q. Can declaring new protected areas (PA) solve the problem of conflict? A. Yes. New areas are declared for their unique ecological and geo-morphological importance. In Maharashtra, we have 71 PAs. A PA network is necessary to have a source-sink exchange, especially for larger mammals. A widespread PA network would enable a relatively manageable population of wild animals outside PAs. Hence, a PA network will have a positive impact in addressing the human-wildlife conflict issues. Q. Is Wildlife Protection Act helping effectively to save our tigers or some amendments are needed? A. I think the WLPA 1972 has adequate provisions for effective tiger conservation. With the amendments like the creation of NTCA and tiger conservation foundations, most of the things have been taken care of. A legal framework for the declaration of corridors should be included in the Act. Q. Why has Kanhargaon sanctuary not been handed over to wildlife? Besides, there are many field staff vacancies in wildlife? A. The 269sqkm Kanhargaon was notified in March 2021. It was declared by including most of the areas of FDCM. In lieu of this, some forest patches have been identified in Chandrapur and Allapalli divisions for FDCM. After handing over these areas to FDCM from territorial divisions the staff strength will be reorganized. Some early action in this regard will be taken. I agree that many field posts are lying vacant in the wildlife wing. We are trying to fill them up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/60-young-tigers-dispersing-conflict-is-bound-to-happen/articleshow/88230619.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||India||Cong, BJP lock horns over K'taka anti-conversion law||BENGALURU: A political discourse in favour of and against the proposed anti-conversion bill has kicked off ahead of the winter session of the Karnataka legislature in Belagavi, though the state government is still undecided over tabling it. The Belagavi session is going to start from Monday. Right-wing organisations on Saturday upped pressure on the government and demanded that the bill be tabled in this session itself. "If not, we'll launch a state-wide agitation from January 1," said Sri Ram Sene president Pramod Mutalik. He said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has assured a delegation of seers that met him a few months ago that a law against forceful conversions would be enacted in the Belagavi session. "The government must fulfil its assurance. For no reason it should be deferred," Mutalik said. The anti-conversion law introduced by other BJP-ruled states has proved to be effective in curbing forceful conversions, he claimed. To Karnataka PCC president DK Shivakumar's statement that Congress would oppose the bill if it's placed in the Belagavi session, the state BJP launched a counterattack on social media. "There is a competition within the Congress over opposing the anti-conversion law. If the law is enacted, one section of society will be hurt. More than anything else, it may hurt your supreme leader. Political gains are important for you over the interests of Hindus," the party's official Twitter handle said. Meanwhile, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj minister KS Eshwarappa reiterated that the government will enact the law and none should have any doubt about it. "Whether to table the bill in the Belagavi session or in the next session is the only question. But our government is very serious about the issue," Eshwarappa said. "BJP has planned to table the bill from the government side or in the form of a private bill through its members. Let them bring it in any form, our party will oppose it," Shivakumar said, referring to the decision of BJP MLC Tulasi Muniraju Gowda to table a private bill. "This matter is not something related to only Karnataka. It has drawn international attention...," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cong-bjp-lock-horns-over-ktaka-anti-conversion-law/articleshow/88232333.cms||---

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B on Saturday issued directives to the solid waste management department (SWMD) and the two private firms AG Enviro and BVG India, which are engaged in door-to-door collection, not to lift mixed garbage. The move was initiated after NMC slipped in the recently declared Swachh Bharat ranking from 18th to the 23rd position. There is, however, no provision to levy fines for not following the rule. If operators continue to transport unsegregated garbage to Bhandewadi, they will be fined Rs 100 for each trip. Citizens found dumping garbage will be penalised as per SWMD rules. As per NMC, bio-degradable substances like fruits, vegetables, leaves and flowers, and kitchen leftover are wet waste and plastics, paper, glass, metals, aluminium foils etc dry waste. The civic body has appealed to citizens to keep red bins for diapers, sanitary napkins, battery cells, paint cans, chemical sprays, disinfectants, empty medicine bottles used for children and the elderly at home. “This will be collected separately,” said SWMD nodal officer Dr Gajendra Mahelle. Earlier too NMC had announced such a plan. “It could not implemented as there was no segregation at source even though garbage vans were customized to collect dry and wet garbage separately,” said Dr Mahelle, adding that sanitary workers, employees of the two firms and citizens had not followed orders then. Dr Mahalle said the firms have already launched an awareness campaign in all the 10 zones. “Residents must keep bins at homes for dry and wet garbage. The firms will have to ensure they are collected separately and transported to Bhandewadi,” he said. On the likely increase in dumping of waste in open places, Dr Mahalle said, “The SWMD team and nuisance detection squad will penalise such citizens.” On December 3, the NMC had warned AG Enviro and BVG India to dump only segregated waste at Bhandewadi dumping yard or be penalised. Dr Mahalle also said that arrangements for dumping wet and dry wastes have been made at Bhandewadi. The city generates around 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage which includes 60% wet and 40% dry waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-segregated-garbage-will-be-lifted-from-dec-15/articleshow/88230633.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Sardinha was chief minister from November 1999 to October 2000. “Sawant should know that the chief minister is a chief minister of the state and not of a constituency. I did what was needed to be done for my constituency when I was chief minister,” he said. He said that 30,000 sqm of land near Sonsoddo was acquired during his tenure as MLA, which now lies unutilised. “I lost the subsequent election because of that.

The girl was handed over to her parents on Friday. Her father, who took her custody from Children Welfare Home in Dongri, did not press any charges against the man - an engineering student, citing that he had no fault. The girl's parents have roots in India. On December 4, a yellow notice was issued for the girl by the Interpol through the nodal agency - Central Bureau of Investigation. A yellow notice is a global police alert for a missing person. The notice is published for victims of parental abductions, criminal abductions (kidnappings) and unexplained disappearances. The police said while going through her social media accounts, her parents suspected the girl could be in India. The girl had befriended the teenager on Instagram and after a prolonged friendship, she took a month's tourist visa and came to Mumbai from Sweden to meet him. Upon landing in Mumbai on November 27, she intended to live with him but his family did not allow her. They put her up with a female cousin in a separate flat in Trombay, an officer said. On the same day, the girl's family had lodged a missing complaint with Swedish authorities who, in turn, took the help of Interpol. The Interpol, through the CBI, then approached Mumbai police. The case was then handed over to the Interpol liasioning office of the crime branch. Interpol, along with Crime Branch Unit 6, finally traced the girl. "With technical help, we traced the girl and handed her over to her family," said deputy commissioner of police (Detection 1) Neelotpal. The police said the girl's father first landed in Delhi and from there he came to Mumbai and took custody of his minor daughter. On Friday, the two flew back to Sweden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/swedish-girl-who-fled-to-mumbai-for-online-male-friend-sent-back/articleshow/88232350.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Goa||Goa: Vijai Sardesai gives Congress till Monday to decide on alliance||PANAJI: The Congress-Goa Forward Party (GFP) alliance remains under a cloud even before its formal beginning with talks between the two parties on Saturday proving to be inconclusive. While Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao said the alliance talks are on a healthy track, GFP president Vijai Sardesai asked Congress to make up its mind by Monday. According to party insiders privy to the discussions, Sardesai was clear in his displeasure with Congress’ flip flops and hinted that Congress leadership needs to pull up its socks if it has to stand a chance in the 2022 assembly elections. “They are natural allies at the moment and what we started with Team Goa, we want to pursue. We met today in deference to their national leadership. Now we want to see their response,” Sardesai said. Rao who was present for the meeting spoke to reporters after the nearly hourlong meeting and said that the alliance talks will continue. “The discussions will continue. It is a very healthy and good discussion in a friendly manner,” he said. Congress and GFP had released a picture with great fanfare, showing Rahul Gandhi holding hands with Sardesai and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat post a meeting at the Gandhi residence. However, the alliance appears to be falling apart particularly after senior AICC election observer P Chidambaram said that the term alliance is being used indiscriminately. From Congress’ side, Curtorim MLA and working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, state party president Girish Chodankar, Kamat and Rao were present. GFP was represented by Sardesai, vice-president Dilip Prabhudesai, general secretary Mohandas Lolienkar and Akbar Mulla. Kamat left the meeting a bit early. “I have gone with all sincerity owing to the sentiment of the people and conscious that people are watching us. We are already late and we are running out of time. The delay has not helped anyone and Congress party is losing allies,” Sardesai said. Sources said that with Congress’ strategy unclear, GFP could start working on a plan B for the 2022 assembly elections and may even forge ties with other players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sardesai-gives-congress-till-monday-to-decide-on-alliance/articleshow/88231253.cms||---

BMC's daily update showed that the seven-day tally (December 5-11) was 1,472 - almost 16% higher than the 1,238 cases the previous week (November 28-December 4). BMC public health department doctors said this was due to increased testing due to the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. For the last few days, the city has been doing over 40,000 tests on an average and the daily testing average has been less than 0.6%. The state and city's active cases, too, have reported a rise since the last two days. Active cases in the state were 6,452 of which 1,808 are in Mumbai. "The Covid-19 situation in the city is stable. We are isolating the Omicron suspects in institutional quarantine and focusing on vaccination. We will also start mobile awareness drives on the need to get vaccinated,'' said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. State government officials said that deaths in the city and state have been low for the last one month as the treatment protocol has been set and most new cases that are being detected have mild symptoms who don't even need hospitalisation. "However, with the year-end festive season around the corner and the Omicron threat looming large, we have urged districts to ensure implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour," said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-covid-deaths-in-mumbai-yesterday-2nd-such-day-this-year/articleshow/88232361.cms||---

Pauskar had made the announcement at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Gopal Gaonkar Memorial Goa Multi-Faculty College building at Dharbandora, recently. Chief minister Pramod Sawant was present at the function. Sources said the factory has 84 contractual workers and if they have to be regularised, the already loss-stricken factory will have to bear an additional burden of around Rs 18 lakh per month. The factory that was started in 1973, has been shut for the last couple of years. It has incurred a loss of over Rs 102 crore since its inception. Despite this, the factory spends Rs 42 lakh per month on the salary and wages of its staff, the source said. “Since the factory is not working, Pauskar could absorb all the workers in PWD as multi-tasking staff,” said the official. While most of the contractual workers were working as Khalasi to assist the boiler operators to keep fueling the furnace and other works, some were working at factory petrol pump.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/absorb-sanjivani-contract-staff-in-pwd-pauskar-urged/articleshow/88231279.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

The deceased has been identified as tractor driver Manoj and labourer Rupesh Barsagade. Another labourer in the tractor, whose name could not be learnt, suffered serious injuries and was rushed to Chandrapur for emergency treatment. Sources informed that a 18-wheeled truck coming from the opposite direction dashed head on with the tractor at around 4pm close to Bairam Baba temple on new bypass road. The collusion was so strong that tractor driver and his labourer were killed on the spot. There was brief tension on the spot as leaders of different parties reached the spot and denied lifting of the body till the transporter, who owns the truck, does not pay compensation of Rs 50 lakh each to the deceased. Cops later pacified the mob and removed the body for post-mortem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-killed-in-accident/articleshow/88230684.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||No need to make flex fuel engines mandatory: Nitin Gadkari||NAGPUR: After earlier stressing on making flex fuel engines mandatory for automobile manufacturers, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Saturday said now there is no need to do so as many auto giants have already started manufacturing it. He also batted for using the engine for drones to bring down their cost from Rs6 lakh to Rs1 lakh. Speaking at the launch of Agri Vision Radio, the city MP announced a new train will start from December 22 to Bangladesh carrying products like custard apple, cotton bales, ayurvedic medicines and textile among others from various parts of Vidarbha. The areas included Washim, Akot Morshi, Katol, Narkhed and others. The move came after the success of an earlier experiment of exporting oranges from the region to Bangladesh through the railway network during Covid-19 pandemic. Stressing on increasing the use of bioethanol as fuel, the minister said he would be taking help from Russian scientists to increase ethanol’s caloric value and make it at par with petrol. “Companies like Hyundai and Suzuki have started manufacturing flex engines for four wheelers while Bajaj and TVS are making them for two wheelers. As against Rs100/litre for petrol, ethanol can be available for Rs62.” Emphasizing on the use of flex engines in drones, the senior cabinet minister said Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers (RCF) had come out with a new form of urea that can be spread through drones. “To make it cheaper, drones need to fly on flex engines using ethanol rather than using lithium-ion battery. One such drone has been made by an agriculture university in Rahuri. We need to phase out petrol and diesel engines.” Gadkari said till now material was dispatched through through sea route Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) to Dhaka. “Through railway, it will be a lot easier to dispatch all goods in less time and at half the cost. Since Bangladesh is a global hub for readymade garments, cotton from Vidarbha area can be in big demand there. We can also send chillies from Bhiwapur, custard apples from Washim and bananas from Buldhana.” The senior BJP leader said the two countries have already launched a joint venture company for exporting these products. “Our prawns can also be exported to countries like Singapore where the rate is Rs10,000 per kg as against Rs800 in Vidarbha. On my request animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar has started working on it. Ramtek MLA Ashish Jaiswal too should reach out to fishermen.” Sharing his dream for farmers, Gadkari said they too should stay in air-condition bungalows in their villages and should not commit suicides due to crop failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-need-to-make-flex-fuel-engines-mandatory-gadkari/articleshow/88230705.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

"Conservation of KVT walls was a challenging task as enamel paint had damaged them badly and figures carved on stones had decayed. We have completely removed the enamel paint from the walls. The work of restoring artistic designs carved at the time of the temple construction in 1777 has also been started. But, it is a time-taking process and will be completed after the opening ceremony of KVD," said Dr Shivani Mishra, a conservator from Rajasthan who has worked for restoration of historical temples of different periods. Apart from KVT, the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board had also taken up the task of conserving 24 other temples unearthed during removal of old buildings or existed in the vicinity of KVT but were in a dilapidated condition due to improper maintenance. Work on remaining 8 temples to begin after KVD openingAlong with KVT, my company was tasked to restore 24 other temples in their actual shape and design," said Mishra, mentioning that of these 24, work on 17 temples, including Chandragupt, Mandhateshwar, Dwadishling, Brameshwar, Gangeshwar, Bharmagupteshwar, Bhuvneshwar, Tarkeshwar, Chintamani, Samudra Manthan, Goyenka Chhatralaya, Shri Putlibai, Panchmukhi, Bhasma Gateshwar temples and Gyanvapi mandap has been completed. "The process of restoring the decayed carved design on the stones of KVT walls with a solution prepared with 'gud' (jaggery), 'methi' (fenugreek seeds), 'guggul' (Commiphora wightii), custard apple water, stone and stone powder will continue till all designs are revived," she said mentioning that the work on remaining eight temples will also be started after the opening of KVD on December 13. "Expanded in 5-lakh square feet area, the KVD shrine is also being called a complex of temples due to restoration of all the temples found in the area covered under this project," said SKVSADB chairman Deepak Agrawal, adding that bringing the temples including KVT in their original shape was a challenging task. He added that the selection of conservators was done after going through a long and complex series of presentations. "The selection of my company was done on merit. Cost of work for conserving 25 temples including KVT was estimated at Rs 1.60 crore and we started our work in August," said Shivani, expecting that her assignment of conserving all 25 temples would be completed by January end. Despite being a highlighted issue since 2009, finding a solution for saving the artistic stone walls of KVT from the cancerous impact of enamel paint repeatedly before 2008 had not been possible. The experts said that the temple is built with porous Vindhya stone, which absorbs water along with salt and mineral through capillary action, but starts decaying in case it is coated with plastic paint as it does not allow moisture to go out of the stone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvd-clears-challenge-of-restoring-kashi-vishwanath-temple-walls-24-unearthed-temples/articleshow/88232359.cms||---

The patient also happened to have her relatives in the city who ultimately took her home after she was taken to Kingsway Hospital. Syncope is a condition in which the flow of blood to the brain is affected leading to unconsciousness. She was travelling with her husband. The patient is learnt to be three months pregnant. The first call about the medical emergency was received at 12:15pm after which the aircraft landed in another 15 minutes. The medical team found the patient in an unconscious state with blood pressure also dropping considerably. She also had a low oxygen saturation of 92% and was given oxygen support. The medical team was headed by Dr K Itehesham. As some of the patient’s relatives live in Nagpur they took her home, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mumbai-bound-flight-makes-emergency-landing/articleshow/88230718.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nagpur||Some traffic violators pay up, many claim ‘wrongly booked’||Nagpur: Once a violator and never to reform, or so it seemed from the thin attendance at the Lok Adalat held on Saturday. Ranjit Deshpande (name changed) was summoned to the Lok Adalat to settle unpaid fine for speeding on Bhandara Road. Though Deshpande appeared before the traffic court of judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) JM Agnihotri, he refused to pay the fine. He argued that when there was no speed caution board, how can the traffic police issue him a challan for speeding? Deshpande was not the only one who cried foul on being issued a challan. There were several other violators who too felt that the challan issued to them was “not right”. Many traffic violators returned without paying the fine amount. Another motorist pointed out that he too was challaned for speeding on Amravati road. “I received a text message from the traffic police to appear before the motor vehicle court on December 11 to pay the pending e-challan for speeding,” he said and sought to know about the non-existent speed warning signboard. “When there are no boards, how can traffic police issue such challans?” he said. Many violators expressed anguish after they were not allowed to contest their e-challan before the JMFC. Ramesh, who did not wish to reveal his full name, said the entire process of conducting Lok Adalat is an eyewash. “Lok Adalat is being organized to settle cases, but we are not allowed to speak and instead directly asked to pay the fine imposed by the traffic police,” he said. He was summoned to the court for five pending traffic challan cases. A person who was penalized twice for riding a two-wheeler without helmet on the same day, said, “Both the e-challans were issued within a gap of one hour.” In both the challans, the traffic police imposed Rs500 additional cost for disobedience of orders. The Lok Adalat was held from 11am to 5pm to settle the payment of pending traffic penalties and notices. Though the traffic police had issued notices for appearance before the Lok Adalat to over 2.17 lakh violators who defaulted traffic fines in the last six months, special fine collection counters were also opened at the 10 traffic zones across the city. As many as 2,496 traffic challans were disposed of during the Lok Adalat, said traffic police. The department also received Rs11.9 lakh fine from the violators. The traffic police had also conducted special nakabandi across the city from November 25 to December 10 to recover fines. During the drive, 25,571 violators paid Rs1.19 crore in fines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-traffic-violators-pay-up-many-claim-wrongly-booked/articleshow/88230730.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

He had earlier made an attempt to end his life by consuming poison around three years ago but was miraculously saved after being in the ICU for 45 days. ‘Papa mujhe maaf kara’ (Father, forgive me), he wrote in the suicide note. Utkarsh Mudliar was the eldest of the two sons. Utkarsh, who earlier worked with a road construction company, was jobless for around a year after returning home during the pandemic lockdown. His father, Subhash, who worked as a helper at MSRTC, was suspended around a fortnight ago for participating in the ongoing statewide agitation demanding merger of the corporation with the state government and salary hike among others. Utkarsh was alone at home while the rest of the family had gone to Wardha to attend a marriage. The family was stunned after returning in the wee hours of Friday. Utkarsh, who had passed standard XII, was found hanging. Subhash said he was the sole breadearner of the family as his both sons were looking for jobs. “The MSRTC authorities had sent the chargesheet to my house as we are off duty. My elder son had slipped into depression thinking his father too lost his job and they (the brothers) were unable to get one for themselves,” said the distraught father, addding, “MSRTC authorities take our lives for granted and consider us no better than animals.” Subhash had joined MSRTC in 1996. He was initially a driver but the authorities had declared him ‘unfit’ before allowing him to work as a helper only three years ago after a break of around 10 years. Subhash regretted telling his sons very often to put in more efforts to find jobs. “We also have loans to repay,” he said. Hudkeshwar police have registered a case of accidental death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/msrtcs-suspended-workers-unemployed-son-dies-by-suicide/articleshow/88230737.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Lucknow||Previous govts had no desire to work for farmers, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In a no holds barred attack on the opposition at the inauguration of the long- pending Saryu Canal scheme in Balrampur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said that he was born in the year in which the scheme was given approval but now, when he had lived several years, studied and become capable of serving the state, the project was finally being launched. Questioning the inability of previous governments in being able to complete this project, the CM said that a year after PM Modi came to power in 2014, he decided to push this scheme and also launched the Krishi Sichai Yojana to help farmers. 17 of 18 identified projects complete in state, says CMHowever, in the first two years of this scheme, the previous government did not take any interest in it. Earlier, governments of Congress, BSP and SP had no desire to work for farmers. Between 1978 and 2017, not even half the Saryu Canal scheme had been completed, which we managed to finish in four years," CM said. Calling the Saryu Canal scheme among the largest in the country, the CM said that soon after coming to power, Modi had reviewed about 100 pending projects and decided to push them immediately. Out of these, 18 were identified in UP and, the CM said, the government had managed to complete 17 out of these with just one, the Madhya Ganga scheme, pending. "The PM told me that we had to double the income of farmers by 2022 and therefore it was important to take these schemes forward. The 17 schemes we have completed have resulted in bringing 22 lakh hectare additional land under irrigation facilities," he said. Crediting the BJP governments in the Centre and the state for having addressed long pending issues of eastern UP, an area, the CM said, which had been ignored continuously since India gained independence, Yogi Adityanath enumerated the various projects launched in the area in the recent past. "Just four days back, the PM inaugurated a fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur which had been shut for 32 years. He recently launched an AIIMS in Gorakhpur, nine medical colleges, an international airport in Kushinagar and now the Saryu Canal scheme. Earlier, common diseases like malaria, encephalitis, chikungynua, were not identified and therefore not treated. We set up a viral research centre in Gorakhpur for Rs 10,000 crore and launched it on December 7," the CM said. The project will facilitate irrigation of about 15 lakh (14.04 lakh) hectares of arable land while offering a permanent solution to the problem of floods in certain areas of Purvanchal .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/previous-govts-had-no-desire-to-work-for-farmers-says-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/88232384.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He was addressing a rally in Balrampur after inaugurating the Saryu Canal National Project, which will meet the irrigation needs of over 14 lakh hectares of land and benefit about 29 lakh farmers.  Modi said a big event on natural farming is being organised on December 16 and requested farmers across the country to connect with it either through TV or Krishi Vigyan Kendras. Noting that Padma awardee Subhash Palekar of Maharashtra has initiated the idea of zero budget natural farming, Modi said it saves earth and water and the crop produced through it is also better.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-pm-narendra-modi-urges-farmers-to-adopt-natural-farming-in-balrampur/articleshow/88232422.cms||---

Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, who was a schoolgirl when her father first streaked into space, was one of six passengers buckled into the cabin of Blue Origin’s New Shepard spacecraft as it lifted off from a launch site outside the Texas town of Van Horn. Football star and TV celebrity Michael Strahan was also part of the crew. The crew capsule was carried aloft atop the fully autonomous, six-storytall spaceship and separated from the rocket booster as it soared to an altitude of about 350,000 feet before falling back to Earth, descending under a canopy of parachutes. The entire flight, from liftoff to touchdown, lasted a little over 10 minutes, with the crew experiencing a few minutes of weightlessness. “It was unreal,” Strahan said after emerging from the capsule. Bezos arrived to greet and embrace the newly minted citizen astronauts as they emerged from the capsule, all smiles. He then pinned astronaut wings to each of their collars. As she chatted with Bezos, Churchley recounted her wonder at seeing the blackness of space from inside the capsule. The spacecraft itself is named for Alan Shepard, who in 1961 made history as the second person, and the first American, to travel into space — a 15-minute suborbital flight. A decade later, Shepard walked on the moon as commander of the Apollo 14 mission, famously hitting two golf balls on the lunar surface.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/daughter-of-pioneering-us-astronaut-alan-shepard-soars-to-space/articleshow/88232483.cms||---

The strains were evident all week, as the Biden administration sought to bring the alliance with Israel into a united front about how to deal with Iran over the next year. In an effort to close the gap, US officials let out word this week that two months ago, President Joe Biden asked his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to review the Pentagon’s revised plan to take military action if the diplomatic effort collapsed. Officials also outlined new efforts to tighten, rather than loosen, sanctions on Iran. After a tense phone call with Blinken 10 days ago, Israeli PM Naftali Bennett dispatched his defence minister, Benny Gantz, and the new head of the Mossad, David Barnea, to US this week armed with new intelligence about Iranians’ uranium enrichment and the work of what Israel says is their weapons group. Despite the tougher American talk, Israeli officials left worried that the diplomatic outreach to Iran would continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/iran-nuclear-programme-sparks-fresh-us-israel-tensions/articleshow/88232519.cms||---

While a new administrator would be appointed to replace Chatterjee, the party said it would stand beside the maligned civic boss whom the CBI had arrested despite his cooperation in the probe into a Ponzi case. “We will definitely stand by him. The way he was arrested is wrong and we will not accept that. How can they arrest him if he has not been evading appearances before the CBI?” Trinamool district president Rabi Chatterjee said. “His name was not in the first CBI charge sheet. It was included later. They claim he was a legal adviser to the Ponzi firm. They arrested him after adding his name in the supplementary charge sheet. The party will seek justice for him,” the Trinamool leader added. Party sources said a new chairperson would likely be named in two days. “This position cannot remain vacant for a long time.

Promoting sustainability was the theme of the wedding. The family said its primary objective was to bring a sense of environment-friendliness and social responsibility to the celebrations. The festivities kick-started with a blessing ceremony by members of the transgender community, led by the iconic Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi. The decision to begin the wedding week with this ceremony stemmed from both tradition as well as the desire to speak up about the need for inclusiveness in out society, said Upasana Kamineni Konidela, sister of the bride and founder of URLife. “We deeply respect the transgender community of Hyderabad — it’s said to be one of the oldest in India. We were privileged to host representatives of the six badhai houses in Hyderabad. They have great stories to tell about life, and we are happy to have been able to interact with the community more closely,” said Upasana. The wedding week was punctuated by several similar events that celebrated the couple’s happiness by giving back to the community. On the second day, the bride’s family organised food boxes and festive clothing to be distributed amongst the children and adults at the Hyderabad-based non-profit organisation, Prajwala Foundation and to the elderly and children of Domakonda village, from where the bride’s family hails. Even the decor and gifting choices were thought out carefully, to make them sustainable as well as benefit the community at large. Over a thousand beeswax candles were handmade by the Chenchu tribal community from the Amrabad Forest Reserve, with a little help from Apollo Total Health, CSR initiative. The idea was to not just empower them but also increase their visibility. Similarly, all the flowers curated for the wedding were donated to Holy Waste — an organisation that recycles floral waste by turning it into products like incense sticks, soaps and organic Holi colours. Continuing the restoration initiative of the Domakonda Fort, owned by the bride’s ancestors, proud parents Anil and Shobana Kamineni picked personalised handcrafted Bidriware gifts for their guests, thereby reviving this dying art form of Telangana. That’s not all, a tree planting initiative was also undertaken and over 10,000 trees were initiated as part of the festivities. The wedding present for the bride and groom too was equally unique. Two lions at the Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, named Vicky and Lakshmi, were adopted by the duo for one year. The bride’s family also arranged a hearty lunch for the 450 employees at the zoo, as they wanted everyone to be a part of the celebrations. The event that caught the most attention was the unique Pochamma Panduga celebration at Domakonda Fort. This tradition has come down from generations, and the whole village joins the celebrations to worship the fort deity. The family was seen wearing upcycled designer wear and traditional handlooms to embrace the Telangana culture. Upasana’s parents-in-law, actor Chiranjeevi and wife Surekha, hosted an intimate bash to celebrate the newlyweds. This was followed by the bride’s aunt and uncle Sangeeta and Vishweshwar Reddy throwing a grand dinner in their honour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/anushpala-kamineni-and-armaan-ebrahim-raise-the-bar-for-eco-friendly-weddings/articleshow/88226913.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Sealdah flyover in Tripura road safety tweet, TMC slams ‘copycat’ model||KOLKATA: A Twitter post that was later deleted showing an image of Sealdah flyover in a Tripura government’s slogan-writing contest for road safety led a political spat on Saturday with Trinamool Congress accusing BJP-governed states of repeatedly using images of Kolkata to showcase their “development”. The post by the @mygovtripura handle had asked for entries in the motor vehicle driving regulation slogan-writing competition, carrying a cash award of Rs 5,000. It appeared to be part of the Tripura government’s road safety campaign. But the image used was one of Sealdah flyover, with its tram tracks, yellow taxis and buses. TMC claimed this was the third time in four months that BJP copied “TMC’s governance model”. “This is not the first time that a BJP-led government has engaged in dishonest means to trick voters using work done by the AITC government. In November, the Union ministry of civil aviation shared photographs of the Durgapur airport in Bengal and passed it off as an airport in Uttarakhand. Similarly, the Yogi Adityanath government had used pictures of Kolkata’s iconic Maa Flyover in a full-page advertorial in September to show the economic progress done by the UP government,” TMC said. “Is @BJP4Tripura claiming that these are their roads? Are there no well-maintained roads in Tripura? Has @BjpBiplab really NEGLECTED DEVELOPMENT to this extent? Ridiculous how BJP repeatedly steals from the #BengalModel to showcase @MamataOfficial’s developmental work as theirs!” TMC’s Tripura unit tweeted late on Friday. Campaigning in Behala, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh retorted back when asked about it. “Is Sealdah flyover their personal property? During advertisements, good images are always used to draw people. There will be numerous photographs of Eiffel Tower used in advertisements. What is wrong with it? They do not have anything else to say.” However, on Saturday evening, the original post was taken off Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sealdah-flyover-in-tripura-road-safety-tweet-tmc-slams-copycat-model/articleshow/88231345.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Guv: BSF & police must work in sync||Kolkata: After an hour-long meeting with Bengal chief secretary H K Dwivedi and state home secretary B P Gopalika, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday said he had broached the BSF issue with them, urging “cooperative coordination” between the central force and Bengal police. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has spoken to PM Narendra Modi about this and TMC MPs have taken it up with Union home minister Amit Shah. The Bengal assembly has already passed a resolution opposing the move. Bengal, along with Punjab, has opposed the Centre’s decision, which extends BSF’s jurisdiction to make search and seizures under several central laws from 15 km to 50 km along the international border; in Bengal’s case along the India-Bangladesh border. The governor said he had sought details on cabinet decisions by the year-end and a “status report” on appointments of vice-chancellors in state-run universities. The Bengal government didn’t react to Dhankhar’s statements. Trinamool MP Saugata Roy said that the Centre was trying to encroach on the rights of the state as law and order is a state subject. Dhankhar said he had also sought certain clarifications from the state government about The Howrah Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, relating to proceedings of hearing and adjudication of objections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-bsf-police-must-work-in-sync/articleshow/88231421.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: 3 illegal hotels at Buxa Tiger Reserve pulled down||KOLKATA: The forest department has finally swung into action against illegal structures in the core area of Buxa Tiger Reserve and razed three unauthorised private hotels, which were in different phases of construction. In November, a team of foresters had faced strong resistance while inspecting an illegal construction site on the banks of the Jainti river. Green activist Subhas Datta had recently informed the eastern regional bench of National Green Tribunal (NGT) — comprising Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Dasgupta (expert member) — that there were 69 establishments under private ownership and 20 under the state government at Buxa. The NGT, in its order dated August 31, 2017, had directed shutting down of all illegal establishments within the core area of the reserve. “But, it is alleged, that instead of closing down the hotels/resorts/illegal constructions, more such establishments have been allowed,” the bench had observed earlier this week. The forest department then finally issued notices to resort/hotel owners, asking them to vacate the land within seven days. Most hotels were being run under the guise of homestay. The department had warned that any unauthorised establishment on forest land would be demolished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-illegal-hotels-at-buxa-pulled-down/articleshow/88231329.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Kolkata||Roaring cheers for Buxa: Tiger caught on camera after nearly three decades||KOLKATA/JALPAIGURI: A tiger camera-trapped at the Buxa reserve after nearly three decades has sent foresters and wildlife conservationists into a tizzy. The photograph was clicked and released on Saturday. With no recent sighting in the north Bengal park until now, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had taken up an augmentation project at Buxa, the preparatory work for which is on. The news comes as a major boost for state wildlifers at a time the NTCA has reportedly refused to release protection funds for the reserve. The all-India tiger estimation report in 2019 had said there were no tigers left at Buxa. Experts say the recent sighting once again proves the importance of relocating forest villages to ensure a proper tiger habitat. State chief wildlife warden Debal Roy said: “We can safely say that this is the first record of a tiger at the park in at least two decades. This is great news when background work for tiger augmentation is on. We had earlier found indirect evidence (a few days ago, pugmarks were found on a riverbed), but now we have direct proof.” While a senior forester said a tiger was last sighted at Buxa in 1998, local residents claim the last sighting was in 1993, when a big cat was seen near the Pana river. State wildlife advisory board member Animesh Bose said the recent sighting had ended the tiger jinx for Buxa. “I had personally seen a tiger at the reserve in 1985. There had been indirect evidence like scat and incidents of cattle-lifting after that, but a tiger caught on camera is a huge relief for us,” he said. While Biswajit Roychowdhury of Nature, Environment and Wildlife Society has termed it a feather in the cap of the state forest department, Joydip Kundu of city-based NGO SHER said the efforts of the field staff had finally borne fruit. Buxa field director BR Sewa said the tiger might have come from Bhutan hills. “Deploying more and more camera traps to scan the forest has been a big move. Last year, we had placed 150 cameras; this year, 14 so far. We will install more soon,” he said. According to Sewa, parks like Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary and Jigme Syngye Wangchuk National Park in Bhutan have indirect connectivity with Buxa. “Since tigers have a big home range, it is possible that this one has migrated from Bhutan hills forest. Also, under the tiger augmentation plan, we have introduced at least 500 spotted deer in the park in two years, thus improving the habitat,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/roaring-cheers-for-buxa-tiger-caught-on-camera-after-nearly-three-decades/articleshow/88231417.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

Mohammad Khurasani, spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. It was the first attack since the TTP on Thursday announced the end of a onemonth cease-fire with the government. The truce had been announced in November amid peace talks between the two sides. The TTP has been targeting vaccination drives in Pakistan, claiming it was a Western conspiracy to sterilise children. The assault took place in Tank district on the second day of a five-day anti-polio drive in the province, a police official said. Two gunmen riding a motorcycle open fire at a police team escorting the medics, killing one constable and critically wounding another, the official said. Members of the vaccination team escaped unhurt, police said. CM of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mehmood Khan promised that the culprits will be brought to justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/in-first-attack-since-end-of-truce-ttp-fighters-kill-cop-on-polio-duty/articleshow/88232529.cms||---
---||Kolkata||YOU ARE WELCOME||Kolkata: Adapt, survive and thrive. This is the pandemic lesson the hospitality industry — on a roller-coaster ride since the outbreak of Covid-19 in early 2020 — has learnt along the road to recovery. Unlike last year when celebrations and big-ticket events were scaled down due to curbs, room occupancies have started to pick up again. While the festive season went good, the industry is expecting another sizeable uptick in business, thanks to enhanced capacity limits, easing of restrictions and the increased pace of vaccination. To suit each unique holiday need and preference, tailor-made packages are in for ‘staycations’ and ‘workcations’ with strict focus on safety protocols and a dash of ‘immunity-boosting’ ingredients on the menu. ITC Hotels has launched an initiative called “WeAssure” in collaboration with medical professionals and disinfection experts to reassure guests of the best-in-class safety and hygiene standards. “To ensure the safety of food preparation, we have implemented stringent measures and protocols, including mandatory temperature checks for all chefs and F&B associates, strict ingredient regulations and frequent disinfection of the kitchen area and equipment,” said Tejinder Singh, area manager east, ITC Hotels & cluster general manager, ITC Royal Bengal & ITC Sonar. “Our mindfully curated menus provide unique food experiences with ‘local love’ using fresh seasonal and local ingredients, while celebrated preparations from ITC Hotels are home-delivered through food aggregators and ITC Hotels F&B App, following a contactless service,” Singh added. The pandemic has caused hoteliers to reinvent their business models such that they are in tune with the changing needs of guests, says Dilip Mishra, gen-eral manager of The Lalit. “Guests are now more cautious about safety measures and the food they eat. Hence we follow strict cleanliness protocols between a guest’s checkout and another’s check-in in the same room. Also, a completely new menu has been designed with special focus on ‘immunity-boosting’ ingredi-ents. We have started procuring local stuff so that improvisations can be done at a lower cost and in lesser time,” he said. “When stay-at-home restrictions were in full force and workforce was downsized to curb the virus spread, our engineering / IT staff used to help with food de-livery if F&B staff were busy while the kitchen staff used to help the security or procurement departments,” Mishra added. Rishi Jain, MD of The Jain Group, feels that the easing of Covid-19 restrictions after the first lockdown paved the recovery path. “As it resulted in a travel boom to places like Siliguri and Gangtok, the city’s hospitality sector simultaneously began to see green shoots because of its strategic location as gateway to the northeast,” said Jain. The Jain Group’s current project in the hospitality division includes the Holiday Inn, Kolkata, which is a joint venture with IHG Hotels. JW Marriott Kolkata has created the Marriott Global Cleanliness Council to tackle the realities of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have rolled out enhanced tech-nologies, including electrostatic sprayers with hospital-grade disinfectants, to rapidly clean and disinfect surfaces throughout the hotel. In addition, the com-pany is testing ultraviolet light technology for sanitizing keys for guests and devices shared by associates,” said Sumeet Suri, general manager, JW Marriott Kolkata. He added that the brand was consistently trying to adapt to the new normal through the adoption of measures like digitisation, introduction of a sus-tainable plant-based menu and personalisation of services. “We need to evolve and innovate every month to be able to stay ahead of the game. As a result, we have reworked alternative sources of revenue like home deliveries and miscellaneous errands, reviewed the wedding business from cost per plate to cost per event as the numbers have reduced, analysed cost with a magnifying lens and questioned the ROI on every penny spent,” Suri added. For Ibiza, the recovery of business gradually started post-June last year as more local tourists started coming in on weekends. “A good network connectivity and WiFi enabled them to work from the resort, as was the norm largely during the pandemic. We achieved 80% of pre-Covid sales figures by January this year and had good footfall till April at Ibiza. Bookings for destination weddings are in high demand now,” said Subhadip Basu, GM of Ibiza The Fern Resort and Spa, Kolkata. “With increased vaccinations in place and adherence to Covid protocols, the footfall has again gone up since the relaxation of lockdown. This year, we are expecting the industry to bounce back,” Basu added. According to Kumar Shobhan, general manager at Hyatt Regency Kolkata, hotels and resorts across Bengal have been witnessing more than 65% occupancy since the last two-three months after the pandemic’s second wave. This unexpected rise is because of an increasing preference for intra-state travel given the restrictions on international travel and exciting offers and packages offered by most properties. “Hyatt Regency has curated stay offers keeping in mind both long-stay guests as well as staycation ones. The guest packages are tailor-made to ensure maximum flexibility and savings and to suit each unique holiday need and preference. The staycations come with the added benefits of a complimentary pick up and drop, room upgrade on the check-in and free stay for kids,” Shobhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/you-are-welcome/articleshow/88231518.cms||---

---||World||US, West allies pledge export controls tied to human rights||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration announced a partnership Friday with Australia, Denmark, Norway, Canada, France, the Netherlands and the UK to try to stem the flow of sensitive technologies to authoritarian governments. The partnership, named the Export Controls and Human Rights Initiative, calls for the countries to align their policies on exports of key technologies and develop a voluntary written code of conduct to apply human rights criteria to export licences, according to a White House statement. The effort is aimed at combating the rise of “digital authoritarianism” in countries such as China and Russia, where software and advanced surveillance technologies have been used to track dissidents and journalists, shape public opinion and censor information deemed dangerous by the government. By working to synchronise export controls across countries, American officials hope to cast a wider net to prevent authoritarian nations from accessing important technologies, as well as help companies with US operations work on a more even playing field. Samantha Power, administrator for the US Agency for International Development, said on Friday the US would undertake a suite of new measures over the next year to help set global norms around technology and human rights. Those steps include investing up to $20 million annually to expand the digital democracy work of the Agency for International Development, working with like-minded countries to establish principles for introducing an initiative with Canada and Denmark to lay out how governments should use surveillance technology in a manner consistent with human rights and the rule of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-west-allies-pledge-export-controls-tied-to-human-rights/articleshow/88232568.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Secunderabad Cantonment road closure: Junior defence minister scores self goal||HYDERABAD: The local military authority (LMA) in Secunderabad Cantonment has closed 12 roads, including two in 2021, in the last two years. However, five of these roads have been reopened with restrictions with the soldiers manning the entrances, retaining the discretion to allow or reject entry to any motorist. In a written reply to Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy in the Lok Sabha, Union minister of state (defence) Ajay Bhatt admitted that two roads were closed during 2021 and 10 roads during 2020. These include two roads in 'C' class defence land and 10 roads that fall under 'A' class defence land. Ironically, nine of the roads closed in the last five years are under 'C' class, which are under SCB control and not under Army (class 'A'). SCB is a civic body and closure of its roads means denial of right to freedom of movement on public roads, argue resident welfare associations. The reply was self-contradictory. Even though stating that no road was closed in the Secunderabad Cantonment after 2018, the minister gives details of the roads closed since 2016, including 10 roads in 2020 and two roads in 2021. In all, 19 roads were closed between 2016 and 2019. Of these, 19 roads, five were "partially" closed (during nights only). The minister said 31 roads were closed in the last five years and, of them, five were opened with "restriction" and five were "partially" opened. Revanth Reddy had asked "whether roads in cantonment area are frequently closed by the LMA despite several orders of this (defence) ministry regarding illegal closure of roads". The minister replied saying "No, sir. After issuance of MoD instructions dated September 4, 2018, no new road has been closed by LMA in contravention of the government instructions. However, two roads which were closed earlier continue to be closed." The reply was self-contradictory on two counts. First, the minister had admitted closure of 12 roads after 2019 (i.e., 2020 and 2021) while denying no road was closed after 2018. Secondly, the minister also admitted that two roads, which were closed earlier, continue to remain closed. The minister was, however, silent on the question of the action taken by the government to ensure that its orders of 2018 were implemented. He simply replied that as per the high court order, the LMA Secunderabad could close a road under its management for security reasons. People living in colonies abutting AOC Centre fear the LMA will close more roads citing security reasons as 58.1% of SCB falls under 'A1' (under active occupation of Army) and 'A2' land (reserved for future occupation of Army). About 2.03% of SCB land is under 'C' category (cantonment board land for its use). Only 27.48% of land belongs to private parties, 22 of closed roads fall under 'A' land and nine under 'C' land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cantonment-road-closure-junior-defence-minister-scores-self-goal/articleshow/88232564.cms||---
---||World||British study on Omicron suggests huge wave in January||LONDON: The UK government may need to introduce tougher restrictions to slow the growth of the Omicron variant and prevent a new surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations and deaths, British scientists said Saturday. UK health officials say Omicron is spreading much more quickly than the Delta strain and is likely to replace it and become the dominant variant in Britain within days. The UK recorded 58,194 virus cases on Friday, the highest number since January, though what portion were the Omicron variant is unclear. Concerns about the new variant led PM Boris Johnson’s Conservative government to reintroduce restrictions that were lifted almost six months ago. Masks must be worn in most indoor settings, vaccine certificates must be shown to enter nightclubs and people are being urged to work from home if possible. Many scientists say that’s unlikely to be enough. Modeling released on Saturday by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggested Omicron is likely to cause a large wave of infections by January, and could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England in the next five months if no other measures are taken. The most pessimistic scenario foresees half a million people hospitalised with the virus by the end of April and says daily hospital admissions could be double the previous peak in January 2021. The study by the scientists, who help advise the British government, has not been peer reviewed. The number of infections will depend on how much the variant escapes protection from vaccines, and how effective booster shots are at bolstering immunity, both of which remain unclear. Scientists in South Africa, where Omicron was first identified, say they see signs it may cause less severe disease than delta, but caution that it is too soon to be certain. “In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home,”' said Rosanna Barnard of the school’s Center for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases. “However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the (health service) is not overwhelmed.”' Johnson’s government says it is not considering tougher measures, but aims to offer everyone 18 and over a booster shot of vaccine by the end of January.

---||Business||‘Internet’s on fire’ as tech experts race to fix major software flaw||BOSTON: A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool — one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft — is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organisations around the world. “The internet’s on fire right now,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. “People are scrambling to patch,” he said, “and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it.” He said on Friday that in the12 hours since the bug’s existence was disclosed that it had been “fully weaponised”. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that’s ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. “I’d be hard-pressed to think of a company that’s not at risk,” said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it “the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade”. The vulnerability, dubbed Log4Shell, was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server — no password required — is what makes it so dangerous. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix. But patching systems around the world could be a complicated task. While most organisations and cloud providers such as Amazon should be able to update their web servers easily, the same Apache software is also often embedded in third-party programmes, which often can only be updated by their owners. The first obvious signs of the flaw’s exploitation appeared in Minecraft, an online game owned by Microsoft. Microsoft said it had issued a software update for Minecraft users. Researchers said the vulnerability could be exploited in servers run by companies such as Apple, Amazon, Twitter and Cloudflare. Cloudflare’s Sullivan said there we no indication his company’s servers had been compromised. The firms did not respond to requests for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/internets-on-fire-as-tech-experts-race-to-fix-major-software-flaw/articleshow/88232625.cms||---

The UK is seeking elusive consensus from the club in response to what it calls “malign behaviour” by Russia, and over tensions with China and Iran. “We need to defend ourselves against the growing threats from hostile actors,” British foreign secretary Liz Truss said as she opened the meeting of foreign ministers from the UK, the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. “And we need to come together strongly to stand up to aggressors who are seeking to limit the bounds of freedom and democracy.” The US and its Nato allies are concerned that Russia could invade Ukraine and have said they would inflict curbs on Russia if that happens. Moscow denies planning any attack. Truss and US secretary of state Antony Blinken discussed how to deter Russia from “further aggression against Ukraine” in a meeting, the state department said. UK said the two warned that a Russian incursion “would be a strategic mistake for which there would be serious consequences”. The state department also said the top American diplomat for Europe, Karen Donfried, will visit Kiev and Moscow next week “to reinforce the US’ commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty” and to seek a diplomatic solution to the crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/g7-ministers-present-a-united-front-against-russia-over-ukraine-crisis/articleshow/88232634.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata hospitals revive early-pandemic protocol to face Omicron threat||KOLKATA: Two suspected Omicron cases have led private hospitals in Kolkata to revive their old Covid porotocol, including noting down travel histories of patients with symptoms and isolating those who have been abroad recently or in contact with such individuals. Use of PPEs is being enhanced and frontline workers have been asked to strictly follow prescribed safety norms. Some hospitals have started identifying areas for a separate Omicron isolation ward. The AMRI Hospitals, where the first Omicron suspect is now admitted, has revived its Covid Task Force Committee that was formed soon after the onset of the pandemic last year and includes an infection control team, microbiologists and critical care experts. "We have gone back to the measures that were in place at the beginning of the pandemic. Our health workers have been asked to follow all safety measures since this variant is apparently more transmissible. The suspect has been kept in a separate room even as we wait for the confirmation report. We are also awaiting directions from the government on whether we should have a separate Omicron ward," said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that a more detailed travel history is now being sought from patients. Hospitals stress on checking travel history of Covid+ patientsAt RN Tagore hospital, those with a recent travel history to South Africa and certain countries would now be isolated and tested for Covid before being guided to the fever clinic if they have symptoms, ensuring that they don’t come in contact with other patients. “Samples of those with a travel history testing positive would be sent for genome sequencing through the ID Hospital,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added that while temperature screening of all patients will continue, suspected patients will now go through stricter screening if they have a travel history. Isolation rooms are being identified for Omicron patients at Medica, which has also stepped up safety norms since Friday. “In case there is an Omicron spread, we will be ready with separate rooms for each patient. Each Covid suspect is being asked for a detailed travel record,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. Peerless Hospital, too, has alerted its staff about the need to strengthen safety measures and ensure that each patient’s travel history is noted. “We have been diligently maintaining the travel history of each Covid positive since the onset of pandemic. Since the number of Covid patients has gone down, each patient is now given a separate room,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Hospitals, however, hope that the measures may not be necessary for long since most Omicron cases have reportedly been mild. “The suspect now admitted is asymptomatic and so are a majority of those who have tested positive to the variant. We are keeping our fingers crossed,” said Barua.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-hospitals-revive-early-pandemic-protocol-to-face-omicron-threat/articleshow/88232679.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Pune||Maharashtra: FIR against Parbhani officer for vaccine ‘lag’||PUNE: Parbhani collector Aanchal Goyal has filed an FIR against a health officer managing a primary health centre on the charge of not actively participating in the Covid vaccination programme. The FIR was filed based on a report by the zilla parishad CEO on the poor performance of the officer, who was not conducting the necessary number of drives nor was he taking steps to complete the first dose of vaccination, Goyal told TOI. The percentage of first dose completion in the district is 73 and the second dose 38. Pimpalghari, where the health centre is situated, has registered less than 70% first dose vaccination as reported by the zilla parishad CEO. Goyal said the FIR, filed through the tehsildar, has been registered under sections 2,3 and 4 of the Epidemic Act, 1893, and section 56 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. “These sections mainly deal with dereliction of duty,” said the collector. Besides, a departmental inquiry would be initiated against the health officer. Collectors in the state are monitoring the vaccination programme in the districts they are in charge of. The state currently has 85% partial or first-dose beneficiaries and 50% full-dose beneficiaries. FIR against officer for ‘lag’ in vaccinationParbhani district occupies 30th position in terms of vaccination in Maharashtra. According to the complaint, even after following up with the official and urging him to encourage citizens to participate in the drive, no effort to push the immunisation drive was taken by the concerned officer. State government officials have been directing local authorities to speed up vaccination in all districts in the wake of omicron variant and experts stressing on completion of double-dose vaccination. Nearly 22 districts in Maharashtra have continued to be below the state average in both the doses. Districts such as Parbhani, Gadchiroli, Hingoli, Beed, Nanded and Nandurbar have been directed to boost first dose of the covid vaccination. Nanded and Nandurbar, till now, have not even completed 70% first-dose vaccination, according to the chart issued on December 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-fir-against-parbhani-officer-for-vaccine-lag/articleshow/88232710.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Her father, who took her custody from Dongri's Children Welfare Home, did not press any charges against the teenager, an engineering student. The girl's parents have roots in India. On December 4, a yellow notice was issued for the missing girl by Interpol through the nodal agency, CBI. A yellow notice is a global police alert for a missing person. It is published for victims of parental abductions, criminal abductions and unexplained disappearances. Police said while going through her social media accounts, her parents suspected she could be in India. Police said the girl had befriended the boy on Instagram and after a prolonged friendship, took a month's tourist visa without her parents' knowledge. Faces no chargesHaving taken a month's tourist visa without her parents' knowledge, the 16-year-old Swedish girl landed in Mumbai from Sweden. Upon arriving in Mumbai on November 27, she intended to live with the friend but his family did not let her stay with them, and put her up with a female cousin in a separate flat in Trombay itself, said an officer. On November 27, the girl's family lodged a missing person complaint with Swedish authorities who, in turn, took the help of Interpol. The Interpol, through the CBI, then approached Mumbai police. Mumbai police then handed over the probe to the Interpol liaison office of the crime branch. Interpol, along with Crime Branch Unit 6, finally traced the girl. She was then sent to the Children's Welfare Home in Dongri. Meanwhile, the Swedish embassy and the Delhi Interpol office were informed about the developments. "The Crime Branch Unit 6 was asked to trace the victim who was suspected to be in Trombay. With technical help, we traced the girl and handed her over to her family through the CBI," said Neelotpal, deputy commissioner of police (Detection 1). Police said the girl's father first landed in Delhi and from there he came to Mumbai and took custody of his daughter, and on Friday the two flew back to Sweden. The father said he did not want to file any complaint against the teenage boy as he was not at fault.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/swedish-teen-who-fled-to-mumbai-for-boyfriend-sent-back/articleshow/88232768.cms||Ahmed Ali

There have been instances of vaccination teams trekking through forests and over hills, but in Dindori, a team of mostly women not only had to use boats, but learn to row them too. When field vaccination teams tried to reach Patri Udan village in Dindori development block recently, they found the hamlet surrounded by the Narmada and Kharmer rivers. The only way in was by canoe. Boats could be found but not boatmen. Undaunted, the vax team boarded the small boats and began rowing. ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife) worker Radha Samaiya said, “It was scary but there was no other option. The locals there are not very enthusiastic about vaccination. First, we have to make them understand, convince them, and only then will they agree to get vaccinated.” Anganwadi worker Mayawati. ‘Vaxxed people against all odds’Mayawati, who had learnt to row so that she could deliver midday meals, was their onthe-go trainer, who joined them on the mission. Dr DPS Thakur said, “The village is isolated and small boats are the only way to reach there. Despite the difficulties, we have been able to vaccinate majority of the eligible residents. There are 35 families in the village. Of the 85 adults, 79 have been fully vaccinated.” Dindori chief medical and health officer Dr Ramesh Marawi said, “Despite difficult terrain and other issues, we have achieved 93% first-dose and 87% full vaccination in the district.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-vaccination-teams-row-the-extra-mile-in-dindori/articleshow/88232567.cms||Siddharth Shankar Pandey

---||Bengaluru||Don’t place strong curbs during Christmas, New Year: Traders to BBMP||BENGALURU: Business establishments are upbeat this Christmas-New Year holiday season with crowds once again turning up at shopping and partying hubs across the city. Riding high on optimism, retail trade bodies, including pubs and bars, have now appealed to the state government not to puncture their hopes by imposing severe restrictions citing resurgence of Covid-19 and its new variant, Omicron. Unlike the last two holiday shopping seasons, when traders were badly hit as sales plummeted, the run-up to New Year is seeing more youngsters chilling out on the streets and in-store traffic going up significantly. But talks of imposing night deadlines and other restrictions in the backdrop of the Omicron variant have upped anxiety levels among traders. In fact, trade bodies have given a representation to BBMP to allow them to continue with ‘normal business’, with an assurance that all Covid protocols will be followed. Popular central business district streets such as MG Road and Brigade Road, which are always jam-packed with revellers on New Year’s eve, will keep celebrations low key. “We won’t be celebrating how we usually do every year. There won’t be any special lighting in our streets,” said Suhail Yusuf, secretary of Brigade Shops and Establishments Association. “With increasing Omicron cases, it is important to keep in the mind that Covid-19 still exists,” he added. However, shop owners on Brigade Road and Church Street want people to drop by without fear. “We cannot afford more shops closing down because of lack of business following Covid,” said another shop owner. Suhail added: “A 125-member association is now down to 90 because of the impact of the pandemic.” Meanwhile, traders on Commercial Street are gearing up to celebrate the yearend with a bang. They are pooling in around Rs 12-13 lakh to decorate the 700-metre stretch, which has been marred by Bengaluru Smart City Project’s redevelopment works. Mayank Rohatgi, secretary of Bengaluru Commercial Association, said members have decided to contribute and beautify the road. “We have spoken to Bengaluru Smart City Limited officials, and they have assured us of finishing road works by December 20, after which we will decorate the stretch,” said Rohatgi. Pubs and restaurants in the city have requested BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta to grant them permission to operate and extend deadlines. “The pandemic has already affected many of us. Celebrations like Christmas and New Year help us,” said a pub owner in Indiranagar. “People have worked from home through the pandemic and on News Year they’d want to party, which needs to be supported,” he added. “We should welcome the coming year and pray this pandemic ends. Celebrations are important,” said another pub owner, who runs a chain in the city. “Instead of stopping an activity, the government should fix rules to limit the crowd and we will accept it,” he added. Gupta agreed to raise traders’ concerns with the government and subsequently come to a final decision. “We need to understand Covid-19 situation still exists and we are taking extreme measures to control an outbreak. Thus, we will be able to decide on celebrations only after the government takes a call,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dont-place-strong-curbs-during-christmas-new-year-traders-to-bbmp/articleshow/88232885.cms||Nithya Mandyam
