It is alleged by the father that his son was murdered by policemen. The petition was filed by Antony Job of Kudavechoor in Kottayam regarding the death of his son Jijo Antony, allegedly at Kavanattinkara near Kumarakom on the evening of November 7. Jijo was working as a chef in Dubai and was scheduled to rejoin work a month later, the father’s plea said. Kumarakom police had registered a case against Jijo on November 7 alleging that he wrongfully restrained Satheesh Chandran V, driver of Kottayam district police chief at Kavanattinkara. Producing a copy of a CCTV footage, the father contends that it shows his son entering Lakshmi Hotel at Kavanattinkara at 8.40pm and four policemen following him inside. Three local persons are also seen following the police into the hotel but two of them are seen hurrying out suddenly, the petition said. While the postmortem report says his son drowned and the police’s version allegedly is that Jijo drowned in a canal at the backside of the hotel, the father points out water is only a foot deep there. His death was due to the manhandling by police and they dumped his body in the canal, the father has alleged while highlighting bodily injuries. Considering the petition filed through advocate PB Sahasranaman during admission hearing on Tuesday, justice K Haripal has sought the views of the police and the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/death-of-27-year-old-chased-by-kerala-police-father-seeks-cbi-probe-at-hc/articleshow/88150894.cms||Mahir Haneef

Expressing optimism about restoration of special status under Article 370 to Jammu and Kashmir, he said people in J&K were resolute enough and steadfast in their resolve to stand for their rights. “We will fight for our rights peacefully as we don’t believe in violence,” he said while addressing a day-long convention of the NC in Jammu. Referring to the repeal of three farm laws in the face of stiff resistance by farmers, he said the government was forced to announce rollback fearing a poll debacle in five states. “The farm laws were passed in a huff, notwithstanding the demand for debate and discussion by the opposition parties ahead of their passage,” he said while claiming that just like the farm laws, the government would have to bow down before the strong will of the people of J&K. Decrying the August 2019 political developments, he described revocation of special status to J&K as snatching away the rights of the people of J&K. Abdullah also questioned the type of democracy being practised by the BJP and referred to the expulsion of 12 members from Rajya Sabha. He said the decision was prompted by the government’s intention of seeking passage of bills as the numbers do not favour the government. The NC chief also expressed concern over the state of affairs in J&K, saying bureaucrats have become authority unto themselves. He said the halting of Durbar Move hugely impacted Jammu businesses. He questioned the claims of normalcy and revival of tourism across J&K. He also dwelt upon the problems being faced by the farmers in Jammu and Kashmir, especially in the wake of recent hailstorm and damages caused to the standing crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-had-acceded-to-gandhis-india-not-godses-farooq/articleshow/88152606.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

This is the second time in the past four years that Nasa has chosen an Indian-American for the astronaut training programme. In June 2017, Indian-American Raja Chari was selected and is currently at the International Space Station. Chari is part of Nasa’s Artemis mission to the moon. There were around 12,000 applications this year. Immediately after the announcement, Chris Sembroski, who was part of the historic Inspiration 4/Space X mission in September, posted on Facebook: “Congratulations Anil Menon!! NASA Astronaut class of 2021! Absolutely thrilled for this guy! They selected the very best.” A lieutenant colonel with the US Air Force, Menon was born and raised in Minnesota. He was SpaceX’s first flight surgeon, helping to launch the company’s first humans to space during Nasa’s SpaceX Demo-2 mission and building a medical organization to support the human system during future missions. Prior to that, the 45-year-old had served Nasa as the crew flight surgeon for various expeditions, taking astronauts to the International Space Station. Menon is an actively-practising emergency medicine physician with fellowship training in wilderness and aerospace medicine. Menon had spent a year in India as a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar to study and support polio vaccination. He is also part of a diverse class that aims to land the first woman as well as the first person of colour on the moon in 2025-2026. The 10-member group will start its two-year training at Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre in January 2022. Upon completion, they could be assigned to missions that involve performing research aboard the space station, launching from American soil on spacecraft built by commercial companies, as well as deep space missions to destinations including the moon on Nasa’s Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System rocket. With the addition of these 10 members of the 2021 astronaut candidate class, Nasa now has selected 360 astronauts since the original Mercury Seven in 1959. Director of Nasa’s Johnson Space Centre, Vanessa Wyche, said: “Today we reach further into the stars as we push forward to the moon once again and on to Mars with Nasa’s newest astronaut candidate class.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-american-in-nasas-astronaut-class-of-2021/articleshow/88152612.cms||Srinivas Laxman

At the weekly auction of state development loans, six states raised just Rs 8,000 crore, which is 41 per cent lower than the indicated Rs 13,600 crore, according to an analysis by Icra Ratings, which said this is the sixth consecutive week of lower-than-indicated issuance. Aditi Nayar, the chief economist at the rating agency, said the spread between the 10-year state debt and the G-secs eased to a 24 month-low of 45 bps from 51 bps last week, while the weighted average cost of their borrowings jumped by 37 bps to 6.80 per cent over the past week. Seven of the 13 states that initially indicated their participation in the auction did not raise funds, even as Telangana borrowed Rs 500 crore more than indicated, she said. According to another agency Care Ratings, the market borrowings by the states so far in FY22 are 18 per cent less than that in corresponding period of FY21. As many as 29 states/UTs have cumulatively raised (except Odisha) Rs 4,19,900 crore so far this fiscal, down 18.4 per cent on-year from Rs 5,14,600 crore. According to Care, the weighted average cost of borrowings, across states and tenures, rose to 6.80 per cent, which is a one-month high while the weighted average yield of the 10-year bonds was stable at 6.84 per cent at last week's level. The issuance has trailed the notified amount for the sixth consecutive week as the cash-flow situation of the large states seem to have benefitted from the release of the final GST compensation end-October and the release of a higher monthly tax devolution to the states in November, Icra said, adding of the total funds today, Rs 3,500 crore or 44 per cent were raised in the shorter tenor of 5-9 years, Rs 3,000 crore or 38 per cent in longer tenors and a just Rs 1,500 crore or 19 per cent were in the 10-year bucket. As a result, the weighted average tenor of SDLs dipped to 12 years today from 13 years last week and the weighted average cut-off rose to 6.80 per cent today from 6.43 per cent in the last auction, led by increase in the weighted average cut-off shorter tenor to 6.67 per cent today from 5.18 per cent last week, Nayar said, adding however, the weighted average cut-off of the 10-year SDL stood at 6.84 today, unchanged from last week. This is despite the benchmark 10-year Gsecs yield has risen 6 bps to 6.39 per cent today from 6.33 per cent last Tuesday. This reflects factors such as the US Fed chairman's comments regarding accelerating the bond purchase taper, while acknowledging that inflation pressures may not be transitory, the partial rebound in global crude oil prices, and the expectation that while the MPC will maintain status quo in the policy review tomorrow, it will signal upcoming policy normalisation. Accordingly, the spread between the 10-year weighted average SDL and G-secs yield narrowed to 45 bps, the lowest since December 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/states-borrowing-cost-again-on-a-song-hits-1-month-high-at-6-8/articleshow/88152728.cms||---
---||Business||Pandemic boosts super-rich share of global wealth||LONDON: The share of household wealth owned by billionaires has risen by a record amount during the pandemic, with millionaires also coming out of Covid-19 ahead, a study found on Tuesday. The World Inequality Report produced by a network of social scientists estimated that billionaires this year collectively own 3.5% of global household wealth, up from slightly above 2% at the start of the pandemic in early 2020. "The Covid crisis has exacerbated inequalities between the very wealthy and the rest of the population," lead author Lucas Chancel said, noting that rich economies used massive fiscal support to mitigate the sharp rises in poverty seen elsewhere. The report drew on a variety of specialist research and public domain data, with a foreword written by US-based economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two of the trio who won a 2019 Nobel for work on poverty. "Since wealth is a major source of future economic gains, and increasingly, of power and influence, this presages further increases in inequality," they wrote of what they called an "extreme concentration of economic power in the hands of a very small minority of the super-rich". The findings corroborate a range of existing studies, "rich lists" and other evidence pointing to a rise in health, social, gender and racial inequalities during the pandemic. Forbes' annual world's billionaires list this year included a record-breaking 2,755 billionaires with a combined worth of $13.1 trillion, up from $8 trillion last year. The new report showed that a wider group of 520,000 adults who make up the top 0.01% richest together saw their share of global wealth hit 11% this year, up from 10% the year before. Belonging to the top 0.01% category meant having household wealth of at least 16.7 million euros ($19 million), adjusted for purchasing power parity across currencies, it said. Analysts say some super-rich have benefited from the shift online of much of the world's economy during lockdowns, while others simply gained from rising asset prices as financial markets bet on the speed and shape of the global recovery. The study also found that while poverty increased sharply in countries with weaker welfare coverage, massive government support in the United States and Europe was able to mitigate at least some of that impact on lower earners there. "This shows the importance of social states in the fight against poverty," Chancel said. Separately, it welcomed this year's deal on a global minimum corporation tax rate of 15% as a possible milestone in efforts to halt a "race to the bottom" which since the mid-1980s has led to a halving of average company tax rates to around 24%. However it said the agreement was flawed because the 15% floor was lower than what average-earners pay in high-income countries and because it offered carve-outs and opaque arbitration possibilities to many of the companies affected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/pandemic-boosts-super-rich-share-of-global-wealth/articleshow/88152809.cms||---

A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh willingly adjourned the matter but could not help but notice that diametrically opposite ends in solicitor general Tushar Mehta and activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan have come together to make a joint request for adjournment on hearing of the PIL on the same ground of ‘changed circumstances’. “This is probably the first time that the SG and Bhushan are making a joint request,” the bench said in a lighter vein. “There appears something wrong,” said Mehta. He did clarify that his comments were in lighter vein much to the amusement of the bench and those present in the courtroom. Petitioner Monicca Agarwal had sought removal of agitating farmers from the roads on the ground that their right to protest is violating the right of commuters to safe and smooth travel on public roads. A bench headed by Justice Kaul had in Shaheen Bagh road block protest against CAA, had ruled that no one had a right to indefinitely block public roads and pathways.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-defers-hearing-on-plea-to-evict-protesting-tillers/articleshow/88152880.cms||---

It included withdrawal of cases against farmers, provided they end their agitation which has seen blockades on major roads at Delhi’s borders. Responding to the offer, the unions insisted the government must first initiate the process of withdrawal of cases. They said a decision will be taken on the ongoing protests on Wednesday only after getting clarifications on this issue and certain other points. Yet, the flow of events suggested that a resolution could be in sight, possibly after a meeting between the union leaders and senior ministers.

The court put off the PIL by more than a month, noting, “This is probably the first time the SG and Bhushan are making a joint request.” Govt proposes MSP panel, end of stir for withdrawal of casesAppealing to the unions, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh, to end their protests, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) wrote to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) — the joint platform of protesting unions — and gave a five-point proposal which includes setting up a committee on MSP with representations from the SKM and other organisations, withdrawal of cases with a condition to first end the agitation, and in-principle agreement on compensating the kin of the farmers who died during the year-long protests. The ministry elaborated that withdrawal of cases would also pertain to those registered in the UTs (Delhi and Chandigarh) and by the central agencies such as railways. On the other two demands, the ministry assured the unions that the government would not introduce the Electricity (Amendment) Bill in the Parliament without consulting all stakeholders. Besides, it said, the government has already decriminalised the stubble burning provisions (Section 14 and 15) in the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) Law. The unions would need to take a call on the MSP issue as it is highly unlikely that the Centre would agree to a legal guarantee and a committee would certainly have representations from pro-reform unions like the Shetkari Sanghatana. The ministry’s note to the SKM, however, remained silent on the sixth demand about arrest and dismissal of junior home minister Ajay Mishra in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which four farmers died.

These MHA’s missive, farmer leaders said, was not clear on these issues. Elaborating on the clarifications, Dhawale, one of the five members of the committee formed for talks with the government, said, “The MSP committee proposed by the government may include even those farmer organisations that supported the farm laws. This is not acceptable to us.” Though the MHA letter has not spelt out the modalities of withdrawal of cases and the quantum of the compensation, it said the UP and Haryana governments have given in principle consent on compensation while Punjab has publicly announced its decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-call-today-on-ending-stir-as-govt-meets-5-demands/articleshow/88152690.cms||Vishwa Mohan

It will be remembered by a two-month-old baby when she grows up as her father was among the dead that day. Or by the wife of a man who got married just 9 days before the tragedy. The 36-year-old Langtun Konyak, a farmer and part-time coal miner, married Ngamlem in September last year and they were blessed with a daughter two months ago. “He was a good son and sole breadwinner for the family,” his father Monyam said over a video call. That was all the shattered father could convey as his widowed daughter-in-law Ngamlem sat on a chair, cradling her baby and staring into the blankness. Ngamlem, Langton's wife, with her two-month-old daughter on Tuesday at Oting village. Langton was one of the 13 people killed in a botched Army ambush and the subsequent violence in Mon district of NagalandMon district, the land of the Konyak tribe, has been shocked by the brutal killings of innocent civilians — all between 25 and 37 of age — returning after a hard day’s work at one of the coal mines in Lower Tiru, about 15km from Oting. The mines are between Oting in Tizit zone and Tiru in Naginimora circle. One more villager was killed on Sunday when security forces fired to disperse protesters, taking the overall toll to 14. A funeral service was held for the villagers on Monday where Nagaland CM Neiphiu Rio paid his last respects. Mining starts in October, after the rains, and continues through the winter till April. Villagers in the area work in the mines as a side gig to supplement their income. “Money is needed for Christmas. And the incident coming just ahead of Christmas makes it even more tragic,” said Hosea Konyak of Oting, who is an adviser to the tribe’s apex body Konyak Union. A village of 190 homes, most people in Oting work part-time in the mines during this season, he said. Nagaland is a Christian-majority state. Hokup's mother Neingam mourns her son's demise at her home in Oting on Tuesday. Langton was one of the 13 people killed in a botched Army ambush and the subsequent violence in Mon district of NagalandHosea knew Hokup Konyak, a neighbour, since childhood. “He couldn’t study beyond Class X but he was a good man. He was the president of the church association for 10 years,” he said. The 37-year-old Hokup got married on November 25, he said. Hokup was the main breadwinner for his family. His mother Neingam said he lost his father in 2004 when he was 20 and has been taking care of the family since then. Hokup had been a miner for the past three seasons. On Tuesday, the village held a meeting to express solidarity with the bereaved families. The villagers were worried about a dozen people wounded in the firing and admitted to hospitals in Dibrugarh, Dimapur and Mon. Some are said to be grievously wounded. “We want the draconian Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) to be withdrawn from Konyak land and the entire Nagaland. The central government should apologise to the people and the community and arrest the officer under whose command such a massacre took place. We want justice, not just blood money being given by the government,” said Hosea. The cry for AFSPA’s repeal has gotten louder. Nagaland CM Rio and his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma weighed in too, demanding on Monday withdrawal of the law that allows security forces to arrest without warrant and kill without having to answer for it. Konyak Union decided at a meeting on Tuesday to observe a seven-day mourning period across Mon district, said Shingwang Konyak, member of its advisory board and former SDM. “Total lockdown was observed in Mon today. Black flags will be put up at all institutions, offices and shops, and people will be wearing black armbands and ribbons as a mark of protest and mourning,” he said. “We plan to hold a candlelit service on December 13.” The organisation has come up with a five-point charter of demands for the country’s President. Saying the killings “can’t be termed a case of mistaken identity”, the charter seeks an independent probe into the incident and trial in a civil court of the personnel involved in the shooting. The union demanded immediate removal of 37 Assam Rifles from Mon district and revocation of AFSPA from the entire northeast.

The cabinet also called off events scheduled for the last four days of the state-organised 10-day Hornbill festival near Kohima to mourn the deaths. Speaking at a mass funeral service for the victims in Mon on Monday, CM Neiphiu Rio had said it was a travesty that the “draconian” AFSPA hadn’t been withdrawn from Nagaland despite a 25-year ceasefire with insurgent groups. Everytime the state would recommend that the “disturbed area” tag be removed, the Centre would extend it by another year to keep the AFSPA in force. Rio’s demand that the legislation must go was echoed by his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma, also an NDA ally on Tuesday. Minister and government spokesperson Neiba Kronu said the emergency cabinet meeting was briefed on the actions taken by the government, including setting up an SIT. He said the cabinet gave the team a month to submit its findings. In Assam, student associations and human rights organisations joined the chorus for repeal of the AFSPA. Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad general secretary Palash Changmai lauded Nagaland CM Rio for speaking his mind. “Rio has reminded his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma that he should have the courage to speak loud and clear.

In Assam, student organisations, human rights bodies and civil society members have joined the chorus for repealing the law, which has claimed so many innocent lives.  Leading student-youth organisation, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba-Chatra Parishad, will protest at 11 am on Wednesday demanding the withdrawal of the law. Similarly, the All Assam Students’ Union has extended full support to the North East Student Organization's (Neso) protest on December 9.  AJYCP general secretary Palash Changmai lauded Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio for asking the Centre to repeal the AFSPA. “Rio has reminded his Assam counterpart Himanta Biswa Sarma that they should have the courage to speak loud and clear. The Assam chief minister, who heads the North East Democratic Alliance, should put pressure on the Union government to repeal AFSPA. He should fulfill his responsibilities towards the Northeast,” said Changmai at a news conference on Tuesday.  He urged Sarma to make it clear before PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah that the northeast is in a region of peace where laws like AFSPA are not needed. “Whether it's Assam, Nagaland or Manipur, there are no major activities of armed rebel groups today,” Changmai added. He said that in Assam, one faction of the Ulfa, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, is in talks with the government and the Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa (Independent) had also announced ceasefire. There has been no violence in recent times, he stressed.  Demow College in upper Assam saw students shouting slogans at the entrance demanding the withdrawal of AFSPA.  Civil society group Axom Nagarik Samaj (ANS), led by former Assam DGP and noted littereteur Harekrishna Deka on Tuesday said the argument of “mistaken identity” in the firing cannot be accepted. “We have no words to condemn this massacre by the security forces. “Mistaken identity” has no meaning for the dead and their family members,” said Deka.  “We welcome the public denouncement of this law by the chief minister of Nagaland. But in this regard, we must see some concrete steps being taken by the Nagaland government so that we can believe the CM means what he says. The situation in Nagaland is tense. People there want to lead a normal, peaceful life,” he said.  Neso chairman Samuel B Jyrwa said repealing AFSPA is going to be their prime demand in the protests scheduled for December 9. “The protests will be all over the Northeast to show our solidarity with the people of Oting village and Nagaland. AFSPA must be repealed. It's a long pending demand of Neso and civil society,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chorus-for-withdrawing-afspa-grows-shriller-in-northeast/articleshow/88153050.cms||Kangkan Kalita

I should not be saying this repeatedly since you are not like chiildren. It will be better that you change yourself, or changes will happen in due course,” sources quoted PM telling MPs during the first weekly meeting of the parliamentary party in the winter session. According to sources, the PM, who has repeatedly frowned upon rampant absenteeism, was upset because there have been occasions when proceedings had to be adjourned for lack of quorum this session. Modi said he doesn’t want to tell MPs regularly about their duties and responsibilities, rather, they themselves should be sincere about it. The ongoing session has witnessed one of the poorest attendances of the MPs specially in Rajya Sabha. The immediate trigger for the PM’s warning was parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi’s remarks bemoaning the absence of BJP MPs, according to sources. Even during the debate on Covid situation in the country recently, which happened for the first time in a structured manner, the attendance of the Lok Sabha was low and one of its sittings was delayed due to lack of quorum. Sharing the details of the parliamentary party meeting, which was for the first time held outside Parliament complex at the Ambedkar International Centre, Joshi said the PM told party MPs that all of them should organise sports competitions in their respective constituencies. At the meeting BJP chief J P Nadda asked party MPs to call district presidents and presidents of mandals from their respective constituencies for tea and interact with them Similarly, the Prime Minister will call district presidents from his constituency Varanasi on December 14. At the meeting, tribal MPs including minister Arjun Munda felicitated PM Modi for celebrating Birsa Munda’s birthday as ‘Jan Jatiya Diwas’.

A bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna said that drugs have a deadly impact on the society and the interest of the society as a whole should be taken into consideration while punishing the accused under NDPS Act. Those who are dealing in narcotic drugs are instruments in causing death or in inflicting death blow to a number of innocent young victims who are vulnerable. Such accused causes deleterious effects and deadly impact on the society. They are hazard to the society,” it said “...While awarding the sentence or punishment in case of NDPS Act, the interest of the society as a whole is required to be taken into consideration,” it said, while dismissing Pakistani national Mohd Zahid’s plea. Zahid was arrested in 1999 and convicted by a Amritsar court for smuggling four kilos of heroin and was awarded a 12 year jail term. While he was undertrail, Zahid was caught again by Delhi Police and 750 gram of heroin was recovered and he was convicted and awarded a 15-year jail term by a Delhi court in 2002 for the repeat offence. He, thereafter, approached Delhi HC for concurrent running of sentence but his plea was rejected. Subsequently, he approached the SC. The SC, however, held that a convict cannot demand concurrent running of sentences if convictions were in different cases and it is discretion of the court to allow concurrent and not consecutive sentences. Enumerating Section 427 of the CrPC, the bench said the power conferred on the court to order concurrent sentence is discretionary and can only be done in appropriate cases. It said, ordinarily the subsequent sentence would commence at the expiration of the first term of imprisonment unless the court directs the subsequent sentence to run concurrently with the previous sentence. “The general rule is that where there are different transactions, different crime numbers and cases have been decided by different judgments, concurrent sentence can’t be awarded under Section 427... the court has the power and discretion to issue a direction that all the subsequent sentences run concurrently with the previous sentence, however discretion has to be exercised judiciously depending on the nature of the offence or the offences,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drug-dealers-hazard-to-society-deserve-no-leniency-supreme-court/articleshow/88153160.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

SII has written to the government to seek clarity on its requirement, if any, for normal two doses for eligible people and also on booster doses. “I’m actually in a dilemma that I never imagined... we are producing 250 million doses a month but the good news is that India has covered up a large part of its population and we would have completed all our orders to the health ministry in a week’s time,” Adar said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. On his future production strategy, he said as there were “no other orders in hand, so I’m going to reduce the production by at least 50% to begin with...on a monthly basis until the orders again pick up either in India or the world” “Over the eight months when we couldn’t export, other nations managed vaccine supplies from donations from the US and elsewhere and we have lost a lot of market share,” he said. He added that he is going to try to claw the demand back in the first quarter of next year. “We must keep in mind that we don’t need a situation like last year where suddenly the country needs hundreds of millions of doses. That won’t be possible if we dial down our production. So that is why we have explained this to the government and experts to let us know now. Just give us that guidance. That discussion is on at the moment,” he further said. “If they need more vaccines for booster doses, we have written to them (central government),” Adar said. He said the vaccine major currently has a stock of 500 million doses. “Half of that is finished product and half can be finished in a matter of two months and it has a shelf life of nine months, so we have to decide what to do with the stock. It is available on priority to India and if not, we will start exporting a lot more from quarter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-enough-orders-may-cut-covishield-output-by-50-sii/articleshow/88153327.cms||---

While the US has been warning of economic consequences if Russia invades its neighbour Ukraine, the latter has demanded for legally binding security guarantees, ruling out any eastward expansion of Nato. Russia's two key demands During the talks, Russian President Putin presented Biden with a demand for legally binding security guarantees that would rule out the expansion of NATO, the Kremlin said. Putin said Nato was bolstering its military potential near Russia's borders and "making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory", the Kremlin said in a statement.

---||India||Supreme Court upholds bail for Sudha Bharadwaj, junks NIA plea||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Bombay high court’s order granting default bail to lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case and dismissed the plea of the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which had challenged the high court verdict. A bench of Justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi did not find any error in the HC verdict and remarked that there was no need to interfere. Sudha was granted default bail under Sec 167(2) of CrPCI t said the only issue involved in the case was whether the court which had allowed the application for extension of her detention in November 2018 was competent or not. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the NIA, tried to convince that the court, which had extended Bharadwaj’s detention was competent but the SC bench was not satisfied and said there is a provision of designated court under various laws, including TADA, POTA, NDPS etc. It said only special courts, which are aware of the intricacies of such laws, could take cognisance in such cases. The bench further said that when there was a special designated court available to deal with such cases and other courts would not have jurisdiction to pass order in cases involving scheduled offences under the Act. The bench was so convinced with the correctness of the high court verdict that it dismissed the NIA’s plea without even hearing the contention of Bharadwaj who had already filed a caveat in the SC to ensure that the court does not pass any order without hearing her. Her counsel, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, was present when the ASG was trying to convince the court that the high courtorder was wrong but he did not get an opportunity to argue or counter the contention of the NIA as the bench dismissed the plea after the ASG concluded his arguments for the NIA. The social activist was granted default bail under Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code on December 1 on the grounds that the additional sessions court, Pune, — which had extended the time for investigation in the case beyond 90 days — was not competent to do so as his court had not been designated a special court under Section 22 of the NIA Act. The high court had said that when a special court designated under the NIA Act, 2008, existed in Pune, the sessions judge had no jurisdiction to extend the detention beyond the stipulated 90 days. It directed that Bharadwaj be produced before the special NIA court on December 8 to decide on the conditions of her bail and the date of her release. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the city’s outskirts. The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The probe in the case was later transferred to the NIA in January 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-upholds-bail-for-sudha-bharadwaj-junks-nia-plea/articleshow/88153381.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||World||Socialist Kshama Sawant faces recall vote in Seattle||SEATTLE: A controversial member of the Seattle City Council - firebrand socialist Kshama Sawant - faces a recall election Tuesday, one month after voters chose moderate candidates over progressives in the general election. The recall is seen as a further test of whether the left wing is in retreat in one of the most liberal US cities. Business-friendly candidates won a council seat and the mayor's office in November. Sawant, 48, an Indian immigrant and an economics professor, is the longest-tenured council member. She has had an outsized influence on the tone and direction of Seattle politics since she launched her political career under the banner of the Socialist Alternative party in 2012, when she ran unsuccessfully for state representative. Sawant was elected to the city council the following year, and her threat to run a voter initiative drive for an immediate $15 minimum wage has been credited with pressuring business leaders and then-mayor Ed Murray to reach a deal raising the wage to $15 over a few years. Seattle was the first major city in the United States to adopt such a measure. But critics have said she offers more rhetoric than substance and that her brash antics are incompatible with good governance. Henry Bridger II is leading the effort to recall Sawant. "She literally blasts people who don't agree with her," Bridger said. "If you're not in lockstep with her ideology, you become the enemy. You're called a right-wing Republican. You're called a racist. You're bullied and pushed around." At stake is how the city approaches homelessness, police reform, taxation and other pressing issues. Sawant has been pushing for rent control, cutting police funding and expanding taxes on high earners such as Amazon to pay for affordable housing, schools and community services. But Seattle and other cities are banned by state law from adopting rent control. And last month, a federal appeals court ruled that two Seattle police officers could sue Sawant for defamation after she claimed a fatal shooting they were involved in was "a blatant murder". The recall question on the ballot cites a minor campaign finance violation that Sawant acknowledged, and for which she paid a fine, and her alleged leadership of a protest march to the home of mayor Jenny Durkan, even though Durkan's address was protected by a state confidentiality law due to her prior work as a federal prosecutor. The recall question also cites her decision to let a crowd of protesters into City Hall while it was closed due to the pandemic. Bridger insisted that his motivation for bringing the recall campaign was to hold Sawant accountable and that it has nothing to do with her politics. But to Sawant's supporters, the charges are a pretext for an effort by big business, developers and commercial real-estate interests to accomplish what they failed to do in 2019 - when a late, million-dollar push by Amazon to defeat her and other progressive candidates backfired. Sawant was reelected by about 4 percentage points. Sawant denies having led the march to Durkan's house, though she did participate in it. She has defended her decision to let Black Lives Matter demonstrators inside City Hall following George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police. She said the protesters were only there for an hour and that it was important for them to be seen in the halls of power. Bryan Koulouris, spokesman for the Kshama Solidarity Campaign, called the attempt to recall Sawant part of a national backlash against the Black Lives Matter movement. "From the nature of the charges and from when this election is happening, it begins to scratch the surface of why this is a right-wing recall," Koulouris said. The two groups supporting the recall - Recall Sawant and A Better Seattle - have raised close to $1 million combined, as has Kshama Solidarity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/socialist-kshama-sawant-faces-recall-vote-in-seattle/articleshow/88153468.cms||---

The exercise saw the task force, which included infantry soldiers, special forces and marine commandos, being airdropped in a snow-clad region at an altitude of over 9,000 feet. “The exercise included transport and armed helicopters of the Army and IAF, including the latest Apache attack-choppers. Different aspects of electronic warfare were also validated in the exercise,” an officer said. “The exercise showcased the capability of the Srinagar based 15 ‘Chinar’ Corps and other Army units to carry out successful operations in high altitude areas,” he added. Last month, in a signal to China to desist from any misadventure, the Army and IAF had also conducted a major “airborne insertion and combat” exercise along the frontier in eastern Ladakh. The three-day exercise had witnessed hundreds of pre-acclimatised troops and heavy weapon systems being air-dropped at an altitude of over 14,000-feet amidst minus 20o Celsius temperatures. India and China are slated to conduct the 14th round of corps commander-level talks this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/armys-jk-drill-to-get-behind-enemy-lines/articleshow/88153469.cms||---

However, she added that she would not contest polls individually unless Article 370 and Article 35A are restored and J&K returns to its pre-August 5, 2019 status. Participating in a media interaction organised by the Indian Women’s Press Corps (IWPC) here, Mehbooba said even as constituents of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) remain united in their demand for restoration of Article 370, the latest political outreach by Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in Jammu could divide the opposition votes in J&K and benefit BJP. The PDP chief also dismissed the ongoing delimitation exercise in J&K as part of BJP’s larger agenda. “They want to carve out constituencies to suit their political interests. The very fact that they singled J&K out for delimitation reveals there is an agenda at work. Otherwise why could they not have waited till 2026 to undertake the exercise?” she asked. PDP has so far refused to be part of the delimitation commission’s meetings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pdp-will-contest-polls-but-i-wont-till-art-370-is-restored-mehbooba-mufti/articleshow/88153534.cms||---
---||World||US Congress includes $300 million for Ukraine, addresses China in massive defense bill||WASHINGTON: United States lawmakers included efforts to push back against Russia and China in a massive annual defense bill released on Tuesday, proposing $300 million for Ukraine's military and a statement of support for the defense of Taiwan.  But they omitted a few measures that had had strong support from some members of Congress, including a proposal to impose mandatory sanctions over the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and a proposal to subject women to the military draft.  The fiscal 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorizes $770 billion in military spending, including a 2.7% pay increase for the troops, and authorization for a range of defense programs as well as strategies for dealing with geopolitical threats.  The NDAA normally passes with strong bipartisan support. It is closely watched by a broad swath of industry and other interests because of its wide scope and because it is one of the only major pieces of legislation that becomes law every year.  This year's bill was released shortly after US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin held two hours of virtual talks on Ukraine and other disputes.  The 2022 NDAA includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provides support to Ukraine's armed forces, includes $4 billion for the European Defense Initiative and proposes $150 million for Baltic security cooperation.  It does not include a provision that would force Biden to impose sanctions over the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline to bring Russian gas directly to Germany. The measure's supporters argue that the pipeline would be harmful to European allies.  Lawmakers also omitted an amendment that would have banned Americans from purchasing Russian sovereign debt.  Biden's fellow Democrats control both the House of Representatives and Senate, and the White House had said administration officials support sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine, but not provisions that could threaten trans-Atlantic ties. On China On China, the bill includes $7.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defense of Taiwan, as well as a ban on the Department of Defense procuring products produced with forced labour from China's Xinjiang region.  The United States has labelled China's treatment of its Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang as genocide, and lawmakers have been pushing a ban on imports of products that may have been made with forced labour from Uyghurs. China dismisses the genocide charge as part of slanderous assertions about conditions in Xinjiang.  The compromise text omits a proposal to subject women to the military draft that was included in earlier versions. The proposal faced stiff opposition from socially conservative lawmakers that threatened to block the entire NDAA.  The compromise bill includes a significant overhaul of the military justice system to take decisions on whether to prosecute cases of rape, sexual assault and some other major crimes out of the hands of military commanders.  The change is the result of a years-long push, led by Democratic senator Kirsten Gillibrand, in response to the thousands of cases of sexual assault and related crimes among service members every year, many of which are never prosecuted.  To become law for the 61st straight year, the NDAA must pass the House and Senate and be signed into law by Biden.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-congress-includes-300-million-for-ukraine-addresses-china-in-massive-defense-bill/articleshow/88153591.cms||---
---||India||2k serious cases of AEFI, 0.004% of 123 crore of shots given: Government||NEW DELHI: Adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) were recorded after 0.004% of the total around 123 crore Covid jabs administered till November 30. Of the 49,819 reported adverse events, 47,691 were minor, 163 severe and 1,965 were serious cases, the government told the Parliament on Tuesday. AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that follows innoculation and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the Covid-19 vaccine. They are reported through the AEFI surveillance system. An AEFI is considered serious if it results in death, requires hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or a cluster (two or more cases) of AEFIs in a geographical area. Investigations and causality assessment help in establishing a cause and effect relationship, junior health minister Bharati Pravin Pawar said. “Total deaths and hospitalisations following use of all three Covid-19 vaccines were 946 (0.00008%) and 1,019 (0.00008%) respectively. The causality assessment of 89 deaths have been completed,” the minister said her reply to a query raised in the Rajya Sabha. “The number of deaths classified under different causality assessment categories is — vaccine product-related 4, coincidental 58, indeterminate 16 and unclassifiable 11,” she further stated. In response to a separate question on whether the government has ascertained the efficacy of Covishield and Covaxin, the minister said Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, is technology transfer of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The efficacy studies for Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine were conducted overseas by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. Serum Institute of India has conducted Phase II/III immune-bridging clinical trials in the country, she said. “The overall interim efficacy of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine at the time of approval of Covishield has been reported to be 63%. Bharat Biotech International has conducted Phase III efficacy trial of Covaxin in the country wherein the efficacy of the vaccine has been reported as 77.8%,” she informed the House. Covaxin was granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on November 3, 2021. The WHO EUL is sufficient for travelling to a large number of countries. However, some countries issue specific notifications for the inclusion of vaccines for travel purposes, Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2k-serious-cases-of-aefi-0-004-of-123-crore-of-shots-given-government/articleshow/88153594.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay high court notice to Nawab Malik on ‘wilful breach’ of his undertaking||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed state minister Nawab Malik to file an affidavit, explaining why action not be taken against him for wilful breach of his undertaking not to post or make statements against Dnyandev Wankhede and his son — Narcotics Control Bureau officer Sameer Wankhede — and their family. “We are prima facie satisfied that undertaking given by him …has been wilfully breached,” said a bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav after hearing a plea by senior counsel Birendra Saraf representing Dnyandev Wankhede. Saraf said Malik had flouted his own promise to the court and had on December 3 given interviews making unwarranted statements against the Wankhede family. Saraf said, “Is this some kind of joke?” He furnished three print-outs of interviews given by Malik and a post on his social media page on December 3 where he was again reiterating comments about Wankhede’s trip abroad or talking about his actions. The high court said a consent order was passed on November 29 after the respondent —Nawab Malik —agreed through his advocate not to make any posts, comments or give interviews against the Wankhedes. A statement made by him was accepted as an undertaking by the HC, the bench noted. Court says Malik appears to have overreached our orderDnyandev Wankhede's lawyer Birendra Saraf presented in the Bombay high court a print-out of a post by Nawab Malik on social media reiterating his comments about Wankhede's trip abroad or talking about his actions. The HC noted that a consent order was passed on November 29 after Malik agreed not to put any posts, comments or give interviews against the Wankhedes. A statement by him was accepted as an undertaking, the bench noted. Malik has targeted the NCB and its zonal officer Wankhede since a series of high profile raids and arrests where the agency's action was alleged to be excessive. Malik's assurance first on November 25 to the court and reiterated on November 29 as set out in the order has wilfully been breached, said Wankhede's counsel. "Our attention is drawn to interviews given by Malik," said the HC. A query was raised by the court as to whether his statements are in a personal capacity or as a minister. "After taking instructions, we are informed that he has made it as spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party," it said. During the hearing when the HC raised the query, Malik's counsel Karl Tamboly initially said he had no instructions. "Who is instructing you. Last time it was his daughter-in-law. Who is there now?" Justice Kathawalla asked. Tamboly said it was the advocate on record (AOR). The judge persisted: "who is instructing the AOR? This is no answer that you have no instructions. Then we will summon him here." Tamboly said, "Okay, we'll bring him here." Later Tamboly said, "We have instructions he spoke in his capacity as party spokesperson." The bench asked, "which party?" The court by then had perused through the Marathi printouts and said, "He (Malik) appears to have overreached our order." But the HC added, "Before we take any action, we direct him to file an affidavit by Friday to state why no action be taken against him for wilful breach of his undertaking." The next hearing is on December 10. On Nov 29, Malik and Dnyandev Wankhede agreed to a truce that the NCP spokesperson would stop making statements against Wankhede, his son NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede and his family till a single judge decides an interim plea against the allegedly defamatory posts. Wankhede Sr, a retired cop, had appealed against Justice Madhav Jamdar's Nov 22 order which observed that Malik's tweets were "actuated by malice'' and posted without reasonable verification, but did not restrain Malik as sought. The judge said rights of both sides must be balanced and directed Malik to tweet only after reasonable verification. Wankhede filed an appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/high-court-notice-to-malik-on-wilful-breach-of-his-undertaking/articleshow/88153648.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||India||BRO to collect toll from civilian traffic on 4 key Ladakh routes||NEW DELHI: For the first time, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) plans to collect toll from civilian traffic plying on the roads it builds, especially in the Himalayan states bordering China and Pakistan. The agency — under the defence ministry — plans to start with four routes covering a distance of 941 kms in Ladakh, including the Leh-Srinagar highway, and Leh’s link to Chalunka in the Nubra valley that is flanked by Chorbat area of Pakistan in the west and Siachen in the north. In a letter to Ladakh transport secretary Saugat Biswas on Monday, the agency sought the administration’s clearance to set up six toll “plazas” on the identified routes with the aim of generating revenue. The move has been opposed by Kargil hill council chief Feroz Khan and social activist Sajjad Kargili, who have sought consultations before allowing toll collection. The identified Ladakh roads are a lifeline for the locals but also get high volume of traffic from outside, bringing tourists and supplies during the June-September period when the passes open up. Traffic becomes mostly local and scant during the winter. The BRO’s roads serve the twin purpose of improving access for the forces and their war machines and boosting economic development in far-flung areas. The BRO proposes to collect toll at three spots on the Srinagar Leh highway passing through Zoji La, where a tunnel is under construction. These are Minamarg, 10 km from Zoji La towards Kargil; Mulbekh, 39km from Kargil towards Leh; and near the confluence of Indus and Zanskar rivers, some 35 km before Leh. Toll is proposed to be collected at Padum on the road via Shinku La connecting Darcha in Himachal Pradesh with the SrinagarLeh highway near Nimmu, even though it is in a rudimentary stage with several river crossings suitable for off-road vehicles. It is touted as an alternative to the Manali Leh road. The road to Chalunka across the Khardung La is Leh’s only link to the northern areas of Nubra valley.

"It's hard to expect any sudden breakthroughs, but the presidents demonstrated their willingness to continue practical work and begin discussing sensitive issues that seriously concern Moscow," Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said after the two-hour talks. Beyond the agreement to hold further discussions, there was no sign of any narrowing of positions in Moscow's readout of the conversation, which followed weeks of tension over the massing of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. A Kremlin statement said Putin repeated Moscow's accusation that Ukraine was behaving provocatively and taking a "destructive line" aimed at dismantling agreements from 2014 and 2015 designed to end a war with Russian-backed separatists. It said Biden spelt out the possibility of Western sanctions against Russia if the situation escalated and accused Moscow of threatening behaviour. Putin responded that "it is actually Nato that is making dangerous attempts to conquer Ukrainian territory and is building up its military potential at our borders." "Therefore, Russia is seriously interested in obtaining reliable, legally fixed guarantees that rule out Nato expansion eastward and the deployment of offensive strike weapons systems in states adjacent to Russia," the Kremlin said. It said the two leaders agreed to instruct their representatives to engage in "substantive consultations on these sensitive issues". Russian authorities have said that Nato's growing ties with Ukraine and the possibility of the alliance deploying missiles targeted against Russia there represent a "red line" it will not allow to be crossed. Putin also told his US counterpart he wanted guarantees that offensive strike systems would not be deployed in countries close to Russia, the Kremlin said. The talks were held as the West voiced concerns that Russia will invade Ukraine and warned of "strong economic and other measures" as punishment should Moscow start a military conflict. The Kremlin, which said before Tuesday's meeting that it did not expect any breakthroughs, has denied harbouring any intention to attack Ukraine and said that its troop posture is defensive. "Two hours suggests to me they had a substantive conversation. But they're a long way from agreeing anything. But since these aren't easy issues, it's not a bad sign -- as long as everyone keeps talking," said Olga Oliker, program director for Europe and Central Asia at International Crisis Group. The Kremlin said bilateral ties with Washington were in an "unsatisfactory state". It said Putin proposed removing limits on the functioning of their respective embassies following a tit-for-tat row in which each country has reduced the number of diplomats that the other can post. Putin and Biden underlined the need to strive to normalise relations and continue cooperating on issues of mutual interest such as cyber security, Ushakov said. He said they had not discussed a proposal to meet in person on neutral territory despite having previously mooted the idea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/kremlin-says-putin-and-biden-to-keep-engaging-despite-no-breakthrough-in-talks/articleshow/88153747.cms||---

The test would be made available within two weeks at the airports in India and other places. The companies have been asked to scale up production amid Omicron concerns. The molecular-based technology used in this rapid test kit neither requires expensive machines like RTPCT, high-speed centrifuges nor a skilled workforce to conduct the test. "The test, RT-LAMP, has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. It takes only 30-40 minutes to churn out the result, which can be visually interpreted. Also, the test can be very easily deployed at the airports, docks, railway stations and other entry points for the screening of patients for Covid as it doesn't require sophisticated machinery and skilled workforce," said an ICMR official. The RT-LAMP kit is validated by the National Institute of Biologicals, Noida. "It will be cheaper than rapid RTPCR," an ICMR official said. As against the current rapid PCR test which costs Rs 3,900 and takes an hour, the ICMR-NIV-developed test kit is likely to be costing not more than Rs 3,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/icmrs-new-rapid-tests-set-to-be-cheaper-give-results-in-30-mins/articleshow/88153722.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||India||Normalcy by June if Omicron stays less virulent, says expert||MUMBAI: Life could get back to normal by June 2022 if Covid's latest avatar, Omicron, turns out to be less virulent than other variants like Delta, which caused the mega second wave in India this year. This positive outlook comes from state government's technical adviser Subhash Salunkhe whose calculations are based on the news about Omicron coming out of South Africa over the past two weeks. "One need not be too worried at the moment because Omicron seems to be mild. It is more transmissible, but it is not causing a severe disease," said Salunkhe, who was previously the state director general of health and an adviser to the WHO. "In the coming months, one may actually be happy that Omicron emerged. Instead of putting restrictions in place, governments should insist on people following Covid-appropriate behaviour to guard against Omicron," he told TOI. The logic, as per epidemiology, is that viruses lose their virulence over time and settle for a "symbiotic relationship" with their living hosts. Experts like Salunkhe say Omicron could be the symbiotic variant: If community transmission of Omicron begins, it would over the next few months replace the highly virulent Delta. "People may get infected or reinfected, but that would act as a natural vaccine," he said, adding Covid could be downgraded from pandemic to endemic in the next five to six months, as a result. In early March when the number of Covid cases and deaths suddenly shot up, Salunkhe travelled across Vidharbha and told the state government that a mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 was the cause. This was confirmed later when scientists identified Delta. He has a caveat: The final word on Omicron's virulence or lack of it is still not out. "We have to wait for it for the next couple of weeks when experts make an assessment," he said. Meanwhile, state surveillance officer Pradeep Awate told TOI on Tuesday that there are no new Omicron-positive cases in Maharashtra. "The Omicron tally remains 10," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/normalcy-by-june-if-omicron-stays-less-virulent-says-expert/articleshow/88153745.cms||Malathy Iyer

However, health experts assure that there is nothing to be scared about the new lineages for now. Omicron, with about 50 mutations, was officially recorded in South Africa on November 8 and since then has spread to 34 countries, including India. Experts point out that the split in the Omicron lineage is more of interest to scientists as it will help in better epidemiological surveillance and there is nothing for the common man to be worried about. Incidentally, the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), had first split into two lineages and then into three, including the Delta plus. It later split into numerous lineages numbering around 100. Luckily, this split had not caused any significant harm to people. Read AlsoICMR's new rapid tests set to be cheaper, give results in 30 minsA soon-to-be-introduced and visually interpreted rapid Covid test - developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology and transferred to Chennai and Delhi-based companies for production - could cut down the cost and the turnaround time by almost 40%, ICMR-NIVReferring to the split in Omicron variant, Vinod Scaria, senior scientist at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, tweeted on Tuesday: "The B.1.1.529 (Omicron) lineage is now split to BA.1 and BA.2 . BA.1 will now have the original lineage and BA.2 will encompass the new outlier with around 24 mutations". The two Omicron lineages were classified based on the mutations. Some of the mutations are common for both variants. But some are unique to both lineages. Interestingly, while one lineage (BA.1) gives S-Gene Target Failure or SGTF, which helps in identifying the Omicron variant through the existing RT-PCR test, the other (BA.2) does not give SGTF. As per Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGOLIN), which has been assigning nomenclature to the novel coronavirus variants under PANGO lineage system, it has proposed to expand the breadth of the Omicron lineage to include all its variants. "The names BA.1 and BA.2 follows the PANGO convention to avoid more than three numerical fields," it posted on its website.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-has-split-into-2-lineages-but-experts-allay-fears/articleshow/88153753.cms||Syed Akbar

---||World||Mixing Pfizer, AZ jabs with other vax gives robust immunity: Lancet study||LONDON:Following up first doses of the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines with second doses of the Moderna or Novavax jabs generates robust immune response against Covid-19, according to a study published in The Lancet journal. A team led by researchers at the University of Oxford in the UK found that no safety concerns were raised in the study of 1,070 participants. The study supports flexible use of these vaccines in primary immunisation schedules, which is crucial to help rapidly deploy these vaccines, especially in low- and middleincome countries where vaccine supply may be inconsistent. “Thanks to studies such as these, we are now getting a more complete picture of how different vaccines can be used together in the same vaccine schedule,” said Matthew Snape at the University of Oxford. “Encouragingly, all these schedules generated antibody concentrations above that of the licensed and effective two dose Oxford-AZ schedule,” said Snape. When it comes to cellular immunity, the researchers said, having a first dose of the AZ shot followed by any of the other study vaccines generates a particularly robust response. In addition, a significantly higher number of short-lived vaccine reactions were reported in volunteers who got a second dose of Moderna compared to those who got two doses of AZ or Pfizer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/mixing-pfizer-az-jabs-with-other-vax-gives-robust-immunity-lancet-study/articleshow/88153863.cms||---

A bench of M R Shah and B V Nagarathna held that the pre-deposit condition has no link with the grant of stay by the National Commission which can direct the party to deposit any amount higher than 50% or the entire amount of as a condition to stay the operation of the state commission order. The court passed the order on a plea by a batch of real estate companies challenging the orders of the National Commission directing them to deposit the entire amount which they were directed to refund to aggrieved homebuyers before staying the orders. They contended that as per Section 51 of the Consumer Protection Act, the parties cannot be directed to deposit more than 50% of the decretal amount before the National Commission. “It is the pre-condition to deposit 50% of the amount as ordered by the state commission before the appeal is entertained by the National Commission. Therefore, it is a condition precedent to deposit 50% of the amount before his appeal is entertained by the National Commission. However, that does not take away the jurisdiction of the National Commission to order to deposit the entire amount and or any amount higher than 50% of the amount while considering the application to stay the order passed by the state commission,” the bench said. “Pre-deposit of 50% of amount as ordered by the state commission under second proviso to Section 51 ofthe Consumer Protection Act...,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-sets-pre-deposit-rule-to-file-plea-in-national-consumer-panel/articleshow/88153877.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||Have achieved target of abolition of manual scavenging: Govt||NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday informed Parliament in response to a written question in Lok Sabha that it has been “able to achieve the target of abolition of manual scavenging” as per the prescribed definition under the law. As per the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act, 2013)” manual scavenging means manually cleaning, carrying, disposing of, or handling in any manner, human excreta in an insanitary latrine. It is prohibited with effect from December 2013. In response to another question the ministry of social justice and empowerment states that “no deaths have been reported due to engaging in Manual Scavenging (which is lifting of human excreta from insanitary latrines). However, 321 persons have died due to accidents while undertaking hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks during the last five years.” The minister for social justice and empowerment Virendra Kumar said that surveys conducted for identification of manual scavengers have reported their numbers to be at 58,098. “All identified and eligible manual scavengers have been provided assistance for their rehabilitation,” Kumar said. A mobile app was launched last year to identify existing insanitary latrines. “After field verification of the data uploaded on the app, no existence of insanitary latrine has been verified. Therefore, there is no report of practice of manual scavenging currently in the country,” the ministry said. Fatal accidents in sewers and septic tanks are due to non compliance of the prescribed safety measures and standard operating procedure (SOP). A national policy on mechanised sanitation ecosystem has been formulated and circulated to the states for implementation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-achieved-target-of-abolition-of-manual-scavenging-govt/articleshow/88153907.cms||---

The doctor, who has no symptoms and is currently in isolation at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, will undergo a repeat test after 2-3 days. As per protocols for the new variant, a patient must obtain two consecutive negative reports within 24 hours to be discharged from hospital. According to the hospital, traces of the viral RNA may have been found during the RT-PCR tests. My viral load was high initially: DocThe Omicron-infected doctor told TOI: "My viral load was very high in the initial days. That may be the reason why traces of the viral RNA may have been found. I've no symptoms, but a bit of stress continues till I return home." Dr Manoj Kumar HV, dean and director of Sri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical College and Research Institute that runs Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, confirmed that the doctor has continued to test positive for Covid-19. Sources said some patients turn out positive even 40-60 days after getting infected. The Bengaluru doctor, who tested positive on November 22, was admitted to a private hospital from November 25 to 29 after he complained of body ache and giddiness. There, he received monoclonal antibody treatment. After his genomic sequencing report detected the Omicron variant, he was admitted to Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital on December 2 along with primary and secondary contacts who had tested positive for Covid. The infected doctor's wife, who is in isolation after testing positive, has completed 12 days of treatment. The couple's children, who are negative in RT-PCR tests, are in isolation. Bowring hospital's isolation wards have 10 patients, including the Omicron-infected doctor. Of them, six are his contacts. The remaining three are Covid-positive staffers from a Bommasandra factory and secondary contacts of India's first Omicron-infected person, who fled the quarantine and returned to South Africa. The trio have shown no symptoms and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing. Reports awaitedAmong the Omicron-infected doctor's contacts, three doctors have tested negative on December 6 and their repeat RT-PCR tests are yet to be done. Their genomic sequencing reports are awaited. BBMP chief health officer Dr Balasundar said these three doctors have sought discharge from the hospital. Dr Manoj Kumar said a decision will be made based on the BBMP commissioner's opinion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/omicron-infected-doc-still-covid-ve-repeat-test-soon/articleshow/88153968.cms||Sunitha Rao R

With surging IT demand globally, IT firms have made robust net additions of people. TeamLease said every job created in the technology sector has a multiplier effect. The industry is estimated to have created about 3.2 million indirect jobs.Top Indian IT services companies added 72,000 employees in fiscal 2021, up 44% from about 50,000 in the year before. Sunil Chemmankotil, head of specialised staffing at TeamLease Digital, said India’s IT/BPM talent is on track to double from 5 million to 10 million over the next few years riding on the back of an upward growth trajectory, healthy deal pipeline, and tech as a differentiator for companies to scale up significantly. “About 42% of this will come from IT services and 25% from GCCs (global capability centres). India has 1,260 GCCs and this is expected to cross 2,000 over the next 2-3 years,” he said.Chemmankotil said that the heightened demand environment has unlocked opportunities for contract staff to work alongside permanent employees in a big way. India’s tech sector contractual workforce is expected to grow from 126,461 to 148,211 in 2021-22, a 17% growth over last year. “Only 3% of the 4.8 million employed in the IT sector are contract staff compared to 18% in the US. The 3% is expected to grow to 6% over the next few years. With the last two quarter results, talent mobility from full-time employment to contractual employment has increased, showing more acceptability among employees and companies in a more evolved talent landscape,” he said.IT contract staffing stood at 21,850 in the September quarter, compared to 20,500 in the preceding quarter. TeamLease expects this number to go up to 24,400 in the December quarter. Attrition in contract staffing is expected to increase sharply to 49% in 2021-22, from 40% in the previous year. Teamlease Digital says the top 13 digital skills include full-stack developer, cloud and devops experts, and cyber security professionals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/it-employee-strength-to-rise-to-4-8mn-this-year/articleshow/88154021.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||Bengaluru||As candidates splurge on Karnataka MLC polls, clamour for cap on expenses grows||BENGALURU: The demand for capping candidates’ expenditure and other electoral reforms is growing stronger amid reports about moneybags bribing voters in elections to the legislative council from local bodies. Unlike polls to elect members for the legislative assembly and Lok Sabha, there is no limit to the expenditure of a candidate contesting MLC polls where elected members to local rural and urban bodies are the voters. Candidates are reportedly splurging on campaigns amid tough competition for the December 10 polls. There are reports of candidates offering between Rs 35,000 and Rs 1 lakh per voter and a range of gifts. “A cap is not fixed on expenditure of candidates in MLC polls since it’s assumed that candidates are not required to spend money as voters are elected members. It is unfortunate that elections to the upper house has assumed the proportions of general elections in terms of corruption and electoral reforms are urgently needed,” said Madabushi Sridhar Acharyalu, professor of law and former information commissioner of India. He said while it takes fresh legislation by the Parliament to fix the ceiling on election expenditure in MLC polls, the Election Commission of India should modify its model code of conduct mandating candidates to file details of expenditure at the end of elections. Officials from the Chief Electoral Officer, Karnataka, said they have launched an extensive enforcement drive to curb electoral malpractices. Flying squads have seized 2,534 litres of liquor worth Rs 9.5 lakh so far and FIRs have been registered in 238 cases. Interestingly, there are no reports on seizure of cash while functionaries of political parties have admitted they are forced to distribute money. Many civil society organisations and stakeholders are demanding the Centre amend the Representation of People Act (RPA) to bring in electoral reforms. “It is worrisome that elected representatives are taking bribes to vote for their representatives. The cap on election expenditure may not put an end to corruption, but it may act as a deterrent at least,” said Trilochan Sastry, chairman, Association for Democratic Reforms. BS Shvanna, chairman, Ram Manohar Lohia Thinkers Forum, said his organisation will write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking amendments to the RPA. “We’re seeking reservation in MLC polls for women and the downtrodden,” he said “The gram panchayat members are officially not affiliated to parties since polls are not fought on party lines. This has given way to corruption in MLC polls. Polls for the GP should be made political as it was in the previous avatar of mandal panchayats,’ said BL Shankar, former chairman of the legislative council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/as-candidates-splurge-on-mlc-polls-clamour-for-cap-on-expenses-grows/articleshow/88154027.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka MLC polls: Alliance with BJP will be decided at local level, says HD Kumaraswamy||BENGALURU: The BJP and JD(S) struggled for about a week to firm up an alliance for the upcoming legislative council polls, but in vain. On Tuesday, JD(S) leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy ruled out joining hands with the BJP and said the alliance will be decided at the local level in segments where the party isn’t contesting. The party is contesting in only six of the 25 seats going to polls. “The party has officially decided not to go into an alliance with the BJP or Congress in seats where it is contesting. However, we have asked the local leadership to take a decision on who to support in places where the JD(S) isn’t in the picture. This decision has to be taken keeping in mind the party’s prospects in the 2023 general elections, where JD(S) has set a target of 123 seats,” said Kumaraswamy. The two-time former CM said senior leader BS Yediyurappa personally called him and sought his party’s support in places where it wasn’t contesting. “While the Congress has dismissed any support from the JD(S), the BJP too has not sought our alliance officially. It was only Yediyurappa who made a courteous appeal to me to back BJP candidates where we are not contesting. We are courteously telling Yediyurappa that the JD(S) will not support the BJP in the MLC elections,” said Kumaraswamy. He, however, said that in 19 MLC segments the party has left it to the local leadership to support whoever they wish to keeping in mind the need to build a base ahead of 2023 assembly elections. “For example, in Sindhanur, our candidate had sought permission to back the Congress candidate. While in some places the party will back the BJP candidate, in others it will back the Congress candidate. Both BJP and Congress are our political enemies, but local issues are separate from state issues,” he said. Earlier, Yediyurappa was looking to bolster his party’s fortunes in places where BJP was in a direct fight with the Congress. “While there are no talks of an alliance, I am hoping that the JD(S) will support us in places where it is not contesting,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/alliance-with-bjp-will-be-decided-at-local-level-hdk/articleshow/88154028.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Unified transport authority bill may be tabled during winter session||BENGALURU: The long-pending BMLTA (Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority) bill, which envisages an umbrella organisation for Bengaluru on the lines of Transport for London (TFL), is likely to be placed in the legislative assembly during the winter session in Belagavi, scheduled to begin on December 13. Additional chief secretary (urban development department) Rakesh Singh told TOI: “The bill is most likely to be tabled during the upcoming session. One more stakeholders’ meeting with various government departments is pending. But we will complete it soon.” In September, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) prepared a draft BMLTA bill, which is available on its website. BMLTA will be a unified transport body that will integrate multiple government agencies and come up with initiatives such as the common mobility card and multi-modal transport hubs. The National Urban Transport Policy recommends the formation of a unified metropolitan transport authority. Though a BMLTA committee was constituted in 2007, it didn’t have any statutory powers. However, the BMLTA bill aims to constitute the authority with statutory backup to regulate and coordinate urban mobility initiatives in the Bengaluru metropolitan area. At present, agencies such as the transport department, Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority, BDA, BMTC, BMRCL, BBMP, and traffic police are responsible for planning, developing, implementing, and managing the city. Given that multiple institutions and departments are at work, overlap of responsibilities and functions is impeding planning and implementation. According to the draft bill, BMLTA will have 21 members, with the chief minister as chairperson and the ministers of Bengaluru development and transport as vice-chairpersons. Other members include the BBMP mayor and representatives of departments such as urban development, transport, finance, public works, women and child development, police, BBMP, BDA, BMRDA, BMRCL, Directorate of Town and Country Planning, pollution control board, and Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises. The DULT commissioner will be CEO. There will be two special invitees from South Western Railway and National Highways Authority of India. It will also have 10 non-official members — three experts on urban mobility, corporate governance and finance, two from civil society organisations, three from institutions representing the private sector and professional bodies, and two from academic institutions. The proposed BMLTA will prepare a comprehensive mobility plan and traffic management plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/unified-transport-authority-bill-may-be-tabled-during-winter-session/articleshow/88154029.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka MLC polls: A final attempt to woo voters||BENGALURU: With just two days left for the legislative council elections, all three major political parties have intensified campaigning in the state. While BJP and Congress are contesting for 20 seats, JD(S) is in the mix for only six seats. On Tuesday, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai campaigned in Belagavi district to drum up support for BJP candidate Mahantesh Kavatagimath. His predecessor BS Yediyurappa embarked on a second round of campaigning in Shivamogga and Davanagere districts. “We will win at least 15 seats. I’m not saying this to please anyone. This is based on ground reality,” Yediyurappa said while calling on members of rural local bodies to support the party. Opposition leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC chief DK Shivakumar campaigned for party candidates in Mandya and Bengaluru Rural constituencies. “People are fed up with the anti-people policies of the BJP and this election will reflect that sentiment with BJP suffering defeat,” Siddaramaiah said. Though the outcome of these elections will have no immediate political impact, winning more seats will boost the confidence of the parties ahead of the assembly elections, which are less than a year-and-half away. These elections are particularly significant for BJP as it is an opportunity for the ruling party to get a majority in the 75-member upper house, provided it wins 12-13 seats. The party won seven of these 25 seats in the last elections. To realise its goal, it is focusing on north and coastal Karnataka regions, which are its bastions. “We are hoping to win at least 8-10 seats from these two regions,” a party functionary said. BJP also made an unsuccessful effort to seek JD(S) support for seats where it is not in the fray. JD(S) leader Kumaraswamy refused to offer support as his wish to get an official request from the chief minister or state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel wasn’t met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/a-final-attempt-to-woo-voters/articleshow/88154030.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Villagers block road after biker rams boy||Bengaluru: Tension prevailed on Bengaluru-Gauribidanur Road on Tuesday morning after a biker rammed an eight-year-old boy at Makali village on the outskirts of the city. The incident took place around 10am, when Bharath was walking on the roadside. A biker coming from Gauribidanur was allegedly riding in a rash and negligent manner and hit Bharath. The biker, identified as Naveen, tried to escape but was chased and caught by the villagers and handed over to Doddaballapur rural police. Meanwhile, Bharath was rushed to a nearby hospital with severe injuries and is under treatment. Following the accident, angry villagers blocked the road and demanded speed-breakers near the village. They blamed the recent removal of the road humps for the accident. The blockade resulted in vehicles piling up for more than 2km on both directions. The villagers stopped protesting after local police assured them of speed-breakers near the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/villagers-block-road-after-biker-rams-boy/articleshow/88154031.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP officials to get tax collection targets||BENGALURU: With property tax collections not going up despite the city expanding rapidly, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to take the corporate route. It has started fixing collection targets for revenue officers on the lines of sales executives. Of the Rs 4,000 crore property tax target this year, only Rs 2,483 crore has been collected so far. At a meeting on Monday, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta instructed his revenue officials and assistant revenue officials to ensure that citizens paid their property taxes and also asked them to issue notices to those who have defaulted and collect it immediately. BBMP special commissioner (revenue) Deepak RL said, “Like any corporate set-up, setting targets and monitoring them closely definitely helps with efficiency. Assistant revenue officers are unit heads and they have been given targets from the head office this year. Targets were being given earlier too but from the zonal level and it wasn’t an efficient approach.” BBMP says it is aware there is time till March for citizens to pay property tax this year, but it’s actually trying to target defaulters who haven't paid for three to four years. “We are trying to ensure arrears are collected. We have started the legal process now because we don't want to leave it to the last minute in February. If we start now, we might be able to collect property tax from defaulters,” Deepak said. Many defaulters are malls, shopping complexes, commercial buildings and hotels, with only a minority being residential properties, he added. BBMP has an assistant revenue officer at the sub-division level and a tax inspector, a revenue inspector and tax accessor at the ward level. In wards where the potential to collect property tax is high, two or three more tax inspectors are posted. Drawing up a listGaurav Gupta said, “A defaulters’ list should be prepared and legal action taken and tax should be collected. All necessary steps must be taken to ensure that property tax is paid.” “If property owners have not done self-assessment, revenue officers should visit the place, fix the property tax, and it should be collected,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-officials-to-get-tax-collection-targets/articleshow/88154032.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC allows smartcard registration for new vehicles||BENGALURU: Non-transport and fully built transport vehicles, on first sale, will be registered as per the smartcard-based process — the system that existed prior to the issuance of a government notification dated October 31, 2021. The high court on Tuesday passed an interim order in this regard while admitting a petition filed by Rosmerta Technologies Ltd. Through the October 31 notification, the government had paved the way for vehicle registration by manufacturers and dealers. “Prima facie, the contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner appears to be correct and as such it requires consideration. Let the statement of objections be filed by the additional government advocate within three weeks,” a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi observed. The petitioner claimed that the government’s decision to do away with issuance of smartcard-based registration certificate and bring in electronic/online registration in its place was arbitrary and illegal. The company contended that it had signed an agreement with the government in 2009, valid till 2024, requiring it to issue smartcard-based registration certificates for new vehicles. Because of the recent notification, the registration certificate will be issued through electronic or online mode, meaning the petitioner will no longer be required to issue smartcard-based certificates. According to the company, the concession agreement with the state was on the basis of the ‘one nation, one card’ policy of the Centre. The company also argued that the draft notification on the rule change was issued on October 26 and in just five days, the notification was made official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-allows-smartcard-registration-for-new-vehicles/articleshow/88154033.cms||---

On December 5, the student’s father, a factory worker, filed a police complaint accusing his daughter and her boyfriend of theft. According to police sources, investigation revealed that the duo stole the money and gold to buy expensive items.

The theft was noticed on November 29. “Initially, we searched all over the house. Then we realised that someone from our family itself had stolen them. . Slowly, I realised it was none other than my daughter and her boyfriend who stole them,” the father said. After the parents questioned the girl repeatedly, she allegedly confessed. When they called the boyfriend, he went missing. “The girl claimed to have acted on her boyfriend’s direction. We traced the boy and detained him.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Brothers, SI get into brawl over right of way||BENGALURU: Motorists jostling for space is a typical scene on broken roads of Bengaluru. Usually, it ends with one of them giving way to the other on the asphalted stretch by driving on to the muddy track. But a similar situation at Chikkabettahalli on Vidyaranpura-Yelahanka road on Monday took a different turn — drivers of two cars glared at each other for a few minutes and hurled expletives before exchanging blows. While one of the cars was being driven by a police sub-inspector in plainclothes, the occupants of the other car were two brothers. A video of the brawl went viral on Tuesday. Police arrested both the brothers, A Manoj, 27, and A Dheeraj, 26, of Yelahanka New Town on charges of attacking sub-inspector Shreeshaila Koli. Manoj is a manager with a food delivery firm in the city. The face-off occurred around 11:30pm, when the brothers were on their way home and the SI was driving back to his residence in Jalahalli in his private car. Both cars stood in the middle of the road, thinking the other will give way. Koli first asked the brothers to move their vehicle. However, the brothers retorted saying Koli should drive back and make way. Koli got off his car, walked towards the brothers and told them who he was; he allegedly shouted at them for ‘blocking the road’. The SI warned the duo that they’d be booked for creating public nuisance, after which he snatched their car key. According to sources, Koli used filthy language, which provoked the brothers to storm out of their vehicle and attack the sub-inspector. Koli intimated his station and two night beat police constables from Yelahanka New Town reached the spot. But the situation turned all the more ugly as the constables tried to overpower the brothers but were eventually thrashed by them. By then, a Hoysala vehicle with more police staff reached the spot, while the brothers swiftly drove away. By Tuesday afternoon, cops arrested the brothers under different sections of Indian Penal Code, including 353 (obstructing government official from carrying out his duty), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with danger weapons or means) 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (act with criminal intimidation). Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) CK Baba said: “It is a case of road rage. The accused attacked our sub-inspector when he asked them to make way since vehicles were piling up in all directions.” However, another senior officer said Koli could have handled the situation more calmly. “We heard that Koli abused the brothers and that’s why they got provoked,” he said, adding: “Had Koli not acted hastily and snatched the car key, the incident would have ended on a much smaller note. If the brothers were blocking the road, disturbing others, Koli could have called a Hoysala first instead of snatching their vehicle key,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/brothers-si-get-into-brawl-over-right-of-way/articleshow/88154036.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Three on the run after transferring money from dead man’s account||BENGALURU: Police are on the lookout for three persons who allegedly transferred money from the bank account of a dead railway employee. The suspects are Nagamani, 40, of Gorur village in Hassan district, Prasanna Kumar TN, 55, of Tarahunase village near Yelahanka, and Santhosh Navali of Kundagola in Dharwad district. According to sources, KM Channakeshavaiah of Yelahanka died of Covid-19 on May 3. He had named his nephew Girish KV as the nominee for his bank account at the SBI Yelahanka branch. Girish told police that when he enquired with bank officials, they informed him that someone had transferred Rs 9,33,856 to various bank accounts between May 5 and 14 using UPI. He then contacted his aunt Vishwabharati, who confirmed that she hadn’t withdrawn or transferred anything from the account. Girish collected the details of the fraudulent transactions on November 11. On November 16, northeast CEN Crime police registered a case of cheating and cybercrime against the accused. Meanwhile, all three suspects approached the 58th additional city civil and sessions court seeking anticipatory bail. Judge GL Lakshminarayana denied their plea on December 4. Nagaveni contended that she had a relationship with Channakeshavaiah and had a dispute with Vishwabharati regarding the disbursement of his retirement benefits. She also claimed innocence in the alleged crime. Her co-accused, Kumar and Navali, did the same. However, the court dismissed their plea considering their non-cooperation with the investigation and their act of absconding. Police are still making efforts to trace the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/three-on-the-run-after-transferring-money-from-dead-mans-account/articleshow/88154037.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||Bengaluru||‘Hydrogen sulphide suppresses HIV infection’||Bengaluru: Researchers from IISc and their collaborators have found that hydrogen sulphide (H2S) plays a key role in suppressing HIV as increased H2S gas has a direct effect on reducing the rate at which the virus multiplies in HIV-infected human immune cells. The findings, researchers say, paves the way for developing a more comprehensive antiretroviral therapy against HIV. The team included researchers from the department of microbiology and cell biology (MCB) and the centre for infectious disease research (CIDR) at IISc and people from the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI). The results have been published in the journal eLife, IISc said in a statement. Pointing out that current state-of-the-art combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is not a cure for HIV, researchers said, it can only suppress the virus – cause it to become latent. “...Unfortunately, in some cases, cART is known to fail even when patients fully follow drug regimen. Certain negative effects are also associated with cART, such as the build-up of toxic molecules leading to ‘oxidative stress’ and loss of function in the mitochondria, the cell’s powerhouse. These effects can contribute to inflammation and organ damage,” researchers said.Amit Singh, associate professor, MCB/CIDR and corresponding author, said scientists have recently begun exploring beneficial effects of H2S presence in HIV-infected cells on both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. IISc added that in the previous study, Singh’s lab developed a tool to measure oxidative stress in cells infected with HIV. “In that work, we showed that the chemical agent (N-acetylcysteine) could suppress HIV reactivation from latently infected cells. A German study later showed that N-acetylcysteine partly acts by releasing H2S molecules, which is when we began examining its role,” Singh said.Previous work from Singh’s lab also looked at effects of counteracting oxidative stress by an antioxidant nanozyme during HIV infection. “Since H2S also functions as an antioxidant molecule, we wished to see whether our prior insights could be translated to show contributions of H2S on HIV infection,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hydrogen-sulphide-suppresses-hiv-infection/articleshow/88154039.cms||---

---||Chennai||Greater Chennai Corporation mends over 16k potholes as rain reduces||CHENNAI: The city corporation has patched up more than 16,700 potholes, 50% of them last week after rain reduced. Allocated 26 crore from the state disaster relief fund to restore flood-damaged roads, Greater Chennai Corporation has identified 63 major stretches with potholes 50m-100m wide and plans to spend 8 crore on them.  A total of 63 roads with 49,343 sqm of potholes will be patched up in the coming days. At a review meeting on Monday, officials were asked to inspect roads daily and ensure patchwork is carried out. Deputy commissioner (works) S Prasanth told TOI that roads being dug up by service agencies and water retention were among the causes for the damage. Contractors meant to maintain these roads won’t be liable to patch them up if these are the reasons. For instance, Nungambakkam subway and Brindhavan Street in T Nagar, and both re-laid less than a year ago, have developed huge potholes. Ward level officials said the first was damaged by rain water retention and the second due to TNEB digging work. “We have already made road-cut permissions online and are working on a system to stop illegal road-cuts by telecommunication operators,” said a senior official. One ward level official said they faced many challenges as heavy machinery can be brought only at night. “And highways roads are wider so they usually block one side and finish patchwork while we can patch them up only after traffic police clearance,” he said. The corporation maintains 33,374 interior roads stretching over 5,525 km and 387km of 471 bus route roads, most of them re-laid ahead of the 2021 TN election. Activists said roads where there was flooding have also begun peeling off such as in Anna Nagar. “The civic body should conduct a proper audit of all roads re-laid in the last one year and those that were not inundated,” said H Chandrabose, a civic contractor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-mends-over-16k-potholes-as-rain-reduces/articleshow/88154044.cms||Komal Gautham
---||Chennai||Rain intensity may increase over next two days in Chennai: Weathermen||CHENNAI: After some parts of the city and the suburbs experienced a brief spell of rain on Monday, weathermen have said that the intensity of rainfall could increase from light to moderate over a few areas in the city and the suburbs at least for the next two days. This is because easterlies will make their entry from Wednesday bringing convective activity. Bloggers, however, said there are chances that December may end in a deficit. Chennai subdivision has recorded a 69% excess rainfall with 1153.6mm against a normal 681.3mm between October 1 and December 7. IMD has forecast light to moderate rain to occur over some areas of the city and the neighboring areas in the next 48 hours as skies would remain partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperature may hover at 31°C and 24°C. A meteorologist said as cyclone Jawad has fizzled, easterlies have started to enter the coastal areas. This will lead to a convective activity when the warm moisture-laden easterly winds interact with the cool land. “Much of the spells could be seen at night,” an official said. IMD officials said there are chances of mist over coastal and adjoining interior districts as easterlies get streamlined. Mist forms when warm air over the sea interacts with the cool land surface. On Monday morning, some parts of north and south Chennai saw sudden spells. While Nungambakkam recorded 1.7mm, Meenambakkam registered zero rainfall.

Following this, at least three bus crew parked their vehicles on GST Road and staged protests demanding action against the cop. The constable was travelling on the bus to the police station when the conductor asked him to buy a ticket. Though the constable who was later identified as Haridas of the Mamallapuram police station told him that he was a policeman, the conductor initially refused to believe him and asked him to show his identity card. During an argument that broke out, the duo exchanged blows. The conductor asked the driver to stop the bus and called up a few other bus conductors. The bus crew along with a few others staged a protest demanding action. The protests that went on for about an hour had stalled the buses heading from Chengalpet to Kalpakkam, Tambaram, and Thiruporur affecting traffic. On information, senior police officials from Chengalpet and the depot manager Maran went to the spot and pacified the protesting bus drivers and conductors. Later, the staff withdrew the protest as the cops promised to take action against the policeman. Bus conductor Murugesan filed a complaint against Haridas for attacking him. The Chengalpet police are probing the issue. It may be recalled that DGP C Sylendra Babu has earlier instructed all the policemen to buy tickets while traveling in plain clothes and during their personal work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cop-in-mufti-refuses-to-buy-ticket-fights-with-conductor/articleshow/88154045.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: If undivided share remains same, land owner can’t object to more construction||CHENNAI: Once an absolute power to develop a property is given to a builder, no objection to additional constructions could be raised by the landowner, if the promoter does not step beyond his undivided share of land, TNRERA has ruled. Authorising the builder to develop the property at their ‘own discretion’ will give absolute rights for the former over the property and cannot be challenged, if more units are added in the future, said the Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA). The case relates to a complaint by a landlord, who entered into a joint venture agreement with a developer in 2018 to deliver apartments in 18 months. While the agreement was for construction of six flats, the complainant alleged that it was being advertised for eight units. Also, pointing out that hand over of flats was delayed due to a case in court, she wanted the TNRERA to direct the developer not to proceed with any construction due to changes in the structure of the building. In response, developer Naviya Builders of Pallikaranai said construction was stalled due to lockdown, but work has now resumed and the construction is nearing completion. Noting that only six flats have been constructed, it said two more apartments will be added only after obtaining approval from the appropriate authorities. Moreover, the promoter underscored that he was not obligated to seek approval from the land owner on the number of apartments constructed/ proposed to be constructed in the project, as the undivided share and built-up area promised to land owner will not be violated. In its ruling, TNRERA said the complainant had authorised the promoter to manage and develop the property as per the power of attorney's own discretion. An undivided share of 1,640sqft too had been given by the land owner to the promoter. The promoter, therefore, is entitled to utilise the undivided share and construct flats as per the permissible FSI. It, however, said the land-owner was at liberty to approach the adjudicating officer of the TNRERA to seek compensation and interest for delay in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/if-undivided-share-remains-same-land-owner-cant-object-to-more-construction/articleshow/88154048.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

The official liquidator is directed to take over the assets of the respondent company,” ruled Justice R Subramanian on Monday. Since counsel for SpiceJet sought time to move an appeal against the order, the judge suspended the operation of the order for three weeks, on a condition that the company deposit 5 million US dollars in two weeks. In a BSE filing on Tuesday, however, SpiceJet said the Madras high court “was pleased to stay the operation of the order for a period of three weeks, subject to the condition that (SpiceJet) deposits the amount equivalent to $5 million within a period of two weeks”. Justice Subramanian was passing orders on a plea moved by Credit Suisse AG, a stock corporation registered under the laws of Switzerland. According to the petitioner, SpiceJet had availed itself of the services of SR Technics, Switzerland, for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft engines, modules, components, assemblies and parts which are mandatory for its operations. A 10-year contract was signed between the companies on November 24, 2011.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/shut-spicejet-take-over-assets-says-hc-in-loan-default-case/articleshow/88154049.cms||Suresh Kumar

Since the order was issued at 4 pm, she could not reach the college on the same day to confirm her admission.On the next day, the college refused her admission citing a Supreme Court order that admissions should be concluded on September 30.Aggrieved, the petitioner moved the court. Disposing of the plea, the court said, “The petitioner has not committed any fault or delay in reporting before the college. It was the mistake committed by the selection committee in not conducting the counseling in advance or providing information to the college directing them to admit her.”Though the allotment was informed to the college through fax message, they denied the admission to the petitioner. In such circumstances, the committee should have initiated action against the college by making a complaint to the competent authority. However, no such action was taken, the court added.Therefore, this court is of the opinion that the committee and the college have jointly contributed for the denial of right of admission to the petitioner to undergo BDS course, the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-orders-5-lakh-payout-to-girl-who-missed-dental-seat/articleshow/88154052.cms||---

OPS and EPS demanded that the government extend compensation and government jobs to the bereaved families. In a statement, Palaniswami pointed to media reports of Manikandan, a native of Mudukulathur in Ramanathapuram, who was found dead in his house under mysterious circumstances after being interrogated at the police station, while Ulaganathan, who ran a petty shop in Arakandanallur in Villupuram, fainted after being attacked by the police in a verbal duel. He was declared dead when brought to the hospital. Palaniswami said the opposition would not remain mute spectators to the deteriorating law and order situation in the state. “Women and the public could not freely move in the state. People would resort to protests if this situation continues. Appropriate posting should be offered to the police personnel. The state should establish rule of law and act against errant cops,” he said. Palaniswami accused the DMK regime of being supportive to anti-socials and certain individuals in the police force. EPS cited reports of a cop held for raping a woman when she was returning from a cinema hall, a woman cop lodging complaint with higher ups, alleging humiliation at the hands of colleagues, and an army officer being robbed of his mobile phone and cash at the secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/eps-demands-cbi-probe-in-death-of-college-student/articleshow/88154055.cms||---

In the other semifinal, Baroda will take on Gujarat.Earlier, openers Bhupen Lalwani (30) and Divyaansh (76) gave Mumbai a steady start, which Rudra Dhanday (74) built on.

For Karnataka, medium-pacer Nischith N Rao returned 4 for 47.In reply, Karnataka were off to a blazing start with Luvnith Sisodia (48) and Shivakumar BU piling an 28-ball, 53-run opening stand. The other batsmen built on the good start with Aneesh KV (56) and Kruthik Krishna (65) contributing crucial half-centuries. Karnataka lost focus in the latter half of the chase, losing three wickets for the addition of 17 runs. But they found their go-to men in skipper Shubhang Hegde (38) and Manoj Bhandage (67 n.o, 40b, 3x4, 5x6), who put together a 83-run association for the seventh wicket. All-rounder Bhandage, who had an off day with the ball, conceding 62 runs in six overs, made amends with his quick-fire innings which helped Karnataka advance.Brief scores: Mumbai: 345/6 in 50 overs (Bhupen Lalwani 30, Divyaansh 76, Rudra Dhanday 74, O Jadhav 78, Khizar Dafedar 72; Nischith Rao 4-47) lost to Karnataka: 351/7 in 49.4 overs (Luvnith Sisodia 48, Shivakumar BU 52, Aneesh KV 56, Kruthika Krishna 65, Shubhang Hegde 38, Manoj Bhandage 67 n.o)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-pip-mumbai-to-make-semis/articleshow/88154077.cms||---

However, vacancies were up nearly 30% year-on-year. Job portals and headhunters TOI spoke to said that there was a cautious optimism across verticals this month as pre-festive season hiring was very robust this year. Given the buoyancy in hiring action witnessed over the last few quarters, the drop in volume in November is “a blip in the radar”, they said. Active job openings in November at around 295,000 were 8% lower compared to 320,000 jobs in October but around 10% higher than the same month last year, specialist staffing firm Xpheno’s data showed. “While the threat of a third wave is real, it’s too early to call out a hiring impact at this point,” Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, said. “The short-term volatility witnessed in the trading markets and year-end season for the IT sector seems to have impacted hiring volume and velocity, but this is to be seen as a minor correction,” he added. Anshul Lodha, head of Page Executive, India, said hiring in November was around 40% up year-on-year, but almost on a par with October. However, fresher hiring is on an all-time high. Professional services firm Aon’s Fresher Hiring Index in November notes a 161% rise in requirements as compared to November 2020. “The year-on-year analysis of talent demand showed that the consumer-led sectors such as consumer durables/FMCG and retail posted strong growth in talent intake. This was fuelled by festive buying and reopening of offices and retail hubs too,” Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs and TechGig said. TimesJobs’ RecruiteX index showed that while FMCG recorded the highest year-on-year growth at 18%, IT/Telecom followed at 12%.Full report on www.toi.in||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hiring-slows-in-nov-after-pre-festive-season-rush/articleshow/88154078.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Chennai||Were 19 ‘missing’ waterbodies behind flooding in North Chennai?||CHENNAI: Nineteen major tanks, a large number of smaller ones, their supply channels and surplus courses seem to have vanished from North Chennai’s topography. These missing waterbodies could be the reason why many localities here were flooded after the recent spate of showers. Experts blamed the disappearance of these tanks and their channels on rapid urbanisation. Former PWD assistant executive engineer S Thirunavukkarasu said five of the missing tanks were fairly large ones. The Vyasarpadi tank covered about 220 acres, Sembiam tank 51.25 acres, Peravallur tank 128.22 acres, Kodungaiyur tank 128.23 acres and Perambur large tank 52.16 acres. The smaller ones include Erukkancheri tank, Ayyaneri thangal, Kadapperi thangal, Perambur small tank, Perumal thangal and Velleri thangal. Of the total 19 tanks, 11 form a chain allowing for a cascading effect wherein if one tank is full, excess water automatically flows into the next one. The water holding capacity of just these 11 tanks came up to 191.25 mcft. During monsoon, rainwater from the 19 tanks would drain into Buckingham Canal, Cooum river and Otteri Nullah. This system helped prevent inundation in areas surrounding these waterbodies, Thirunavukkarasu said. On average, the tanks would release about 7,000 cusecs into Buckingham Canal, 5,340 cusecs into Otteri Nullah and 3,900 cusecs into the Cooum during the monsoon. However, indiscriminate encroachments have disrupted this system. Ambattur lake, Korattur lake and Madhavaram Retteri too form a chain. The channels that carry discharge from these waterbodies have been encroached upon and this led to flooding during the monsoon especially in North Chennai. The government too has taken to converting waterbodies into housing projects. For instance, Mogappair lake and Nolambur lake have been filled and housing projects set up, Thirunavukkarasu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/were-19-missing-waterbodies-behind-flooding-in-n-chennai/articleshow/88154079.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Kanchi villagers put life on line to cross Cheyyar||Chennai: A rope and maybe a helping hand from a stranger — This is all villagers have at their disposable to cross the brimming Cheyyar river in Kancheepuram district. The other option is taking a 35km-long detour. The recent showers washed away the 50-year-old causeway across the Cheyyar so everyone from elderly women to schoolchildren queue up for this dangerous crossing, holding on to a rope tied across the banks for dear life. Last week, soon after a major portion of the causeway was washed away, vehicles and buses were prevented from taking this route.This left villagers from Vengacheri, Kadambarkoil, Kavampayir and Karuveppampoondi no option other than taking a detour of nearly 35km and travel via Manammathi to reach Kancheepuram district.The causeway also sustained serious damage about five years ago, but was not repaired. “Now with the recent rain, it is fully damaged and we are struggling to cross over to the other side,” said Kalyani, who has to go to a government hospital in Kancheepuram for check-ups every week.Schoolchildren and people carrying huge bundles were also seen struggling to cross the river while a person from the other side waited to help those stuck in the middle.“We know it is a major risk making this crossing, but we have no other option than to climb over all the debris. It is nearly impossible at night,” Kalyani said. Karpagam also takes this dangerous route to drop her daughter off at a college in the district. “We are lucky to have not faced a major emergency like a fire or a medical emergency so far. Help would reach us very late,” she said.Other villagers added that pregnant women and the elderly wouldn’t be able to access an ambulance if needed and urged authorities to take action immediately.“Majority of traders have to go to Kancheepuram to buy essential commodities wholesale and bring it to our village. Our businesses have been badly affected due to the transportation issues,” said Padmanaban of Vengacheri village. The district administration is yet to act. Moreover, there is not one police officer posted here to prevent people from crossing the stretch. However, after several complaints, senior police officers promised to post a few policemen at the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kanchi-villagers-put-life-on-line-to-cross-cheyyar/articleshow/88154080.cms||---

The agency, however, did not mention the names of the firms in the official release.While seraching premises connected to the first firm, officials gathered documents and other incriminating material which revealed that it had been actively involved in systematic suppression of sales by manipulating its account books.The extent of suppression of sales was found to be more than 1,000 crore, over a period of several years. It was also found that the firm made purchases with unaccounted cash of about 150 crore in the textile and jewellery divisions over the past few years, according to a statement released on Tuesday.Material and documents collected from the premises of the second group revealed that it had obtained bogus bills worth 80 crore from a set of parties to suppress taxable income. Evidence relating to unaccounted gold was also gathered, the release added.Besides this, the group was found to be debiting inflated making charges of jewellery. Unaccounted rental receipts and scrap sales aggregating to 7 crore have also been detected.

---||Chennai||Local bodies to pay 24L fine for polluting lakes||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has slapped a fine of 24 lakh on Avadi Corporation and Greater Chennai Corporation (Villivakkam) for dumping and burning waste near water bodies. Solid waste was burned along the south-west bund of Ambattur lake on 12th Main Road of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) residential colony at Ayapakkam. Waste was also dumped in some pockets on both sides of the bunds of Ayapakkam surplus canal, which leads to the lake. TNPCB during inspection found out that the underground sewage system (UGSS) provided in the Ayapakkam TNHB Colony was not maintained properly and sewage frequently overflowed.Even when a sewage treatment plant (STP) was set up in the colony, local authorities did not obtain consent from the board, according to a report submitted by TNPCB to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently. Sewage from this plant was discharged not only into Ambattur lake but also into river Cooum without getting permission from the public works department and the Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust (CRRT), the report said. Besides, stormwater drains constructed by Avadi Corporation in Sivasakthi Nagar, Annai Anjugam Nagar and Gangai Amman Nagar, carried sullage into Ambattur lake. Some other areas in the corporation's limit (including Ganapathy Nagar and Moontru Nagar) did not have underground sewage systems and they too polluted the lake. So, the TNPCB has directed Avadi Corporation and Greater Chennai Corporation (erstwhile Villivakkam panchayat union area) to pay 24 lakh as compensation for causing damage to the environment and take steps to comply with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The board told NGT that Avadi was yet to pay the compensation. The corporation in response said that steps were taken to provide underground sewage connections to all houses before 2025. They were preparing a detailed project report to implement this. Meanwhile, analysis of water samples collected from the lake suggested that concentration of heavy metals such as chromium, lead, nickel, zinc and copper was already beyond the permissible limits.Therefore, the NGT earlier this week directed TNPCB to take action against erring local bodies and submit the details before the next hearing of the case on December 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/local-bodies-to-pay-24l-fine-for-polluting-lakes/articleshow/88154085.cms||Ram Sundaram

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu flags ‘alarming’ dog deaths on IIT-M campus, wants animals released||CHENNAI: Referring to the situation as alarming, the Tamil Nadu government’s animal husbandry department told Madras high court that at least 57 dogs kept in an exclusive shelter on IIT-Madras premises had died over the past 13 months. The department recommended that the dogs be released from the shelter and enlarged within the IIT-M campus. It also added that despite a request made by the department to the registrar of IIT-M, the institution refused to furnish details of the 34 individuals who are said to have adopted the sheltered dogs from IIT-M, the department said. The submissions were made through a report after a joint inspection with experts from Tamil Nadu Veterinary University. Recording the submission, the first bench of acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu observed that it would be desirable to appoint a dog-loving advocate as advocate commissioner in the issue and adjourned the hearing to Thursday. The issue pertains to a public interest writ petition filed by PFCI alleging ill-treatment of more than 100 dogs captured on IIT-M campus and lodged in three ‘dog parks’ on IIT-M premises. During the course of hearing, Animal Welfare Board of India filed a report submitting that the institution is taking good care of the dogs. On the contrary, the report filed by the state government department said if proper sanitation and hygiene had been maintained at the shelter, the deaths of some dogs could have been avoided. “It could be summarised that the serious lacunae in maintaining the hygiene and sanitation of the shelter could compromise the health and wellbeing of the dogs kept within the shelter,” the department said. The animal welfare organisation, which has been entrusted with the care and management of the dogs, has failed in ensuring crucial aspects like management and taking care of the health of the dogs, which has had a direct bearing on the quality of life and longevity of the dogs, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-flags-alarming-dog-deaths-on-iit-m-campus-wants-animals-released/articleshow/88154088.cms||---

The main accused, S Triloka Chandar, 56, of Nagari, is native of Tuticorin and moved to Andhra Pradesh about 25 years ago. He had been earlier arrested by the city police in 2010 and 2015 for thefts in Adambakkam and Madipakkam. Police said Chandar would sneak into people’s homes while they were sleeping and make away with their jewels without them ever stirring. “He would look for people sleeping near windows and steal their jewels,” an officer said. In October, the Velachery police received two similar complaints of thefts of nearly 11 sovereigns of gold. Using CCTV camera footage, police identified Chandar and picked him up from Andhra Pradesh. Based on his confession, a pawnbroker named Ukaram, also from Nagari, was secured. Investigation revealed that Ukaram sent Chander to carry out offences in the city even paying him an advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/ap-man-hired-to-steal-jewels-from-city-folk-lands-in-jail/articleshow/88154090.cms||---

---||Chennai||Fit-again Washington to make comeback for Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu, which began the season by retaining the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 title, face defending champions Mumbai in their opening game of the Vijay Hazare Trophy at Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. The schedule of the tournament is a demanding one with teams playing 5 one-dayers in 7 days during the league phase. A day after playing Mumbai, the Vijay Shankar-led side will take on Karnataka. Tamil Nadu, which failed to make the knockout stages of the competition, will be hoping for an improved performance. They will be boosted with the return of Dinesh Karthik and Washington Sundar. The side wears a settled look with N Jagadeesan and C Hari Nishaanth expected to open the proceedings. The middle-order will be manned by Shankar, young gun Sai Sudharsan, Karthik and Washington while M Shahrukh Khan dons the finisher’s role. The team has options aplenty in their bowling department --- be it pacers or spinners. On the other hand, Mumbai — captained by Shams Mulani — are missing a few key players like Prithvi Shaw and Shreyas Iyer. While Prithvi is part of the India A tour of South Africa, Shreyas featured in the India-New Zealand Test series which concluded in Mumbai on Monday. A depleted Mumbai side notwithstanding, Tamil Nadu will not want to take them lightly. “Mumbai have always been a top-quality side even if a few of their players aren’t part of the team. We will have to be on top of our game against a team like Mumbai,” coach M Venkataramana said on the eve of the contest. Mumbai will be banking on Yashasvi Jaiswal, Armaan Jaffer and Siddhesh Lad to do the bulk of scoring. Their bowling will be spearheaded by medium-pacer Dhawal Kulkarni along with Tushar Deshpande. Despite a challenging schedule in the tournament, Venkataramana is hoping that the team will be able to deliver a strong performance. “The schedule is the same for all teams. We have a strong side and players are experienced enough to come up with the goods,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fit-again-washington-to-make-comeback-for-tn/articleshow/88154092.cms||---

The university has also proposed skill training for the needy students, who are keen to earn their livelihood on their own under the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana programme. According to pro-VC Prof Sanjoy Kumar, the NOU has also proposed to set up its zonal headquarters at the commissionery headquarters so that students from semi-urban and rural areas can avail the benefits of study centre. At present, the NOU has 185 study centres where more than 1 lakh students are enrolled, he said, adding the number of students has increased as compared to the Covid pandemic year 2020-21. The NOU, which is likely to be shifted to its own building in Nalanda next year, intends to get National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) grade by 2023. The university is gearing up for it under the supervision of NOU VC Prof K C Sinha, Sanjay said. According to Sanjay, the NOU is imparting PhD course in 15 major subjects and PG teaching in 28 subjects. The university is also running seven PG Diploma courses, Degree honours courses in 28 subjects and certificate courses in 36 subjects, he said, adding that BEd teaching is also on the list of courses at the NOU. Keeping in view the difficulty of students, mostly girls, to reach Patna from far-off places like Purnia, Kishanganj and Raxaul to appear at the examinations, the NOU has decided to hold examinations in their home districts only. To help students resolve any issue online, the university is creating a ‘dashboard’ on its website, Sanjay said. According to him, the purpose of the university is to provide teaching guidance to students and clear their doubts through online classes also, as and when required. The NOU has issued an advisory to the office that each staff is supposed to be present in the office by 10.15am on working days and dispose of all problems related to students on priority, the pro-VC said, adding the university is committed to maintaining transparency in its functioning under the direct supervision of the new VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nou-to-open-study-centres-in-all-dists/articleshow/88151268.cms||Kumod Verma

He has discussed the matter with the Centre. It is a problem not just of Bihar, but the entire country,” Singh said. “Yet, the availability of DAP will improve by the end of this week. The NPK variety is available, but more of it will be available for use by the farmers,” he said, adding the allotment for the state is 12 lakh metric tonne (MT) of urea, 10 lakh MT of DAP and four lakh MT of NPK, besides other types of chemical fertilizer. “During the sowing of wheat and winter maize and cultivation of potato, farmers need a huge amount of DAP and NPK. There is an acute shortage of DAP in the state,” Singh said. The sowing of wheat is done between November 15 and December 15. “It is the peak sowing season for the farmers, but 40% of the total fertilizer required in the country is made available through import,” Singh said. Singh appealed to the farmers of the state to purchase and use DAP and NPK as per their need only. “The farmers should understand and appreciate each other’s needs. They should purchase fertilizer as per their requirement for the rabi season,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fertilizer-crisis-to-ease-in-bihar-minister/articleshow/88151151.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Business||Gender diversity at top level boosts productivity, profits||By Anuranjita KumarThe steady elevation of diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) to the very top of the corporate discourse has to be one of the most heartening developments in recent years. Today, it is increasingly common to find press announcements from large companies emphasising and highlighting their DEI efforts, particularly around gender diversity. To be sure, their motivations extend beyond cultivating a favourable brand image. For there is enough research-based evidence to prove that organisations with more gender diversity, particularly at senior levels, clearly outperform those with less diversity in productivity, innovation, profits and shareholder returns. A quick scrutiny of the Indian press shows that domestic corporations are also catching up and are making conscious efforts around increasing gender diversity. Yet, the data around female participation in the workforce reveals that the task ahead is mammoth. The World Bank estimates that female labour participation in India had peaked at 31.8% in 2005 and has subsequently fallen to reach 20.8% in 2019. India’s own CMIE pegged the participation rate at 17.7% in May 2016, which reduced to 10.2% in September 2021. In urban areas, the rate is down to 7.8%. A common explanation for this worrying trend — more women dropping out of the workforce as compared to men — is that the pandemic has hit woman professionals disproportionately harder. Compared to men, more women were either laid off or left jobs voluntarily during the crisis. Of course, the pandemic is not the biggest reason why many women stop working. In fact, research often reveals that major life events for women, led by marriage and childbirth, are frequent triggers for them to quit jobs. Regardless of the causes, these findings not only contradict the growing organisational awareness of diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) and efforts to build more gender-balanced workplaces, they also dramatically conflict with the prevailing economic environment — growth in household incomes have lagged while prices of most household goods have shot up in recent years. Clearly, there ought to be sufficient financial incentives for many women to return to work and start earning again. Here, we found a valuable clue from our conversations with CEOs and chief HR officers from many companies, who revealed that their efforts to promote or hire senior woman professionals at the top get scuttled because the industry struggles with retaining enough women at junior or middle levels. These business leaders are also aware that the key to achieve gender balance at the top of the organisation is to enlarge the talent pool of woman professionals at mid to senior levels. This, in turn, requires building an effective talent pipeline with enough number of woman professionals rising constantly through junior and mid-level roles, both inside as well as outside the organisation. Now, building this talent pipeline involves two separate tasks, of which only one is obvious: We need to prevent the permanent attrition of woman professionals on account of major life events like marriage or childbirth by making it easier for them to manage and navigate their professional career around these events. The second task is less obvious but equally important: Organisations also need to make it much easier for experienced woman professionals to return to work after they have been on a break for a while. Why is this important? A recent survey by Manpower Group revealed that no less than 74% of female millennials anticipate taking a career break for childcare, eldercare, or to support a partner in a job. One common requirement underpinning both these tasks is dedicated organisational support available in terms of learning and development of woman professionals. There is a clear need for developing differentiated L&D programmes to support woman professionals transitioning from junior to mid and later to senior-level roles. As their professional responsibilities increase with time, so do their domestic and family commitments. Women in particular need specialised mentoring and coaching to navigate their way around both professional and family commitments without feeling overwhelmed. Industry stakeholders can also contribute and make a difference. At WiT-ACE, we run Wocademy, a woman-focused online learning platform offering free self-paced courses and online classes for women who want to return to work after maternity or other breaks. Early responses from both organisational leaders and their woman employees have been encouraging. Women, including young mothers, who have undergone training by Wocademy, tell us they are much more confident of resuming and continuing with their jobs. Our experience also corroborates the belief that when it comes to designing L&D programmes for a gender-diverse workforce, the one-size-fits-all approach will clearly not work. It would not help businesses retain their existing women employees, and it certainly won’t help those women who are willing and ready to return to work after a break — particularly when such breaks extend to a few years. In addition to conventional skills training, these women also need specialised mentoring to boost their confidence — that they have indeed caught up with the world and are again well-equipped to resume their careers and be successful at it. In fact, we believe that the effectiveness and eventual success of an organisation’s gender-diversity agenda can be predicted by the presence of gender-focused L&D programmes within that agenda’s execution plan. Unless women’s unique developmental needs are adequately understood and fulfilled, they will continue dropping out of the workforce, putting corporate DEI programmes at the grave risk of failure.

The relinquishment will be held from December 25 to December 29. The health wing authorities warned the endowments department that the event may become a trigger to spread the new Omicron variant of Covid-19 and asked officials to be cautious and strictly follow Covid-19 norms. Endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas along with district collector J Nivas, temple EO Bramarambha and VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh conducted a field level inspection. Officials have decided to block the road from Vinayaka temple to Indrakeeladri hill top and arrange three separate queues for elderly, disabled and other devotees. Temple authorities have been directed to distribute four lakh masks to devotees and set up sanitisation points at every entry and exit. Thermal screening will be mandatory at all entry points. Trust board chairman Paila Sominaidu said no tickets will be sold during the fest for normal devotees. Fifty relinquishment counters will be set up at multiple locations to ensure there are no crowds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/covid-norms-in-place-for-relinquishing-deeksha/articleshow/88151781.cms||Venu Lanka

Among the 24 buildings come up on over Rs 700 crore KVD project nearing completion one is the Mumukshu Bhawan located less than 100 yards from the Mahashamshana (great cremation ground) of Manikarnika. This area is also known as Avimukta Kshetra- the most sacred circle of Kashi. Between Manikarnika Ghat along river Ganga and the KVT this two-floor Mumukshu Bhawan has come up on north-east of the Mandir Chowk. Construction of the Mumukshu Bhawan building is complete and its interior work is also in the finishing stage, said the divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board Deepak Agrawal showing this new hospice of Kashi to TOI. The modality to operate this Mumukshu Bhawan is being finalised as per which the persons on death bed will be accommodated on first come first serve basis. Stay in this hospice will be allowed for 15 days, said Agrawal mentioning that 25 beds on each floor will be placed on the lines of dormitory. The proposed modality for the operation of KVD’s Mumukshu Bhawan is hinting that it is going to be run on the lines of Kashi Labh Mukti Bhawan situated in Mishirpokhara locality in Godowlia area, which is serving since 1958 and accommodates only those who are on death bed and come to the city for ‘Kashilabh’. Other Mumukshu Bhavan of Assi area, which was established in 1920, allows elderly people, above 65, to spend their last days in peace for a good death and liberation from the cycle of birth and death, said its manager Vinod Kumar Agrawal. As per the norms of this hospice, which has 40 berths with a facility of long stay, an aspirant can get berth here only after one of the inmates dies, he said adding that, due to the same reasons the wait to get berth here by elderly persons from across the country remains very long. Regarding the belief of ‘Kashyam marnam muktih’ a senior priest of KVT Acharya Shrikant Mishra said, “As per Shastras among six prime pilgrimage centres of Sanatan only Kashi has the right of giving Moksha as here Lord Shiva gives Tarak Mantra in the ears of dead.” The idea of establishing Mumukshu Bhawan in KVD came to SKVSADB officials whe while purchasing buildings it was found that an organization Vriddha Sant Seva Ashram ran a hospice exclusively for elderly Dandi Swamis wishing to die in Kashi. The new Mumukshu Bhawan has been built at the same place. With the purchase of such ashram buildings against the payment of Rs 2.50 crore it was also planned to incorporate hospice in KVD, said the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mumukshu-bhawan-near-manikarnika-ghat-at-kvd-boon-for-salvation-seekers/articleshow/88152084.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

SHO, Jawahar Circle, Radha Raman Gupta said that a team from Bhopal police have already arrived in Jaipur to probe Sejpal’s involvement in their area. Besides Bhopal, Gurgaon police have sent an FIR to the Jawhar Circle police station about a 2010 hotel burglary. Gupta, however, said that the accused remain in Jaipur until the city police complete their probe into the Rs 2 crore worth jewellery that the accused had stolen from a hotel at Jawhar Circle on November 25. Gupta said that the police are currently involved in preparing a chargesheet against the accused very soon. Sejpal has been involved in over 30 cases in nearly 12 cities of the country. He mostly targeted five-star hotels by tricking unsuspecting staff. He had fled to Gujarat after a heist in Jaipur and was caught from there on December 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-from-bhopal-to-quiz-jewel-thief-sejpal/articleshow/88152782.cms||---

Contributions plunged 64% year-on-year to Rs 8,828 crore in fiscal 2021 under CSR, making it the lowest in recent years. In fiscals 2020 and 2019, CSR expenditure was Rs 24,689 crore and Rs 20,150 crore. In 2014, India had mandated companies to spend 2% of their average net profits clocked in the preceding three fiscals on social causes. But the pandemic that set in towards the fag end of fiscal 2020 forced companies to balance their business goals, employee well-being programmes and social obligations. A significant part of their CSR contribution was directed towards fighting the public health crisis, leaving little for other social causes. Companies set up medical infrastructure, established oxygen plants and contributed to Centre & state governments’ Covid relief programmes to counter the pandemic. “Given the expectations of a third Covid wave, the probability of (companies) diverting more funds during this fiscal seems imminent,” Crisil Foundation COO Maya Vengurlekar had said in August. India’s largest conglomerate, the Tata Group, spent nearly Rs 1,000 crore on CSR activities in fiscal 2021, retaining its top position, according to data from ministry of corporate affairs. Reliance Industries followed next, spending Rs 922 crore on social causes. The company, headed by India’s wealthiest man Mukesh Ambani, contributed Rs 561 crore to the Centre and various state governments’ Covid relief programmes. IT major Infosys contributed Rs 362 crore to CSR activities in fiscal 2021, while diversified cigarette-to-cookie maker ITC allocated Rs 335 crore, according to the data. Following the outbreak of Covid, New Delhi has been amending CSR rules by including multiple components into them. It has allowed companies to use CSR funds for setting up Covid care facilities, manufacturing of ventilators and other medical equipment, among other things. “More changes may be in order this fiscal as new rules proposed by the ministry of corporate affairs have kicked in from April 2021. In its notifications, apart from key CSR rules, the ministry has also urged India Inc to support Covid relief work, and awareness & vaccinations drives as part of their ongoing CSR mandate,” Crisil Ratings director Nitesh Jain had also said in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/csr-spends-plunge-64-in-fy21/articleshow/88152738.cms||Reeba Zachariah

With a current turnover of Rs 520 crore, Pandiarajan said the aim is to double the business to Rs 1,120 crore by end of this financial year. “By FY23, we aim to reach a valuation of Rs 2,000 crore, where 25% (Rs 500 crore) of dilution stake is a norm for going public,” he said. “We have started the process of IPO recently. Simultaneously, we would like to blend the brick and mortar and digital model of skill development businesses. Most of the online edtech platforms have realized the importance of having physical classrooms for a sustainable business,” he added. Pandiarajan, on Tuesday, announced the launch of a new skill building initiative for rural India called ‘Ma Foi Career Centre’ (MCC) and virtually opened seven such centres across Tamil Nadu- Coimbatore, Thiruvallur, Chengalpet, Trichy, Madurai, Salem and Chennai. “We will be opening a total of 242 centres nation-wide by the end of 2023 that will be working closely with the respective government departments and corporate firms to create a positive impact across 748 districts in the country,” he said. Mobilization of youth for skill developments and training has been the major challenge, especially in the time of job placement. “This is mainly due to youth in villages and small towns hesitating to relocate post job placement. Training centres or project implementation agents do not get their bills settled if they do not meet the government-kept norm of 70% of job placement post training” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ciel-hr-services-to-go-for-ipo-by-q4-of-fy22-23-k-pandiarajan/articleshow/88152423.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Business||Route Mobile to enable conversational commerce by adding payments to chats||Mumbai: Route Mobile, a company that enables businesses and enterprises to reach out to customers through email, WhatsApp and text messages, is now adding payments to these channels to facilitate conversational commerce. The company’s communication-platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) model enables, among other things, marketing, payment reminders and grievance redressals. Its offering Click2Pay enables these businesses to send in a specific link for payment where the customer has to only choose the instrument and enter credentials. Hitherto retailers and insurance companies have been sending customers links for payments through partnership with payment aggregators. Route Mobile will enable this service for any provider irrespective of who their payment service provider is. Route Mobile has said that it can integrate any payment provider within days enabling businesses to send out actionable messages. The company has been supporting businesses in their dealings with customers through electronic challans by first enabling marketing, servicing and grievance redressal. The latest move enables the payment to be completed without having to visit the merchant’s website. For the consumer what this means is that they will be able to make a payment to the merchant during a WhatsApp business account chat or while engaging with a chatbot without having to exit the conversation. The payment interface will be a temporary pop-up through which authentication is done. “We have started with WhatsApp and slowly we will move to text, email RCS (rich communication services, a next generation version of SMS),” said Milind Pathak, group chief business officer Route Payments. “World over the trend is e-commerce is moving to conversational commerce or communication commerce. We are powering that journey by integrating the merchant’s existing payment gateways and allowing the consumer to use the payment instrument of their choice — cards, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) or wallets,” said Pathak. Route Mobile is already a business service provider with WhatsApp. “Any enterprise that wants to integrate with WhatsApp through us, can integrate their payment gateway with the chat,” said Pathak. By partnering with Route Mobile, any e-commerce provider can put an extra button in a communication allowing the customer to pay and conclude the transaction. “Besides WhatsApp we will power any channel that has communication ability and we will enable any payment instrument which the merchant wants to bring,” said Pathak. He describes Route Mobile as a super aggregator that has all the communication channels at one end and a host of merchants and their payment gateways at the other end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/route-mobile-to-enable-conversational-commerce-by-adding-payments-to-chats/articleshow/88152822.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||RIL, Abu Dhabi cos tie up for $2bn petchem plant in UAE||Mumbai: Reliance Industries (RIL) along with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and ADQ will set up a $2-billion petrochemicals facility in UAE’s largest emirate, the companies said on Tuesday. While the parties didn’t reveal their equity component in the joint venture, this will be RIL’s first investment in a greenfield petchem project outside of India. The petchem facility in Abu Dhabi’s Al Ruwais city, targeted to be operational by 2025, will produce chlor-alkali, ethylene dichloride and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Chlor-alkali enables the production of caustic soda, crucial to the alumina refining process. Ethylene dichloride is used to produce PVC, which has a wide range of applications across housing, infrastructure and consumer goods. The Abu Dhabi facility will have a capacity to produce 9.4 lakh tons of chlor-alkali annually, 1.1 million tons of ethylene dichloride and 3.6 lakh tons of PVC. The petchem project was initiated based on the demand potential for these products. In 2019, RIL and Abu Dhabi had signed a framework to explore joint investments in petchem. The unit will create export opportunities to Southeast Asia and Africa, as well as provide local industry with a source of critical raw materials manufactured in the UAE, the companies added. The $74-billion RIL and Abu Dhabi have a long relationship, with the former sourcing crude oil from the emirate for many years. Abu Dhabi had also invested in RIL’s retail and telecom (Jio) businesses. The Abu Dhabi project will be the first investment by RIL in the Middle East and North Africa region, the Indian company said. In 2012, RIL had purchased BP’s petchem unit in Malaysia for $230 million. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said, “India’s need for PVC to propel its growth, and the value from the abundantly available feedstock in UAE, provides a win-win partnership for all the companies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-abu-dhabi-cos-tie-up-for-2bn-petchem-plant-in-uae/articleshow/88152886.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Chennai||Kanchi villagers put life on line to cross Cheyyar||Chennai: A rope and maybe a helping hand from a stranger — This is all villagers have at their disposable to cross the brimming Cheyyar river in Kancheepuram district. The other option is taking a 35km-long detour. The recent showers washed away the 50-year-old causeway across the Cheyyar so everyone from elderly women to schoolchildren queue up for this dangerous crossing, holding on to a rope tied across the banks for dear life. Last week, soon after a major portion of the causeway was washed away, vehicles and buses were prevented from taking this route. This left villagers from Vengacheri, Kadambarkoil, Kavampayir and Karuveppampoondi no option other than taking a detour of nearly 35km and travel via Manammathi to reach Kancheepuram district. The causeway also sustained serious damage about five years ago, but was not repaired. “Now with the recent rain, it is fully damaged and we are struggling to cross over to the other side,” said Kalyani, who has to go to a government hospital in Kancheepuram for check-ups every week. Schoolchildren and people carrying huge bundles were also seen struggling to cross the river while a person from the other side waited to help those stuck in the middle. “We know it is a major risk making this crossing, but we have no other option than to climb over all the debris. It is nearly impossible at night,” Kalyani said. Karpagam also takes this dangerous route to drop her daughter off at a college in the district. “We are lucky to have not faced a major emergency like a fire or a medical emergency so far. Help would reach us very late,” she said. Other villagers added that pregnant women and the elderly wouldn’t be able to access an ambulance if needed and urged authorities to take action immediately. “Majority of traders have to go to Kancheepuram to buy essential commodities wholesale and bring it to our village. Our businesses have been badly affected due to the transportation issues,” said Padmanaban of Vengacheri village. The district administration is yet to act. Moreover, there is not one police officer posted here to prevent people from crossing the stretch. However, after several complaints, senior police officers promised to post a few policemen at the spot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kanchi-villagers-put-life-on-line-to-cross-cheyyar/articleshow/88152114.cms||---

Dhinakaran took to social media to say that minerals worth crores of rupees were smuggled from stone quarries in Radhapuram and Kudankulam in Tirunelveli which had links with some of the top brass of DMK in Tirunelveli district. Since the sub-collector of Cheranmadevi and SP of Tirunelveli, N Manivannan, had taken stern action against these smugglers, both were transferred suddenly, he said. “There is information that some more top officials are also to be transferred in this connection. Taking action against honest and straightforward officers is a matter of concern,” he said. Official sources said stone quarries in Radhapuram and Kudankulam had excavated more than their permitted amount of minerals and the stones were blasted using powerful explosives. Sub-collector of Cheranmadevi, Siva Krishnamoorthy, had conducted sudden raids on these quarries. It was found that mineral sand of 4.04 lakh cubic metres had been smuggled out of a quarry belonging to one Isakkiappam of Irukkanthurai without proper permit. The sub-collector imposed a fine of Rs 20.11 crore on this quarry. It was a joint action by police and the revenue departments. The sub-collector was transferred a few days after the action was taken. Subsequently, SP N Manivannan was also transferred and Saravanan replaced him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ttv-slams-transfer-of-officials-for-acting-against-mineral-smugglers/articleshow/88152751.cms||---

The demands were among many others put forth during the executive meeting of the association held on Monday. Among other resolutions passed, the association sought for more basic staff workers to be appointed to government schools, including watchmen, sanitary workers etc., to help maintain schools better. The association members noted that especially with schools now reopened, the need for workers had increased. Sanitary workers who were hired on consolidated pay have also been left unpaid for two years. The headmasters said that the workers are struggling to keep the school premises clean. The association further sought exemption of Rs 200 that classes XI and XII students who pursue computer science have to pay. It was also resolved that transfer counselling for teachers and headmasters must be held before counselling for promotion as per the old rule. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/appoint-more-workers-in-govt-schools-hms-assn/articleshow/88152769.cms||---

The day’s rally, which helped the sensex close 1.6% higher at 58,634 points, was also backed by strong gains in the US market on Monday night, traders said. Investors on D-Street are now keenly watching the decision of the RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC), set to be announced on Wednesday morning. Additionally, a segment of market players is turning cautious as foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are continuing to take money out of India. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, Indian markets witnessed a sharp rebound on Tuesday on the back of positive global cues. “Comments from the US stating that the new virus (variant) might be less effective than earlier feared helped elevate global sentiments. Buying was witnessed in banking metals and auto stocks ahead of the RBI meeting on interest rates,” Khemka said. Despite the rebound during the day, which recouped about half of the combined loss the index had recorded on Friday and Monday, the relentless selling is keeping market players cautious. So far in December, FPIs have taken out a net Rs 16,830 crore from the stock market, data from CDSL and BSE showed. This is the highest net monthly outflow from stocks since March 2020, just when the Covid-induced lockdown had led to one of the sharpest selloffs in the history of Indian market. “While markets have seen some relief, the overall volatility is likely to remain for some more time until FPI selling reduces. Investors should await cues from the global central banks for direction on the monetary policy as well as interest rates,” Khemka told MOFSL’s investors. On Tuesday evening, the US market continued to add to its Monday’s gains as most leading indices were up more than 1.5% each. This could help add to sensex’s gains on Wednesday, market players here said. In Tuesday’s market, ICICI Bank, HDFC and HDFC Bank led the gains in the sensex with 29 of its 30 constituents closing higher. Outside of the sensex, BSE’s midcap index closed 1.3% higher while the smallcap index closed 1.1% higher. In the foreign exchange market, activity was relatively steady with the Indian rupee closing flat at 75.44 per dollar. With the RBI policy meet scheduled for Wednesday, there could be volatility in the forex market also, analysts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-rebounds-887-pts-as-omicron-fears-recede/articleshow/88152896.cms||---
---||Business||RBI: Banks can’t put bad loan recovery in income||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to stop including writebacks from recoveries of written-off bad loans as part of their income. From the third quarter, banks will have to adjust these recoveries against provisions for bad loans in their profit & loss statement. While this will not make any difference to the overall net profit that a bank reports, it will make the results more transparent. Although credit growth has been flat for the first half, many banks have reported a big jump in both their interest income as well as in other income. This was because several large corporate accounts that were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) and fully provided for in the past saw recoveries. Some of the large recoveries this year included DHFL and Kingfisher Airlines during the first half of FY22. Many banks that recovered their loans added the interest receivable to interest income and apportioned their claims in respect of the principal amount to other income. This enabled the banks to show better ratios despite there not being much lending activity in the first half. An increase in the interest income pushes up the bank’s average yield on advances. The cost to income ratio also shows an improvement. Besides resolution of default cases, banks also do recoveries by selling their bad loans to asset reconstruction companies for cash. The rest of the financial year is likely to see some large recoveries. Banks have lined up Rs 82,500 crore worth bad loans advanced to 22 companies for sale to the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL). Even if banks were to get a fraction of these advances, it would still add to their bottom line as most of these loans have been fully provided for. Besides recovery from bad loans, bank profits were boosted by treasury income in the earlier quarter as banks sold bonds that were purchased when interest rates were higher. Now with the RBI expected to reduce liquidity in the banking system, bond yields are expected to rise, which will result in a fall in the value of bonds purchased by banks when interest rates are lower. To the extent these bonds are part of the trading portfolio of banks, they will have to make additional provisions. In addition to the two large recoveries from Kingfisher Airlines and DHFL, banks have made recoveries in most of their NPAs in the metals sector thanks to a global commodity supercycle. For instance, in MSP Metallics, SBI got Rs 470 crore which was 50% more than the reserve. Similarly, Canara Bank-led lenders managed to get Rs 531 crore for their loans to Sathavahana Ispat. Although banks are betting on a corporate loan recovery in the second half, so far most corporates have not availed their sanctioned lines of credit. This will put further pressure on bank interest earnings as all lenders are now chasing home loans and reducing interest rates even after the RBI started speaking of normalisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-banks-cant-put-bad-loan-recovery-in-income/articleshow/88152844.cms||Mayur Shetty

He was arrested from his residence at Barhangopal village under Mufassil police station area in Siwan district. It was also revealed during the investigation that Choudhary favoured one of his close relatives, Vikrama Yadav, in getting loan from his bank to purchase a truck for smuggling liquor from Haryana. Police said Choudhary was into liquor business and had licenced shops before the state government enforced prohibition in April 2016. Mairwan police station SHO Sanjeev Kumar said Choudhary’s involvement in liquor smuggling racket surfaced after a truck laden with 1200 litres of IMFL was seized near Dharni Chapar checkpost under his police station area on Uttar Pradesh border on September 23. “The entire consignment was smuggled from Haryana. It was to be supplied to several smaller liquor smugglers in Siwan,” he said. The SHO said the truck was being escorted by a luxury car so that it could be guided to the designated location for unloading the consignment. “Altogether six persons, including Yadav, were arrested from the truck and the luxury car,” he said. The SHO said one more person was arrested later from Siwan town. He said Yadav, in the course of interrogation, confessed to the police that Choudhary had been running the liquor smuggling racket. “He also confessed that Choudhary helped him get a loan from his bank to purchase the truck seized by the police for use in liquor smuggling,” the SHO said and added: “The case was supervised by senior officers before the SP issued his arrest order and he was nabbed on Tuesday.” Kumar said at least 22 criminal cases were registered against Choudhary with different police stations in Siwan. “The cases are related to murder, extortion, illegal arms recovery, scuffle and liquor smuggling,” he said. The SHO said eight of the cases are of illicit liquor smuggling or sale, including five registered in the pre-prohibition era. “One of the illicit liquor smuggling and sales cases dates back to 2003,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/siwan-cooperative-bank-chief-held-for-liquor-smuggling/articleshow/88151125.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The National Company Law Tribunal on Monday admitted the insolvency proceedings and announced a moratorium in terms of the bankruptcy code. RCap had been classified as a defaulter by credit rating agencies two years ago and a resolution process initiated by the debenture trustee has been dragging on, hampered by litigation from creditors to group companies. In a letter dated December 2, 2021, Yes Bank informed the RBI that it had dues of Rs 1,417 crore. This was a principal amount of Rs 987 crore invested in the company’s debentures and Rs 430 crore as interest, which prompted the central bank to act. In its letter, Yes Bank submitted the report of RBI’s Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) as on November 29, 2021, demonstrating that its exposure to RCap was classified as ‘doubtful’. Doubtful assets are those that have been classified as a non-performing asset (NPA) for more than 12 months, in accordance with the RBI’s norms on bad loans. Yes Bank had earlier acquired Reliance’s headquarters for Rs 1,200 crore, which was used to settle dues of Reliance Infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rel-caps-default-to-yes-bank-triggered-insolvency-process/articleshow/88152829.cms||---

However, vacancies were up nearly 30% year-on-year. Job portals and headhunters TOI spoke to said that there was a cautious optimism across verticals this month as pre-festive season hiring was very robust this year. Given the buoyancy in hiring action witnessed over the last few quarters, the drop in volume in November is “a blip in the radar”, they said. Active job openings in November at around 295,000 were 8% lower compared to 320,000 jobs in October but around 10% higher than the same month last year, specialist staffing firm Xpheno’s data showed. “While the threat of a third wave is real, it’s too early to call out a hiring impact at this point,” Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, said. “The short-term volatility witnessed in the trading markets and year-end season for the IT sector seems to have impacted hiring volume and velocity, but this is to be seen as a minor correction,” he added. Anshul Lodha, head of Page Executive, India, said hiring in November was around 40% up year-on-year, but almost on a par with October. “The sudden new variant has shown concern in the market, which is likely to impact the job market in the coming months like December,” he said. However, fresher hiring is on an all-time high. Professional services firm Aon’s Fresher Hiring Index in November notes a 161% rise in requirements as compared to November 2020. “Fresher hiring is going through a once in a decade phase with most companies increasing their digitisation plan and thus increasing the demand side for freshers extensively,” an Aon spokesperson said. Job portal Naukri.com’s monthly JobSpeak index recorded a 26% year-on-year growth in November at 2,173 vs. 1,727 in November 2020. However it was still lower than October’s score of 2,523 and the lowest for 2021 since the second wave (April-May). While the tech sector, especially startups, continue to lead hiring velocity, manufacturing and consumer goods are seeing green shoots, while sectors like banking and financial services, infrastructure/real estate continue to lag. “The year-on-year analysis of talent demand showed that the consumer-led sectors such as consumer durables/FMCG and retail posted strong growth in talent intake. This was fuelled by festive buying and reopening of offices and retail hubs too,” Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs and TechGig said. TimesJobs’ RecruiteX index showed that while FMCG recorded the highest year-on-year growth at 18%, IT/Telecom followed at 12%. While seasonally December has been low on hiring and operational activity for India Inc, the next few weeks will be crucial to determine if the fears of new variant and rising Covid are going to have a lasting impact on the job market, experts said “Currently, most enterprises are in a wait-and-watch mode and we are not hearing of any sudden repercussions. The next 2-3 weeks will give more clarity; most [clients] are moving ahead with plans already made for the October-December quarter,” Deval Singh, business head (telecom, IT& ITes), TeamLease Services, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hiring-slows-in-nov-after-pre-festive-season-rush/articleshow/88152410.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The minister said though no Omicron case was detected in the state so far, the health department has initiated several measures to keep the new Covid variant at bay. “Our focus is on equipping ICUs with all life support systems. “Continuous monitoring of doctors and medical staff in all hospitals will be ensured so that serious patients are treated at the nearest health facility,” the minister added. He said the government has succeeded in making all the hospitals and medical colleges self-dependent as far as oxygen generation for medical purpose is concerned. “The government recently appointed about 3,000 doctors of different branches to treat patients at different health facilities in the state, including primary health centres,” he added. During the second wave of Covid, hospitals in the state had faced a serious oxygen crisis. It prompted the government to install oxygen generation plants at different places. After the emergence of Omicron, the health department asked all the government hospitals, including medical colleges, to rearrange their Covid wards with sufficient number of beds and other facilities. Pandey said, “We cannot stop viruses from coming to our state. However, we can surely do our best to check its spread by testing and tracking people.” Referring to the genome sequencing lab recently set up at IGIMS, the minister said it would facilitate early confirmation of the virus strain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/number-of-icu-beds-to-be-increased-in-all-hospitals-says-health-minister/articleshow/88151288.cms||VK Tripathi

The minister said the health department has initiated several steps to make the pulse polio national immunization campaign from January 23 to 27 a success in the state. Pandey said since January 26 would be celebrated as Republic Day, the campaign can be extended by one day at the local level as per convenience. “The drive will be conducted by following Covid safety protocols. Efforts will be made to achieve 100% coverage during the campaign. In 2020, 84 polio patients were found in Pakistan and 56 in Afghanistan. In 2021, one patient each has been confirmed in both the countries,” he said. The minister added it was necessary to carry out high quality pulse polio campaign to prevent infection. “All the district magistrates have been asked to meet the district task force 10 days before the start of the campaign to review the preparations and take appropriate action to maintain the quality of work. At block level, BDOs and CDPOs have been asked to ensure availability of anti-polio vaccine in sufficient quantity,” Pandey said. He added focus would be on newborns. “Trained vaccinators will be deployed at bus stands, railway stations and square-intersections,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pulse-polio-drive-from-jan-23-to-27-minister/articleshow/88151332.cms||Faryal Rumi

According to them, with the relaxations in Covid-19 guidelines, schools have already started functioning in offline mode and children have started visiting marketplaces and recreation centres along with their parents, increasing the risk of infection as they have not yet been vaccinated, they said. AIIMS-Patna Covid in-charge, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said though there is no clear evidence so far to indicate that Omicron is more dangerous for children, they are certainly at greater risk as they are still unprotected. The Omicron has not yet made its mark in Bihar, but it may appear here at any moment. The functioning of primary schools must be restricted as soon as some cases of the new variant are reported, he said. Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said initial reports from South Africa showed the super mutant variant of Omicron has been increasing hospitalisations among children under five years of age. However, the infection so far has been mild in nature. As the nature of its virulence is still being investigated by the experts, one can’t say anything about it with certainty. The best way to protect children from this infection would be to reinforce the Covid protocols with all strictness and start vaccinating children, if sufficient doses are available, he added. Another pediatrician, Dr Vivekanand, observed that children are certainly vulnerable to this new variant because of its greater transmissibility. He said Omicron is likely to infect children like flu and, hence, parents would have to take proper care to protect their children from infection. Adults must follow the Covid protocols sincerely and teach their children to maintain basic hygiene by regularly washing hands and avoiding crowded places. Besides, children should be administered sufficient doses of multivitamin and vitamin D to strengthen their immunity, he said. Dr Satish Kumar of the medicine department at Nalanda Medical College Hospital said children are the most vulnerable population as far as the Omicron variant is concerned. They have not yet been vaccinated and most of them were not infected with Coronavirus in the last two waves. Parents at home and teachers in schools need to take utmost care that children do follow the Covid-19 protocols. If there is an increase in the number of people getting infected with the new variant, schools must be closed and classes should be held only in online mode, he said. Gynaecologist Dr Punam Raman opined that all the adults must be vaccinated with both the mandatory doses as soon as possible to ward off the threat of the new variant. The risk in children can be mitigated by following the public health measures already recommended by health authorities, like- maintaining hand hygiene, masking and maintaining safe distance and keeping off crowded places, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-kids-more-susceptible-need-protection-from-omicron/articleshow/88151300.cms||B K Mishra

The JD(U), during its Samata Party days, had won two and one assembly seats in Manipur in the 1995 and 2000 polls, respectively. Samata Party’s Radhabinod Koijam was even the Manipur chief minister for a short tenure in February, 2001. His government, however, fell in May the same year. The JD(U) has no MLA in the entire northeast region, except the one in Arunachal Pradesh. The party had won seven of the 15 seats it contested in the 2019 Arunachal Pradesh assembly elections to emerge as the second-largest party after the BJP, which had bagged 41 seats. However, its six MLAs switched over to the BJP in December, 2020. Earlier, in June 2019, the JD(U)’s lone MLA in Nagaland, G Kaito Aye, joined the ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP). “In such a scenario, the Manipur election is crucial for JD(U). We are striving hard to revive the party in the northeastern states in order to become a national party,” Taithul said. JD(U) national general secretary and party in-charge for northeastern states, Afaque Ahmad Khan, and its North East Executive Council chairperson, N S N Lotha, visited Manipur on November 17 to review the party’s preparations for the proposed rally on December 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-to-hold-rally-in-manipur-on-dec-18/articleshow/88151166.cms||Madan Kumar

The “Waste-wise cities: Best practices in municipal solid waste management” report of NITI Aayog showcased best practices in 10 different thematic areas of waste management of 28 cities/towns, including Bobbili. Bobbili has been featured in the report as one of the three cities having best biodegradable waste management systems in the country. According to the publication, the synergy between a biogas plant, and home composting, windrow composting and vermicomposting, helps the town process 100 per cent of its biodegradable waste. There has been a ban on plastic bags and pouches in the town for more than 10 years now. Speaking to TOI, commissioner, Bobbili municipality, S Srinivasa Rao, said the combination of biogas plant and composting through various modalities have helped the town achieve 100% processing of its biodegradable waste. “Even when it comes to dry waste, it is properly segregated. The recyclables and reusable materials from the dry waste are extracted and sold. Apart from the municipality’s efforts, the citizens of the town extended their full efforts towards all the initiatives,” said Srinivasa Rao. Bobbili used to be a garbage-littered town and a hub of water- and vector-borne diseases about a decade ago. But things took a turn for the better with the state government framing solid waste management rules in 2010.  An information, education and communication (IEC) programme was recognised as a key tool to achieve this objective. But before educating the general public, the staff of the municipality trained themselves about the benefits of source segregation. Within no time, the municipality had a working model to handle various types of waste. The drive received financial aid to procure garbage collection vehicles from the 12th Finance Commission grants. A route map was developed to cover every house under door-to-door segregated garbage collection initiative. The town took several steps to eliminate the use of plastic bottles and sachets. The city generates about 7.4 tonnes of biodegradable waste a day. This is pulverised through shredding and volume reduction before being fed into composting units. The municipality also encourages home composting and handholds interested households on proper techniques and other information. Today, Bobbili is one of the top 10 municipalities in the country in terms of rate of waste processing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/bobbili-shows-the-way-to-waste-mgmt/articleshow/88151632.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

According to the researchers, these materials offer a greater advantage over conventional and non-biodegradable packing materials. This would also enhance the functional properties of foods such as bio-availability, taste, and enhancing the shelf-life. The group of interdisciplinary researchers, led by Dr T Jagan Mohan Rao, assistant professor, department of biotechnology, NIT Andhra Pradesh, published the research in the peer-reviewed ‘Journal of European Food research and Technology’. The article was co-authored by Dr Punuri Jayasekhar Babu, assistant professor, biomaterials and bioengineering research laboratory, department of biotechnology, Pachhunga University College, Mizoram University and Akriti Tirkey, a PhD candidate at Mizoram University. Dr Rao said the research emphasised the role of nanoparticles to provide mechanical stability to packing material. “This also shows how nano-sensors can be developed to detect pathogens, contamination, pesticides, and allergens. Nanoparticle-based material enhances antimicrobial properties of packing material to prevent food spoilage and contamination. The research also touched upon food safety aspects related to nanomaterials and follows eco–friendly practices,” said Dr Rao. The research also discussed the role of government agencies in addressing safety issues, bringing the legislation and regulations on the use and application of nanomaterials. “It highlights how bio-based polymers can be blended with nanoparticles to make more efficient and effective packing materials. The researchers explained how confidence can be built among consumers by maintaining transparency in evaluating the effects of nanoparticles on humans and the environment. They also discussed how researchers and industries should develop products that can easily get public acceptance. If safety and security issues are addressed, nanotechnology can revolutionise the food processing and packaging industry to a great extent and minimise food wastage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/nit-ap-team-shows-how-nanoparticles-can-be-used-in-food-packaging-material/articleshow/88151646.cms||---

The man returned to Umilada village in Santhabommali mandal to attend his daughter’s wedding on December 9. His travel history shows that he flew to London from South Africa, and then to Mumbai where he tested Covid-19 negative. He was in home isolation for 10 to 12 days in Mumbai before travelling to Vizag on November 23. He took a car fromVizag to reach Umilada. He gave another sample for testing on December 5 at a primary health centre. District medical officials rubbished rumours of an Omicron case at Santhabommali and said the sample was being sent to Hyderabad to rule out doubts about the Omicron variant. Tehsildar of Santabommali mandal, Adi Babu, told TOI that the man had only tested Covid-19 positive and refuted claims that it was an Omicron case. “The person came to attend his daughter’s wedding to be held on December 9. After testing positive today, we identified 24 primary and secondary contacts, and have sent them to get tested. All of them are in home isolation now,” Adi Babu said. He added that authorities have asked the man to postpone his daughter’s wedding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/sample-of-omicron-suspect-sent-for-test/articleshow/88151661.cms||Siva G

The kids were identified as Manukonda Santosh, Eede Venkatesh Goud, Kaluvakonda Venkatesh alias Cherry and Kaluvakonda Prabhudeva — residents of Rajeev Gurhakalpa colony. According to Mangalagiri town police, three children were studying in fifth standard in MTMC Upper Primary School in New Bank Colony while one of them is pursuing education privately in the same area. The incident happened on Monday evening when the four kids snuck out of the school for a few minutes without taking permission and returned around 4 pm. Upon learning the incident, their class teacher reprimanded the students and informed the incident to the principal who asked them to bring their parents. Fearing they would be punished by their parents, they decided to leave for their relatives’ place in Chirala while leaving their school bags at school. Hours later, the parents approached the school and said their children did not return home and found the school bags in the classroom. Cops formed a team to trace the whereabouts of the students. After news reports surfaced on Tuesday, cops received information about the kids being in Chirala and soon picked them up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/4-kids-who-ran-away-from-school-traced/articleshow/88151651.cms||---

Addressing the media, Veerraju said he never worked for position or power as he was always committed to the party. Veerraju challenged the YSRC to come forward for a debate on development instead of levelling allegations. “I strongly condemn the YSRC leader’s allegation on Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s speech in Parliament on the Annamayya project. He read out the speech given by our MPs Sujana Chowdary and CM Ramesh. Shekhawat knows what happened to the Annamayya project during the recent floods. Instead of taking precautionary measures, the state government is criticising the Union minister and BJP MPs.” Veerraju alleged the state government is spreading false propaganda against the Centre by claiming that the latter doesn’t provide funds for the Polavaram project. “If the state government cannot construct Polavaram, I would recommend handing it over to the Centre,” he added.  He opposed the privatisation of cooperative dairy farms and sugar factories in the state and said the Left and TDP failed to question the YSRC’s ‘anti-people’ policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/will-quit-politics-after-24-polls-bjp-state-chief/articleshow/88151681.cms||Venu Lanka

He noted that the recent weather trends have drastically affected lives and well-being. He said the situation, particularly in India, including the Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is deteriorating due to rising temperatures. “This is a dangerous phenomena, which require deeper studies and immediate course correction,” said Sarath Chandra, a researcher at department of climate change at IIT, Hyderabad. He said they have also noticed new kinds of health effects that are triggered by climate change. Adding that communicable and non-communicable diseases are worsening as a result of climate change and rising temperatures, he said, “The phenomenon of rising temperatures is acting like a slow poison on human beings. It is making it difficult to eat, move, sleep, concentrate, reproduce, affecting mental health,” said Sarath Chandra. The researcher added that countries in the tropics such as India have summers that are much longer than elsewhere and with high temperatures even up to October and November. He analysed that warmer nights are affecting sleep and a prolonged sleep deficit is harmful to human health in the long run. Sleep disorders might also result in diseases like Alzheimer’s, mental disorders, extreme anxieties, depression, impulsive behaviour, bipolar disorders, said the researcher. Rising temperatures are also found to be causing health disorders such as kidney, respiratory, skin and other chronic ailments. Sarath Chandra said extreme hot and humid conditions are known to clinically impact the production of several chemicals and hormones in the body, especially melatonin, dopamine, endorphins and also impact the production of hormones responsible for human reproduction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/extreme-weather-events-can-impact-public-health/articleshow/88151767.cms||Samdani MN

In an interview with TOI, the bank’s MD & CEO, C V R Rajendran speaks of how the new promoter shareholding norms are beneficial to the bank. The RBI has revised rules for promoter shareholding. How is the bank going to respond to that?Our shareholders are long-term investors and they would like to hold on to their 51% stake as long as possible and increase it if allowed. Originally, when they got permission from the RBI, the stipulation was that promoters cannot dilute below 51% for the first five years. The second time there was a requirement that the stake needs to be diluted to 40% by the year 2024 — five years after the investment. Then the promoters were required to reduce to 30% in 10 years and 15% after 15 years. The new rules allow promoters to hold 26% forever and the in-between milestones have been removed. Does this throw open opportunities to grow from M&A?We have not explored the possibility of acquiring NBFCs or fintech companies. Not that we are not open to the idea it is just that the valuations are high. We are always open to merger opportunities. The few proposals which came up were not attractive enough. Have you slowed branch expansion to look at acquisition opportunities?No. That is related to geographies. We have decided to go slow in the north because traction is a little slower than in the southern states. In Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the pick up in business are much faster. We have promised our investors that branches will break even in the first year and we are able to do that in the south, where we are opening branches. During the current year, we have opened 50 branches and another 40-50 branches will be opened. What is your strategy on the lending side? Do you plan to increase your corporate loan book?We have a relatively small balance sheet and can target only small and medium corporates. When it comes to large corporates, we will not get a seat on the consortium table so we do not focus on these accounts as a policy. We are finding good demand for mid corporates and small & medium enterprises. In theory, we can go up to Rs 400 crore but we do not do such large loans. Normally our entry level for a corporate is capped at Rs 100 crore with the limits increased based on client experience. We are doing well in lending to food processing, infra we have slowed down a bit for state government-funded projects unless there are pre-funded projects. You had seen some defaults in gold during the pandemic. Do you see auctions continuing…We do not want to position ourselves as a bank that will sell jewellery in a hurry. An auction is the last resort. Last week, we announced Rs 280-crore worth of auctions but what was sold was just Rs 10 crore worth of gold as for the remaining accounts customers have made part payments or agreed to pay. Are you on target to reducing NPAs? How are the loan recoveries shaping up?We are on track to bring down our NPAs to below 1% by the end of the current financial year. Courts are not functioning yet. We have two debt recovery tribunals in Kerala and both do not have a person in charge. As a result, no action is taking place under SARFESI. But we are able to affect recoveries through negotiation. Do you see deposit rates going up? What about lending rates?Some banks are raising deposit rates. Perhaps they have taken a long-term view and decided to accumulate deposits when rates are low. We have not raised rates and in fact, reduced our bulk deposits. Lending as of now is very competitive and double B clients are taken at 7-5.5%. Now excess liquidity is chasing the loan market. We are small players and we are allowing clients to leave at low prices. Will the normalisation lead to an increase in yield on advances?We have already told analysts that 5.22% is not a net interest margin that we will be able to maintain. Our guidance was 4.5% for three more quarters to come. Has the bank arrived at a settlement with the unions?We have given them an offer but the unions have not come to the table. They have made some demands; we have made our demands. What they have said is that we have to agree to all their demands and they have not accepted any of ours. This is not acceptable. Our banking business is not affected. Now only 15% of customers are coming to the branch. We went to the court to get a stay order from our staff being prevented to open branches but last time we could not open a few of them. This time we are hopeful of keeping all branches working. What do you expect from the policy?My desire is that the RBI reduces the liquidity in the system. That is not an expectation but a desire. The excess liquidity spoils the business for banks as risk-based pricing does not take place and lower-rated borrowers are raising funds at 7-8%.

---||Goa||Goa: Court denies bail to accused, says land grab mystery must be probed||MARGAO: In a significant development in the land grab case registered by Fatorda police, the court of the additional sessions judge, Margao, has rejected the anticipatory bail application filed by one of 17 accused, Fransisco Colaco, a resident of Davorlim. Pronouncing his order in the open court, additional sessions judge P M Shinde ruled that, prima facie, the applicant’s custodial interrogation was required with respect to “fraudulent mutations of survey holdings” in the case. “His custodial interrogation is also required for another reason, to recover the alleged purported deed of sale on which basis the mutations were carried out. There is a mystery in the present crime which has to be investigated thoroughly and for that purpose the custodial interrogation of the applicant accused is very much required by the police,” the order reads. Colaco, along with 17 others, have been charged under Sections 465, 468, 471, 420 of the Indian Penal Code by Fatorda police based on a complaint lodged by the Salcete mamlatdar, to the effect that the applicant along with other accused persons since January 2018 to May 2020, forged title documents i.e. deed of succession, deed of sale, tenancy purchase certificate, deed of family partition and used them as genuine and produced them before the mamlatdar, Salcete, in mutation proceedings and got their names included in Form XIV of the properties in question. They, thus, got the names of the original occupants/owners deleted, and when legal heirs of the occupants/owners asked for the information under RTI in the office of the mamlatdar, the 12 relevant files of mutations were found missing. It was the case of the prosecution that the original succession deed used for mutation proceedings was yet to be recovered “which can only be recovered from the applicant”. The prosecution submitted that “the mutation entry has been certified hurriedly within 23 days which otherwise would take ages to complete, hence it can also be concluded that some government officials might also be involved in the present crime”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/court-denies-bail-to-accused-says-land-grab-mystery-must-be-probed/articleshow/88153437.cms||---

The victim also reiterated the same contention in her affidavit and pleaded for the man’s immediate release. The case involved Amreli resident Nareshbhai Chudasama, who is in his early 20s. He had eloped with a 15-year-old girl in 2018. Chudasama was first booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act with Vadhvan police station in Surendranagar. When cops traced the couple, the girl refused to go with her father and was sent to a women’s shelter home in Rajkot. The couple managed to unite once again and escaped from the place. The girl’s father lodged another complaint with Dholera police in Ahmedabad district under Pocso and IPC charges. Nearly three years later, Chudasama was arrested by Dholera police and sent to judicial custody. After the police filed a chargesheet against him, Chudasama applied for regular bail and was heard by a special Pocso judge at Mirzapur rural court. He claimed innocence and submitted that when the girl turned 18 years old, they got their marriage registered with a sub-registrar on June 14, 2021. His advocate argued further, “After the marriage, the couple began living together as husband and wife. If the accused is kept in jail for long, the victim in this case would only suffer because she is living at the accused’s home as his wife.” The prosecution and the victim’s father vehemently opposed the bail plea. However, the victim filed an affidavit and pleaded for the accused’s immediate release. She stated that they had been in love for a long time and she had wanted to marry him. “When she turned adult, they tied the knot and got their marriage registered. She is now living at the accused’s home with his family. If her husband is made to languish in jail for long, she will have to face the difficulties,” she stated in the affidavit. After hearing the case, special judge T K Rana granted bail to Chudasama on various conditions like he would regularly attend court proceedings and would not try to influence witnesses.

The incident occurred when the police were trying to stop Yadav and his supporters from entering the venue of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s public meeting at Baba Kinaram Inter College ground in Ramgarh area of Sakaldiha on Sunday. SP Chandauli Ankur Agrawal, on Monday, said that despite the high security for the CM’s event, the SP leaders and workers tried to march toward the meeting venue without any prior permission to give a memorandum containing issues like problems being faced by farmers in procurement of fertilizer, paddy purchase and pathetic condition of roads. Police tried to stop them about 8 km away from the venue and requested to submit their memorandum, said Agrawal adding that instead of giving memorandum they tried to move forward and when police tried to stop them they indulged in scuffle with cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/sp-mla-over-150-supporters-booked-for-assaulting-cops/articleshow/88152108.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cops kick off gender sensitization training for drivers||Kolkata:Kolkata Police on Tuesday sensitised 50-odd auto drivers on the ‘do’s and don’ts’ while dealing with passengers, especially on how to behave with female passengers Reported by TOI earlier in its Monday edition, the city police kicked off its ambitious “This Car Respects Women,” a gender sensitization programme that will run for three months and aims to train 12,500 drivers of app cabs, taxis, autos and buses. The training module will address sexual harassment and violence against women and try to teach the drivers how to behave with female passengers properly. Speaking on the occasion after inaugurating the programme, police commissioner Soumen Mitra recalled how Kolkata has earned the tag of being a “friendly city” and reminded the drivers how they often ended up as the first contact person for any person arriving from outside to the city. “I have traveled in enough buses, autos and taxis in this city to see how drivers went out of their way to make our didis, masimas and pishimas comfortable. They even guided them to the addresses that outsiders are not acquainted with. It is this attitude - of treating female passengers as part of the larger family - which we want to inculcate. The Nirbhaya incident was a shocking incident whose impact was felt across the country, even in this city. A number of programmes were designed to stop a repeat of the horrific act. This project is one such effort to make the city even better and safer. I hope what you learn here will be implemented on the road but taken back to your homes and families,” Mitra said. Firoz Ahmed, an auto driver on the Park Circus-Gariahat route for the last 20 years said he has attended such programmes whenever he gets a chance. “It helps to improve the philosophy of life and lead an improved lifestyle. There are times when we do get a bit agitated due to a number of circumstances. Our language then becomes suspect. This training will help us cope with those situations,” said Ahmed. Soumitra Ghosh, plying on the Kasba-Gariahat route for the past two years, said he got information about this workshop from his union and enrolled immediately. “I would love to see such workshops take place on the ground too. In that way, even passengers can be made active participants. Also, ideally, these are tips not only for us but anyone in the public sphere. The more it gets noticed and accepted, the better it will be,” he said. “Always behave well, try to help the passenger reach her destination, even if she is not familiar with it. Always ensure you use parliamentary language. Even if you do not agree with female passengers, don’t pass any quick judgment. Body language should not be intimidating. Listen to and be aware of how the female passengers communicate with you. Understand if she is seeking any help,” the leaflet on the programme stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-kick-off-gender-sensitization-training-for-drivers/articleshow/88152119.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Various associations of MKU staffs gathered under a banner on Tuesday and held a meeting to assess the situation and urge the university authorities to ensure payment as soon as possible. The staffs had written a signed letter to the registrar (in-charge) of MKU on Monday stating that they were shocked to see that salaries and pensions were not paid for November yet. “For 55 years, the university has always paid salaries and pensions without any delay. Many of the pensioners are retired vice-chancellors, registrars, controllers of examination, academic council, senate and synidicate members, eminent scientists etc., who have worked for the welfare of the university. Hence, we urge for efforts to be taken for payment of salaries and pensions to staff and pensioners at the earliest,” they said in the letter. A teaching faculty who did not want to be named said that around Rs 5 crore is needed for payment of pensions alone every month. “Many old universities like MKU are facing pension liability and are unable to bear the cost of pensions. If the state government can provide the pension contribution just like in case of a government job, it will lessen the burden,” he added. On Tuesday, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan also shared a post on Twitter and urged for intervention by chief minister M K Stalin to ensure the payment of salaries and pensions at the earliest. Meanwhile, university sources said that efforts are being taken to ensure payment of salaries and pensions by Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mku-yet-to-pay-nov-salary-pension-due-to-financial-crisis/articleshow/88152780.cms||---

Ravi Pardhi, 38, had visited Kapil Nagar police station to lodge complaint against his family members who had allegedly thrashed him. He reportedly collapsed while waiting at the police station. The cops had rushed him to Mayo hospital where doctors declared him dead. Police said Pardhi had allegedly manhandled his mother at their residence near Joshi garden. He was subsequently thrashed by others in the family. As Pardhi reached the police station, his family members followed him to lodge a counter-complaint. While the cops at the police station had asked Pardhi to sit outside, he collapsed to the ground. Cops said police station CCTV footage showed Pardhi in some kind of uneasiness before collapsing and he was heavily sweating. “We are treating the case as a deemed custodial death and have asked state CID to take up the probe,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cid-to-probe-mans-death-in-police-station/articleshow/88152096.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Omicron will eliminate more dangerous Delta: Rajasthan food minister||JAIPUR: Food minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas has mooted a new theory on the origin of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. Responding to a question after the informal cabinet meeting on Tuesday on the Congress rally to be held on December 12 in Jaipur amid the threat of a new variant, he said, “This new variant Omicron has come to kill the old dangerous variant Delta. So Omicron is not as dangerous as Delta.” Though he added that this was his personal view saying, “I don’t understand much of this.” Khachariyawas added, “I believe that Omicron is not that powerful. Strange as it may sound, but Delta is more dangerous. I myself have become a victim of corona in the first wave, but the second wave was more deadly. Yet we have to fear Omicron. As far as the rally is concerned, he said Covid guidelines had to be followed for the rally. He said, “We have to keep in mind that running life is also very important. After Corona, there is crisis of livelihood and hunger. We have to fight against hunger too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/omicorn-will-eliminate-more-dangerous-delta/articleshow/88152803.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata doctors back kid vaccines as shield against new Covid strain||KOLKATA: Amid reports of many children getting infected by the Omicron variant in South Africa, Kolkata doctors said it was time to extend the vaccine protection to children as soon as possible. While a section of health experts felt Omicron could pose a bigger threat to unvaccinated paediatric population, another section said we needed more data to come to a conclusion. But all agreed that the inoculation drive must be extended to children at the earliest. “Since Omicron is known to have higher transmissibility, it could infect more children. But two things — innate and trained immunity — specific to children because of various vaccines for routine immunisation provide them a certain level of protection against Covid,” said Mihir Sarkar, professor of paediatrics at the Medical College Hospital, Kolkata. Sarkar pointed out even the more virulent Delta variant did not cause severe disease in children generally and hence he was hopeful that even if more children come under the grip of Omicron, they will have only mild disease. “But then, another concern is MIS-C a condition, which affects a certain percentage of children post Covid infection even if they had only mild symptoms or were asymptomatic. Some children get really severe MIS-C. So, we need all kinds of protection ring around them,” said Sarkar. Institute of Child Health (ICH) associate professor of paediatrics Prabhas Prasun Giri, however, felt it was too early to say whether children would be more vulnerable to Omicon. “Vulnerability of children to Covid is unlikely to change due to a change of strain of the virus. Still it is better to vaccinate the paediatric population at the earliest. Vaccinating them is also significant for attaining herd immunity,” said Giri. Some western countries have already vaccinated or are vaccinating kids. In India, the Union health ministry is yet to roll out the jabs for children even as one vaccine has already got emergency use authorisation (EUA) while another one has been recommended for EUA by the expert committee. “Children above 12 years are vaccinated in European nations. On the face such emerging variants, we need to provide our children the vaccine protection, especially in the wake of reopening of schools,” said ICH consultant paediatrician Agnimita Giri Sarkar. “The fact that this variant is causing infection among a large number of children in South Africa is a matter of concern, despite the fact about it causing milder disease. I have two school children and I want them to get the vaccine protection at the earliest,” said paediatrician Sumita Saha of Fortis Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/docs-back-kid-vaccines-as-shield-against-new-strain/articleshow/88152100.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

During the hearing of a contempt of court application over poor road conditions, traffic problems and the stray cattle menace, when the court began raising questions, AMC conceded that it could not focus much on these issues because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its counsel submitted that for most part of the year, most of the civic body’s staff were engaged in dealing with the pandemic situation and a large part of its budget was also spent on this. The bench of Justice A J Desai and Justice S J Dave asked the civic body to furnish details about the roads when the petitioner’s advocate, Amit Panchal, argued that though the AMC claimed to have repaired more than 500km of city roads in the last three years, it had not supplied any details showing which stretches were repaired so that the claims co. The lawyer also said that the civic body’s claim that none of the roads that were built recently and are under warranty were damaged in the last monsoon is false. The HC also ordered the AMC to inform the court about what action it has taken to resolve traffic snarls after the city police tendered a voluminous 811-page affidavit that included a report from the Central Road Research Institute, New Delhi. The judges appeared dissatisfied with the promises that the AMC made during the last hearing, about putting an end to haphazard parking under the metro route. The judges asked about parking along the metro route, and the authorities assured the court that the problem would be taken care of. On Tuesday, Justice Desai reminded the authorities about the parking issue and said that despite their assurances, there has been no change. He also said that driving on these roads is difficult because a very small area is left for driving because of parked vehicles. The court also pointed out encroachments under flyovers and asked which authorities are responsible for managing stretches where flyovers have been built. As the petitioner complained about persistent stray cattle on public streets and half-hearted efforts to bring about a permanent solution to the problem, the high court directed the state government to file an affidavit showing all communications after 2017, when the AMC began requesting the government to enact a legislation for urban areas to restrain the movement of cattle. The court posted a further hearing on these issues on December 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-to-amc-which-roads-were-repaired-in-3-years/articleshow/88152793.cms||---

The semester exam was conducted online earlier this week. The university had announced its results within a few hours of the exam. During inquiry, VNSGU officials found that the students with more marks had logged in twice due to which marks were added twice to their ID. “These students logged in once but due to some technical issue they could not appear in the exam. They then approached the varsity and we allowed them to log in again due to which this issue was created,” said a varsity official. Meanwhile, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) submitted a memorandum to the university demanding action against the agency that is conducting the online exam. NSUI leaders alleged that the agency has been assigned the work to conduct online exam without tendering. “Total 60,000 students are appearing in the online exam and this time, due to the new model, we are able to announce the results within hours after the exam was over. We have rectified the error and steps are taken so that it is not repeated,” the official added. Against the total 50 marks question paper, these students received 60 to 75 marks. According to VNSGU, if a student logs in twice on getting 30 marks, he or she will get the marks twice, thus totalling to 60. Recently C R Paatil too appreciated the VNSGU for announcing the results of the online exam within hours of the exam was over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ten-vnsgu-students-get-more-than-total-marks/articleshow/88151371.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Online hotel booking service fined for denying accommodation||Shariq.Majeed@timesgroup.com Ludhiana: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered an online Hotels and Homes Service (Oyo rooms) to pay Rs 25,000 to a customer for acute deficiency of service for alleged denial of rooms booked and prepaid by him. The commission, comprising president K K Kareer and member Jaswinder Singh also ordered the company to refund Rs 25,506 to the customer, Dr Kulwant Singh of Guru Nanak Colony in Ludhiana. The complainant said that he, along with his fellow doctors, intended to visit Nainital during summer vacation, for which he booked four rooms in a hotel from the website of the opposite party on June 7, 2017. The complainant paid Rs 42,200 for booking of four rooms from his bank account. As per the booking confirmation by the opposite party, the complainant and his friends were to check-in on the afternoon of June 10 and check-out on June 13, 2017 at about 11am. The complainant received the confirmation of booking through a whatsapp message on his mobile number. When the complainant, his family and friends reached the hotel concerned at Mallital (Nainital) at about 8pm and showed the booking confirmation to staff on duty, the staff refused to acknowledge any booking. The complainant contacted the opposite parties and complained about non-availability of rooms but were refused any help, due to which the group had to face inconvenience, harassment and humiliation. The complainant had to stay at another hotel after paying much higher tariff. When the complainant requested the opposite party for refund of the booking amount, they only refunded Rs 14,494. It was alleged that this amounts to deficiency of service and unfair trade practice on the part of the respondents. The complainant got a legal notice served dated September 19, 2017 through his counsel but to no avail. In his complaint, he requested that the opposite parties be directed to refund the balance amount of Rs 25,506, along with Rs 60,000 compensation. The respondent however claimed that on June 7, 2007, the complainant booked four rooms for four persons through their platform using his account and mobile number of his friend Sukhmander Singh in Nainital. The complainant paid Rs 42,200 for the booking, which was confirmed through SMS by them. According to respondents, the booking was only for four persons instead of four families or 16 persons, as alleged by the complainant. Even in the confirmation message, it was specifically mentioned that the booking of four rooms was for four guests. Accordingly, the complainant was refused room accommodation for four families aggregating to 16 persons. Due to peak season, there was no refund policy applicable, but as a goodwill gesture, they refunded one night tariff. Can be added as box: The commission after considering contention raised by counsel for opposite parties held that no doubt in the whatsapp message sent by them, it is mentioned that the booking has been made in respect of four rooms from June 10 to June 13, 2017 for four guests, but it is totally unthinkable that there could be a restriction of stay of just one person in one room. In the event of stay of more than two persons is required, especially in the case of kids accompanying the couple/parents, the hotel usually charges extra for an extra bed for the additional person/child staying in the room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/online-hotel-booking-service-fined-for-denying-accommodation/articleshow/88151271.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot blames Amit Shah for trying to topple his govt||Jaipur: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot blamed Union minister Amit Shah for the political crisis of last year claiming that, “Rajasthan made history by failing their efforts to topple the opposition-ruled state governments which helped to save the democracy in the country.” He was responding to Shah’s statement during his recent Jaipur visit that the BJP will not destabilise the state government. The chief minister while talking to media after having consultation with ministers and party office bearers at the PCC on Tuesday retorted, “Is it in his hands? They tried it, but failed. Their own MLAs did not support them. Two planes were sent to Jaipur to shift BJP MLAs out of the state but only one could take off. The second plane flew empty,” he said. Gehlot alleged that the conspiracy of toppling his government was hatched in the office of Amit Shah and at the residence of Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Delhi. He said the Congress government got the support of people, MLAs from all sections and therefore his government was saved. He alleged that the home minister and other Union ministers in the NDA government were involved in the conspiracy of toppling the state government. Without naming, Gehlot said the voice of one of the Union ministers from Rajasthan was already there in the audio tape. “But he lodged a case against OSD to chief minister Lokesh Sharma in Delhi. He is also an accused in the multi-state co-operative scam. Look at their thinking. How (he) has become a Union minister,” the CM said without naming Shekhawat. “He should give voice sample, but he tries to find a ways to evade. The voice sample will make things clear. He will be exposed in which manner he was there in the conspiracy (to topple the government),” he said. Lokesh Sharma appeared before the Delhi police’s crime branch on Monday in connection with the case lodged on Shekhawat’s complaint. Gehlot also accused Shah of misleading the people during his Jaipur visit. He said the allegations levelled by Shah on the Congress government in the state in his speech were baseless. He claimed that the Congress’ anti-inflation mega rally in Jaipur on December 12 will be historic which will herald the beginning of the downfall of the NDA government at the Centre and the repeat of the Congress government in Rajasthan, breaking the jinx of alternating governments every five years in the state. He said the Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi after careful consideration have shifted the rally from Delhi to Jaipur and there is tremendous response from the people. He alleged that women and people are worried as prices of even essential items have been sky-rocketing due to the wrong policies of the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gehlot-blames-shah-for-trying-to-topple-his-govt/articleshow/88152815.cms||---

They said that despite the area and its surroundings being home to over 20,000 people, a 1.5 km long stretch of the road has not been completed in the last four and a half years. They threatened that no politician would be allowed to campaign in the area if the road was not constructed on the entire stretch. Worst affected are residents from localities like Netaji Park, Ram Nagar, Gautam Vihar and Green Avenue. Residents complained that street lights were missing on this route, which made travel difficult in the dark and in foggy weather. Area resident Angrej Singh said, “We have been asking MLA Kuldeep Vaid for construction of this stretch for the past 4.5 years and he has been giving one excuse or the other for the delay. Now that the election code is about to be imposed, we had to protest. We blocked traffic for about two hours on Tuesday but will do so for the entire day next time if the road is not constructed.” Saying that despite several accidents caused by potholes, residents announced that they would not support any party this time. Rahul Sharma, a resident of Apple Villa, who has a factory on the road said, “Many of my employees, especially women complain about potholes due which their two-wheelers lose balance and they fall, getting injured.” Congress MLA from Gill constituency Kuldeep Singh Vaid said, “Many roads are already built up and this small stretch will also be constructed soon. Officials are already on the job. I got roads in all the areas constructed during my tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-threaten-to-ban-entry-of-politicians-over-delay-in-road-construction/articleshow/88151282.cms||---

According to pharmacy owners, there is an increase in queries about any protocol treatment regarding Omicron infection. While the Omicron variant can potentially spread faster than the Delta variant of Covid-19, there is less clarity among patients about the treatment protocol for the variant so far. “Infections are here to stay and people will have to take care of their immunity. Sales of health supplements are already high since the outbreak of the pandemic,” said Rajendra Khandelwal of Dhanwantary Medicare. According to Somnath Ghosh of Metro Pharma, sales of multivitamins and multi-mineral have gone up by 15%-20% in past seven-ten days. “The sales of Vitamin C, D and E have gone up significantly—almost 25% in past one week. At our stores, from Garia to Madhyamgram, we are seeing an increased demand for multi-vitamins,” he said. “Instead of asking for multi-vitamins, people are asking for specific vitamin and mineral supplements now. It could be that they are more informed now,” Ghosh added. Pharmacists said that at least four big pharma companies have come out with health supplements in past one year. “This trend of informed decisions by patients started in 2009 when H1N1 (swine flu) cases were being reported in the country. But people took it more seriously when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out,” Khandelwal said. Manik Lal Das, secretary of the south Kolkata branch of Bengal Chemist and Druggists Association, said there was an increased demand of vitamins and minerals. “There is a spike in demand each year at the onset of winter. It cannot be possible to link it entirely with the apprehensions about the Omicron variant. But we are seeing an increase at pharmacy stores,” he said. Debashsis Pal of Satyadeep Medical at Dum Dum said that most of the demand for health supplement is from the 50 years and above age group. “There is always a demand for supplements each winter. The increase in demand is, however, yet to touch the level we witnessed at the beginning of the second wave,” Pal said. Pinaki Dey, consultant physician at the ILS, Dum Dum, however, cautioned against unnecessary consumption of multi-vitamin and multi-minerals. “There is no standard process to boost immunity. Why do you need to take vitamins and minerals without doctor’s advice? So far, we are prepared to treat any possible case of Omicron by following the Covid-19 protocol,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vitamins-health-supplements-start-flying-off-shelves-as-fear-of-omicron-variant-lurks/articleshow/88152125.cms||Rohit Khanna

After the incident came to light, all the user IDs of Covid vaccinators in the district were inactivated with immediate effect. Gaya civil surgeon K K Rai told the media that an FIR was lodged with Tekari police station in connection with the forgery. “According to the report forwarded to senior officials by Tekari block health manager (BHM), Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, his UP counterpart Yogi Adityanath, former Bihar CM Rabri Devi and state health minister Mangal Pandey were administered the Covid vaccine doses at 1pm on Tuesday,” Rai told reporters. Sources said the cellphone numbers mentioned against the beneficiary names were ‘switched off’. “The Tekari BHM reported to the district monitoring and evaluation officer that mobile phone number 9525491600 of Alipur health sub-centre ANM Usha Kumari was frequently used as user ID and password on the Covid vaccination portal, CoWIN, by either of the four vaccinators — Upendra Singh, Akash Kumar, Ravi Raj and Baban Kumar — who were hired for vaccination and knew the cellphone number for use as ID and password for data entry. One of them has committed the fraud and he will be identified soon,” Rai added. Earlier on Monday, fake RT-PCR test of PM Modi, Amit Shah, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and cine- stars Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra at Karpi block headquarters in Arwal district had come to light. As per the data, swab samples of the top political leaders and cine-stars were collected on October 27 and the test reports were found negative the other day. Two data operators were dismissed and an FIR was lodged against them and others entrusted with the task of conducting Covid test and making data entries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-yogi-hemant-mangal-vaccinated-at-tekari-in-gaya/articleshow/88152128.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Row as RTC rural buses to drop ‘yellow’||VIJAYAWADA: A decision taken by Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) about a month ago to change the colour scheme of Pella Velugu buses has now become a political controversy with opposition parties starting to criticise the government. The APSRTC had taken a decision to change the colour scheme of Palle Velugu buses which run in the rural areas. The new colour scheme includes green, white, black and nicker nut colours. While all the colours are similar to the old colour scheme, yellow has been replaced with nicker nut colour. Removing yellow from the colour scheme evoked sharp responses from TDP as its flag colour is yellow. Spokesperson K Pattabhiram said the YSRC government is scared of yellow colour as it reminds it of TDP. “We are not claiming any patent over yellow colour. It is being used as auspicious colour since ages which is the reason why it finds place on the buses,” he said. Political controversies over bus colours is not new in Andhra Pradesh. Similar allegations were made by YSRC in 2015 when the colour scheme was changed. They alleged that the then TDP government is painting APSRTC buses with its party colour. Political reactions followed every time the APSRTC changed the colour scheme of buses. The Palle Velugu buses used to have red colour during 80’s and 90’s. The colour scheme was changed during the then TDP regime resulting in political slugfest. Later, in 2004, when Congress party came to power, the colour scheme was again changed and that time it was green and white. Even when the state got bifurcated, the RTC in Telangana changed the colour scheme of luxury services to pink which again drew criticism from Opposition parties. Speaking to TOI, executive director (ED) (engineering) of APSRTC, P Krishna Mohan, said the decision to change the colour scheme was taken as part of the routine exercise of refurbishing the buses. “We change the colour scheme periodically when the old buses go for fitness test. These buses used to undergo a lot of repair works including on seats and body. To give a fresh look to these buses, we change the colour scheme and design as well. There is no reason behind changing the colour scheme other than to give them a fresh look,” said Krishna Mohan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/row-as-rtc-rural-buses-to-drop-yellow/articleshow/88151279.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Nagpur||Stop all govt facilities to polluting industries: Wadettiwar||Chandrapur: No industry is bigger than the lives of people, said Chandrapur guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Wednesday and directed the administration to stop all government sops and facilities to the industries that continue to flout pollution control norms. Addressing a meeting held at the collectorate to review alarming pollution levels, Wadettiwar said, “Industries operating in the district are engaged only in profit-making and playing with the lives of the citizens.” “Trees in and around Chandrapur have turned black. This is probably the only place in the world where the colour of trees can be seen black. The severity of pollution can be gauged from the fact that Breathing Billboard (artificial lungs), installed in the city to measure pollution, turned black in just five days,” he said. “The government is not against industries, but these need to follow the regulations. No violation of law will be tolerated. Industries also need to think about the lives and health of people, while earning profit. But sadly, it does not seem to be happening,” he said. Saying that many industries are flouting norms, Wadettiwar cited high pollution caused due to Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) mines in the district and coal transportation. “Those handling the coal sidings do not even bother to sprinkle water before transporting coal. Transport trucks carry excessive load over the roads with lesser load bearing capacity,” he said and directed RTO officials to take action against such violators. During the meeting, Wadettiwar also took up the issue of industries and coal mines diverting the flow of rivers and nullahs. “Lift water and earn money appears to be the only policy of companies. People are dying, their lungs are turning black, but none appears to be concerned. This will not be tolerated any more,” he said. The minister directed to institute a joint committee of revenue, public works, police and sub-regional transport department to curb the pollution and control excessive load carrying traffic. Heads of all major departments and representatives of different industries, including WCL, Coal Washers, Grace Industries, Chaman Metallics, Bopani and others, were present during the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-all-govt-facilities-to-polluting-industries-wadettiwar/articleshow/88170908.cms||Mazhar Ali

But in Chhattisgarh, we have made a provision to purchase cow dung at Rs 2 per kg and created 7,777 cattle sheds. This step has increased the earnings of dairy operators, farmers and even the landless. By selling cow dung, many purchased mangalsutra for their wife, laptop for daughters and air tickets for travelling in planes.” We plan to set up 10,000 more cattle sheds this year, he added. “We are finding ways to ensure that people have money in their pockets. However, in UP, when we asked traders about their business during Diwali, they said buyers had no money,” he added. Targeting PM Modi on Gujarat development model and doubling farmers’ income, Baghel said, “Gujarat model of development has failed while Chhattisgarh model of development is being discussed in the country as most of the promises made by Rahul Gandhi before state election have been fulfilled there. Farmers were told their income will double by 2022, but it’s 2021-end and they are forced to sell their produce at half price. Shortage of DAP, fertilisers has left farmers struggling and they are compelled to commit suicide.” Since the BJP government came to power in UP in 2017, question papers of recruitment exams were leaked eight times, he alleged. Baghel, who also offered prayers at Kashi Vishwanath temple, said, “Developing Kashi Vishwanath Dham has snatched the livelihood of many traders.” The new construction has deprived devotees of the spiritual experience near KV Temple, claimed Baghel, who is also Congress party’s observer for UP elections. Baghel also targeted Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav saying, “The SP chief did not come out of his house in the past four and half years. He also did protests from his home but has come out now when the election is to be held.” Baghel said party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be the party’s face in the 2022 UP assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/guj-devpt-model-failed-farmers-income-hasnt-doubled-baghel/articleshow/88152132.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Some other markets have already started sanitising their premises, requesting traders and customers to follow Covid norms. The advisory was sent on Monday. “We have sent fresh advisories to all our members to stay alert and not let their guard down. Business activities have resumed in full swing and some people might have become complacent but that can prove costly,” said Tarak Nath Trivedi, of Federation of Traders’ Organisation in West Bengal. “We have asked them to start sanitising the premises and ensuring everybody wears mask and maintains social distance. They should also enforce policy of no mask, no entry. In crowded markets it is difficult to do thermal scanning, but we have requested them to start it again,” said Trivedi. Community markets are crowded throughout the day with several thousand people visiting daily, so the risk of transmission of any virus is higher. During the first and the second wave the administration had imposed severe restrictions on community markets, when many didn’t follow the safety guidelines resulting in losses for the traders. “We do not want that situation again, so it is better to be cautious,” said Trivedi. “We have been telling the shop owners and customers regularly to maintain distance and wear masks, but most do not follow. We will have a meeting soon,” said the secretary of a Burrabazar market. Several other markets like Bagri Market have started sanitising their premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-advisories-for-traders-to-stop-infection-spread/articleshow/88152138.cms||Zeeshan Javed

A building contractor, Mukesh Shaw (43), was found dead inside his residence at Sonali Park, Bansdroni, hours after he returned from a wedding ceremony. Police said he was found dead by his younger brother Sanjay around 6.40am. Mukesh was found face down, lying slumped on the floor with a chopper in his hand. He had deep injuries on his neck and shoulder. Cops claimed the manner of blood flow has made them suspect foul play. “Prima facie, it looks more like a murder. The wounds do not support self infliction. However, we are waiting for the initial postmortem report,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. In another incident, Sumanta Ghosh (37), a manager who works for an online travel site, was found dead around 7.05am on a pavement in front of a guest house on Rajani Sen Road, Mudiali, where he had checked in to evaluate it on behalf of his company.

---||Jaipur||Mercury dips across Rajasthan as cloud cover vanishes||JAIPUR: As cloud cover vanished from almost every part of the state on Tuesday, majority of the places witnessed a dip in their minimum and maximum temperatures. Churu remained coldest in the state where a minimum temperature of 7.5°C was recorded, the Met reports said. Attributing the vanishing of the cloud cover to the active northerly winds and absence of factors like cyclonic circulation, Jaipur Met office stated that the mercury will further take a dip in the next 24 hours across the state. Many places are likely to witness shivering cold conditions. People in Jaipur woke up to a comparatively chilly morning as a minimum temperature of 7.5°C was recorded. It was followed by a bright and sunny afternoon with a maximum temperature of 25.2°C. In the evening, chilly winds were witnessed in and around the city which compelled people to stay back at their homes. Some people came out to enjoy sizzlers and hot beverages to beat the shivering cold conditions. Also ground frost was seen in the farms during early morning which made the farmers worried. “One has to water the plants as they can’t be left with ground frost as it can damage the crop under the sunlight. Thus, in shivering cold conditions watering of plants during early morning hours is a must,” said Hariram Saini, a farmer at the Srimaodhpur village of Sikar district said. Churu was followed by Sangaria (Hanumangarh) where a minimum temperature of 8°C was recorded, Sriganganagar 8.9, Bikaner 9.7, Alwar and Sikar 10°C each, Jaisalmer 10.4, Vanasthali (Tonk) 11.6, Sawai Madhopur 11.8, Ajmer 13.2 and 14.6°C each was recorded at Jodhpur. In its forecast Jaipur Met office stated that shivering cold conditions will further aggravate in the state in the next 24 hours. Many places in the state are likely to get ground frost in the morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mercury-dips-across-state-as-cloud-cover-vanishes/articleshow/88152825.cms||---

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the mercury may slightly drop over the next few days due to the cold westerly winds. The city is likely to see shallow fog for the rest of the week, IMD said. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 25.1 degrees Celsius, a degree above the season’s average, compared with 24.8 degrees a day earlier. However, due to the colder wind and clear skies, the minimum temperature fell to 11.4 degrees Celsius as against 15 degrees on Monday. However, it was still three degrees above the season’s average. The average, according to IMD, between December 7 and 11 will be 24.3 degrees Celsius maximum and 8.9 minimum. “The minimum temperatures may drop on Wednesday and the maximum and minimum may hover around 24 and 10 degrees Celsius,” said an official. “The meteorological conditions will remain almost the same for this week. The cold westerly winds may bring the mercury down to 9 degrees Celsius by the end of it,” he added. The city may receive northwesterly winds of 8-10kmph on Wednesday. “Temperatures keep fluctuating at this time of the year, especially around a western disturbance. However, after its passage, the winds become westerly or northwesterly from the snow-clad mountains and the mercury drops,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cold-comfort-nip-in-air-blue-skies/articleshow/88152834.cms||---

The woman gathered something was amiss only after her superior from work alerted her. She then approached the Charkop police with a complaint. The woman holds a salary account with the bank where she works and accesses her money through a mobile banking app. Lately, she was having trouble making withdrawals using her debit card and decided to inquire with the bank's customer care helpline. She searched for the number online and dialled it, without realising that the number actually belonged to a fraudster. A man answered the call and then hung up when she spoke. He then called her back and introduced himself as a customer care executive of the bank. The woman told him that a "card invalid" message popped up every time she used her debit card. The man asked her to download two apps -- Team Viewer and Any Desk. These apps gave him remote access to the woman's device screen. "The woman followed his directions and operated her bank's app. Shortly, she noticed a sum of Rs 12.9 lakh credited to her account. When she quizzed the man, he said the sum was loan disbursement for another individual and had been accidentally credited to her account. He warned that the amount had to be immediately returned to the intended recipient, else she would be penalised," a police officer said. What the accused had done was view her banking details through Team Viewer and Any Desk and then use those details to apply for a pre-approved loan in her name. As a result, the amount had been credited to her account. But the woman was not aware of this. The accused then gave her four account numbers and asked her to transfer money into them. While the woman was transferring money, a manager from her workplace kept dialling her. She eventually answered the manager's call and narrated everything. The manager responded that something was wrong and she should ask the accused to share his employee code. When the woman did, the accused shared a 10-digit code instead of a six-digit code. This alerted her but by then she had already transferred Rs 10 lakh. The accused then stopped taking her calls. Charkop police have registered a case under IPC and the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-banker-duped-of-rs-10l-from-a/c-by-cyber-fraudster/articleshow/88153782.cms||---
---||Kolkata||St Xavier’s head completes 25 yrs of priesthood||Kolkata: Father Dominic Savio, principal of St Xavier’s College, completed 25 years of his priesthood on Tuesday. The occasion was celebrated by the other Jesuit priests of the college, teachers, students and alumni. Of these, 22 years were spent in St Xavier’s College. Father Dominic was born in a hamlet in Trichy in 1964 and was inspired by his uncle, Father Arockiasamy, who was a Jesuit priest, from a very young age. His mother, Maria Thangam had always inspired him to be a priest like his uncle and it was his happiest moment when his mother was the first to receive his priestly blessings. Father Savio completed his MA and MPhil in Economics and joined St Xavier’s College in April 2000 as a lecturer in economics. In 2009, he was appointed the vice principal of the morning section BCom department and had to manage 3,000 students. The alumni of the department remember how he had adopted unique methods of teaching by making students visit Haldia Petrochemicals. They also lived with villagers in Santiniketan to experience their lives. “As a Jesuit, I have always told my students that good marks are important but after five years one will remember them if they become changemakers in others’ lives,” Father Savio said, looking back on his years of teaching. He spearheaded several relief campaigns, along with the alumni association of the college, after Amphan, Yaas and Gulab cyclones and during the past 20 months of Covid. Describing St Xavier’s as a “sangam”, Father Savio said that the institution has been the greatest influence in his life and has helped him grow both as a Jesuit priest and an educator. “He has inspired Xaverians to become compassionate towards those who are less fortunate with humility and gratitude,” said Firdausal Hasan, secretary of the St Xavier’s College Alumni Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/st-xaviers-head-completes-25-yrs-of-priesthood/articleshow/88152156.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||KMDA survey to measure depth of Rabindra Sarobar||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) plans to conduct a survey to measure the depth of the Rabindra Sarobar lake to assess the present condition of the water bed. KMDA officials said knowledge about the 73-acre lake’s depth was required to install pipes and inject liquid oxygen into the water body in a bid to increase the dissolved oxygen level. This will, in turn, sustain life. Officials said that preliminary talks have already been held with an agency that will use sonar technology to measure the lake bed and the depth from the surface. Sonar sends sound waves to the bottom of the water body. The time it takes for the sound wave to return with an echo indicates the depth. KMDA wants to avoid the criticism that it had faced when it installed three fountains for aeration. The fountains had to be removed after rowing clubs pointed out that they posed a threat to the safety of both the rowers and their equipment and were a hurdle in the only rowing course in the state. Knowing the depth will help them install the pipes carrying liquid oxygen at a depth that does not interfere with the rowing activity. KMDA officials said the water body has a depth of about 20 feet in the middle but no survey has been carried out till date to know its exact depth and condition of the water bed. The authorities have meanwhile bought two dissolved oxygen (DO) meters to regularly read the dissolved oxygen level at the waterbody. “It is during this winter season that the dissolved oxygen level in the water body gets reduced when there is fog and cloudy conditions. Regular reading of the water body using the DO meters will help to keep check on the water’s dissolved oxygen level,” said a KMDA official. Environmentalists have been saying that taking up lake management strategies like nutrient remediation, aeration and hydro raking can help prolong the lifespan of the water body for many years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-survey-to-measure-depth-of-rabindra-sarobar/articleshow/88152154.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Kolkata||177-yr-old St Stephen’s Church springs back to life, now complete with a new crest||Kolkata: Older than St Paul’s Cathedral and with a steeple comparable with that of St John’s Church, the 177-year-old St Stephen’s Church in Kidderpore, that served many governor generals in British India, is once again back to life. The church that lay in a state of deep physical crisis has now been restored and re-dedicated for worship. However, a new crest has been created after a century-long search for the original one proved futile. Popularly called the Rocket Church because of the way its steeple had been designed, the church was built in 1844 to serve sailors. It has four spires jutting upwards, making the steeple look like a rocket. However, it was ship lanterns that inspired the design. The belfry in the middle of the steeple did not house a bell but a lantern, much like the ship lanterns in those days. “For miles inside the Hooghly, as ships came in, the unique steeple attracted attention of sailors. The steeple was heavily damaged and needed immediate attention. Such tall steeples, which are a signature of churches built by the British, had often fallen off and had to be rebuilt. So it was our priority when Bishop Canning planned the restoration,” said Brian Grey, secretary and deacon of the church. The church was built during the time of governor general, Lord Henry Hardinge and bishop Daniel Wilson. According to records, governor generals like Edward Law, William Wilberforce Bird and Lord Dalhousie too worshipped here. However, it is not known whether the church ever had a crest/emblem or not. For over 100 years, under different bishops and presbyters, records and documents preserved not only in the church and St Paul’s Cathedral but also in the British Library that houses India Office Records, the search yielded no results. So Bishop Canning decided to create a crest following the history of the church. Apart from the emblem of the Bishop inside the shield, the left top has stones that remind one of the assassination of St Stephen, the right top has St Stephen’s Cross which is also repeated at the left bottom. The right bottom has an anchor that reminds one that the church was meant for sailors. “We have been able to compile an emblem with precise historical attachments,” said Bishop Canning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/177-yr-old-st-stephens-church-springs-back-to-life-now-complete-with-a-new-crest/articleshow/88152178.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Students who have been allotted colleges in the CAP round I can now confirm their admissions by Friday. Moreover, the deadline to submit the caste proof certificate has been extended to December 21. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant’s tweet read, “As per the demand of engineering students and parents and as per the instructions from minister of tourism Aditya Thackeray, the deadline for admissions to engineering degree is being extended. The government has also extended the deadline for submission of original certificates of caste verification required for the centralised admission process for the academic year 2021-22 under the technical education department till the last date of the admission in the second round of the centralised process.” The admission process for CAP round 1 started on December 4 and as per the earlier schedule was supposed to end on December 7 at 5pm after which on December 8, the vacancy list for round 2 was supposed to be released. However, the new schedule declared by the State CET Cell, gave an extension till December 10, to confirm their admission for round 1. As per the new schedule, students can confirm their admission by Friday, 5 pm and the vacancy list for round 2, would be displayed on December 12. While many students were happy about the decision, there are also responses on social media about how the extension will further delay the start of the academic session for the 2021-22 batch. There will be only two centralised admission rounds after which the admissions will be at the college level. According to the CET cell’s notification, the college needs to display vacant seats on the institute website and give appropriate advertisements in the newspaper. Registered candidates must apply to individual colleges and the merit list is prepared and displayed by the college on the notice board as well as the website. The entire process of admission must be carried out by following government admission rules between December 22 and 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-extends-cap-round-1-for-engineering-to-friday/articleshow/88152169.cms||Ardhra Nair

A team headed by senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar, inspectors Sangeeta Patil and Vijay Puranik arrested Sufiyan Faiyaz Chari (19) of Parvati Payatha, and Nilesh Sunil Kumbhar (30) of Hadapsar from a spot in Koregaon Park. Police had arrested prime suspect Mehboob Saifan Balurgi (32) of Janata Vasahat and his minor accomplice (17) from Market Yard on Monday afternoon. “We also seized a country-made pistol from Chari. We will send it for ballistic examination,” Kalaskar said. “Balurgi runs a footwear shop in Janata Vasahat, while Chari is unemployed. Chari’s father is a friend of Balurgi,” Kalaskar said. “About two months ago, Balurgi started planning to eliminate Manur and bought a country-made pistol. Balurgi explained to Chari how to operate the pistol and told him about the plot to eliminate Manur,” Kalaskar said. “On Monday, Chari took the help of the minor boy and asked him to drive the scooter, while Balurgi and Kumbhar followed on a motorcycle. The four then stood near Manur’s residence and followed him till Chandrabhaga chowk, where Chari pumped bullets into his head, chest, and back,” he said. Kalaskar said, “The assailant fired a total of eight rounds, of which six were fired from close range.” “During questioning, the main conspirator, Balurgi, told police that money transaction went sour between him and his childhood friend Manur,” he said. Police also said that Manur was into construction as well as building material supplies and was associated with a political party. He was also fond of wearing excessive gold ornaments. According to police, the victim had borrowed Rs5 lakh from Balurgi and returned Rs2.5lakh. Balurgi had been pursuing him to return the remaining amount and would often question him about his penchant for wearing gold ornaments, but not returning his money. About two-and-a-half-months ago, the two even had a heated quarrel when Balurgi tried to snatch one of the ornaments from the victim, which led to an argument between them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-more-men-arrested-for-murder-of-small-time-builder-in-katraj/articleshow/88152179.cms||---
---||Delhi||NCR: Panel orders units not running on cleaner fuel to shut till December 12||NEW DELHI: The central government’s air quality panel, Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM), on Tuesday ordered closure of industries in NCR that are not running on gas or cleaner fuel. Earlier on December 3, the commission had regulated the operations of such industries, allowing them to operate only on weekdays. However, on Tuesday, it said that the violating industries or units would not be permitted to operate at least till December 12. “CAQM has issued directions for immediate closure of all such industries located in industrial areas where PNG infrastructure and supply are available but have still not switched over to PNG. As per the directions of the commission, these violating industries or industrial units will not be permitted to schedule their operations till 12.12.2021, and the position will be reviewed for further decisions,” read a statement from the air panel. CAQM asserted that it is adopting a “tough stand” against the industries in industrial areas, which are flouting its directions of shifting the industries operating in NCR districts to PNG or cleaner fuels. It stated that the step was taken as a “compelling need to prevent further deterioration of the environment and towards improvement of air quality in Delhi-NCR.” To prevent worsening air quality scenarios, all the industries in the NCR having gas connectivity shall be run only on gas, failing which industries concerned shall be closed, the panel stated. “All industries in NCR where gas connectivity is available shall immediately be shifted to gas and state governments have to furnish industry-wise date of shifting,” the statement added. The air panel pointed out that it had earlier in August directed the state governments of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to shift the industries operating in NCR districts to PNG or cleaner fuel. The NCR state governments were directed to audit the industries already connected to PNG supply and ensure that they don’t use polluting fuels like coal. The centre’s panel had also asked the state governments to stay vigilant to prevent the use of unapproved fuels in the NCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-orders-units-not-running-on-cleaner-fuel-to-shut-till-dec-12/articleshow/88152876.cms||---

But India's domestic air traffic has so far been resilient against the Omicron variant when compared with that of some other countries. This week, as compared to the last, airline seat capacity fell 3.8% in US domestic market, while in China it fell by 1 %. But in India, the third largest domestic market it went up by 0.5%, according to UK aviation data company OAG. In India, domestic airlines offered a total of 3.34 million seats last week, while this week the number was a tad higher at 3.36 million. But pre-Covid, in the first week of December 2019, domestic airlines offered a total of 3.5 million seats. Region-wise, the worst hit was North Africa where airline capacity dropped 19 %, or about one-fifth from 0.78 million seats to 0.63 million seats, that is. The UK market in a statement of defiance increased by 2.7%. “The next seven days for the airline industry could well determine how the first quarter of 2022 looks for every airline, airport, and supplier within the whole travel system,” said OAG. Meanwhile credit rating agency ICRA said that the threat of new variant, which has pushed the resumption of scheduled international operations, has the potential to derail the domestic recovery too, if it becomes a source of fresh round of lockdowns/restrictions in the near term. Domestic air passenger traffic grew by about 15-16% at around 104-105 lakh in November , compared to about 89.85 lakh in October, said ICRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-domestic-air-traffic-up-by-0-5-inspite-of-omicron/articleshow/88152866.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: BJP’s hoarding on Ram Lalla triggers a political slugfest||PRAYAGRAJ: A hoarding installed by Bharatiya Janata Party leaders, depicting the transformation in the condition of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya before and after the BJP came to power, set the political temperature soaring ahead of the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due early next year and has set the ball rolling for a hoarding war between parties. The hoarding carrying two pictures with the title — “(Then) Ram Lalla the tent mein (When Ram Lalla was in a tent) vs (Now) Ho raha hai bhavya Ram mandir ka nirman (A rand Ram temple is being constructed)” has raised political heat in the Sangam City. Samajwadi Party and Congress leaders slammed BJP over the hoarding and accused the ruling party of dividing people in the name of religion. Countering the charge, BJP leaders said the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya has been high on the agenda of the party and a priority for a long time. The hoarding has been installed at Sohbatiya Bagh and many locations in trans-Yamuna and trans-Ganga areas. BJP state co-convener (media) Ashish Gupta told TOI, “The construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya has always been a priority for BJP. Lord Ram has always been the epicentre of our faith and we were most vocal for the construction of Ram temple for a long time.” He asked opposition leaders why they were rankled by the hoarding and whether they were disappointed by the construction of Ram temple going on in full swing. Samajwadi Party district president Yogesh Yadav said, “BJP is not in a position to face the public therefore it is trying to divide people on the lines of religion.” “BJP government has failed on all fronts, including development, law and order, farmer’s problems, inflation, and is diverting attention from these issues by raising ‘mandir, masjid, kabristan and Pakistan’ to hide its failures,” he added People are fed up with the ruling party’s ‘anti-people policies’ and BJP would not come back to power this time, said Yadav. UPCC general secretary Mukund Tiwari said, “Lord Ram is the centre of faith for all of us but his name should not be used for gaining political mileage. It is unfortunate that BJP is trying to use the name of Lord Ram to grab power again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjps-hoarding-on-ram-lalla-triggers-a-political-slugfest/articleshow/88152192.cms||Kapil Dixit

Rajasthan was among leading states in vaccination, but now it has slipped to the ninth position. Now, for scaling up vaccination, just call 181 and vaccine will be at your doorstep. The vaccination drive has gained momentum in December. The health department is facilitating the availability of vaccines for the beneficiaries. Just call 181 and the health department teams will reach the doorsteps for vaccination camps. The rider is that a group should have at least 10 beneficiaries to get the vaccination team at its doorstep so that there is no wastage of vaccine doses. The state witnessed a slowdown in vaccination drive beginning October due to harvest and festive seasons. Amid apprehension of spread of Omicron variant of Covid which is having manifold infectivity and transmissibility, health department is now encouraging people to get fully vaccinated. In December, Covid vaccination figures show an encouraging trend. In just first six days of December, the state reported vaccination of half of the doses which were vaccinated in the whole November. “Covid vaccination is something which we are fully focusing now. Clear directions have been issued to health officials and collectors to take measures to scale up vaccination in the state. They have been asked to follow Pratapgarh which has achieved more than 100% vaccination of first dose of vaccine,” Parsadi Lal Meena, health minister told TOI. The Covid vaccination has almost derailed in October and November not only in the state but also at the national level. Realising it, the Centre had launched ‘Har Ghar Daskar’ mission. Health secretary Vaibhav Galriya said, “On December 4, health personnel by working tirelessly set an example of vaccinating more than 11 lakh people.” He said that this effort should continue so that Covid can be controller on time. Now, encouraging the beneficiaries, the health department has come up with an arrangement, which will make hassle-free vaccination. “If there are 10 persons eligible for vaccination in any part of the city, they just call at 181 and the vaccination will be arranged for them. It is soon coming up,” said Raghuraj Singh, mission director (immunisation). Besides, in Jaipur too, the health authorities have geared up to implement it. “Our teams will reach the spot if 10 persons in a group wanted to get vaccinated. They will be vaccinated on the spot,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). The health department has realised that people were not coming to the vaccination centres due to crop cutting season and festive season in October and November, but now the vaccination centres have started witnessing beneficiaries coming in increased numbers. Apart from that, arrival of Omicron variant has also driven people to vaccination centres in increasing numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-push-for-more-jabs-dial-181-to-get-covid-vax-at-your-doorstep/articleshow/88152849.cms||---

The posters with the head ‘Cat missing’ in bold letters also feature a picture of the six-year-old female Persian cat named Jessy and two contact numbers. A mole on its lips is mentioned as the cat’s identification mark. G Kirubarakan, 42, a resident of Ramanathapuram, said he had received more than 100 calls after he put up the posters on Tuesday. He has stuck more than 100 posters across the city. He said most of the calls were just about consoling him while giving him hope that he would get the cat back soon. “Callers from Ramanathapuram locality asked for more details about the cat and promised to revert with information about the cat.” The cat went missing on November 29. “I had relatives at my place on that day. I forgot to close the main door and the cat went out without our notice.” Kirubakaran, a used car seller, said he had bought the cat for Rs 30,000 in 2015. Since then, the cat was like one of his family members.He has three more cats at home. Kirubakaran spends around Rs 2,600 per month on feeding them and another few thousands on medical and salon expenses to maintain their hair. The cat has helped Kirubakaran earn too by giving birth to 21 kittens, of which he has sold 18 so far. “Her absence has left a void in the house. Jessy was very obedient and loving. We are waiting for someone to call and tell us that our Jessy is with them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/poster-of-missing-persian-cat-goes-viral/articleshow/88152850.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Auto drivers fret about school commute income||Hubballi: Autorickshaw drivers are a worried lot as education minister B C Nagesh has said he will not hesitate in shutting down schools again if the number of schoolchildren infected with Covid-19 warrants such a move. Auto drivers had rejoiced when schools had started on-campus classes after Deepavali. For well over a year, many auto drivers had worked in other trades, such as selling vegetables or working as land labourers, to make ends meet. For many of them, the opening of schools meant that they could resume their regular work of dropping children to campuses and taking them back home. Shekharayya Mathapati, the president of the Hubballi Autorickshaw Owners’ and Drivers’ Association, said reports that schools may be closed again have given us sleepless nights again. “Hubballi-Dharwad alone has about 30,000 autorickshaws and about 10,000 of them carry schoolchildren.” He added: “If we take Hubballi alone, we have around 17,000 autorickshaws and 6,000 do school trips. We are struggling hard to get back to normal life from almost two years. Many autorickshaw drivers had become unemployed and lived on charity ration kits and worked in fields in villages. We were starting to feel tension-free with the hope of taking care of our families. However, the education minister’s statement has again made us worried about our future.” Mathapati has ferried schoolchildren for 26 years. “In the pre-Covid days, I used to carry about 70 students. Now, it is down to 30,” he said. Fakiresh Kundagol, another autorickshaw driver in Unkal, said he was working in his agriculture fields in Malali, Kundagol taluk, after the lockdown in 2020 started. “Due to heavy and untimely rain, we suffered losses there also. Then, the fuel price hike became a burden. We are totally clueless about our future. We don’t know any other kind of work. At the other end, we have to pay bank instalments,” he said. Vinayak More, an autorickshaw driver at the railway station, said that he has to pay a rent of Rs 500 per day for the autorickshaw. “I hardly get Rs 200 per day but school trips had been a help to meet family needs. We are praying to the almighty that the school shutdown and lockdown don’t happen,” he said. Manjunath Jogi, a school van driver, said he had two vans earlier. “We sold one vehicle last year and are managing with one. As parents are also under financial crisis, we are unable to hike the auto fare on a par with the fuel price hike,” he said. He said that banks had given loan moratoriums of three months but the schools were shut for well over a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/auto-drivers-fret-about-school-commute-income/articleshow/88151351.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Kolkata||Cloakrooms to make a comeback at Victoria||Kolkata: Visitors to the Victoria Memorial Hall will no longer have to lug their bags while touring the exhibits at the museum or enjoying the garden. Nearly a decade and a half after its cloakrooms disappeared, the facility will make a comeback this month-end or early January at the north and the south gates. “Two cloakrooms have been constructed for visitors at the entrances to the VMH. Finishing touches are now under way. The larger cloakroom at the north gate is 602sqft while the one at the southern gate is 412sqft. Together, there will be enough capacity to store the luggage that visitors from afar bring to the museum,” said VMH curator Jayanta Sengupta. While the north cloakroom can accommodate around 700-800 bags at a time, the one in the south can take in around 500 bags. With a sizable section of visitors to VMH either hailing from Bengal's districts or from other parts of the country and on a shoe-string budget, they turn up with shoulder bags, suitcases and even holdalls. In the absence of a cloakroom, they enter the grounds with the bags, get them scanned at the entrance to the museum and then carry it around even as they check out the artefacts and works of art on display. While it is inconvenient for those who carry the luggage, other visitors get disturbed too as they clutter the viewing space. VMH used to get around 10,000 visitors daily prior to the Covid outbreak. At present, it attracts 5,000-6,000 visitors a day. Of them, one in five brings a bag of some kind and then carries it around, both while touring the museum and the grounds. Once the cloakrooms are commissioned, visitors entering VMH with bags will be directed to the facility after they purchase the ticket and enter the compound. There, the bags will be scanned and stored till the visitors claim them later. “We are working out the modalities on whether the facility will be free or chargeable and how much will be charged and whether it will be on a per-hour basis,” said Sengupta. VMH did have two cloakrooms at the entrance to the museum till 2008 when the facility was withdrawn after the two hall porters retired. Thereafter, one of the facilities was turned into a baggage scan facility and the other into a museum shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cloakrooms-to-make-a-comeback-at-victoria/articleshow/88152220.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The authorities had declared the sale illegal under the provisions of the Disturbed Areas Act and had initiated criminal proceedings against one of the Muslim buyers. The petitioner in this case is Ahmedbhai Patel, a resident of Paldi, who is in possession of the land in Sarkhej. According to him the land was sold by one Harish Sheth in 1984, much before the Disturbed Areas Act came into force in 1986 but not made applicable to this area. In 1987, the land was further sold to Patel and four others. The land was covered under the law only in 1997. In 2007, Sheth passed away and his son Pranav Sheth issued a notice to Patel and other owners to return the possession of the land claiming that the transactions that took place in the 1980s were fraudulent. In 2018, Sheth began proceedings under the Disturbed Areas Act about a sale deed of 2010 and questioned the possession of the land. As Sheth initiated the proceedings, the deputy collector on January 29, 2019, declared the sale null and void under sections 5 and 5(2) of the Act and ordered Patel to return the land to Sheth. The authority also ordered criminal proceedings under Section 9A of the Act against Patel, who unsuccessfully appealed to the special secretary revenue department (SSRD). Patel approached the high court against these proceedings and Justice Sangeeta Vishen stayed the orders of the revenue authorities. Patel was the first person in Ahmedabad against whom the recently enacted land grabbing laws were invoked. He was put behind bars for the transactions for the land. The high court quashed the remand order and released him on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disturbed-areas-act-hc-relief-for-senior-citizen/articleshow/88152927.cms||---

The deceased, Rajesh Pandey, belonged to Kuchaikote Bazaar and was on way to court with a colleague. The incident took place at around 10.45am when Pandey was riding pillion on a bike with a colleague, Jitendra Choubey, on way to Gopalganj civil court where both practised law. Choubey managed to escape unhurt in the incident as criminals targeted Pandey only. The crime spot is around 6km away from Pandey’s residence and around 15km from the Gopalganj civil court. Professional shooters were involved in the crime. One of them used a 9mm pistol, Sadar SDPO Sanjeev Kumar said. “The lawyer was shot thrice. He was rushed to hospital but doctors could not save him,” he said. “They first shot him from behind and the side while on the move. One empty cartridge of 9mm and two of 7.65mm were recovered from the spot,” he said. Choubey was unable to tell anything except that the criminals didn’t have their faces covered. SP Anand Kumar said it was yet not clear why Pandey was killed. “Police are investigating the case from several possible angles. His family members and people close to him could not say anything,” he said. The SP said Pandey used to go to the court with Choubey for the past several months. As soon as the news about the murder reached the civil court, the lawyers abstained from routine legal works, paralysing court proceedings. Gopalganj public prosecutor Deo Vansh Giri said the SDPO approached them and assured of cracking the case within eight to ten hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lawyer-killed-on-way-to-court-in-gopalganj/articleshow/88152219.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Rajasthan police identified the accused as one Kushwender Singh. Singh has been accused of watching and circulating child pornography and his phone was seized by the police for investigation. Police claimed in a statement that Singh is being probed for viewing child pornography on social media, and sharing it with other people. The state police claimed that a US-based organisation, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) had complained on National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal about that the incident. The police investigated the complaint and found it to be a case of child pornography, accordingly an FIR was filed under the relevant sections of the IT act.

The logic, as per epidemiology, is that viruses lose their virulence over time and settle for a “symbiotic relationship” with their living hosts. Experts such as Dr Salunkhe say Omicron could be the symbiotic variant: If community transmission of Omicron begins, it would over the next few months replace the highly virulent Delta. “People may get infected or reinfected, but that would act as a natural vaccine,” said Dr Salunkhe, adding Covid could be downgraded from pandemic to endemic in the next five to six months, as a result. In early March, when the number of Covid cases and deaths suddenly shot up, Dr Salunkhe travelled across Vidarbha and told the state government a mutated form of SARS-CoV-2 was the cause. This was confirmed later when scientists identified Delta. Dr Salunkhe has a caveat: The final word on Omicron’s virulence or lack of it is still not out. “We have to wait for it for the next couple of weeks when experts in the world and India make an assessment,” he added. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said the consensus appears to be that Omicron isn’t virulent. “Yet, we should wait for two months before we stop worrying about this variant. We cannot base our conclusions on speculations,” he said. Meanwhile, state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI on Tuesday that there are no new Omicron-positive cases in Maharashtra. “The Omicron tally remains 10,’ he said. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said Covid was detected in 23 out of the 4,845 travellers who had arrived at the Mumbai airport from high-risk countries. “Nine of their contacts also tested positive,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wait-for-2-mths-for-final-word-on-omicrons-virulence-says-doc/articleshow/88152885.cms||Malathy Iyer

Police in Kalwa had registered a case against him. If arrested he will be released on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 and with one or two sureties of like amount, said the high court. Justice Nitin Sambre took an oral undertaking from Thakkar’s lawyer Hrishikesh Mundargi that he would not post such tweets again. The HC felt that no custodial interrogation was necessary in the case. Dinesh Bane of the NCP had lodged a complaint against Thakkar, including a non-bailable offence under section 505(2) of IPC. Thakker said last year he was booked and arrested in few cases and released on bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/tweets-case-sameet-gets-anticipatory-bail-from-hc-in-mumbai/articleshow/88153821.cms||---

The state government led by Yogi is acting like a mute spectator and cases of atrocities on Dalits are rising,” Lallu said after paying tributes to the deceased four members of a Dalit family who were brutally murdered on November 25 at Gohri village in Phaphamau police station area. The SC/ST wing of UPCC had organised a ‘Shraddhanjali Sabha’ at Patel Sewa Sansthan, lopibagh, to pay tributes to the killed Dalits. “The gruesome incident has exposed the deteriorating law and order in the state,” said Lallu while claiming that police were trying to cover up the incident and demanded a CBI probe. “Congress general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been targeting the government over rise in atrocities on Dalits and other public issues while Samajwadi Party and BSP leaders are confined to their homes,” Lallu said. Targeting Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav for not performing the responsibility of opposition despite having good number of MLAs, the UPCC chief said, “For the past four and half years, Yadav has been just issuing baseless statements and writing posts on Twitter.” “Congress with only few MLAs played the role of real opposition in the assembly. I was sent behind the bars many times for raising voice for the people, but Akhilesh was nowhere,” Lallu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/yogi-has-failed-to-handle-state-should-return-to-math-lallu/articleshow/88152226.cms||Kapil Dixit

---||Ahmedabad||Now, resident docs withdraw from emergency services||Ahmedabad: Intensifying their agitation against delay in NEET UG counselling, resident doctors across Gujarat withdrew from emergency and Covid-related duties to further press for their demands. The demands include a fast-track process for National Eligibility cum Entrance Test post graduate (NEET-PG) counselling 2021. The medicos say they are overworked as only two batches of students are currently deployed at medical colleges. Around 1,000 resident doctors of various medical colleges in Gujarat have called a day-long strike, claiming that the shortage of manpower in civil hospitals due to the delay in new admissions to post-graduate courses have significantly increased their workload. The resident doctors, who are attached to various government hospitals, had observed a similar strike on November 29 and stayed away from OPD work from 9am to 5pm. Since the demands were not heard, they decided to observe a similar strike on Tuesday, said Dr Oman Prajapati, vice-president of the Junior Doctors’ Association of Ahmedabad’s B J Medical College, attached to the Civil Hospital. They had given a deadline of 6pm to the government to consider their demands, failing which they threatened to withdraw from emergency services as well. The medicos are protesting against the postponement of the NEET-PG counselling, claiming the delay was causing an acute shortage of doctors, which in turn is affecting the quality of treatment provided to patients in government hospitals as one resident doctor is doing the work of three. Resident doctors in other major cities, such as Surat and Vadodara, also joined the strike and sat outside their respective colleges to register their protest. The Centre put on hold the counselling for the NEET-PG 2021 until January next year over some issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-resident-docs-withdraw-from-emergency-services/articleshow/88152935.cms||---
---||Pune||More people opting for advanced lasik surgery||Pune: More people have been coming forward for undergoing vision correction surgery ever since the advancement of lasik eye surgery in the last few years. Many professionals, fitness enthusiasts and doctors as well have been opting for vision correction surgery to do away with their dependency on glasses and contact lenses. A Bengaluru-based eye surgeon Sri Ganesh said that in the early years of lasik, around 0.5% patients in India had undergone refractive surgery. Post advancements in lasik surgery in the last few years, around 5% of the patients in India with refractive errors have been undergoing laser vision correction,he added. “With the increase in comfort, safety and accuracy the numbers should increase in the coming year,” said Sri Ganesh, director of Nethradhama Superspeciality hospital. The recent advances in surgery include — bladeless lasik, which is a painless minimally invasive procedure that enables patients to resume all their normal activities including sports within a week; presbyond lasik which corrects presbyopia in older patients; wavefront lasik which corrects irregularities in vision and contoura lasik that re-shapes the cornea into a more uniformed and smooth surface. Eye surgeons can now correct almost all types of vision problems and have made the procedure much safer and predictable. Recently, a prominent eye surgeon and an avid marathoner in Pune underwent the bladeless procedure to set right the vision problem he had been living with since childhood, so that he could give his best shot at the Ironman triathlon next year. “I had hypermetropia or hyperopia (long-sightedness), which meant I needed plus power glasses. I needed an additional plus number for near vision after I turned 40,” said eye surgeon Aditya Kelkar, director of the National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO), which is among the first eye hospitals in India that have been offering lasik surgery since 1994. Hyperopia is an eye condition where distant objects are seen clearly but near objects appear blurred. This is due to incoming light being focused behind, instead of on the retina wall due to insufficient accommodation by the lens. Asked why he took so long to undergo the lasik surgery, Kelkar said that the lasik technology ‘Contoura’ has been made available in India only for the last 4-5 years. “I opted for the lasik surgery to do away with dependency on glasses. I am also a fitness enthusiast and I find difficulty running and swimming with glasses. I feel more confident now,” said Kelkar, who got the surgery done in April. Bengaluru-based Sri Ganesh is also among the eye surgeons, who have opted for lasik eye surgery. . He had perfect vision until he turned 45 years. Then he started becoming totally dependent on reading glasses. The issue is known as presbyopia. “I was dependent on glasses for any near activity and for reading,” Sri Ganesh said. He decided to undergo a laser vision correction ‘Presbyond’, which corrects both distance and near vision in people over 40 years. “It has been six years since my surgery and I am very happy. I am able to do all my activities and hobbies without the impediment of wearing glasses. My vision could not have been more perfect. I am more confident,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-people-opting-for-advanced-lasik-surgery/articleshow/88152235.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Each flyover would be more than 1km long and have four lanes. The Union government has agreed to sanction Rs 400 crore for the project. Singanallur Junction on Trichy Road (NH-181) is infamous for traffic congestion during the peak morning and evening hours. The NH wing has decided to construct the flyover from Uzhavar Sandhai to Vasantha Mills on Trichy Road to ease traffic. “The Centre has sanctioned the project, which will begin in April 2022,” said a highways department official. At Saravanampatti Junction, the flyover would link Kalapatti Road Junction with Thudiyalur Road Junction, covering a distance of 1.4km. The flyover is expected to address the traffic congestion on Coimbatore-Sathyamangalam road (NH-948), which is predominantly being used by the vehicles coming from Kalapatti Road and Thudiyalur Road. The remaining two flyovers would come up at Saibaba Kovil Junction and Thudiyalur Junction on Mettupalayam Road (NH-181). “We have enough space at all the four junctions and we don’t have to acquire land for the flyovers. Each flyover is estimated to cost Rs 100 crore. The work on them is likely to begin in April next year.” K Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said the district road safety committee had mooted the flyovers at the four junctions a few years ago. “Initially, the transport and highways ministry had approved the flyovers only at Saibaba Kovil and Thudiyalur junctions. Later, NH wing officials decided to just expand the roads at the two places.” A few days ago, he said, officials attached to the road transport and highways ministry had visited Saibaba Kovil and Thudiyalur junctions and decided to construct the flyovers soon. “The flyovers will help reduce traffic congestion drastically. The NH has also decided to construct a flyover at Sundarapuram Junction (NH-948) in future.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/four-flyovers-to-come-up-in-city-at-rs-400cr-to-ease-traffic/articleshow/88152888.cms||A Subburaj

He said that people are not serious about wearing masks and are not maintaining social distance at crowded places. During a visit to Nashik Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) on Tuesday, it was observed that many farmers and traders were not wearing masks and resorting to overcrowding. Over 60% of the farmers and traders at the APMC premises were seen without masks, while the others, had not worn the masks properly. Jadhav said it is a matter of worry that people are not wearing masks in public places, markets and the APMC. He said, “We need to follow Covid appropriate behaviour to further prevent the third wave. The Omicron variant of the virus is more infectious than the delta variant. Avesh Palod, the director of the solid waste department of the NMC said that he has directed all the concerned officials to conduct drives at Nashik APMC premises and marketplaces and penalize the people not wearing masks. The civic body has formed 18 teams in six divisions of the municipal corporation to take action against those not following Covid appropriate behaviour. The NMC had started penalizing the erring city residents during the first wave last year. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in the city, the squads have fined over 14,000 erring residents and collected a fine of Rs 50 lakh. Total 9,457 citizens were fined for not wearing the masks in public and marketplaces during the last financial year 2020-21 (April-March) and collected a total fine of Rs 27.12 lakh. During the current financial year between April 1 and November 30, the NMC has fined 4,578 erring residents, collecting a total fine of Rs 22.91 lakh. The officials said, earlier, the fine for not wearing masks was Rs 200, but the amount was increased to Rs 500 before Diwali this year. The government has recently issued guidelines for increasing the fine up to Rs 1,000 for the same. However, the NMC for the time being is penalizing Rs 500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-chief-worried-about-violation-of-covid-norms/articleshow/88153464.cms||Tushar Pawar

More worrying is the state government hinting at stopping offline classes, if the situation goes out of hand. Parents said detection of cases in campuses, just when academic learning was taking off smoothly, and the situation was returning to normal after a long gap of 18 months, is disheartening. “The closure of schools and colleges again will have serious repercussions on students,” expressed a parent. Many students who have common cold and seasonal flu are reportedly staying away from school. Shambhu Shankar, coordinator, block resource centre, Belthangady taluk, said there is a small dip in attendance, since parents are not sending their wards who are down with cold or flu. “The school environment was almost back to the days before the pandemic. Students, parents and teachers are worried about the possible closure of educational institutions, due to a surge in Covid cases caused by new variants of the virus,” said Shambhu. Kurian, principal of Alva’s College, Moodbidri, said that students are of the strong opinion that they do not want to disrupt learning due to another wave of Covid-19. “They are not mentally prepared to face the college closing down again. Academic learning is almost back to normal at this hour, and students are preparing for their examination and projects,” he added. Another government school teacher criticised statements from ministers of the state government, that have shaken up parents and students. “It is better that the government make measured statements, especially when it links with schools and colleges. It has made a negative impact among parents and students. There are only a few cases reported in the state, and yet it is depicted as a severe outbreak of Covid-19, which is not a good development,” a teacher criticised. DDPI Malleswamy said there are no cases of Covid-19 reported among school students. “Students are not happy if schools close down again, and we would not want it to happen,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/parents-students-worried-over-possible-closure-of-edu-campuses/articleshow/88151355.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Goa||At 89.8%, state struggles to hit 100% double-vax status||Panaji: An average of 1,000 persons are taking the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine each day. These include youth who have recently turned 18, people who have come to Goa from other states for work and others who were unvaccinated, state immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said on Tuesday. As on date, 108% of Goa’s population has taken at least one dose of the vaccine, he said. The directorate of health services has set the state’s eligible (18+) population at 11.66 lakh. It is yet to achieve the target of administering the second dose to 100% of this population and has missed several deadlines announced. Chief minister Pramod Sawant had earlier announced that Goa would achieve 100% Covid-19 vaccination with the second dose by November 15. “We are at 89.8%. We should touch 90% by Wednesday,” he said. When asked when the state would reach 100%, he said it depends on the people to come and take it. Each day an average of 3,500 persons have been taking their second dose of the vaccine. The vaccine stock available with the state is 1,79,330 doses. This is expected to last till the end of the year as the state’s consumption is around 1,50,000 doses a month, Borkar said. Till date, Goa has administered 23 lakh doses of the vaccine. Although Covid vaccinations are not available to public at health centres on Sundays, house to house vaccination to the home-bound, persons with disabilities and the elderly who cannot leave their homes, continues on Sundays. Beneficiaries who have been doubly vaccinated are 10.5 lakh and partially vaccinated 2.2 lakh. TOI had earlier reported that majority of the fatalities who succumbed during the devastating second wave were unvaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-89-8-state-struggles-to-hit-100-double-vax-status/articleshow/88153477.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Developers to provide sale deeds for regularisation||Ludhiana: In a bid to catch defaulters, building branch officials have been asked to collect sale deeds of developers who had applied under the regularisation policy by submitting full and final agreements with buyers. Senior town planner Surinder Singh Bindra has written to assistant town planners about this. The sale deeds will help determine how many plots were sold in reality and weather the sale was conducted legally. In the letter, the ATPs were instructed to check applications submitted one year back. Developers of these colonies were asked to produce sale deeds of plots which were shown as sold in their applications. Their applications were to be cancelled immediately if they failed to comply. RTI activist Kuldeep Khaira, who has been raising these issues said, “Developers, in order to prove that their colonies were developed before 2018 and could be regularised under the policy, had given agreements and more than one year has elapsed. If there were genuine buyers, the developers would be able to produce those sale deeds.” He said there was a need to check documents minutely and catch such developers. An official claimed that over 180 applications had been received and only 30 to 32 developers were given NoC. He said they would now ask developers to furnish sale deeds and if they fail to do so, they would cancel the application. Other legal action would also be recommended against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/developers-to-provide-sale-deeds-for-regularisation/articleshow/88152890.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

No deaths due to the infection were recorded in the last 24 hours, officials said. With the fresh cases, the infection tally rose to 14,41,449, while over 14.15 lakh patients have recovered till now. The total number of deaths due to the disease stands at 25,099, including one death reported on Monday. The number of active cases stands at 376, of which 152 are in home isolation, the officials said. The positivity rate of Covid-19 has seen a gradual rise over the past week and daily cases have also gone up. On Sunday, the city recorded 63 fresh Covid-19 cases – the highest single day tally since August 25. “Next few weeks are going to be very crucial. There is a possibility of increase in cases due to the new variant that has already been detected in the city,” a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital said. A 33-year-old man who returned from Tanzania was recently confirmed positive for Omicron variant of Covid-19 in Delhi. He is currently isolated and under treatment at Lok Nayak hospital. Sources said the 33-year-old man was fully-vaccinated. Despite that, he contracted the infection. Fortunately, sources at the hospital said, his symptoms are mild. Till date, Delhi has received over two dozen passengers travelling from at-risk nations who were found to be symptomatic or confirmed positive for Covid-19 upon arrival at the airport. All of them are under isolation at Lok Nayak hospital. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital said samples of all patients have been sent for genome sequencing and results are awaited. “Most of the isolated passengers and their contacts are asymptomatic. There is no reason for panic,” Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital said. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa last month. It is feared that the Omicron variant – which is highly mutated may overtake the Delta variant as the predominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 in the coming days. Initial reports suggest the new variant is unlikely to cause severe disease in fully-vaccinated persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/51-fresh-covid-19-cases-positivity-rate-at-0-1/articleshow/88152891.cms||---

The incident took place on Sunday but came to light when the girl’s parents lodged an FIR late Monday. In his complaint, the girl’s father said he had gone to work on Sunday and his wife and three-year-old daughter were at home. In the evening, the 13-year-old son of a neighbour lured his daughter to his house on some pretext when he was all alone, he added. “The boy played an obscene video on a mobile phone and raped my daughter. When her condition deteriorated, he dumped her outside my home,” he said in the complaint. The girl’s mother noticed bleeding from her private parts and informed her grandparents who also live nearby, said police officials. The grandparents of the girl caught and thrashed the boy and took the girl to a clinic and later dropped her home. Late, in the night, when the girl’s condition worsened again, her mother called her father back from work. The girl’s father informed police on Monday. A police team arrived and took the gir to the community health centre but the doctor there referred her to Ursula Hospital from where she was further referred to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital. After registering a case on the complaint of the father, police took the juvenile in custody. Bidhnoo police station in-charge Atul Kumar Singh said, “A case has been registered on the complaint of the girl’s father and the accused juvenile has been detained.

---||Mumbai||Don’t try sharp practices in Mumbai: HC to errant realtors||MUMBAI: No smart practices with the court, the Bombay high court on Tuesday told three directors of a private realty company who “cheated” several flat purchasers and a financial institution. It also gave 15 days for a partner who fled to the US to return to Mumbai. “Since you have already cheated flat purchasers and a financial institution, do not indulge in such smart practices with the court. The court will not spare anyone... This is the message we want to convey to one and all,” said a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. They heard five petitions by flat purchasers against Jayesh Rami, Rajesh Savla and Ashwin Mistry, directors of Raj Arcades and Enclave Pvt Ltd. The trio collected amounts from flat purchasers for their project ‘Raj-Shivganga’ at Babrekar Nagar, Kandivli (W). These flats were mortgaged to Anand Rathi Global Finances Ltd, misrepresenting that they were unsold flats. On Monday, told by Kandivli police that Rami had left for US on the day he was directed to remain present, the judges directed his son-in-law Neerav Parekh to remain present. Savla and Mistry were directed not to leave the country and deposit their passports. Neerav said Rami had gone to the US following the birth of his grandchild. After many questions, he said Rami has started the process of returning to India, which includes Covid-19 formalities. After the judges orally directed Neerav to ask Rami to appear through videoconference, Rami undertook to return to India “not later than 15 days from today.” “It’s best in the interest of the family reputation to put an end to this. He goes to the US when there are orders to appear in court. He never told us he wants to go to the US,” said Justice Kathawalla. He further said, “If you have taken money, you have to pay. What is the sense in this fight? Other partners are making an effort to pay,” said Justice Kathawalla. Advocate Malhar Zatakia, for Savla and Mistry, said by Thursday they would give details of a confirmed buyer for sale of the office premises at Kandivli. Zatakia also informed that they have given a proposal to Anand Rathi to settle the outstanding amount. Posting the hearing next on Friday, the judges have sought disclosures from the trio, including all assets, balance sheets, tax returns of last five years in their individual as well as company’s name. Independently it has directed the income-tax department to give details of their returns for the same period. They directed the trio to submit bank statements of the company’s account for the past five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dont-try-sharp-practices-in-mumbai-hc-to-errant-realtors/articleshow/88153824.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Then the leaden thumping of the Omicron threat gave organizers pause. The original plan was to allow 400 people in for the live performance and reach out to a larger audience by streaming the concerts, said Sandeep Joshi, the Saptak secretary. “That is the attendance limit currently imposed by the government,” Joshi said. “The notification is likely to be renewed on December 10. So by December 11, we will take a call, keeping the government’s fresh advice and the Omicron situation in mind.” Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, the Mohan Veena legend, told TOI: “I hope the live event takes place in some form.” He added: “Both artists and rasikas relish the interactions, being present in the moment for an unfolding raga, and the buzz of a shared experience.” For the first time, Saptak had gone completely online in its previous edition. “The online experiment was all right,” Pandit Bhatt said. “But we play not for cameras and computers but for people.” Rasikas in Ahmedabad will be hoping that at least a few of them will be able to delight in the spikes of “wahs” in person.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/o-musi-cron-call-on-hybrid-saptak-on-dec-11/articleshow/88152958.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

No new works can be approved once the election code is enforced. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said he was aware of the councillors’ demand and would call a meeting shortly. Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor and party district president Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “Regular meetings are required if we have to resolve public issues. There are many important issues like sewerage, water supply and even roads not only from one ward but from other wards. I had spoken to the mayor about this and he assured that the date of the meeting would be announced shortly.” He said he would talk to the mayor again and urge him to call the meeting as soon as possible. With elections around the corner, councillors want pressing issues addressed. BJP councillor Sunita Rani said, “The major issue around my ward is that of parking. There is very less space for parking and people keep taking it up. However, the area is thickly populated and there is hardly any space available.” She also raised concern about mushrooming of encroachments in various wards, including hers and said that this would be one of the issues to be taken up in the meeting. The timing of development works has also rankled some. Lok Insaaf Party councillor Swarandeep Singh Chahal said, “We are against this policy of MC officials to construct roads at the end of the year, when temperature is low because of the winter season. The MC could not complete construction of main roads so what will they do in internal areas? Also, roads constructed at low temperature will not survive for long.” He said they would raise the issue of corruption among officials in the house meeting. Mayor Balkar Sandhu assured, “We are going to call the house meeting very shortly and important resolutions will be approved.” The last MC house meeting took place on July 14 at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan. Thereafter, no meeting could be scheduled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hold-house-meet-before-poll-code-of-conduct-is-enforced/articleshow/88152905.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Leopard alert along Katraj ghat sparks heightened vigil||PUNE: After cleaning staff of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) raised suspicions about the presence of leopards in the Katraj ghat forest area surroundings, the vigil in the vicinity is being increased and warning boards are likely to be displayed by the authorities. The staffers involved in daily cleaning of the road raised an alarm about the possibility of leopards being sighted, and have approached the forest department to conduct checks. Forest officials said they are beefing up the watch at vulnerable spots and reaching out to locals with an appeal to remain more cautious. PMC cleaning staff has also been asked not to take any undue risks. PMC cleaning supervisor Prashant Nigade said, “Our staffers work in shifts from early morning till night along the entire ghat section. Besides the daily cleaning of roads, the teams are also involved in action against illegal dumping of garbage and imposing of fines. There has been suspected movement of leopards or a leopard-like animal in the forest along the ghat section. We have therefore approached the forest department to initiate further measures.” Katraj ghat is a hilly section located towards the city’s south. It connects Pune to the Kolhapur highway. Authorities from PMC said they have asked both staffers and residents nearby to stay vigilant. “We will be working in coordination with the forest officials to see if any boards can be displayed in the ghat section to alert travelers and citizens, and prevent panic,” said a civic official, choosing to stay unnamed. An official from the forest department added, “We will be monitoring the area for the next few days. Our teams will visit the suspected spots and trails. Further steps will be planned based on the observations. Our teams will be in constant contact with local residents to get updates on any animal movements. As of now, there is no immediate plan to install any cage.” In October this year, a leopard had been captured by forest officials in the Hadapsar area, after it got stuck between some houses in a vasti. Just days prior to that, Mohammadwadi residents had reported a sighting of the big cat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-alert-along-katraj-ghat-sparks-heightened-vigil/articleshow/88152252.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Mumbai, Hyderabad airports offer most expensive rapid tests||MUMBAI: To offer RT-PCR and rapid tests at a cheaper cost, the government-run Airports Authority of India (AAI) has decided to pass on the revenue earned through these Covid-19 tests to passengers. With this, airports run under private-public partnership (PPP) would be the ones with the expensive rapid tests. Currently, rapid tests at Mumbai and Hyderabad airports, priced at Rs 3,900, are the most expensive ones on offer in the country. The revenue share percentage taken at airports for RT-PCR/rapid RT-PCR test in the existing contracts is withdrawn till further orders, stated the letter sent by V A Chourey, AAI executive director (operations), to its regional executive directors on Monday. “The benefit of the same is to be passed on to the passengers by reducing the cost of the tests,” it said, adding that airport directors are to take necessary action with immediate effect and forward an ‘action-taken report” to his office. On Monday, Kolkata airport cut its rapid test price from Rs 4,000 to Rs 3,750 and further to Rs 2,900 on Tuesday. Chennai airport reduced the cost to Rs 2,900 from Rs 3,400. Among PPP airports, Delhi charges Rs 3,500 for rapid test, Bengaluru Rs 3,000 and Cochin Rs 2,490. Till December 5, Mumbai airport’s rapid test was priced at Rs 4,500, the most expensive in the country. Then the airport cut the cost to Rs 3,900—same as Hyderabad—but it still is the most expensive. A Mumbai International Airport Ltd spokesperson said: “We are working with test laboratories and other partners to see whether we can further bring down the cost of the rapid test.” Under the new Omicron-led testing norms, passengers arriving from ‘at-risk’ nations have to undergo RT-PCR test and wait for their results before they can leave the airport or take a connecting flight. While a regular RT-PCR test report takes 6-8 hours and costs under Rs 1,000, the rapid RT-PCR test issues a report within 13 minutes to two hours. In the past few days, a large percentage of passengers have been voluntarily opting for rapid tests. But families are the worst hit. A family of four arriving from London to Mumbai will have to pay over Rs 15,000 if they don’t want to stay put at the airport for 6-8 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hyd-airports-offer-most-expensive-rapid-tests/articleshow/88152916.cms||---

Justice Nitin Sambre granted Khan bail for Rs 25,000 PR bond and surety, but imposed conditions, including that he not make statements about the complainant, Manoj Patil, on social media or other forums. On September 16, Patil, a fo-rmer Mr India contest winner, filed a complaint at Oshiwara police station alleging that Kh-an defamed him on social media so he tried to end his life. The HC had earlier granted Kh-an interim protection till further hearing. Khan’s senior counsel Rajiv Chavan argued that sessions court had erred in denying him pre-arrest bail and the complaint was false.

---||Ahmedabad||Permanent principals: 27 of 31 posts vacant||AHMEDABAD: The posts of permanent principals in 27 out of 31 government polytechnic colleges are vacant in the state. Sources in the education department say the situation has arisen due to wrong interpretation of All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) norms by the state government. “As per the AICTE rules, the candidate eligible for the post of principal should hold a doctorate degree or should have ME/MTech degree. The government is not considering candidates with ME/MTech and is looking only for PhD holders,” said sources. There is a dearth of PhD candidates willing to take up the job and temporary posts are being created instead. In case of self-financed diploma colleges, the situation is different as they have appointed candidates with ME/MTech qualification for the post of college principals. “The council has laid down the rules for appointment of college principals but the state government has interpreted them in their own way. Some government colleges have appointed principals on a temporary basis while in other cases lecturers are working as in-charge principals,” said sources. Gujarat Technological University takes strict action against colleges that do not have a permanent principal by imposing penalty and reducing the number of seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/permanent-principals-27-of-31-posts-vacant/articleshow/88152957.cms||---

In a letter shot off to the minister on Tuesday, Shanmuga Sundaram recalled the death of three elephants after hit by a speeding train near Navakkarai recently. In the last six years, 11 elephants were killed on the Kanjikode–Madukkarai railway line, the MP said. As the tracks were built deep inside forests, poor visibility, especially during monsoon, lead to such accidents, he pointed out. “Life of elephants is under constant threat along the Kanjikode and Madukkarai railway lines. The measures suggested by the Railway Authority before the NGT, including permanent speed restriction, installing signboards and wires with low voltage at the boundary, elephant ramps, honeybee alarms, and underpasses will only interfere in the ecosystem of these mammals,” he said. He also stated that the plan to fence A and B lines between Madukkarai and Walayar stations would permanently bar elephants’ access to their water source. “A major portion of railway track B-line and track A-line falls within the forestry and restoration zone of the Nilgiris biosphere. This is the main reason why wild elephants were killed by trains. Using the alternative route will help in saving elephants,” he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mp-divert-trains-from-palakkad-via-pollachi/articleshow/88152903.cms||---

With the city receiving intermittent rain in recent days, the bus drivers said the condition of Ukkadam II bus depot has become worse. “We have raised the issue with higher officials several times, but to no avail,” said one of the drivers. The agitated drivers have shot a video of the depot filled with sludge and circulated on social media. It is at the depot where drivers park the buses after their shift and mention the issues that the buses faced in the logbook. Mechanics would go through the logbook and work on the issues to improve the vehicles’ condition. A driver, who requested anonymity, said it was very difficult to get into the bus without getting their clothes dirty. They said the depot was also poorly lit up in the early hours of the day. Another driver said, “Even if we park the buses on the front side for easy access, mechanics will move them to the far end. We have raised the issue with the depot manager, but a solution is yet to be found.” An official, meanwhile, said a road work was going on next to the depot. “Since it is a slope, rainwater flows into the depot, carrying mud. Now that the rain has stopped, things will improve in a day or two,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sludge-at-bus-depot-irks-drivers/articleshow/88152920.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Travel and tourism is linked with many industries such as transport, food and others. The tourism industry in the coastal districts, whose growth was on a positive note, especially since August, is likely to take a hit. “Being the season of weddings and Christmas, a lot of visitors from outside, and NRIs throng the city to visit their families, for pilgrimage and to unwind,” said William D’Souza, managing director of Globe Travels. He explained that a lot of bookings have already been cancelled, especially by NRIs coming from Gulf countries for Christmas holidays. “They are uncertain on what will happen in the coming days, if they come to India. Travel and tourism contribute financially towards the real estate, food and beverage sector. A lot of travellers from the Gulf book taxis to travel to far-off places from Mangaluru,” William said, while explaining that several sectors will be hit. Due to the prevailing uncertainty, those in the travel and tourism sector are unable to make any plans regarding organising events for Christmas and New Year celebrations. Sources from the industry said that before the Covid-19 pandemic, they used to organise Christmas gala and New Year events, but this year they are not sure of the same. “For the time-being, we have decided to keep the celebrations simple, with no extra events,” said a manager of a hotel. “Hotel rooms are being cancelled by many people.” Yatish Baikampady, who runs beach guest houses, is confident that the emergence of the Omicron variant will not disrupt the tourism industry. “People are still on a revenge tourism mode. Almost all the beach houses in this region have been fully booked till mid-January. It will have an impact only if there is restriction in movement.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/omicron-tourism-industry-may-take-hit/articleshow/88151395.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Total six teams have been formed for checking along with the support of police teams. However, the checking has led to long queues of private vehicles on National Highway 48. Travellers arriving in cars and buses checked for their temperature and those found with mild symptoms were subjected to rapid tests for suspected Covid-19 infection. Checking is being conducted on Bhilad, Unda, Daman and Silvassa roads. “Each team consists of two members who are checking passengers for temperature or any tell-tale symptoms. In case of any symptom, we conduct a rapid test,” said a health official. Health officials are also setting up Covid facility at a government hospital in Valsad district. “Beds in government hospitals are being kept ready,” the official said. On Tuesday, seven persons tested positive in Surat city for Covid-19. Meanwhile, the genome sequencing report of the 53-year-old Navsari doctor came negative for the Omicron variant on Tuesday. The doctor had tested positive of Covid-19 infection after eight days of his return from the UK. He landed at Mumbai and then reached Navsari. Government laboratories have also started genome sequencing tests of each positive patient to find out the variant. “We are sending all samples for genome sequencing to identify the variant. Since the number of positive persons is less, we are trying to find out variants of infection in each patient,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/ncov-checking-begins-at-gujs-entry-points/articleshow/88151418.cms||---

The students will be selected through weekly tests. A special team of teachers will train the aspirants. District chief education officer (CEO) N Geetha plans to get funding from corporates and voluntary organizations to conduct the coaching. “We plan to shortlist 100 students and offer them dedicated training by senior teachers,” Geetha said. The residential training will be offered during weekends. The district education department is in talks with some colleges for space. Residential training for government school students was offered by the state government in 2018 as private NEET coaching centres were inaccessible for these students due to high cost.  The school education department has tied up with private coaching centers to offer residential NEET coaching across Tamil Nadu. While the coaching took place in 2019, it was stopped because of the pandemic in 2020. Later, the training was offered online till this year. The chief education officer said awareness among government students about JEE was very low. A government school student from Trichy made it to the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) this year. “We want to more students from government schools to join IITs,” Geetha told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/edu-dept-to-resume-residential-coaching/articleshow/88152938.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Delhi||Delhi: DPCC notice to 3,756 industrial units for not complying with plastic waste norms||NEW DELHI: Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has served a show-cause notice to 3,756 industrial units for not registering under the Plastic Waste Management (Amended) Rules, 2016. Of these, 620 are plastic producers, 1,271 recyclers and 1,865 manufacturers. A senior official of DPCC said, “Producers, importers and brand-owners (PIBOs) are required to fulfil extended producers responsibility (EPR) for the plastic waste generated due to the products introduced by them in the market, according to Plastic Waste Management (Amended) Rules, 2016.” “EPR is the responsibility of a PIBO for environmentally sound management of the product till the end of its life. PIBOs are required to obtain registration from DPCC if they are operating in 1-2 states/UTs. The EPR action plan for plastic waste management has to be submitted for obtaining the registration,” added the official. While 889 producers are covered under the plastic waste management rules, 620 units have been identified as defaulters for not having registration. “A show-cause notice has been issued to the 620 defaulting units. A closure order has been enforced on 75 units,” said the official. Similarly, out of 1,516 recyclers covered under the plastic waste management rules, only 93 have valid registration, 152 have applied for it, while 1,271 units are defaulters. Likewise, of the 2,063 manufacturers, a show-cause notice has been served to 1,865 units. The provision of the amended rules state that EPR for management of plastic waste packaging is entrusted with the PIBOs who introduce the products in the market. They are required to establish a system for management of plastic waste generated due to their products by engaging with local bodies. The amended rules were notified by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change in August this year. Some single use items, including plastic or PVC banners less than 100 microns, cutlery, packing films around sweet boxes or invitation cards, are restricted. For phasing out single-use plastic in Delhi, the environment department on October 28 issued an advisory to government departments and autonomous bodies to use alternatives in the interest of the public. It advised them to replace plastic wrapping papers with biodegradable ones and plastic utensils with ones made of leaves or bamboo and use bamboo sticks for earbuds, balloons and flags.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dpcc-notice-to-3756-industrial-units-for-not-complying-with-plastic-waste-norms/articleshow/88152945.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Pune||Discharge Omicron patients just like severe cases: State||Pune: The Maharashtra public health department has directed districts to discharge Omicron-positive patients just like severe cases are released, in accordance with the current guidelines, states a detailed Directorate of Health Services order. The current guidelines state a severe case can only be discharged after complete clinical recovery and a negative RT-PCR result on the 10th day. On the public health measures to be undertaken in the backdrop of Omicron emergence, every district and municipal corporation has been asked to revisit their line list of positive cases from November 1, 2021. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI: “This list should be searched for any positive case with a history of international travel. Lab samples of such cases, which are with respective labs, should be referred for whole-genome sequencing as a part of routine surveillance.” He said the state is sharing with districts the line list of international travellers received from the Bureau of Immigration and downloaded from Air Suvidha App. Every district and civic body should track such cases, and conduct RT-PCR tests. If found positive, such samples should be referred for Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). “Positive cases will be admitted as per symptoms in three-tier Covid-treatment facilities and treated as per the prevalent protocol. If found negative, they would have to undergo seven days of home quarantine and tested on the eighth day. If found positive, the samples will be sent for WGS while positive passengers will be sent to a dedicated Covid facility,” Dr Awate said. A similar procedure will be followed post airport screening. Other measures include proactive search of cluster, breakthrough infection, reinfection and uncommon symptom cases to be tested with RT-PCR, ILI or SARI survey in high-risk groups and reactivation of fever clinics to screen cases from the community. All district administrations have been asked to ramp up testing: Minimum 140 tests per million per day with the proportion of RT-PCR:RAT 70:30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/discharge-omicron-patients-just-like-severe-cases-state/articleshow/88152943.cms||Neha Madaan

Police said that a group of nearly 25-30 people arrived on 20 two-wheelers and assaulted three persons as a retaliation for cases of two rioting incidents reported at Andethadka of Ilanthila village in Belthangady on Sunday. Uppinangady police had booked two separate cases in connection with rioting reported in Andethadka on Sunday. Mohandas,40, a resident of Kajekaru, has stated in his complaint filed on Tuesday, that 25-30 miscreants arrived on two-wheelers and assaulted him, his brother Ashok and another person with lethal weapons, at 7pm on Monday. Police said that Mohandas and his brother Ashok were selling fish at Subrahmanya Cross in Kasaba village when the incident was reported. The miscreants arrived by the national highway carrying lethal weapons, including swords and rods. The group attacked the complainant, Ashok and Mahesh, a customer, before fleeing from the spot. The accused were allegedly speaking in the Beary language and called each other Naushad, Ravoof, Shabeer, Ashraf and Rasheed. While Mohandas sustained injuries on his head and chest, his brother was injured critically on his right hand. Mahesh sustained bruises near his right ear, police stated. Superintendent of police Rishikesh Sonawane said that two people were arrested in connection with Sunday’s rioting case.

---||Coimbatore||App-based autos take customers for a ride||Coimbatore: G Sathish, a resident of Peelamedu, recently booked an autorickshaw to the city railway station from his house on app-based taxi aggregator Ola for Rs180 to catch his midnight train. The driver, who made a call to inquire about the pickup and drop details, sought to know the fare shown on the app and demanded an extra Rs 50 for the ride. Left with no other option, Sathish had to agree for the same. “If we don’t agree to their demands, most drivers would cancel the trip,” he says. This is when people have switched to app-based taxi aggregators like Ola to escape from the fleecing of regular taxis. “There is hardly any difference between the fare charged by the app-based autos and the regular ones. It is not worth the money to book and wait for the app-based autos.” Things aren’t any different with the app-based cabs as well. While autos demand anywhere between Rs30 and Rs50 over and above the fare shown on the app, cab drivers seek an additional Rs 50 to Rs 100 per trip. Lilly Florence, a resident of Ganapathy, said some drivers would ask the timing of the train or buses and try to fleece the customers by exploiting the situation. “Recently, I booked a cab to catch a train. When the driver demanded extra cash, I could only oblige. The driver said the cab owner had asked him to charge an extra of Rs 50 for a day trip and Rs100 for a night trip.” Auto drivers, however, said the increase in fuel price and vehicle service cost had forced them to demand more cash from the customers. “The price of diesel was less than Rs 80 a litre a year ago. Now, it is priced at Rs 92. Service cost too has increased in the past couple of years,” said an auto driver from Gandhipuram. K Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said the app-based aggregators should take stringent action against the drivers based on the complaints from the customers. “Otherwise, they will lose their credibility over a period of time. The app-based aggregators still have an edge over the regular taxies when it comes to fares. But if the issue is not addressed, there would not be any difference in the near future,” he said. He said while the government could revise the fares fixed in 2013, auto drivers were always in the habit of demanding more than the fixed amount. K Umasakthi, joint transport commissioner, Coimbatore zone, said he had received several complaints of fleecing from the customers of app-based aggregators. “People can raise complaints with us and we will take appropriate action.” A detailed email sent to Ola executives requesting their comment did not elicit any response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/app-based-autos-take-customers-for-a-ride/articleshow/88152951.cms||V Devanathan

Upkar Singh Ahuja, CICU president, and DS Chawla, UCPMA president, said, “The meeting with Union minister of industry and commerce Piyush Goyal and minister of state Som Parkash was held on Monday at Parliament House. Our delegation raised issues like continuous rise in steel prices, GST verification on purchase, government support on non validation of vehicle dismantling plant, export promotion schemes for MSME and the availability of raw material for MSME. The major point that came up for discussion was the continuous rise in steel prices, which can only be countered by formation of the steel regulatory authority. Both ministers heard our grievances patiently and also cleared their doubts on this matter after which it was decided by them that soon they would arrange our meeting with senior officials of the departments concerned and also steel manufacturers to address this problem and ensure that the MSME units get steel at competitive prices. Our delegation was quite satisfied with the meeting with the ministers and we are hopeful that the demands raised in the meeting will be fulfilled soon.” In another meeting, a delegation of cycle industrialists comprising of UCPMA general secretary Manjinder Singh Sachdeva and others met Pawan Dewan, chairman of Punjab Large Industrial Development Board, at his office.

---||Bengaluru||Omicron fear: Don’t close schools, education experts tell Karnataka govt||Bengaluru: Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh on Tuesday categorically said schools and colleges won't be shut in the backdrop of increasing Covid-19 clusters and fear of Omicron variant. His statement comes a day after the government added to the confusion by hinting at closure of educational institutions if cases continued to rise. He said schools would be closed only if there is a major emergency. Meanwhile, education experts suggested the state drop plans of cancelling offline classes as shutting down schools will affect learning capabilities and behaviour of children. Educationists suggested that the government, if compelled to close schools, should decentralise the process and allow each local level body to take the call. "One thing we have learnt over the past two years is that offline education is the only way to reach the majority of children in the state. We cannot afford to close schools one more time. Instead, we should allow schools to take the decision depending on the local situation," said Rishikesh BS, faculty at Azim Premji University. "For schools that have to close in case of any such unfortunate incident, the teachers need to prepare worksheets and send them to children for days they will miss until that school starts functioning," he added. Schools point out that they are the first to bear the brunt every time. "Schools are the first to close and last to reopen. The state government has allowed gatherings of 500 people for functions. But, they want to close down schools. It is great they have started asking for vaccine certificates for entering malls and theatres. But they should also look at alternatives for schools if they get closed like strengthening the digital ecosystem," said Nooraine Fazal, founder, Inventure Academy. The department of public instruction maintained it will follow recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee. "There are 1 crore children in the state. Even if 0.02% children turn positive, the numbers would be 2,000. Should we close down schools for all 1 crore children? Health experts have repeatedly said how children are immune and the new variants are not a threat to life," said a department official. Experts also highlight that schools in other countries in Europe are open even while cases are on an increase. No change in PU examsSome students of II PU protested in front of the department of pre-university education seeking a postponement of the mid-term exams starting on November 9. The students said it is not safe to conduct offline exams as cases are surging. However, DPUE director R Snehal said exams will continue as per schedule. "We'll instruct all colleges to take adequate precautions for smooth conduct of exams," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dont-close-schools-edu-experts-tell-ktaka-govt/articleshow/88153963.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

They said that despite the area and its surroundings being home to over 20,000 people, a 1.5 km long stretch of the road has not been completed in the last four and a half years. They threatened that no politician would be allowed to campaign in the area if the road was not constructed on the entire stretch. Worst affected are residents from localities like Netaji Park, Ram Nagar, Gautam Vihar and Green Avenue. Residents complained that street lights were missing on this route, which made travel difficult in the dark and in foggy weather. Area resident Angrej Singh said, “We have been asking MLA Kuldeep Vaid for construction of this stretch for the past 4.5 years and he has been giving one excuse or the other for the delay. Now that the election code is about to be imposed, we had to protest. We blocked traffic for about two hours on Tuesday but will do so for the entire day next time if the road is not constructed.” Saying that despite several accidents caused by potholes, residents announced that they would not support any party this time. Rahul Sharma, a resident of Apple Villa, who has a factory on the road said, “Many of my employees, especially women complain about potholes due which their two-wheelers lose balance and they fall, getting injured.” Congress MLA from Gill constituency Kuldeep Singh Vaid said, “Many roads are already built up and this small stretch will also be constructed soon. Officials are already on the job. I got roads in all the areas constructed during my tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/residents-protest-block-road-over-delay-in-road-construction/articleshow/88152959.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

CAQM had on November 16 directed Delhi and neighbouring states to take preventive measures to curb air pollution. Sharing details of the steps it has taken against polluting vehicles and industries, use of DG sets and dust-control measures since November 17, the department said it had inspected 1,432 industries so far. “On Tuesday alone, 30 teams inspected 75 industries and clusters,” an official of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said. He added that most of the industrial clusters are already running on PNG. “Only two clusters, including the one in Anand Vihar, are yet to get PNG connection. These clusters have negligible use of the gas, so distribution companies don’t see it as economically viable to connect them,” a DPCC official said, requesting anonymity. The department said of the 22,764 sites in the city inspected by 585 enforcement teams, violations related to dust pollution were found at 2,146. “A total of 2,891.52 MT of road dust had been collected for scientific disposal in designated sites/landfills,” it added. Listing other measures, the department said more than seven lakh vehicles had been inspected in the past 20 days. Of these, 21,449 vehicles were slapped with fines while 7,168 others were impounded. Moreover, diesel vehicles older than 15 years and petrol vehicles older than 10 years also faced penalties, with 749 challans issued and 1,754 of them impounded. Apart from this, 31 trucks that were found plying without any essential commodities were impounded as well. Delhi government earlier restricted the entry of trucks other than those carrying essential items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-28-7-lakh-fine-imposed-on-polluting-units/articleshow/88152999.cms||---

He was booked under sections 354 (A) (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code, 66 (B) and 67 (A) of the Information Technology Act and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women (TNPHW) Act. A police officer said Ezhanaipandi had joined as the grade-II police constable at the Coimbatore rural armed police in 2018. The woman cop, who was married, also joined the force the same year. The two were in a relationship, the officer said. Due to a difference of opinion, they separated and he moved to Tirunelveli while the woman went on to live with her husband and children. Ezhanaipandi recently started calling the woman cop and her husband stating he has obscene photos of her and would upload them on social media. Unable to bear the mental torture, the woman lodged a complaint with the rural cybercrime police. Police registered a case against Ezhanaipandi and arrested him on Monday. He was remanded in judicial custody the same night. Further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/constable-held-for-harassing-woman-cop/articleshow/88152960.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Saundhatti and Ambil yatras called off again||Kolhapur: The famous annual Saundhatti fair in Belagavi district and the Ambil yatra in Kolhapur district have been cancelled due to the Omicron threat. The annual fairs at the temples of Goddess Renuka, or Yallama, at the two places are usually held in December every year. After the Saundhatti yatra, the annual Ambil yatra takes place on the next full-moon day. Lakhs of devotees from in and around Kolhapur and Belagavi districts arrive at these temples to seek the blessings of Goddess Renuka. Last year too, the annual fairs wre called off due to the pandemic. Earlier, both these regions had witnessed a major spike in Covid cases, which had forced the local authorities to call off the fairs. This time, however, both region have low Covid count, but the fairs have been cancelled as a precautionary measure. Statements issued by the authorities of both the temples said that since it is difficult to ensure social distancing and avoid contact between the devotees, the fairs have been cancelled. The collectors of both the districts held talks with the temple authorities before the decisions were announced. The three-day Saundhatti fair usually takes place at the hill-locked temple. Most devotees come from Kolhapur. The local yatra samitis arrange vehicles for the devotees free of cost. The devotees from Karnataka’s Belagavi region arrive in large numbers to Kolhapur to attend the Ambil yatra. It is believed that the goddess gives strength to women and, therefore, women take part in large numbers in these fairs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/saundhatti-and-ambil-yatras-called-off-again/articleshow/88153496.cms||---

The drive started after complaints of rash and negligent driving under the influence of alcohol mounted. Cops with latest breathalyser devises are conducting checks at strategic places such as Beach Road, Jodugullapalem, and Dwarakanagar in the city. “We stopped the drive in March 2020 after the outbreak of Covid-19 to avoid the risk of transmission of virus. We resumed the drive on November 30 after motorists complained that some youngsters under the influence of the liquor were riding bikes and cars at high speeds. There were also accidents in the city due to drunk driving,” said ADCP (traffic) Ch Adinarayana. We have registered 233 cases of drunken driving in the past six days and highest single-day cases of 50 was reported on Sunday (December 5). We are chalking out plans to expand the drive to more areas, Adinarayana added. “Section 185 of MV Act says motorists can be booked for drunk driving if his/her blood alcohol content (BAC) is more than 30 mg per 100 ml blood. Once the motorist is caught for drunk driving, the motorist has to be produced before a local court and can be fined up to Rs 10,000 or jailed for a period of up to six months,” the police added. “Under the influence of the liquor, some motorists have hit the dividers and other vehicles. We have observed that over seven to eight accidents occurred due to drunken driving in the past few weeks,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/drunk-driving-checks-back-after-20-months/articleshow/88151422.cms||Nalla.Babu

Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, told TOI: “The Omicron variant cases in India are sporadic and travel related. The cases detected are mild, and most of the patients are asymptomatic and under observation. As of now, cases have not been found in any major clusters and there is definitely no community transmission, as had been reported in South Africa or even the UK.” He said they (task force members) did not see the state implementing any “lockdown” because the cases were too few now. The state till Monday evening had reported 10 Omicorn cases—seven from Pune and three from Mumbai. Besides, cases were reported from Karnataka, Gujarat and Delhi. With the country stepping up vigil to track international passengers, Dr Joshi said there was a need for citizens with travel history to make voluntary disclosure. “The Delta variant is phasing out, but there is no clue if it would be displaced by Omicron in. Anyway, the number of cases is too small,” he said. — Nisha Nambiar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-no-community-transmission-of-new-variant-yet-says-experts/articleshow/88152962.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Damodar Mauzo wins India’s highest literary prize||GOA: For me, language and literature is a means, not an end in itself; means to improve the quality of life. I never wrote in the hope of seeking fame or readership. It gives me joy, no doubt, when others read my works, but I find great fulfillment if a reader identifies with it (literary piece) and tries to change his ways,” eminent Konkani writer Damodar Mauzo had once told TOI in an interview. So on Tuesday, when Bhartiya Jnanpith announced Mauzo to have bagged the 57th Jnanpith award 2022, the acclaimed writer was as modest as ever — acknowledging greetings from hordes of Konkani mogis who called on him at his Majorda house and answering phone calls that never stopped ringing with his trademark ear-to-ear effusive grin. Mauzo is the second Konkani writer to receive the highest literary award, presented annually by Bharatiya Jnanpith. Ravindra Kelekar had won the 42nd Jnanpith award for 2006, the first-ever awarded to an author writing in Konkani, presented in July 2010. The Jnanpith award, started in 1961, is presented to an author for his “outstanding contribution towards literature”. Two attributes of his personality have reflected in Mauzo’s literary works. The Sahitya Akademi award winner loves to describe himself as a perfectionist, one who pays attention to details and “trying to be as perfect as possible.” For him, accuracy is sacrosanct. “I try to find the shortest way to do things. This aspect of my personality has crept into my writings. Once you know where you are going, you can find the shortest route to reach there. Because of this, I call myself a short story writer. Irrespective of the length of my short stories — some of them average 35 pages — all of them perfectly fit into the definition of a short story,” Mauzo had told TOI. His works have been translated into at least 12 languages, including English and Hindi, and that has made Mauzo strike a chord with the readers and writers of other regional languages as well. Mauzo is of the view that while nuances and differences of language and dialect do get lost in translation, there is no such loss in the appeal of the content. What sets Mauzo’s works apart from that of other Konkani litterateurs is that most of his writings depict the lifestyle of the Goan Catholic community in a very realistic manner. The bonhomie shared between the Hindu and Catholic communities in Goa is also prominently and effectively depicted in most of his works. His first novel, ‘Karmelin’ (1981), which won him the 1983 Sahitya Akademi award, portrayed the trials and tribulations of Goan women working as babysitters in the Gulf countries. “Never before had this subject come into any language, not even in Kerala literature. For the first time in the history of Konkani literature, the Catholic community got reflected in Karmelin,” was what Mauzo had said about his award-winning work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/damodar-mauzo-wins-indias-highest-literary-prize/articleshow/88152963.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The incident happened on December 4 and the victim Taufiq Rayani’s body was found in the parked truck near Kapurai crossroads on national highway 48. Rayani, a native of Uttar Pradesh, had reached Vadodara along with the helpers Fukran Indraraj and Mohammed Naseem.  According to the complaint filed by Gufran Ali Pathan, Taufiq had called Pathan on December 4 and informed him that he had reached the Tandalja area. When Pathan called him the next day, Taufiq’s phone was switched off. Pathan inquired further and learnt that Taufiq never crossed Halol toll plaza.  He also contacted some transporters who told him that the truck was seen near Kapurai Crossroads. When Pathan reached there, he found Taufiq’s body in the truck. Police investigations revealed that Indraraj and Naseem had got into heated arguments with Taufiq over money. One of them attacked Taufiq with some sharp object and caused injury on his throat.

Gumfabai Bhalerao’s lawyer Kartik Sharma told TOI, “Gumfabai Bhalerao had lodged a complaint with the Mukundwadi area police station in November 9, but the police did not act on it. Following this, she lodged a complaint with the Aurangabad commissioner of police, but in vain.” The lawyer added that she moved court seeking directives to the Aurangabad police to register a case against the minister. The woman, in her petition, has stated that her family hails from Varud Tofa in Risod of Washim district, where the family is known and respected as Mahaar community members. Citing Malik’ allegations that Sameer Wankhede is Muslim and his father’s name is Dawood, she has stated that: “In Aurangabad and other places, where other family members reside, they are being obstructed by community members from visiting Buddha Vihar for worship.” She claimed that community members are taunting her and her family members by saying that they are Muslims and asking to go to a mosque, instead of the Buddha Vihar for prayers. The plea further stated that by giving false information as well as by lodging complaints with different authorities and also withthe minister of social justice, and talking about Sameer Wankhede’s caste, the minister has provoked the officials to use their power against the NCB official. She claimed that the same amounted to a violation of the SC ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. She has demanded registration of an FIR under relevant sections of the SC/ST Atrocities act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/wankhedes-aunt-moves-court-to-seek-registration-of-offence-against-malik/articleshow/88150763.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mangaluru||Police harassing law student in the name of probe: Activist||Mangaluru: A social activist has alleged that the law student, who filed a case of attempt to rape against senior advocate KSN Rajesh, is being mentally harassed and called for investigation without any valid reasons. Activist Prasanna Ravi, who has come in support of All College Student’s Association and the victim, while addressing media persons on Tuesday, alleged that the victim is being called for investigation whenever the association plans for a protest or any activities to demand justice. “When the student organisation requests police for nod to organise peaceful protests to demand justice, they are denied permission citing election code of conduct. However, they (police) allow others to do the same (protest). Why is the police department silencing their voices,” she asked. Meanwhile, she also criticised the department’s inability to trace the accused, who is still at large even after 50 days. “The city police commissioner has all his personal time to sing, dance and do other non-policing activities, but there’s no development when it comes to this case. He is also not meeting us in person to discuss the case. Whenever we raise our voice, the police commissioner conducts a press conference on the development of the case. Last time when we questioned, he spoke about a lookout notice being served against the accused.” She also alleged that ACP South sub-division Ranjith Bhandaru harassed the victim citing investigation. The victim was called to the ACP office without any reasons, in the name of investigation. “She was also not provided with any female police constable during the journey to the office or no vehicle most of the time. The current case should be handed over to DCP Hariram Shankar,” she demanded. The association members also threatened that they will go for an indefinite hunger strike if the accused is not arrested at the earliest. “It’s not right to comment on the personal space of a police officer and things I do outside after my office hours. We are working on the case and are investing a lot of time on it. Some cases are detected within hours or a few days, but some take long. We are sure to come to a logical end to this case. An able IPS officer is deputed to oversee the case and there is no necessity to change him,” said N Shashi Kumar, city police commissioner, Mangaluru||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/police-harassing-law-student-in-the-name-of-probe-activist/articleshow/88151430.cms||---

The scheme was introduced to encourage farmers to use renewable energy to increase their production. An official from the agricultural engineering department said last year, 23 farmers in the district were beneficiaries of the scheme and we expect more farmers will benefit this year. The department is yet to get an order from the state government on identifying beneficiaries for this year. Farmers can also apply for solar-powered dryers, which will help farmers to add value to their products and get better returns. The department is ready to set up solar-powered dryer using polycarbonate-sheeted greenhouse spreading from 400 square feet to 1,000 square feet. Small and tiny scale farmers, scheduled caste and scheduled tribe farmers and woman farmers can get the dryer facility at 40% subsidy or up to Rs 3.5 lakh, whichever is lesser. Others would receive 40% subsidy or Rs 3 lakh, whichever is lesser, for the setting up the facility, the official said. A farmer can also set up solar-powered fencing up to two acres and get 40% subsidy or Rs 1.35 lakh, whichever is lesser. Farmers can contact 0422-2434838, 0422-2966500 and 04259-237271 for further details.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/get-subsidy-by-installing-solar-pumps-agri-dept-to-farmers/articleshow/88152964.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Online hotel booking service fined for denying accommodation||Ludhiana: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has ordered an online Hotels and Homes Service (Oyo rooms) to pay Rs 25,000 to a customer for acute deficiency of service for alleged denial of rooms booked and prepaid by him. The commission also ordered the company to refund Rs 25,506 to the customer, Dr Kulwant Singh of Guru Nanak Colony. The complainant said that he, along with his fellow doctors, intended to visit Nainital during summer vacation, for which he booked four rooms in a hotel from the website of the opposite party on June 7, 2017. The complainant paid Rs 42,200 for booking of four rooms from his bank account. The complainant received the confirmation of booking through a whatsapp message on his mobile number. When the complainant, his family and friends reached the hotel concerned at Mallital (Nainital) at about 8pm and showed the booking confirmation to staff on duty, the staff refused to acknowledge any booking. The complainant contacted the opposite parties and complained about non-availability of rooms but were refused any help. The complainant had to stay at another hotel after paying much higher tariff. When the complainant requested the opposite party for refund of the booking amount, they only refunded Rs 14,494. It was alleged that this amounts to deficiency of service and unfair trade practice on the part of the respondents. According to respondents, the booking was only for four persons instead of four families or 16 persons, as alleged by the complainant. Even in the confirmation message, it was specifically mentioned that the booking of four rooms was for four guests. The complainant was refused room accommodation for four families of 16 persons. Due to peak season, there was no refund policy, but as a goodwill gesture, they refunded one night tariff. The commission held that the booking was of four rooms for four guests, it is unthinkable that there could be a restriction of stay of just one person in one room. In the event of stay of more than two persons, especially kids with the couple/parents, the hotel usually charges extra for an extra bed for additional person/child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/online-hotel-booking-service-fined-for-denying-accommodation/articleshow/88152967.cms||Shariq Majeed

The state’s target was to vaccinate all adult beneficiaries with the first dose and those who had skipped the second shot by December 31. Maharashtra, though, still yet to vaccinate 100% beneficiaries in the healthcare and frontline worker categories, with whom the inoculation programme had started. Maharashtra on Tuesday crossed the 120 million (12.02 crore) Covid vaccine dose mark. Official records till December 5 (Sunday) revealed 4.4 crore people have so far received both doses of the Covid vaccine. As many as 17 districts continued to lag in terms of vaccinating health workers. In the frontline worker category, 19 districts were behind the state average. The lowest complete vaccination among health workers has been registered in Jalna (79.4%), followed by Aurangabad (82.5%) and Sindhudurg (82.9%). Among frontline workers, the lowest vaccination is registered in Gondia (79.6%), followed by Jalna (82.1%) and Osmanabad (83.1%). A senior government official attributed the trend to the possibility of many frontline workers taking their second dose in the general category. “It’s been 10 months since vaccination started. There is no other possible reason other than vaccine hesitancy,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-10-health-frontline-staff-still-to-take-2-jabs-in-state/articleshow/88152987.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Goa||Goa: Soon, a Rs 317-crore tender for Zuari bridge towers||PANAJI: A tender will soon be floated by the state public works department for the construction of observatory towers and viewing galleries atop the new Zuari bridge. At Rs 317 crore, the works will also include construction of approaches to get to the tower, decorative lighting for the structures, and development of parking facilities. Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, has said that the towers atop the new eight-lane Zuari bridge are expected to rival the Eiffel tower as an international tourist attraction. As per the plans, two high-viewing towers are proposed to be built over the bridge, which are expected to offer spellbinding views of the River Zuari. Each tower is expected to be at least 110m high from water level, and the project is planned to include an observatory and viewing gallery, art gallery, besides a revolving restaurant. The area below the Zuari bridge on the Agassaim side will be developed into a parking space for visitors to the tower. A permanent walkway will take visitors from this parking space to a high-speed passenger lift, which will carry them to the top of the towers. As per the brief provided by the Union ministry of road transport and highways, the design of the towers should be unique and should resemble none of such existing structures in the world. This international tourism project is expected to charge visitors an entry fee for the experience. In 2019, the contractors constructing the new Zuari bridge, Dilip Buildcon, are believed to have submitted designs for the towers, created by designers of the bridge itself from Paris. However, no approval came from the ministry for these designs. The eight-lane new Zuari bridge is an ambitious Rs 2,700 crore project, which is nearing completion. The bridge’s approach roads will taper into four lanes. The project stretches from Verna junction to Bambolim, covering a distance of 13.6 km. Over 7km is being constructed at an elevated level to allow traffic to pass from below. It will enable vehicles using the bridge to pick up speed, on the lines of an expressway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-a-rs-317cr-tender-for-zuari-bridge-towers/articleshow/88152974.cms||---

However, the interim orders in force in these petitions till now are extended till December 20, 2021, to enable petitioners to challenge this order. On August 3, 2018, the Supreme Court had restored the preliminary notification issued on December 30, 2008 by reversing the orders passed by both the single and division bench of the Karnataka high court and directed authorities to issue a final notification within three months, without excluding any acquired land.The BDA issued a final notification on October 30, 2018. Basappa and others had challenged both these notifications. However, dismissing the petitions, Justice SR Krishna Kumar pointed out that restoration of the preliminary notification by the Supreme Court on August 3, 2018 with respect to the entire extent of 3,546 acres 12 guntas would relate back to the date of the original preliminary notification of December 30, 2008. This would validate, confirm and affirm the preliminary notification with effect from December 30, 2008 onwards and not from any later date. "Consequently, all acts, deeds and things as well as all transactions, documents. etc, which have been done or come into existence after December 30, 2008, by or at the instance of any person in respect of any portion of the notified land measuring 3546 acres 12 guntas would get subsumed by the judgment of the apex Court and become subject to the outcome of the acquisition proceedings pursuant to the preliminary notification," the judge said in his order. With regard to the final notification, Justice Krishna Kumar is of the view that in the backdrop of the orders passed by Supreme Court, the scope of interference in the present petitions is extremely restricted and limited and added there is no merit in any contentions urged by petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-nixes-pleas-against-bda-land-acquisition/articleshow/88153970.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Court tells lawyers to inspect tallest building in G’nagar||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday appointed two young lawyers as court commissioner to inspect the tallest building in the old Gandhinagar city after a complaint that the building continued to grow higher even after the civic body revoked its development permission citing structural irregularities. The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri was hearing a PIL filed by an ex-councillor of Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC), Pinkyben Patel, complaining that a multi-storied has been put up without development permission and has been occupied and utilized without any occupancy certificate from the civic authorities. Petitioner’s counsel Hardik Pandit submitted that the civic body did not take action against the developer J K Infrastructure because of involvement of ex-mayor Ritaben Patel. The lawyer argued that while the authorities carried out a sealing drive for want of development permission, the civic body took no action against this building despite repeated representations. The GMC maintained that it has been issuing notices to the developer in this regard. For the developer, it was submitted that the permission to put up eight floors was granted, but with an amendment in the General Development Control Regulations they applied for a revised permission because they were entitled to put up three more floors. On the other hand, the civic body revoked the development permission on the ground that there were certain structural irregularities found in the construction of the building. When the developer’s advocate termed the litigation as personal vendetta and argued that the objection was raised by a leader of the opposition party, the chief justice commented, “That is how it comes out. Otherwise this would not have come out.” The judge termed it whistleblowing. When the court found conflicting claims, it invited two youngest members of the bar present in courtroom – Diksha Pandya and Aditya Patel — and tasked them to carry out an inspection of the building on Wednesday and asked them to prepare a report on whether the building has been occupied, what is the status of construction, electricity, water and drainage connections. The court commissioners have been ordered to submit their report in a sealed cover by December 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-tells-lawyers-to-inspect-tallest-building-in-gnagar/articleshow/88153102.cms||---

The cops said that the concerned authorities have been asked to be present before the investigating officials for questioning. The police said that not providing information about a crime in such cases is a non-cognizable offence and hence they had to take the permission of the court before summoning the trustees. “The court gave us the permission on Tuesday. We will now question the trustees as to why they didn’t inform the cops after they learnt about the alleged sexual assault on the girl,” said D S Chauhan, ACP (crime). Investigators will also focus on gathering evidence, if any, that the girl, who later committed suicide in a train at Valsad, may have given to any one of the trustees. The crime branch had on Monday booked two trustees and an employee of the trust for covering up the alleged gang rape. Managing trustee Priti Shah, trustee Sanjeev Shah and employee Vaishnavi Taparia were booked for covering up rape of the girl. They will have to appear before the crime branch. The police said that if they get enough evidence against the accused, they may arrest the trio in the coming days. Investigations have revealed that the 18-year-old girl had informed Vaishnavi about her alleged rape and the trustees too were apprised of the incident. But the trustees didn’t inform the police or even the girl’s parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-summon-trustees-of-vadodara-institute/articleshow/88151446.cms||---

Two samples each from Kozhikode, Malappuram and Ernakulam, and one each from Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta have tested negative. Two more results are awaited. The samples of those who tested Covid-19-positive, and arriving from ‘at risk’ nations, are sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant. The genome sequencing is being done at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram. Meanwhile, one more person from a high-risk nation tested positive on arrival at Kozhikode airport. “Though the first set of samples have tested negative for Omicron, there should be no lack of vigil,” said health minister Veena George.  Those coming from high-risk countries, included in the list issued by the Centre, are being screened and tested at the four airports in the state, said the health minister. There was confusion over people coming from Russia, since it was not included in the Centre’s list in the first phase. Hence, the people who arrived in Kochi from Russia were allowed to go without testing. But now, all these people have been tracked and their contacts are also being traced, she added. AAI reduces Rapid PCR charges at Karipur airport In a relief to UAE-bound travellers from Calicut International Airport, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has reduced the cost of mandatory Rapid PCR tests required for travellers from Tuesday. Airport director R Mahalingam said that AAI has reduced the cost of Rapid PCR test from Rs 2,490 to Rs 1,580. The new rates came into effect on Tuesday.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Omicron negative in 8 of 10 samples tested||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/KOZHIKODE: It’s a huge sigh of relief for the state as eight of the ten samples sent for genomic sequencing to detect the presence of Omicron variant of coronavirus has become negative. Two samples each from Kozhikode, Malappuram and Ernakulam, and one each from Thiruvananthapuram and Pathanamthitta have tested negative. Two more results are awaited. The samples of those who tested Covid-19-positive, and arriving from ‘at risk’ nations, are sent for genome sequencing to determine the variant. The genome sequencing is being done at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram. Meanwhile, one more person from a high-risk nation tested positive on arrival at Kozhikode airport. “Though the first set of samples have tested negative for Omicron, there should be no lack of vigil,” said health minister Veena George.  Those coming from high-risk countries, included in the list issued by the Centre, are being screened and tested at the four airports in the state, said the health minister. There was confusion over people coming from Russia, since it was not included in the Centre’s list in the first phase. Hence, the people who arrived in Kochi from Russia were allowed to go without testing. But now, all these people have been tracked and their contacts are also being traced, she added. AAI reduces Rapid PCR charges at Karipur airport In a relief to UAE-bound travellers from Calicut International Airport, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has reduced the cost of mandatory Rapid PCR tests required for travellers from Tuesday. Airport director R Mahalingam said that AAI has reduced the cost of Rapid PCR test from Rs 2,490 to Rs 1,580. The new rates came into effect on Tuesday. He said that the rates were reduced after AAI decided to forgo its revenue share. People’s representatives and expat organizations have been raising the demand to reduce the Rapid PCR test charges, which had come as a burden on expats going to the UAE mostly for employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/omicron-ve-in-eight-of-10-samples-tested/articleshow/88152294.cms||---

The state’s eligible population for the vaccine is 9.14 crore. On Tuesday, when close to eight lakh people took the shot, state additional chief secretary (health) Dr Pradeep Vyas said the state had crossed the 120-million mark of Covid vaccine doses. “Maharashtra achieved the 100-million mark on November 9 and crossed 110 million on November 25,” he added. “Till now, Maharashtra has administered 12,02,70,585 Covid vaccine doses,” said Dr Vyas on Tuesday. A breakup of the number reveals that 4.37 crore people or 47.81% of the state's adult population-- had received both the doses of the Covid vaccine. The number of people who have taken at least the first shot stands at 7.65 crore or 83.69% of the eligible population. Since November 29, the state has been witnessing a daily turnout of between nine and 12 lakh that is much higher than the turnout in October and early November. The Covid vaccination drive, which began on January 16, hit a lull during the Navratri festival in October with barely two lakh people taking the shot daily; experts felt this was because people had lost their fear against Covid due to the drop in daily cases and deaths. Meanwhile, 74,009 people took the shot in Mumbai on Tuesday, with almost 77% of the city's 92.3 lakh adult population fully vaccinated. Around 104% of the target population have received at least one vaccine (this is because residents of other nearby corporations have taken their shots in Mumbai). BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said that less than 0.39% of the fully vaccinated people in Mumbai had got breakthrough infection (falling ill despite getting vaccinated). This works out to be roughly 28,000, said BMC officials. “The good news is that most of the patients with breakthrough infection have had mild symptoms,” he said. The four genomic surveys done at Kasturba Hospital laboratory between August and November have shown that severe disease, and deaths were more in the unvaccinated population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-breakthrough-infections-in-4-cases-12cr-doses-in-state/articleshow/88152997.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Bizmen now seek abolition of professional tax||Ludhiana: After the Punjab government doing away with VAT assessments, businessmen are now demanding abolition of professional tax in the state. According to City Inc, threat of penalties and other setbacks due to professional tax notices and pending dues looms large on them and given the hassles involved in complying with it, the government should scrap it immediately. According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners Suppliers Association Ludhiana, “No doubt the state government has done a good thing to do away with VAT assessments for the year 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. But until the Rs 2,400 per year professional tax levied on the businessmen and other income tax payers is done away with, our burden is not going to decrease. Already several notices have been served to the businessmen for not taking professional tax number and not paying the professional tax that is not justified and rather than introducing any amnesty scheme for these notices, the state government should abolish this tax immediately.” According to Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers Association Ludhiana, “Amidst so many other taxes and expenditures like GST, income tax, provident fund and ESI, professional tax too is very complicated and not only requires time, but money is also spent on for complying with professional tax. It is our request to the state government that when on one side it is advocating reducing the burden of compliances and permissions then why it does not do away with the professional tax.” According to Sunil Mehra, state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, “Ever since the professional tax was introduced in the state, the government has earned nothing out of it and resources and time of officials and taxpayers too has been wasted. As it has proved to be complete failure, the same should be abolished so that everyone can heave a sigh of relief. We have written to Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi urging him to abolish this tax and in case our demand is not met, we will hit the roads.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bizmen-now-seek-abolition-of-professional-tax/articleshow/88152998.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Pune||4 attack 2 Metro officials trying to stop theft on site||Pune: Two Metro officials were injured after they were attacked by four men who tried to steal iron plates from a Metro construction site in Yerawada around 1am on November 26. MahaMetro traffic officer Dnyaneshwar Khanderao Bendre (62) sustained a leg fracture while site supervisor Anil Gaikwad fractured his finger, police said. The two were admitted to a private hospital and they lodged a complaint on Monday after being discharged from the hospital. This is the second incident of an attempt to steal construction material from a metro site over the last two weeks. Sub-inspector Ravindrakumar Warangule of the Yerawada police told TOI that the incident took place near a BRTS bus stop on the Pune-Ahmednagar Road. “The four men came to the spot in an autorickshaw and were picking up steel plates used for constructing Metro pillars and other work. Officials at the site spotted them and tried to stop them,” said Warangule. “The four men then kicked and punched Bendre and Gaikwad and also assaulted them with heavy stones. They left the spot without stealing anything,” Warangule said. Police have registered a case for offences under Sections 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons), 352 (assaults or use of criminal force), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. On November 24, a gang of four men attacked a 23-year-old Pune Metro supervisor who stopped them from stealing scrap steel from a site at Bopodi. The four suspects assaulted Saurabh Gaikwad with cement blocks and the handle of a chopper. The Khadki police, investigating the Bopodi case, are yet to make progress after registering a case under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery) of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-attack-2-metro-officials-trying-to-stop-theft-on-site/articleshow/88152310.cms||---
---||Nagpur||225km Eastern Mah E-way to connect Gadchiroli, Gondia to Samrudddhi Mahamarg||Nagpur: The access controlled Nagpur-Mumbai super communication expressway, titled Samruddhi Mahamarg, will become the first road from one end of the state, at Mumbai in the west, to Gadchiroli in the east. Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Limited (MSRDC) has floated a tender for appointment of a consultant for extension of Samruddhi Mahamarg from Nagpur district to Gondia and Gadchiroli districts, titled as Eastern Maharashtra Expressway (EME).As per the tender floated a day ago, the EME is likely to stretch 225km from Nagpur to Gondia and Gadchiroli. TOI had first reported about MSRDC’s plan on November 29.MSRDC vice-chairman and managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar told TOI, “Consultant will study feasibility of the project and also give detailed report on advantages to the state as well as linking districts. If it materializes, the expressway will be, of course, first-of-its kind access from one side of the state to other covering several districts,” he said.MSRDC sources said, “Alignment from district to Gondia and Gadchiroli is not finalized and will be worked out by the consultant as it will be an outright new road. Project will have to take care of forests and mines. Samruddhi Mahamarg will start from Shivmadka on city’s outskirts. After 11km, first inter-change is at Datala. Most suitable point for beginning of EME seems Datala inter-change.”Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who proposed the Samruddhi Mahamarg, said, “It is a good decision. But this government only announces projects and does nothing. This project is being discussed as now Bhandara and Gondia are going to elections.”Energy minister Nitin Raut said, “Samruddhi Mahamarg being developed by MVA government will become lifeline of Vidarbha with addition of EME. Gondia and Gadchiroli are Maoist-affected and tribal districts. Infrastructure development and easy connectivity with second capital, other parts of the state and Mumbai will boost agriculture and industrial production in these districts. It will also help curbing Maoists. Government should also take up expressway from Gadchiroli to Hyderabad from Sironcha-Kaleshwaram, and Gadchiroli to Raipur, and link them with EME,” he said.Describing the new project as encouragement for trade and commerce, president of Chamber of Associations of Maharashtra Industry and Trade (CAMIT) Dipen Agrawal said, “Socio economic problems of Gondia and Gadchiroli districts may end with this project. Also, it will encourage agriculture-related trade. Sponge iron is in abundance in Gadchiroli. Conveyance through this project may come as big relief for many industries in the district and other parts of the state.”Total length of Samruddhi Mahamarg will rise to over 900km. Currently, it is 701km expressway with width of 120meter in 10 districts. The new project is likely to be around 225km. Three more districts will be linked, with some parts of Bhandara district likely to come along the expressway.As per recent statements of MSRDC minister Eknath Shinde, the stretch from the district to Shirdi is likely to be completed by December end.BOX‘MAHA’MARG IN REAL SENSE* 701-km Samruddhi Mahamarg with width of 120m under construction* Begins from outskirts of Nagpur, connects to Mumbai via 10 districtsMSRDC minister Eknath Shinde announced Mahamarg will open from city to Shirdi by December endGovernment has proposed Eastern Maharashtra Expressway of 225kmIt may begin from Datala inter-change and pass via Bhandara to Gondia and GadchiroliMSRDC has floated tender for appointment of consultant||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/225km-eastern-mah-e-way-to-connect-gadchiroli-gondia-to-samrudddhi-mahamarg/articleshow/88152316.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Nearly 400 stalls have been set up of which 380 — non-traditional ones — are along the promenade, from the city’s ferry point till Kala Academy, while the traditional stalls have been set up near the Church Square.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BJP cites CAG, says coastal road project report is ‘flawed’||Mumbai: The BJP has sought answers from the civic administration and the ruling Shiv Sena on the delay in submitting an undertaking to the Union ministry for environment, forests and climate change that no residential or commercial construction will be allowed along the coastal road. It has also sought to know why a plan to prevent unauthorised constructions along the road has not been prepared and submitted to the Centre as also a plan for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the fishing community. The BMC, in a press release, said no fraud or irregularities have been committed in the coastal road project. Addressing a press conference at the state BJP headquarters in Mumbai on Tuesday, BJP leader Ashish Shelar said he is only highlighting what the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has said in its report on the coastal road. “Mumbaikars have a right to know why reclamation has been carried out the absence of experts, why no traffic analysis has been done and why such a flawed detailed project report (DPR) as highlighted by the CAG,” he said. Shelar said the BJP was not opposed to the project but was highlighting the “irregularities” committed by the corporation in public interest. “We have already raised the issue of Rs 1,600 crore being paid in excess to the consultants and contractors. The CAG report bears out our complaints,” he said. According to the CAG report, the BMC under the BMC Act, is not entitled to build tunnels for the coastal road, said Shelar. “Since all these issues concern the environment, the state environment minister must answer to the people of Mumbai,” he said. Rebutting the allegations, the BMC said the DPR finalised by M/s Stup and Ernst & Young was published on its website in 2015 with a traffic analysis. It further said the BMC had issued a circular in 2019 about no construction to be allowed along the coastal road. Both documents have been submitted to the MoEFCC and accepted by them, said the press release. The civic corporation has appointed Tata Institute of Social Sciences to carry out a study of the fisherfolk and its recommendations will be acted upon. The 90 hectare reclamation it said is being done under the supervision of experts. Also, the Supreme Court has allowed the BMC to carry out reclamation, build the road and secure it and 70 hectares is to be developed as open spaces with approval from the apex court, it said, adding all payments to contractors are done following due procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-cites-cag-says-coastal-road-project-report-is-flawed/articleshow/88153866.cms||Clara Lewis
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MU move to rent out plot for shoot opposed||Mumbai: The Mumbai University’s decision to allot a five-acre land on its Kalina campus for shooting a web series has met with opposition from some quarters. Teachers have claimed that the biodiversity on the campus will be disturbed due to the film set. A senate member even claimed that the decision was arbitrary. The land next to Ambedkar Bhavan has been given on rent for Rs 2 lakh per acre per month to the production house for more than six months, said a university official. Balaji Kendre, professor and head of sociology department, in a letter to the university’s registrar, said that he is not opposed to renting out university land for film shooting in an existing setting without disturbing the natural habitat of vulnerable species on the campus. He added that the administration can raise money through corporate social responsibility to conserve the natural habitat of the species instead. Senate member Sudhakar Tamboli said the university’s decision seemed arbitrary. “On what basis did the university decide to give it to one organisation and not to others. Everyone would want to use the space available on the campus. Is there a policy in place for renting out university campus?” he asked. A university official said that the shooting permission has been granted after approval from the management council. “No decision is taken by a single person. The rent, the duration, the sound pollution, and impact on biodiversity were discussed before giving permission. We have allowed only woodwork. And the grass was pruned in some regions, which we anyway do annually,” said the registrar. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mu-move-to-rent-out-plot-for-shoot-opposed/articleshow/88153550.cms||---

More than 600 international students have been admitted so far, compared to about 550 last year. The number is likely to go up as the university has offered admissions to over 2,000 foreign students. With over 100 students, Afghanistan accounts for the highest number of admissions offered. Till now, 80 of them have accepted. This is followed by Nepal, with 60-odd admissions offered by DU. “Admissions this time have been better than what we saw last year. As of December 5, the number of confirmed admissions has already crossed 600. Last year, we had offered admissions to about 900 students, of whom 550 had accepted,” Dr Amarjiva Lochan, deputy dean (foreign students), DU, said. Lochan said due to the prevailing conditions in Afghanistan, several aspirants were still in the process of obtaining their e-visas. “Many students have already started joining the programmes online. Government authorities are also trying to facilitate the e-visa process and help them. Some of the students may also arrive via a third country. Whenever they are able to come, they are most welcome,” he said. Applicants who fulfil the eligibility requirements and are recommended for admission by the respective admission committee are issued a provisional admission letter by DU’s foreign students’ registry (FSR). “A provisional admission letter does not guarantee a seat in any specific college of the university. The college is allotted by the FSR,” the university guidelines state. According to officials, aspirants have time till December 31 to confirm their admissions to the various courses, including Ph.D and research programmes. The university reserves 5% of its seats for foreign students and they are admitted to various programmes either under the self-financing category or through scholarship schemes offered by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/intake-of-foreign-students-at-du-up-most-from-af/articleshow/88153014.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

Mohol said that according to a report of the technical committee, the proposed changes were not feasible as it would lead to an escalation in expenses between Rs23crore and Rs70 crore and increase work duration by two years.  “To increase the height, one option proposed was dismantling of 39 pillars of Metro viaduct and their reconstruction. Another option proposed was dismantling of 17 pillars and their reconstruction. It now appears that the work has to go ahead as per the existing plan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lakdi-pul-work-gets-mayors-nod/articleshow/88152324.cms||---

They have been demanding a span of 200 metres between columns as against 60 metres being provided. In a letter to the BMC as well as to environment minister Aditya Thackeray who is the local MLA, they had pointed out the span between the sea link in front of Cleveland Bunder is already narrow and the coastal road connector bridge will add more columns. “The BMC had assured us they would hold a meeting on December 12. On Monday, several men had turned up. Today (Tuesday) they came with a large posse of policemen and started work which we blocked,” said a fisherman.

---||Delhi||AAP slams EDMC over ‘property tax notice to temples’||NEW DELHI: Claiming that East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) had sent property tax notices to several religious places, including gurdwaras and temples, AAP MLA Atishi on Monday alleged that the civic body had also warned to seal them if they failed to pay the tax. AAP alleged that the corporation had lost funds to corruption and now wanted to tax religious places too. Atishi said this was the first time in the history of Delhi that temples were being forced to pay house tax. “EDMC sent notices to several temples saying they must pay house tax, otherwise they would be sealed. This is the first time since the rule of Aurangzeb that somebody has dared to send such a notice to a temple. In 1679, Aurangzeb had imposed Jizya tax on temples. In 2021, EDMC has done the same. This is the real face of BJP. What kind of a government asks temples to pay property tax?” asked Atishi, while demanding that the order be rolled back immediately. The legislator stated that under BJP’s governance, EDMC had been constantly failing to pay the salaries of its teachers, workers, doctors and sanitation staffers. “They have been governing the corporations for just one purpose — to fill their pockets through extortion and corruption. Every resident of Delhi is witness to this fact. The moment somebody starts putting up lintels of their house, BJP councillors flock there to extort the owner,” alleged Atishi. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said no property tax was levied on temples by the three municipal corporations. “In an inadvertent clerical error, a property tax notice issued by EDMC to a dharamsala mentioned the name of an adjoining temple. The EDMC mayor is looking into the matter. In case mischief is found in sending of the notice, necessary action will be taken against the staff concerned,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-slams-edmc-over-property-tax-notice-to-temples/articleshow/88153024.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: ICMR-NIV rapid test can cut down cost and turnaround time||Pune: A soon-to-be-introduced and visually interpreted rapid Covid test— developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology (ICMR-NIV) and transferred to Chennai and Delhi-based companies for production — could cut down the cost and the turnaround time by almost 40%, ICMR-NIV officials said. The test would be made available within two weeks at airports in India and other places. The companies have been asked to scale up production amid Omicron concerns. The molecular-based technology used in this rapid test kit neither requires expensive machines like RT-PCT, high-speed centrifuges nor a skilled workforce to conduct the test. “The test — RT-LAMP — has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. It takes only 30-40 minutes to churn out the result, which can be visually interpreted. Also, the test can be very easily deployed at the airports, docks, railway stations and other entry points for the screening of patients for Covid-19 as it does not require sophisticated machinery and skilled workforce,” said a senior ICMR official. Newer platforms need to be technically less demanding, require minimum equipment, and reduce turnaround time for reporting results. This testing approach, along with measures such as masking, frequent handwashing and social distancing, might be enough to prevent and contain the spread of Omicron, while the Covid-19 vaccination programme was making impressive strides, experts said. The RT-LAMP kit is validated by the National Institute of Biologicals, Noida. As against the current rapid PCR test which costs Rs 3,900 and takes an hour, the ICMR-NIV-developed test kit is likely to cost not more than Rs 3,000. ICMR-NIV Mumbai unit scientists Shyamsundar Nandi, Upendra Lambe, Sonali Sawant, Trupti Gohil, Jagadish Deshpande have developed the RT-LAMP kit. The Chennai-based AcrannoLife Genomics is gearing up to make the rapid kit available at airports in all major cities. “We are in an advanced stage of discussions with a few key airports and plan to establish operations soon,” said the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer Agragesh Ramani. Delhi-based Rapid Diagnostic Group of Companies could not be contacted for comment despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-icmr-niv-rapid-test-can-cut-down-cost-and-turnaround-time/articleshow/88153023.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The hilly region along the ghat the connects Kolhapur and Ratnagiri districts got very heavy rainfall this year. The repair work is ongoing at a slow pace and transporters said they were facing hefty losses. The heavy vehicles are forced to take an alternative longer route, increasing the travel distance by 60-70km. Jaygad port in Ratnagiri is frequently used for sugar export. Every year, around 5 lakh tonnes of sugar is exported from this port and sugar from Maharashtra and Karnataka arrives at the port daily. Omkar Patil, a sugar exporter, said, “As the vehicles have to take a longer route to reach Jaygad port, it takes more time and money. The vehicle owners are not agreeing easily to travel to Jaygad port. As a result, the sugar produce from factories is also not getting picked up on time and causing losses to factory owners, traders and the transporters.” Even the fish transporters are facing difficulties and as a result, prices of fish have gone up. Chetan Sawant, a fish stall owner at fish market near Bindu chowk, said, “As the vehicles are taking a longer route to ply daily between Kolhapur-Ratnagiri, the increased travel cost has impacted the rates of fish. Already, the fishing has gone down due to cyclones and heavy rain. The road is under construction and has been kept closed for heavy vehicles. Hopefully, the road will get repaired soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/amba-ghat-shut-for-heavy-vehicles-transporters-upset/articleshow/88153524.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Due to landslide and road cave-ins major portion of the road had got damaged earlier this year in August. The road is currently out of bounds for two wheelers as the repair works are being carried by Geo-grade technology. Amol Koli, section engineer of Panhala PWD, said, “The repair works will require around Rs 5 crore. Earlier, to avoid inconvenience to the locals, two-wheelers were allowed to travel through the remaining section of the road. But, tourists and other officials also started demanding to travel through this patch. Four days ago, a local got injured after falling into a trench along with his two-wheeler. Hence, we have decided to prohibit two-wheelers on this road. People can use the alternative road created via Rede Ghati area to reach Panhala fort.” Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Shiv Sena held a protest outside Panhala tehsil office stating alternative route via Rede ghati has been poorly constructed and is causing inconvenience to locals as well as tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/road-repairs-at-panhala-to-take-two-more-months/articleshow/88153537.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The council had taken feedback from schools after Class XII English and Mathematics exams, held on December 3 and 6, respectively. The letter states the challenges faced by students and schools. The council said that retaining students in Class 11 and 12 in CBSE schools has always been a challenge as parents feel that students will not be able to get desirable marks to even qualify for higher education. The Mathematics questions were a bit too difficult and lengthy and some questions were out of syllabus. It also said a few were very high-order thinking questions and were highly time-consuming to solve. The English paper had ambiguous questions, especially in the writing section, the letter said. “These kinds of question papers will add to the misery of parents and hence they would prefer state boards in future. Prospective students who wish to prepare for competitive examinations will also lose interest in the subject due to the inability to perform well. A slight consideration of learning gaps of students in view of the academic break due to the Covid pandemic should have been considered,” said the letter signed by the council’s secretary general Indira Rajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/go-easy-on-evaluation-urges-cbse-schools-body/articleshow/88161812.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nashik||Cops struggle to crack burglaries, vehicle thefts||CLEARED SKHER Nashik: The detection rate of house break-ins thefts (HBT) during the day and vehicle thefts has been worst among other cases till October end this year. As per police record, only one of the 21 HBTs of the day time have been detected. Similarly, even the detection rate of vehicles thefts has been dismal this year. This year till October-end, 387 vehicles were stolen from the city. However, only 61 vehicles were recovered by the police. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone 2) Vijay Kharat said, “Detecting thefts in general is always an uphill task as the criminal commits the offence by disguising his identity and no one has seen him in the act of committing theft. This is unlike offences of attempts to murder, voluntary causing hurt, etc, where the person committing the offence is known to the victim.” “Nonetheless the police are always on their toes gathering information about criminals and trying to find the culprits involved in thefts. Once a burglar is arrested on information or actually in the act, then the police can detect a chain of offences committed by him or by his associates in the crime,” added Kharat. The DCP also said that they have detected quite a few cases of vehicle theft in the past one month, which would soon reflect in their detection figures. Meanwhile, the overall detection rate till October end is 63 percent and is two percent lesser than last year. This year, out of the 2,304 cases registered by the city police, they have detected 1,443 cases. Last year, there were 2,635 cases registered with the city police, out of which 1,720 were detected till October-end giving a detection rate of 65 percent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/cops-struggle-to-crack-burglaries-vehicle-thefts/articleshow/88153545.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Students complain as some colleges scrap online classes||MUMBAI: Even as teachers from city colleges are finding it difficult to slip into hybrid mode of teaching with limited resources, a few are trying to increase the number of physical sessions. A city college had decided to start mandatory offline lectures for a course, another is now planning to run classes offline in the first week and repeat the syllabus online the next. After a few students complained, the Mumbai University issued a circular on Tuesday, recalling the government directive asking colleges to conduct lectures in the hybrid mode. Principals, however, claim that students who are fully vaccinated are also opting for the online option. A few students from DG Ruparel College, in a letter to Mumbai University’s vice-chancellor and cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray, claimed that the college issued a circular on November 27, stating that a few classes will be conducted only offline, as opposed to the university’s mandate of running classes in hybrid model. A teacher from the college, however, said that the decision was taken only for a few courses on demand from some students. “The college has not provided Wi-Fi services. Some of the teachers have managed to arrange for it independently, not all. So only a few lectures were being conducted offline for the last three-four days.” Now, after a few students opposed the move, the college has decided to conduct offline lectures a week, and to repeat those for students taking classes online. Pradeep Sawant, university's senate member said that they received a complaint letter from a few students of SIES College, Sion, too. A teacher, however, said that all lectures are running in hybrid mode at the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-students-complain-as-some-colleges-scrap-online-classes/articleshow/88153041.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Dehradun||U’khand mulls change in land purchase laws||Dehradun: After repealing the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act and putting the creation of the Gairsain Commissionerate on the back-burner, the BJP government in Uttarakhand is planning to take a call on land purchase laws in the state. Several residents of the hill state and the Indian National Congress protested this year against the government's decision in 2017 to roll back all curbs on the purchase of land by "outsiders".  The decision, taken by the former chief minister (CM) Trivendra Singh Rawat, paved the way for non-Uttarakhand residents to buy any desired amount of land for tourism, horticulture, and a few other sectors. "Uttarakhand maange bhoo kanoon"(Uttarakhand wants stringent land laws) was the clarion call for several to join the movement. Protesters believed the step was important to conserve the cultural identity of the state. The curbs were introduced back during the Congress government's 2002-2007 rule, when it passed a law restricting non-Uttarakhand residents from buying more than 500 sq metres of land for residential purposes. Later, the BJP government, during its rule in 2007-2012, reduced the upper cap to 250 sq metres. People from other states were not allowed to purchase agricultural land in both instances. However, the Trivendra Singh Rawat government in 2017 lifted all restrictions on land purchase in a bid to attract investments in the hilly areas of the state. The land purchase limit was raised from 12.5 acres to 30 acres for work related to tourism, energy, industry, agriculture, and horticulture. In some cases, people were allowed to purchase above 30 acres of land in the state as well. Rather than taking permission at the state level, purchasers were allowed to seek approval at the district level. Now, the repeal of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board Act has raised the hopes of many. Sources say that the government may withdraw changes made to land laws. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson, Subodh Uniyal, said, “A committee headed by former chief secretary, Subhash Kumar, has already been constituted to review various aspects of the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950. Based on the findings of this committee, a decision will be taken by the state government.” He added that chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had formed a committee after the protests cropped up. “The view of people is important. We will not take any decision that is against the interests of the people of the state,” he said. The Congress party has already announced that if voted to power in 2022, it will withdraw the amendments made by the BJP government. This has been a key issue in the party's poll campaign. “We have opposed the permission given by the BJP government to outsiders for purchasing land in bulk, as it is bound to hurt the hills and its people,” ex-CM Harish Rawat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-mulls-change-in-land-purchase-laws/articleshow/88151504.cms||Kautilya Singh

They said that the in vitro, cytotoxicity and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity studies of medicine formula, originally licensed for treating fever, have been found to be efficient in antiviral activity against Covid-19 virus. Addressing a new conference here on Tuesday, Dr Hrishikesh Damle, managing director of Artimed Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, said that the formulation is made using plant extracts of medicinal plants traditionally used in ayurveda like Centella asiatica (Muthil), Withania somnifera (Ashwagantha) and Andrographis paniculata (Kiriyatha). He said that in the two clinical trials held in Bengaluru, it was found to be safe and well tolerated and also found to reduce the level of Covid-19 specific inflammatory markers. He said that the scientific paper on the in vitro screening of plant extracts for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Activity and evaluation of their acute and sub-acute toxicity and other related studies have been accepted for publication in international peer reviewed journal Phytomedicine Plus.

The two, along with another friend of the teenager, had gone to the spot to party and celebrate the teenager’s birthday, the police told the TOI. Senior inspector Swati Desai of the Sahakarnagar police told TOI, “The woman has stated in her complaint that her friend, who was celebrating his birthday on Sunday, rang her up and asked her to visit him at Taljai hill for a party.” “The woman went to the hill and met her friend, who was accompanied by a friend of his. They scaled the compound wall of the Taljai hill forest area around 6pm by keeping stones near the wall and sat down in an isolated spot in the woods to drink.” “The woman said they were in an inebriated condition and the other friend left the spot saying he wanted to go early. She and her friend were alone around 8pm and that is when the woman felt a little dizzy and decided to take a nap in the woods. She alleged that when she fell asleep, her friend took advantage of the situation and raped her,” Desai said. The woman lodged a complaint with the police on Monday after which her friend was arrested. The police said the arrested suspect is a school dropout and does odd jobs such as working in kirana stores and eateries. He belongs to an economically poor family. Desai said, “The woman is a school dropout and she earlier used to work as a salesperson with a well-known saree shop on Laxmi Road. At present, she is unemployed. We had sent the woman for a medical examination and we have received her medical reports. Investigation is the case is on.” The police have registered the case under Section 376 (Rape) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Ahmedabad||PMEGP: Only 27% of employment target met in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Barely 27% of the targeted jobs were actually created in Gujarat under the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) in 2021-22. About four months before the end of the financial year, only 18,680 people received employment under the PMEGP against the target of giving jobs to 68,536 people, suggests the data tabled in the Rajya Sabha. The PMEGP is a credit-linked subsidy programme meant to generate employment opportunities through the establishment of micro enterprises in rural as well as urban areas. The number of jobs created under the PMEGP is also 18% less than what was generated last year through the scheme. In 2019-20 and 2020-21, 40% and 43.5% of the targeted jobs were given under the scheme. Sources in the government said that due to the second wave of Covid-19 at the onset of the year, projects were delayed. Merely 27% of the 8,567 projects were executed during this time. “The second wave of Covid-19 was very sinister. It brought disruptions and caused a great decline in demand and confidence,” said Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI). Patwari added: “People were not ready to take the risk of starting a new business.” He went on to say: “Even as the market began reviving and demand was back in the market, starting a new business had inherent challenges especially for micro entrepreneurs.” Patwari said the dramatic increase in prices of all commodities not only led to a credit shortfall but also cut the risk appetite of micro entrepreneurs. “The uncertainty triggered by the pandemic weakened the confidence of micro entrepreneurs,” said Patwari. At least 1 crore persons are employed in the MSME sector, state government estimates say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pmegp-only-27-of-employment-target-met/articleshow/88152347.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Aurangabad||Med official suspended for passive role in vax||Aurangabad: Heads have started rolling amid relatively lower Covid vaccination in Aurangabad district with suspension of a medical officer from Gangapur taluka on Tuesday for a period of three months for dereliction of duties during the ongoing immunization programme. The female officer, who was attached to a Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Sidhhnath Wadgaon, was accused of not staying at the headquarters and having a “passive role” in the Covid vaccination programme. The suspension order issued by Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan has invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services Rules, 1979 against the medical officer. As per official data, the PHC at Sidhhnath Wadgaon so far has 69% beneficiaries with the first dose and only 19% fully vaccinated. The figures are below the average immunization of the district as well as the state. Aurangabad ZP CEO Nilesh Gatne said the medical officer earlier on November 24 was served with a show-cause notice and the suspension order has been issued following unsatisfactory response from her. “All health officials and staffers should stay at their respective taluka-level headquarters. The entire machinery should give their best to enhance the vaccination coverage, failing which stern action will be taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/med-official-suspended-for-passive-role-in-vax/articleshow/88153554.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 50-year-old shot dead over maintenance dues||AHMEDABAD: A 50-year-old man from the Ramol area of the city was shot dead by a fellow resident of his housing society on Tuesday afternoon. The accused was arrested by city crime branch officers on Tuesday evening. According to crime branch officers, Ishwar Thakor was a resident of Vrundavan Skyline flats, where the accused, Pradeep Rajput, also lives. As Thakor was a member of the housing society’s committee, he went to meet Rajput to ask for maintenance dues of Rs 3,000, as Rajput had not paid his dues for around eight months.  Rather than paying the money, Rajput got angry at Thakor and began abusing him, for allegedly not providing proper services in the society. The fight turned violent when Rajput pulled out a country-made pistol and fired two rounds at Thakor. One of the bullets hit Thakor just above the left eyebrow and he collapsed at the spot. Rajput then fled. Thakor was taken to LG Hospital in Maninagar, where he died during treatment, said an officer of Ramol police. A team of city crime branch was ordered to nab Rajput and on the basis of his mobile phone location and human intelligence, nabbed him from the Amraiwadi area. Crime branch officers said Rajput was about to board a bus out of the state when he was nabbed. Police officers said Rajput ran a medical store in Vastral. Ramol police registered a case of murder and violation of the Arms Act against Rajput and began an investigation. Rajput had been arrested by Nikol police in 2017 for attempted murder and violation of the Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/50-year-old-shot-dead-over-maintenance-dues/articleshow/88152388.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Sameer Wankhede was 17 years old when he was granted a bar licence’||MUMBAI: A preliminary probe by the Maharashtra state excise department has confirmed that on the day Sameer Wankhede was granted a licence for a bar and restaurant on October 27, 1997, he was ineligible – he was 17 years old then and far below the minimum stipulated age of 21. As a result, the possibility of the licence being revoked is not ruled out. According to reports, the excise department has sent a letter to the Thane collector and Thane excise superintendent to take action as per provisions of law in view of the finding. Under section 54 of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act, the authority has powers to revoke the licence. “The competent authority can revoke the license under section 54-e of the act if the license, permit, pass or authorization has been obtained by wilful misrepresentation or fraud. The licensing authority will have to establish that Wankhede misrepresented the facts while securing the license,’’ a senior official said. TOI had on November 19 reported that despite the fact that he was a minor, he was able to secure a licence for a bar and restaurant. Wankhede had confirmed to TOI that he owns a bar and restaurant and there was nothing illegal about it. ``I own a restaurant in Vashi, it’s all official. When I joined the service, I had mentioned it in my annual records, it has been mentioned in the annual property returns,’’ Wankhede had said. Initially, the licence was in the name of Wankhede. Later the power of attorney was given in the name of his father, Dnyandeo Wankhede. According to the official, Wankhede was granted a licence by a committee comprising the district collector and district excise superintendent. Ujwal Uke was the collector and P G Hedau excise superintendent.  “Documents are brought before the committee after verification at several levels. Prima facie, it appears that in the entire process, Wankhede’s age was never brought to the notice of the committee. As per rules, Wankhede’s statement was recorded while granting licence, but at no stage was he asked his age or asked to produce proof of age,’’ he said. Under such circumstances, the official said, it was for the district collector and excise superintendent to take a call.  “The question now is that more than two and half decades have passed since the licence was granted to Wankhede. It’s a piquant situation before the administration,’’ he said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik had demanded action against Wankhede, saying it was unethical of him to continue running the business after joining the All India service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-wankhede-was-17yrs-old-when-he-was-granted-a-bar-licence/articleshow/88153073.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

---||Dehradun||Army major booked for stalking Dehradun woman||Dehradun: A 25-year-old woman in Dehradun has alleged that she was catfished (when a real person creates a fake identity online), harassed and threatened by a major of the Indian Army. She also claimed that the local police took more than six months to register her complaint.  According to the woman, she had come in contact with the accused in June 2020 on social media. The man has been booked under sections 354D (stalking), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC, police said. Police said that the delay in registering the FIR was due to "prolonged investigation" into the matter. “The major had also filed a complaint against the woman which was being investigated. We have registered a case now and will soon start collecting evidence. A probe into the matter is underway and due action will be taken,” said superintendent of police (city) Sarita Dobhal. “He claimed to be unmarried. After a couple of months, he started pursuing me for marriage and tried to engage in sexually explicit conversations. Later, I found out that he was also involved with other women on the same app, following which I severed all ties with him. He would then call me and threaten me with dire consequences if I shared this with anyone,” said the woman, adding that he even threatened to upload objectionable photos of her online. The woman alleged that the officer, impersonating as other people, then started calling from different numbers. “In January 2021, I filed an online complaint against him which was reassigned to the Patel Nagar police station. Meanwhile, I found out that he is married. I also filed a complaint with the National Commission for Women. The major was posted in Jammu & Kashmir at that time. In March, he started putting pressure on me to take back the complaint. Meanwhile, I checked through an RTI the status of my complaint, and I was told that the matter has been closed even though I had not received any redressal of my grievance,” she said. “I then filed another complaint with the SP city, and was told that the investigation is under process. But there was no progress on this complaint, nor was any FIR registered against him. He filed a civil defamation suit against me in May in Pune, where his wife lives. I even approached his regiment in June but didn’t receive any cooperation. He has assassinated my character and left me completely traumatised because I refused to comply with him,” she said. The woman further claimed that her family approached the district court after getting no help from the police. “Despite multiple dates, police did not appear in court. I had all the evidence with me, including screenshots of our conversation. After running from pillar to post for months, police in Dehradun have now registered an FIR,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/army-major-booked-for-stalking-woman/articleshow/88151556.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

Students of Class IX from Multi-purpose High School interacted with children from Caritas Centre for Deaf-blind, South Goa. Among several activities was a master chef competition where children from Multi-purpose High School teamed up with a child with deaf-blindness to prepare mouthwatering snacks. It was the first such interaction for students of Multi-purpose High School and presented them with an opportunity to understand the different challenges the deaf-blind face. They expressed eagerness to engage in activities with the deaf-blind on a regular basis in the future. The students, parents and adults with deaf-blindness were told about the importance of International Day For Persons With Disabilities and also about inclusion, accessibility and sustainability of persons with disabilities in society, which is the theme for this year’s celebrations. Caritas Centres for Deaf-blind also organised an exposure visit, where the children and young adults with deaf-blindness along with their parents were taken to Sharvaraj Farm adventure park. They engaged in several water activities including aqua loop, speed slide, rain dance, body slides etc. The participants were happy to get out of their homes and socialise with other children and parents. The first time many of them went out of their homes for an outing, they were reluctant to leave the venue. They partook in singing and dancing and the parents gave positive feedback, stating that the event put a smile on the faces of their children. It was the first outing in almost two years due to Covid-19. Deaf-blindness, a unique disability because it is a combination of vision and hearing loss, leads to complex problems in communications, mobility and accessing information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-exposure-event-children-learn-hardships-of-deaf-blind/articleshow/88153598.cms||---

However, locals say that visitors are still not allowed in the moss garden even as more than a year has passed since the inauguration. On a spot visit, the gates of the garden were found locked on Tuesday. When asked about the issue, IFS Sanjeev Chaturvedi told TOI, “The opening of the garden was out of the question between November 2020 and August 2021. When the new infections started declining, we started the process to open the garden for visitors but now, the threat of the third wave of the pandemic has re-emerged.” The officer added, “We let students of both government and private schools come here on tours.” Spread over an area of more than 10 hectares, the garden was developed in a span of over two years. The garden is home to around 30 different species of moss and various other bryophytes. Among the moss species present in the garden, two of them -- Brachythecium buchananii and Hyophila involuta (also known as cement moss) -- feature in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/inaugurated-a-year-back-indias-first-moss-garden-in-nainital-yet-to-open-for-tourists/articleshow/88151573.cms||---

According to STF officials, the gang would issue fake insurance policies through fintech platforms such as Paytm or PhonePe. The gang is also accused of evading tax since 2018. Taking advantage of a glitch in the software, the gang while punching the details would enter registration number or four-wheeler but would select the two-wheeler category while making payment, thereby bringing down the premium from Rs 20,000 to just Rs 500. Once the payment was done, the accused used to forge the policy papers to make it four-wheeler insurance. "If someone would check the policy credentials on the RTO website, it would only show the registration number and validity of the policy. This would make it look like a valid document,” said SSP, STF, Ajai Singh.

The Chief Minister gave the assurance during a meeting with Samastha leaders, including the organization’s general secretary K Alikutty Musaliyar.

It was said that Samastha leaders opposed the move following the assurance given by the chief minister. “Government has no adamant stand on Waqf board appointments. It was the board that decided to refer the appointments to PSC, not the government. We are ready to hold more discussions. The status quo will be maintained till there is some clarity and all fears are alleviated,” Vijayan told Samastha leaders; the statement on the issue was issued by the chief minister’s office. The CM ruled out fears expressed by community leaders that appointments through PSC may result in influx of non-Muslim candidates in Waqf board posts. Samastha leaders, who expressed relief over the CM’s stand, wanted the government to repeal the law passed by the assembly so that the apprehensions on Waqf appointments could be kept at bay. “The CM assured that the government will not push the decision to refer the appointments to PSC. What we have understood from the words of the chief minister is that the government would keep the decision in abeyance,” said Samastha leaders to the media. Samastha leaders wanted the government to constitute a Waqf recruitment board, just like the devaswom recruitment board. The government had set up a devaswom recruitment board after PSC informed it of the practical difficulties in performing the recruitment process reserved for a particular religion only. Opposition leader VD Satheesan, who welcomed the CM’s assurance for more talks on the issue, said the opposition was happy that ‘sense had finally dawned on the government’. “We did point out the problems associated with Waqf board appointments and had asked the government to go ahead only after holding discussions with community leaders. But the government took an adamant stand then and passed the bill,” he said. Satheesan also wanted the government to repeal the law passed by the assembly at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-meets-samastha-leaders-promises-more-discussions/articleshow/88152421.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC gives nod to proceed against loan defaulters||HYDERABAD: In what could come as a major blow to fraudulent companies and their promoters who evade repaying thousands of crores of loans, the Telangana high court gave the green signal to banks and investigating agencies to proceed against the evaders. It vacated the stay order which hitherto had prevented the authorities from taking any coercive steps. Dealing with a batch of petitions filed by Sabbineni Surendra of Coastal Projects Limited, Cherukuri Sridhar of Transstroy (India) Ltd and K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju of Ind-Barath Power Infra Ltd, a bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji vacated the stay order issued by HC last year. Petitioners had then questioned action of RBI in issuing a master circular, which asked banks to declare suspicious company accounts as fraud accounts. A division bench of the HC last year took a view that certain provisions of master circular were not clear on giving an opportunity to defaulters before declaring their accounts as fraud. It asked authorities not to take coercive steps till pleas were adjudicated. RBI and State Bank of India approached Supreme Court, challenging relief given to fraud account companies. The apex court stayed HC order. Citing SC order, Telangana HC bench on Monday vacated interim order. Transstroy owes Rs 8,000 crore dues to banks. Coastal Projects has Rs 7,000 crore, VMC Solutions Rs 2,500 crore, Ind-Barath Rs 1,000 crore and VNR Infrastructure company owes Rs 1,000 crore. Following the latest order, promoters will now come under scrutiny of banks, CBI, ED and other agencies. Most of these firms which availed thousands of crores of loans were now under liquidation after a declaration from National Company Law Tribunal to the effect that they had become insolvent. Vikram Pooserla, counsel for some petitioners, said HC last year had stayed coercive action in a petition filed by Rajesh Agarwal of BS Company. The stay order was later extended to other similarly placed companies too. “Declaring our accounts as fraud unilaterally without hearing us is against principles of natural justice,” Vikram argued. Appearing for SBI, Axis Bank and members of bankers’ consortium which felt aggrieved by loan evasion by Coastal Projects, advocate general BS Prasad said banks conduct a forensic audit of suspicious accounts before declaring them as fraud. “The auditor called promoters of these firms and ascertained facts. So, allegation that they were condemned and unheard is not true,” the AG said. CBI and ED were already probing the cases against promoters. The case will come up for hearing again on April 7, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-gives-nod-to-proceed-against-loan-defaulters/articleshow/88152405.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||India’s geospatial economy can grow to Rs 80,000 cr by 2025 if govt implements right policies: Report||Hyderabad: India’s geospatial economy, which is currently valued at around Rs 38,972 crore and is growing at nearly 13%, is poised to grow to Rs 63,100 crore by the end of 2025, said the ‘Geospatial Artha report: Indian Geospatial Market, Economy, and Industrial Development Strategy’ that was unveiled here on Tuesday at the GeoSmart India 2021 summit. However, the report pointed out that if the Indian government charts out a geospatial industrial development strategy and implements by 2022 the three geospatial policies that are currently in the draft stage, the geospatial economy has the potential to clock a CAGR of 19.6% and hit Rs 80,000 crore by 2025 and employ at least 18 lakh people. India’s geospatial economy currently employs around 4.7 lakh people across user industries, government services and export services. The Indian government is currently in the process of finalising the draft National Geospatial Policy (NGP) and the draft Indian Satellite Navigation Policy (SATNAV Policy, while it has already implemented the Guidelines for Geospatial Data (Guidelines for acquiring and producing geospatial data and geospatial data services including maps) in 2021. The report, which has been prepared under the aegis of the National Think Tank on Geospatial Strategy for New India, was released in the presence of Amit Khare, advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Dr Kiran Kumar, Vikram Sarabhai Professor, ISRO. According to the report, infrastructure development, agriculture, water resources, land management, utilities and urban development are expected to drive the growth of the geospatial economy of the country. Speaking on the occasion, Khare said that the evolving technologies in the geospatial sector have brought about transformational changes whereby even an inch of land in India can be mapped, providing solid backups for Indian land reforms. “Vaccinations in India is a remarkable example were technology and logistics were perfectly supported through the use of geospatial technology,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/indias-geospatial-economy-can-grow-to-rs-80000-cr-by-2025-if-govt-implements-right-policies-report/articleshow/88152414.cms||---
---||Kochi||Gandhinagar byelection: LDF and UDF keep fingers crossed||Kochi: With voters turning up in huge numbers, the byelection to Gandhinagar division polled around 68% of votes on Tuesday. The high polling, compared to the 52% voters’ turnout in the division in 2020 local body polls, predicts a close fight between both the prominent fronts in Gandhinagar, which is considered to be a stronghold of LDF. Of the total 8,090 votes, 5,489 votes were polled as both LDF and UDF carried out aggressive campaigns in the past fortnight. Women outnumbered men in the polling. As per reports until 7pm on Tuesday, 2,826 women and 2,663 men exercised their franchise in the division. The voting, which started at 7am, progressed at a slow pace until around 11am. Later, more voters started to turn up. There were five polling booths in the division. It was following the demise of K K Sivan of the CPM that Gandhinagar seat fell vacant almost six months ago. The LDF fielded Bindu Sivan, wife of Sivan, to take on P D Martin of Congress. Bindu Sivan had been the president of Chottanikkara grama panchayat during 1995-2000. Martin, who has been active in politics for almost three decades, had held the chairmanship of the welfare standing committee of Kochi corporation in 2020. While P G Manoj Kumar contested as the NDA candidate, V for Kochi fielded Binu George. Besides them, there are two namesake candidates for Martin. After the polling, the LDF leaders said that it was a stiff competition and the front’s candidate would win with a low margin though. Meanwhile, UDF leaders said that they were sure that Martin would win with a good margin. At the onset, LDF had decided to field Sojan Antony. The front had even announced Sojan as its candidate despite strong objections against him. Later, he fell ill, and this forced LDF to rope in Sivan’s wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gandhinagar-byelection-ldf-and-udf-keep-fingers-crossed/articleshow/88151586.cms||---

Rohit Bharwad was sent to the jail in Bhavnagar. The cops said that Bharwad has six offences registered against him. “Bharwad is accused of criminal intimidation, voluntarily causing hurt and also under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Bharwad used to let his cattle free on the roads and often got into brawls with people. It was creating a dangerous situation for people on the roads,” said police. The cops added that they have warned other cattle owners to not let their livestock wander on the streets. “Those putting lives of people in danger by letting the cattle stray on the roads would be booked as stray cattle often cause accidents,” the police added. Four days ago, a BJP leader was attacked by a stray cow on Makrand Desai Road. Jagruti Pathak said that she sustained injuries on her head. She registered an offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against an unidentified person, who let the cow on the road, at Gotri police station. Mayor Keyur Rokadia promised strict action and said that such incidents won’t be taken lightly as they can cause loss of lives. On Monday, a car overturned in Undera when the driver tried to evade some cows that suddenly strayed on the road. In October, state BJP chief C R Paatil had pulled Rokadia over the increasing menace of stray cattle in the city. Rokadia was left red-faced when Paatil said that all municipal corporations in the state have started working on stray cattle issue but work being done in Vadodara was below expectations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cattle-owner-booked-under-pasa-for-repeated-offence/articleshow/88151589.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Renovated Sir George Everest House in Mussoorie opens to public||Mussoorie: The heritage bungalow of Sir George Everest, the former surveyor-general of India, was opened to public after Uttarakhand tourism minister, Satpal Maharaj, inaugurated the renovated house on Tuesday afternoon. Speaking to media persons, Maharaj said, “The renovation of this house would promote tourism in Mussoorie and make people aware of the works undertaken by Sir George Everestand his personal connection with Mussoorie.” He added, “A museum would soon be developed inside the building to showcase the equipment and other items used by Sir George Everest.” Located at Park Estate near Hathipaon, about seven kilometres from Gandhi Chowk in Mussoorie, the house had lost its traditional charm with some structures crumbling due to years of neglect. Sir George Everest, who measured the Great Meridional Arc from Kanyakumari to the Himalayas and after whom the world’s highest mountain peak (Mount Everest) is named, lived in the house for 11 years before retiring and returning to England in 1843. The iconic house has been renovated by the Uttarakhand tourism department with the support of the Asian Development Bank. A budget of Rs 23.71 crore was sanctioned for the restoration of the nearly two-century-old house, which is to be developed as a heritage tourism site. However, local residents say the restoration is not in sync with what existed and that there are several deviations from the old design. “I feel that the building has not been renovated as per the original layout and design. For instance, there were no boundary walls in the original structure but the renovated building has them,” said a Mussoorie resident requesting anonymity. Echoing a similar sentiment, Manmohan Singh Mall, former chairman of Mussoorie Municipal Council, said, “It seems that the inauguration has been hurriedly done keeping in mind the upcoming elections. The approach road between Hathipaon and the entrance to the estate is in a bad shape, the museum has not yet been developed and there is no electricity or water supply at the site.” Meanwhile, the state government plans to develop an interpretation centre cum cartography museum, 10 huts for star-gazing with digitally guided star watching facilities, a mountain trail to a nearby peak, an audio-visual theatre, star gazing domes and an open-air amphitheatre at the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/renovated-sir-george-everest-house-in-mussoorie-opens-to-public/articleshow/88151580.cms||Anmol Jain

The duo was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on June 25 in a money laundering case involving Deshmukh. In September, taking cognisance of the ED’s chargesheet, the court had observed that careful perusal of the statements and the charge showing trail of money prima facie indicate that Rs 4.7 crore was received by Deshmukh from the accused Sachin Waze, a dismissed cop, and Shinde. The ED alleged that Palande had coordinated with Waze and others to collect money from orchestra bar owners in Mumbai, and hand it over to Shinde.

The practical exams, which started on Monday, will continue till December 15. As many as 109 students are appearing for the examinations. On the instructions of the varsity’s Vice Chancellor Lt Gen (Dr) Madhuri Kanitkar (retd), controller of examinations Dr Ajit Pathak wrote to the NMC seeking its nod to permit some external examiners to conduct the examination through video-conferencing. Talking to TOI, the MUHS VC said a section of the external examiners could face problems due to restrictions following the fear of Covid resurgence against the backdrop of Omicron’s emergence. “We have requested the NMC to allow such examiners to conduct the examination online. We have also put in place a backup plan in case these external examiners are unable to take the exam online. We shall involve faculties of deemed medical universities in our state to be external examiners,” said Kanitkar, adding that she has already spoken to the NMC authorities on this matter. The VC has made it clear that the MUHS will ensure that the practical exams for PG and super-speciality students take place as scheduled. Dr Pathak maintained that during the previous waves of the pandemic, the NMC had allowed external examiners to conduct examinations via video conferencing. For the PG practical exams, it is mandatory for the varsity to involve two external examiners, apart from two internal ones. All these four examiners have to be physically present to conduct the exam. MUHS had firmed up the names of the external examiners about two months ago when things were good on the Covid-19 front. MUHS officials said external examiners who hail from neighbouring states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka etc. have no issues since they can travel by road and remain physically present to conduct the examination. For example, external examiners from Gujarat will be present physically at medical colleges in Dhule and Jalgaon. Similarly, external examiners from MP will be going to the medical college in Nagpur. “The problem is with some of the external examiners who hail from far-off states like West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab etc. They have to undertake air travel to reach Maharashtra before travelling by road to the assigned medical college. There is hesitancy among such external examiners,” MUHS officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/muhs-for-online-practical-exam-nod-for-external-examiners/articleshow/88130200.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The commission, in its investigation, found that the school was enrolling students without mandatory documents. The commission has ordered the school to cancel the admission of such students. The matter was brought before the commission by parents of some students belonging to the minority community. After a probe, the commission found out that two students were given admissions under RTE on the basis of forged documents. Later, the commission directed Block Education Officer of Vikasnagar to get an FIR registered against school authorities. Meanwhile, in a separate case, the commission sought an action-taken report from the Dehradun district administration in the incident concerning a man from the minority community being threatened by his neighbours to leave the colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/minority-commission-unearths-rte-scam-in-a-vikasnagar-based-private-school/articleshow/88151577.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: SC rejects NIA plea, upholds bail granted by Bombay HC to Sudha Bharadwaj||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Bombay high court’s order granting default bail to lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj in the 2018 Elgar Parishad case and dismissed the plea of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which had challenged the high court verdict. A bench of Justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi did not find any error in the HC verdict and remarked that there was no need to interfere. It said that the only issue involved in the case was whether the court, which had allowed the application for extension of her detention in November 2018, was competent or not. TimesViewThere was little reason to overturn the high court order that granted the 60-year-old activist bail earlier this month. The apex court was right in dismissing the NIA's appeal. In fact, there is a strong case for the argument that the activist should have got bail earlier.Additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, appearing for the NIA, argued that the court which had extended her detention was competent, but the SC bench was not satisfied It said there is a provision of designated court under various laws, including TADA, POTA, NDPS, etc. It said only special courts, which are aware of the intricacies of such laws, could take cognisance in such cases. SC upholds bail even before hearing Bharadwaj’s counselThe Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the Bombay High Court’s order granting default bail to lawyer-activist Sudha Bharadwaj in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon case and dismissed the plea of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) which had challenged the HC verdict. The apex court bench said that when there was a special designated court available to deal with such cases, other courts would not have jurisdiction to pass order in cases involving scheduled offences under the Act. The bench was so convinced with the correctness of the HC verdict that it dismissed the NIA’s plea without even hearing the contention of Bharadwaj who had already filed a caveat in the SC to ensure that the court does not pass any order without hearing her. Her counsel, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, was present when the ASG was trying to convince the court that the HC order was wrong but he did not get an opportunity to argue or counter the contention of NIA as the bench dismissed the plea after the ASG concluded his arguments for the NIA. The social activist was granted default bail under Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code on December 1 on the grounds that the additional sessions court, Pune—which had extended the time for investigation in the case beyond 90 days—was not competent to do so as his court had not been designated a special court under Section 22 of the NIA Act. The HC had said that when a special court designated under the NIA Act, 2008, existed in Pune, the sessions judge had no jurisdiction to extend the detention beyond the stipulated 90 days. It directed that Bharadwaj be produced before the special NIA court on December 8 to decide on the conditions of her bail and the date of her release. The case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, which the police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the city’s outskirts. The Pune police had claimed the conclave was backed by Maoists. The probe in the case was later transferred to the NIA in January 2020. Eight other accused had sought default bail saying they had been in custody for over 180 days with no proper cognizance of the chargesheet against them. Their custody was extended by 90 days by the Pune additional sessions judge “without jurisdiction,” the HC had noted. But it had held that its declaration that the extension was not lawful “is of no assistance” as they “did not avail of the right to be released on default bail.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-upholds-bail-even-before-hearing-bharadwajs-counsel/articleshow/88153090.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Mumbai||Sharad Pawar echoes Mamata Banerjee, Sanjay Raut meets Rahul Gandhi for plan to take on BJP||NEW DELHI: Amid rumblings in the opposition camp, Nationalist Congress party of Sharad Pawar Tuesday said that there are more like-minded parties outside UPA who should be brought together for a joint opposition against BJP, echoing the line propounded by Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. At the same time, Shiv sena said that congress and Rahul Gandhi should take the lead in opposition unity. After the meeting of NCP national executive, Maharashtra minister and party spokesman Nawab Malik addressed the issue of opposition unity. He said Pawar has for last one year been saying that there are more anti-BJP parties outside Upa then there are with Upa. Pawar believes that without bringing those parties into the fold of anti--bjp camp, contesting a big election may not be feasible. Lashing out at the BJP government for trying to scare people on religious grounds and misusing agencies to harass the political rivals, and for the unrest over price rise, malik said, “all the anti-bjp parties should be brought together to bring about a wider alternative front. People want a change.” However, NCP steered away from the issue of leadership that West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has made her focus, and remained accommodative of the Congress. On Tuesday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut also met Rahul Gandhi at his residence for discussions. Speaking to reporters, he said attempts to bring about a cohesive opposition unity to take on the BJP in 2024 Lok Sabha elections is underway.  “I told Rahul Gandhi that he should take the lead. He should play an active role. There cannot be a unity without the Congress. Many regional parties are with Congress,“ he said. Ncp and Shiv sena are in alliance with Congress in Maharashtra where a tripartite government holds power. Malik also made it clear that NCP will have no alliance with Trinamool Congress in Goa, and is in talks with congress for seat-sharing and alliance in poll bound Goa and Uttarakhand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pawar-echoes-didi-raut-meets-rahul-for-plan-to-take-on-bjp/articleshow/88153097.cms||---
---||Delhi||Can’t let kids with rare diseases die: HC to Centre||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday said the Centre has not given any sufficient justification for Rs 193 crore lying unutilised in the rare diseases fund for children and emphasised that it will not let kids die from such illnesses despite funds being available. The high court pulled up the authorities for making a “mockery of the whole thing” and said it was strange that the allocated funds are available but not being spent on children suffering from rare diseases. “The affidavit filed by Respondent no. 1 (Centre) gives no reason or sufficient justification for not utilising the unspent amount of the fund for the last three years on children suffering from rare diseases,” Justice Rekha Palli said. The high court said the government’s affidavit also gives no sufficient justification as to why names of petitioner children are not included till date on the digital crowd funding platform made operational for medicines and treatment for rare illnesses. It asked the government to take instructions on whether it is possible to provide treatment to the petitioner children and then adjust the amount collected through crowd funding. The court granted time to additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma to seek instructions on the issue and listed the matter for further hearing on December 14. “What is this? Children are dying because of lack of funds... What about the corpus which is available with the government here. I will not permit these children to die despite funds being available. When there are funds, why should the children suffering from rare diseases not get it?” the judge said. The court did not accept the submission of the government counsel that the unutilised amount in the fund gets lapsed and said “what kind of answer is this”. On the issue of transfer of the unutilised amount of over Rs 63 crore, lying with Kerala High Court after it was collected from the general public for the treatment of a person suffering from a rare disease, to the rare diseases fund, the Centre told Delhi High Court that it has filed an impleadment application before the Kerala court.

About 1,800-2,000 passengers arrive from international flights at the airport and they have to undergo mandatory RT-PCR test. While about 6,000 domestic passengers arrive daily, including passengers from six flights from Mumbai. Passengers arriving from Mumbai and Kerala either have to present their RT-PCR report on arrival or go through UP government run RT-PCR centre at domestic terminal for testing. “Passengers arriving at Terminal 1 from international flights have the option to either opt for paid rapid Covid test whose results come in 30 minutes or opt for free RTPCR test in which the waiting period is 5-6 hours,” said an airport official. The cost of each rapid test is Rs 3,500. “A waiting area has been set up to accommodate 50 passengers at a time for conducting tests. There are four registration counters, four sampling booths, and 95 Rapid PCR machines for passengers who want paid service, while for free RT-PCR service the state authorities have installed four registration and collecting booths each,” the official said. “For domestic passengers arriving from Mumbai, two registration counters and two sample collecting booths have been set up by the government at domestic terminal for RTPCR,” the official said. In addition to the registration counters, passengers can also register for their test using the QR codes displayed at strategic locations in the arrival corridor,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/free-paid-covid-test-facility-for-passengers-at-amausi-airport/articleshow/88153101.cms||---

As much as 85.7% of the voters cast their votes between 9am and 6pm at the single booth. As many as 478 of 542 males and 510 of 652 females cast their votes in the tight contest held between LDF and UDF. One of the voters cast his vote in a special ballot as he was Covid positive. The death of councillor George Narekkad in May this year warranted a bypoll to the division. With his death, LDF, which is ruling the local body, has the support of only 13 councillors, while UDF has support of 12 councillors and one for BJP. Ajesh Manohar, Arun R Kallarakkal and P C Vinod are the candidates of LDF, UDF and BJP, respectively. While LDF hopes to retain the power, UDF aims to wrest the 27-member municipality, which came into existence in 2015. Narekkad had won Edapallichira with a majority of more than 100 votes. UDF had ruled the local body in the last term. UDF believes that the absence of a rebel candidate in the bypoll would help them win the election.

Based on the complaint of N Prasanth, a student, the accused sub-inspector, Ch Yadagiri Raju of Medipally police station, was caught red-handed at 12.10pm at his office. According to Anti-Corruption Bureau officials, SI Yadagiri Raju was investigating a road accident case registered under Section 337 of the IPC and the complainant’s father, N Srinu, is a victim in the accident. “To identify the accused and fix up responsibility, the SI demanded bribe,” an Anti-Corruption Bureau official said. Not willing to give the bribe, the complainant approached Anti-Corruption Bureau and a trap was laid after verifying the prima facie information. On Tuesday afternoon, when the accused accepted the bribe from the complainant at his office at the PS, the Anti-Corruption Bureau team arrested him. The tainted bribe amount was recovered from the sub-inspector’s possession. A chemical test conducted on the accused yielded positive results.

IUML high-power committee member Panakkad Sadikali Shihab Thangal said that as the law to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC has been passed in the assembly, it has to be revoked using legislative means. “There is still strong resentment in the community against the decision. We will continue our protests till the decision is revoked by the government. The Waqf Protection Rally announced by the party will be held in Kozhikode on Dec 9,” he said. The move by the CM to hold talks with EK Sunni faction alone, which was traditionally aligned with IUML, is seen as a strategic political move by the LDF government to directly establish dialogue with the influential body of clerics and thus weaken the League's grip over community organizations. IUML had rallied 15 Muslim religious groups under the banner of Muslim Coordination Council to conduct an awareness campaign after Friday prayers in mosques against the government decision. But, the move sustained a blow when Samastha backed out on Dec 2. Meanwhile, IUML state general secretary PMA Salam and MLA MK Muneer said IUML will not agree for anything less than the withdrawal of the unilateral decision taken by the government, despite the opposition raised by members in the assembly. When asked about the talks held by Samastha leaders with the CM, Salam said that the party doesn’t want to interfere in individual opinion and freedom of another organization. He added that IUML, as a political party, had its own stand. Muneer said that previous experiences have made it clear that the words of Pinarayi Vijayan cannot be trusted. “It has become clear in many issues, including the promise the CM made in the assembly that cases registered against anti-CAA/NRC protesters will be withdrawn. How can we trust the words of a person who has not honoured even the assurances given on the floor of the assembly,” he asked. Meanwhile, SYS state general secretary Abdul Hakeem Azhari (belonging to AP Sunni faction) said the government should take steps to recover Waqf properties that were taken over by violating the conditions of Waqf. He said that as many mosques in Kozhikode – which were dedicated as Waqf by Sunnis – have been taken over by those following Wahhabi ideology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/planned-protests-to-go-on-till-decision-is-revoked-iuml/articleshow/88152441.cms||---
---||Patna||Nalanda boy awarded 3-year imprisonment in murder case||BIHARSHARIF: The Nalanda Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) on Tuesday awarded 3 years imprisonment to a juvenile in a murder case. But the JJB principal judge, Manvendra Mishra, absolved him of the rape charge because of lack of evidence. Assistant public prosecutor (APP) Rajesh Pathak said the accused, who belongs to Tharthari police station area in Nalanda, had strangled his minor beloved and threw her body in a nearby pond on August 4. The APP said the accused called her near the pond in the wee hours of August 4 and strangled her soon after she told him that her parents had fixed her marriage somewhere else and they were going to Delhi the next day. The mother of the deceased, in her complaint, said they found her missing at around 1am on August 4. Later, her body was found floating in the village pond around 12 noon. The accused was arrested on August 21. He said the court rejected the defence claims that the relatives of the deceased themselves killed her and threw her body in the pond after they learnt about her relation with the village boy. The JJB principal judge directed the superintendent of Nalanda reformatory home for boys to immediately shift him to the special home at Patna. He also directed the superintendent of Patna-based special home to take care of the juvenile’s education and skill development training and submit in his court his periodical report of development every six month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nalanda-boy-awarded-3-year-imprisonment-in-murder-case/articleshow/88152121.cms||Farrukh Nadim

---||Nagpur||ATCS to cut travel time by 7 mins on 6.5km WHC Road||Nagpur: Travel time on busy West High Court Road — from Japanese Garden Square to Khamla Square — is set reduce by 7 minutes from the existing 20 minutes, thanks to Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL). “With a view to make traffic movement smoother under Smart Street project, the NSSCDCL, on pilot basis, has converted the manually-controlled traffic signals on the 6.5km-long West High Court Road to automated traffic control system (ATCS),” general manager NSSCDCL Sheel Ghule told TOI. Trial run of is going on, he added. “An ATCS is equipped with sensors attached to CCTV cameras that capture the real-time data of traffic, calculate the optimal time for signals and transmit the data to the command and control centre,” said Ghule. The cameras installed at the intersections detect volume of vehicles in three categories — 3 metre, 5 metre and 10 metre. The real-time monitoring makes it easy to set timing of a particular signal to optimize the flow of traffic. The ATCS works on the density of vehicles, and accordingly sets timing of traffic signals. At present, there are 164 traffic signals in the city, of which 10 on this stretch have been converted to ATCS. With more than 200 new vehicles being registered every day in the city, the traffic situation has become unbearable for both motorists and traffic enforcement agencies, including traffic police. Also, due to non-synchronisation of signals, travel time on most of the stretches has increased significantly. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sarang Awad said the ATCS is the brainchild of commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar and first trial run of the system was held smoothly. “A few changes have been advised to the NSSCDCL and it will be introduced after at least two more trial runs,” said the DCP. Commissioner of police Kumar said: “We are doing this on pilot basis on one of the busiest corridors. After studying the trial experience, we will see whether it can be further implemented on other roads in the city.” In the present non-ATCS monitoring, the traffic signal cycles are fed manually by team of NMC’s electrical department after studying the vehicle density on all sides of the intersection and the time taken for vehicles to cross it. The ATCS will eliminate the need to manually monitor and feed the timings of traffic signals. “The ATCS works on sensors, which detect the traffic situation and sets the timing of a particular signal accordingly,” said Ghule. Not just this, but the system also sets timings of other signals on the particular stretch to clear the traffic. Under this system, the maximum cycle for a green signal is 40 seconds, while the minimum has been kept at 10 seconds on this stretch. Explaining further, Ghule said: “If there are lesser number of vehicles on one side of a particular intersection, then the signal will remain green only for 10 seconds, instead of the allotted 40 seconds. The system will adapt the timings of traffic signals based on the real-time traffic conditions.” “We are thinking of replicating the ATCS model in the entire city, mostly covering busy stretches like Wardha Road, Central Avenue and Amravati Road,” said the DCP, adding the system will come handy even for providing green corridors for transportation of cadaver transplantation and movement of emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire tenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/atcs-to-cut-travel-time-by-7-mins-on-6-5km-whc-road/articleshow/88152452.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This applies to tests by RTPCR as well as Rapid Antigen test (RAT) methods. Meanwhile, out of 105 passengers who arrived at the Shamshabad airport on Tuesday no one tested positive for Covid-19 virus. “There are chances that some cases might not have been detected in the RTPCR method. Therefore, these samples would not have been taken up for genome sequencing. The RTPCR method has just 70% accuracy, while RAT is worse. Cases might be going unnoticed,” said an expert, speaking on condition of anonymity. The fact, that none of the 13 who had tested positive had any symptoms, and the new variant also does not have typical covid symptoms, adds to uncertainty. “Being asymptomatic means the viral load is very less and that is one reason it can go undetected. there is all the possibility of missing cases,” said a government official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-19-tests-on-pax-not-foolproof/articleshow/88152795.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||HC grants bail to man accused of murder||Pune: The Bombay high court has granted bail to a suspended state government employee from Kolhapur city who is facing charges of conniving with a woman to murder the her mother-in-law in September 2019 at Gadhinglaj after the latter came to know about their illicit relationship. The prosecution’s case was that the woman’s husband would suspect her of having an illicit affair with the (bail) applicant as she would constantly keep talking to him over the phone. This was also the cause of friction between the couple as the husband and the mother-in-law were pursuing the applicant to stay away from the woman, but the two continued talking to each other. In his complaint to the Gadhinglaj police, the woman’s husband said that he was in Athani village when his friend called and told him on September 23, 2019 to return home as his wife was not feeling well. Afterreaching home, his wife confessed before him that since the mother-in-law had personally seen her affair with the applicant and had told that she would tell this fact to him, she (wife) and the applicant killed the mother-in-law by assaulting her with a wooden log. The police later arrested the applicant. Kolhapur sessions court had rejected the applicant’s first bail plea following which he moved the high court through lawyer Satyam Nimbalkar and a final hearing was held before the bench of justice V G Bisht. Nimbalkar had argued that there was no direct or circumstantial evidence against the applicant except the so-called extra-judicial confession allegedly given by the wife to her husband i.e. the complainant. The prosecution had argued that the police had on September 24, 2009 recorded a statement of a child witness (complainant's son) which clearly implicates the complainant’s wife. It further submitted that apart from this statement, there was no other evidence to indicate involvement of the applicant. The HC referred to the FIR, including the wife's extra-judicial confession, and observed: “Needless to say, this is the extra-judicial confession given by the wife to her own husband and the evidentiary value of the same will have to be assessed at the time of trial.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-murder/articleshow/88153609.cms||Vishwas Kothari

They intended to use the money to buy black tar heroin (smack) for their regular dose of intoxication. According to police, the victim had refused to share his smack with the accused men. On Monday, GRP Lucknow sent the three accused-—Sarvesh Kumar Sonkar (22), Santosh Yadav (35) and Bablu Kahar (25)—to jail for the alleged murder. Station house officer Anjani Kumar Mishra said, “Early morning on December 2, the trio brought the victim’s body on a rickshaw to Lucknow railway station. They approached GRP personnel and claimed that they had found his body around railway tracks. The trio demanded cash to cremate the body. However, their demand was refused and the body was taken into custody and sent to the mortuary.” “According to the SOP for unclaimed bodies, we conducted the postmortem examination after 72 hours as no one came to claim it. The report revealed that the victim had been strangulated. This led to suspicion of murder. We called the three accused who had brought the body to us. During interrogation, the trio confessed that Sarvesh had strangulated the victim, while the other two had helped him,” said SHO. He added, “All four including the victim were drug addicts. The trio had killed their acquaintance after he refused to share his smack with them. After the murder, the trio had assumed that police will give them cash to cremate the unclaimed body. The rickshaw on which they had brought the body was owned by Santosh.” CCTV footage from the railway station confirmed the trio had brought the body to the station on a rickshaw. According to GRP, the government pays Rs 5,000 to cremate unclaimed bodies. However, the payment is made to police and not to civilians for cremation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/drug-addicts-kill-junkie-bring-body-to-grp-for-money/articleshow/88153128.cms||---

The formal recognition comes after TLMAL, which had entered into a pact with Lockheed Martin in 2018 to develop a fighter wing prototype, was able to demonstrate the capability to perform detailed part manufacturing and delivery of a fully compliant representative fighter aircraft wing shipset. Lockheed Martin said this achievement further strengthens its partnership with India and “supports its F-21 offering for procurement of 114 new fighter aircraft exclusively for India and the Indian Air Force by proving additional indigenous production capability”. “Lockheed Martin partnered with TLMAL to build one of the most technologically complex aerostructures — a fuel-carrying 9G, 12,000-hour, interchangeable and replaceable fighter wing,” said Aimee Burnett, vice president of strategy and business development, Lockheed Martin Integrated Fighter Group. “This effort represents Lockheed Martin demonstrating to India, and to the world, the degree of confidence that exists in our relationships with our partners in India. Lockheed Martin is one of the only aerospace and defence companies with a complex aerostructure capability for advanced fighters in India,” Burnett added. Speaking at an event to mark the first fighter wing prototype built at the TLMAL facility on Tuesday, Telangana IT & industries minister KT Rama Rao said that the development, which comes after the successful certification and deliveries of F-16 fighter jet wings, echoes Lockheed Martin’s confidence in Telangana’s manufacturing capabilities and is a testimony to the advanced skill base and capabilities of Hyderabad’s defence and aerospace ecosystem. He also pointed out that increasingly aerospace and defence OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) from US, UK, France and Israel are choosing Telangana to establish their state-of-the-art manufacturing, engineering, training and innovation centres in India, even as the state houses a large cluster of over 1,000 local MSMEs engaged in precision engineering industry catering to the aerospace and defence sector, many of which are integrated into global supply chains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-f-21-fighter-jet-wings-all-set-to-be-made-in-hyd-by-tata-lockheed-martin-jv/articleshow/88152445.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Suspecting that the vehicle could have been involved in a road accident, we followed it,” Satish said. The team noticed the car going into the cellar of the apartment, took photos and left. Subsequently, they heard the wireless alert on the hit-and-run case. “We corroborated particulars of the suspect vehicle with the car spotted on Road Number 5. We immediately went to the apartment and saw the two persons with another man who had come in a white car. We later handed over the two to Banjara Hills police,” SI B Harishwar Reddy said. Cops said it would have been difficult to prove the drunk driving angle if the accused had left the place. “The fantastic policing by Blue Colts team played a key role in immediate arrest of the accused,” Banjara Hills ACP M Sudarshan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/quick-work-by-patrolcops-put-brakes-onhit-and-run-accused/articleshow/88152726.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Six more test Covid positive at ZP High School in Mamidipally||HYDERABAD: Four more students, a teacher and a watchman of Zilla Parishad High School (ZPHS), Mamidipally in Nadigama in Ranga Reddy district tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. In total, 10 (students and staff) have tested positive in the school. “A total of 63 people, both students and staff, were tested on Tuesday and six are positive,” said a teacher from the school, adding that the students (two each) are from class 9 and 10. The teacher said that another 30 students were yet to be tested as they were absent on Tuesday. “We were asked to prepare a list of students along with their addresses so that the health department can track and test them,” the teacher added. As per directions of health officials a school needs to be closed temporarily if more than five cases are reported, but teachers said that officials at district level asked them to continue with physical classes for now. “Teachers and students are scared as 10 have already tested positive. Shutting school for two to three days for sanitisation will help us, but we did not get permission from the officials,” said a teacher. P Suseendra Rao, district education officer (DEO), Ranga Reddy, meanwhile, said that he has already informed the collector about the school. “The school has already been sanitised, all students have been tested. We are pursuing the matter and will decide whether or not to temporarily shut the school,” said the DEO. While at Government High School, Mudfort, no fresh cases have been reported as all the 131 students who were tested on Tuesday were negative. Attendance percentage, however, went down as only 131 students attended physical classes on Tuesday as against 328 on Friday, a day before the principal (in-charge) tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/six-more-test-veat-zp-high-schoolin-mamidipally/articleshow/88152774.cms||---

The management of Numaish did not organise the exhibition due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2021. Despite the worries over Omicron, All India Industrial Exhibition (AIIE) Society is gearing up to hold Numaish. The AIIE Society has already completed the process of inviting applications from traders from all over the country and is now scrutinising them to allot the stalls. “We received a tremendous response from traders. We are planning to allot 2,500 stalls in the ensuing exhibition. This year, the AIIE Society has come up with the motto of encouraging new start-ups and young entrepreneurs during the 45-day long Numaish,” AIIE Society vice-president Prabha Shankar told TOI. Traders from Afghanistan, Iran and Thailand will also exhibit their products. On concerns over Omicron, Shankar said: “We are committed to following SOPs issued by the government. We followed them even during the 20-day mini Numaish in October. The allotment of stalls will start this week and we plan to open the exhibition, as per the schedule, on January 1.” The exhibition society has urged the fire services and police departments to issue the mandatory NOC to go ahead with Numaish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/numaish-from-jan-1-2500-stalls-to-dot-exhibition/articleshow/88152817.cms||Sunil Mungara

The deceased — 24-year-old Ayodhya Rai and 28-year-old Devender Das — were cafeteria employees at Rainbow Hospital in Banjara Hills. The duo lost their lives after being mowed down by a Porsche driven by Bazar Rohit Goud (29), a resident of Uppal. Ayodhya Rai, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was looking forward to getting married next year, his employer, Justin Paul — a manager at Cube catering service — informed TOI. “Rai, the eldest in his family was the sole breadwinner with the responsibility of funding the education of two younger siblings. (Devender) Das who is an assistant cook got married just 10 months ago and was looking forward to bringing his wife to Hyderabad in January to start his married life,” Paul explained. Rai’s body was taken to Varanasi via flight from where it was transported to Ghazipur where his last rites would take place on Wednesday. Devender Das’s funeral took place in Panjagutta while his wife Deepti and mother Geetanjali Das, witnessed it through a video call. His family members explain that Devender’s mother Geetanjali is a heart patient and that she would not be able to take it to see her son dead and hence they did not bring them to Hyderabad. Ram Parvesh, Rai’s cousin who also works with Cube explains that a lot was riding on Ayodhya’s salary for the entire family. “He moved to Hyderabad with big dreams of educating his brothers as he could only study till class 10. He also hoped to get married and just a few months ago we found a potential alliance for him,” Parvesh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/accident-victims-were-families-lynchpin/articleshow/88152696.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Goa||Gotcamolem locals want action against wildlife in fields||Poinguinim: Nearly a year after the residents of Gotcamolem in Poinguinim highlighted the challenges faced by them with respect to man-animal conflict on account of fields in the village being allowed to lie fallow, they have now requested the authorities to, at the very least, ensure that farmers clear the fields of undergrowth, bushes and jungle trees. On a request by the villagers, range forest officer (wildlife) Anant Velip had inspected the area and advised them to make an application to the deputy conservator of forests, which they did. With no solution forthcoming, the residents have now requested the authority to use his office to ask the owners and cultivators to keep their fields clean even if they do not cultivate it every year. Paddy fields in the village have been left uncultivated for more than a decade now. Residents say with no human movement in the fields, wild animals, including leopards, bisons, wild boars and reptiles, have increasingly begun frequenting them. “In the monsoon, reptiles even make their way into residential areas. Wild animals are also sighted often, not only during late evenings, but also during the day,” local Maria Fernandes said. The wild animals are attracted to residential areas as domesticated animals like pigs and dogs make for easy prey, said Paul Fernandes, whose dog tied in a closed verandah was lifted by a leopard. It may be recalled that after persistent requests, the wildlife authority had set a trap for the leopard. It was caught and released elsewhere. “Besides, a lot of monkeys have also made their homes in these bushes and wild trees, and further destroy our farms,” local Josefina Fernandes said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gotcamolem-locals-want-action-against-wildlife-in-fields/articleshow/88153628.cms||Albert Fernandes

The victims’ kin later protested outside the factory demanding strict action against the owner and officials of the factory. Forces from three police stations were rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control. Additional district magistrate (city) RB Pandey ordered a magisterial enquiry into the matter. Later in the day, the families of the dead workers settled the matter with the factory management after compensation and other benefits were given to them. No police complaint has been fined. A senior administrative official, who wished not to be named, told TOI, “The families of the deceased agreed to settle the matter after they were offered Rs 50,000 cash, a cheque of Rs 8 lakh and monthly pension of Rs 8,000, along with the sum insured under the insurance scheme.” All the workers fell unconscious while cleaning the tank and were rushed to a private medical college where three of them — all married — died during treatment. The condition of four others is critical and are still unconscious. BL Agro is located in Parsa Khera Industrial area in Bareilly. In the morning, Praveen Kumar (30), Prabhat Kumar (31), Nitin Kumar (30), Hemraj (35), Neeraj Yadav (31), Vijay Kumar (25) and Mohammed Yaseen (age not known) entered the 20-ft-deep tank to clean it and fell unconscious. Yaseen, Neeraj and Vijay were declared dead in hospital. All the victims were residents of nearby villages. Factory’s administrator Prem Babu said, “The cleaning of the equalization tank is a routine process. As the cleaning was scheduled for Tuesday, the tank’s cap was opened on Monday evening itself. The safety team observed that the smell of the gasses was more than the normal level and told the operator to postpone the cleaning. The operator ignored the warning and sent the labourers inside the tank. Two teams are trying to find out what has happened inside the tank. We have completed all the formalities for compensation and all the labourers were covered under insurance.” Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “Doctors say the four workers who are still critical suffered from hypoxia (a condition where the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level) and are on oxygen support. The bodies of three workers have been sent for postmortem.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/3-dead-4-critical-after-cleaning-tank-at-bareilly-factory/articleshow/88151728.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Nagpur||New RT-PCR testing rates low, some labs may stop collection||Nagpur: Following a further rate cut by the state government, some private labs in the city said they may only go for home collection and stop lab sampling which is not viable any more. On Monday, the state government capped the home collection of RT-PCR samples to 700 from the 800 earlier and lab collection at 350 from the previous 500 under certain conditions. Collection from hospital, quarantine centre or testing centre is chargeable at Rs500, down by Rs100. The government aims to encourage more testing as the number started going down. Some lab owners said only the reagents prices have dropped while all overheads, including salaries of technicians, data entry operators, electricity bills, consumables and biomedical waste charges have gone up. As per the government order, expenses for all the necessary consumables like VTM and PPE kits will be borne by the sample provider. Lab owners said people think they are being overcharged when the final cost of test and consumables is communicated to them. Dr Dinesh Agrawal, secretary, Vidarbha Association of Medical Microbiologist, said the revised rates are not justified. “They are not enough to cover the cost of the kit, including chemical, PPE and other consumbles. Ultimately, hygiene will suffer. Quality and services too may be hampered,” he said. Dr Agrawal agreed that some labs may be planning to stop OPD sampling. “Those having their own set up and property may be able to sustain under the new circumstances. But many have rented the space and are likely to stop collection at labs,” he said. Dr Agrawal added that still there may be a Rs100 profit margin for diagnostic labs but it is too less to cover expenses incurred in the process. “Nagpur has around 35 labs from just 5 or 6 earlier. Samples are also less these days. So many are running into losses. RTPCR machines can’t be used for other diagnostics techniques except SarsCov2. One lab set up cost around Rs40lakh,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-rt-pcr-testing-rates-low-some-labs-may-stop-collection/articleshow/88150871.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||1st year students asked to fill online form again, data transition botched up||Nagpur: The Nagpur University’s (NU) new private agency MKCL has left hundreds of first-year students in the lurch by making them fill up enrolment forms on their own. Many parents and students as well as college officials are in panic as NU had set December 8 deadline to complete the enrolment process, which remains pending due to technical glitches. The enrolment number is a unique student ID, without which exam formalities can’t be completed. Recently, NU had brought back a private agency for exam works amid stiff opposition from several quarters. The previous private agency, Promarc, had maintained the student’s data during new admissions in a different format. Several colleges complained to TOI that the exam section is reluctant to heed their advice regarding technical issues faced by students. One of the major problem is that the students need to upload images of their educational documents, with each file size up to 1MB. Previously, images upto 2MB could be uploaded. The students and colleges are unable to view the documents uploaded earlier while they can’t upload new ones. Also, colleges say there is no option to alert student in case their form is rejected by them. Vice chancellor SR Chaudhari and director of examinations and evaluation Prafulla Sabale didn’t respond to TOI’s calls and messages. Till Tuesday evening, there was no clarity if the deadline would be extended. RG Tale, secretary of Principal’s Forum, said the university will have to extend the deadline as huge amount of work is pending. “The limited time frame was the biggest mistake. The university issued a letter on December 4 asking colleges that the enrolment data conversion from Promarc to MKCL needed to be completed by December 8. But the university has kept colleges out of it. There is no guarantee that students may have received the link sent to their registered mobile number. Students keep changing their numbers, many face internet issues, many others don’t have a smartphone. These things were not taken into consideration while taking the sudden decision, said Tale. Tale added that the new format was rolled out without proper training and back up. “Even those who are able to view the link and log in to the portal are unable to see the documents,” he said. A college official said they have over 1,000 students facing similar issues. “Most of them made wrong entries, beside the educational certificates are not visible. In such case, the college rejects the application. But students are not getting an alert,” the official said. Tale said the entire process must be done by college and not students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/1st-year-students-asked-to-fill-online-form-again-data-transition-botched-up/articleshow/88152472.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The team will examine the antiques which were in Mavunkal’s possession at the museum set up at his rented house in Kaloor. Sources said that the team will be constituted by the ASI zonal director (Chennai). Earlier, the Thrissur unit of ASI and the state archaeology department conducted an examination at Mavunkal’s museum after he was arrested in a financial fraud case. They have found that most of the items, which were presented as antiques, were false antiques. But the team also found a few real antiques among the items at the museum. So, further examination is required to collect more details about those antiques and the special team will do it.  The decision was taken by the ASI director based on a letter received from the ASI Thrissur unit, citing the need for a detailed probe into the real antiques possessed by Mavunkal. “They have to trace the age of the antiques and also how Monson procured them. The ASI director has directed the Chennai zonal director to assign it to an SIT. The findings of ASI are required for the crime branch to file the chargesheet and we are awaiting the report,” said a CB source. Meanwhile, the CB has completed the investigation into the financial cheating case registered against Mavunkal based on the complaint filed by six Kozhikode-based businessmen. It was this case that led to Mavunkal’s arrest which later revealed his fraud activities. CB is likely to file the chargesheet by the end of this month. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/asi-to-form-special-team-to-probe-monson-case/articleshow/88152476.cms||---

While red cap is the SP’s traditional party head gear, cycle is their election symbol. Hours after the PM attacked the SP while addressing a gathering in Gorakhpur, Akhilesh took to Twitter saying: "The red alert for the BJP is rising prices, unemployment, the poor condition of farmers and labourers; It is about Hathras, Lakhimpur and harassment of women and youth. It is about a collapsed education system, trade and health and also an alert that the 'red cap' that will push the BJP out of power this time."

---||Nagpur||Bramhapuri stares at jumbo problem||Nagpur: Gadchiroli forest officials are on high alert and have launched intense monitoring as a herd of elephants is likely to be moving further towards Bramhapuri in Chandrapur district from Wadsa forest division. TOI reported on November 20 that a herd of 22 elephants reaching Wadsa, travelling over 50km through Malegaon forests from Dhanora and Murumgaon forest ranges in the Gadchiroli division. One elephant had also delivered a calf taking the herd’s strength to 23. It is nearly two months since the elephants have been moving in the Gadchiroli forest. The herd was first sighted on October 17 and had entered the tribal district through Chhattisgarh. On Tuesday, the herd had reached the banks of Wainganga river, which divides the tiger-bearing Armori range in Wadsa and North Bramhapuri range in Chandrapur district. “We have been keeping a close watch on the situation,” says state PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye. Talking to TOI, conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said, “It is true that the herd is in Palasgaon round in Armori and has reached Wainganga banks. If it crosses the river, the herd will enter Bramhapuri. The Armori forest officials have intensified patrolling and our attempt would be to ensure the elephants remain in Wadsa division.” Mankar said though the road distance the elephants travelled towards the Wainganga riverbank may be 50-60km, the aerial distance is around 15km only. “If the herd reaches Bramhapuri crossing the river, it will be a tough challenge for the forest department, which is already grappling with tiger-human conflict there. The water level has receded and one cannot rule out the possibility,” fears Vivek Karambelkar, Chandrapur honorary district wildlife warden. “In North Bramhapuri, many farmers have taken to banana cultivation. As the area is close to the river, farmers also take second crop apart from paddy. It would be a double whammy for them,” said Karambelkar. However, Sagnik Sengupta of Stripes And Green Earth (SAGE) Foundation, West Bengal, working for elephant conservation, says, “It is unlikely that the elephants would cross the river as there are calves in the herd.” RFO Avinash Meshram said, “Armori is a good habitat with several natural and artificial waterbodies and food in the forest. Besides, there is no disturbance, but still the herd has been changing locations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bramhapuri-stares-at-jumbo-problem/articleshow/88152483.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Special courts were set up to deal with heinous crimes against children, focus on Pocso cases and dispose them of within a year. However, more than 77% of Pocso cases at Delhi courts take anywhere between one and 3 years to complete trial. According to Delhi Police data, in 2020, a total of 1,197 cases were registered with a 30% dip from 2019 when over 1,1719 cases were lodged. The data related to investigation in such cases showed that in more than half the Pocso cases, investigation took more than 90-120 days to be completed. As many as 56% of the CAC cases lodged in 2019 are still awaiting investigation, while chargesheets have been filed in only 36% of them. The Praja Foundation report stated that Delhi Police was facing a 15% staff shortage across its 15 districts and specialised units. The foundation said that there was a major gap between the sanctioned and employed staff when it came to posts of additional deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners of police and sub-inspectors. “As opposed to its sanctioned strength of 92,058 personnel, only 78,286 staffers are employed and working in 2020-21. There is a 74% shortage in staff numbers with only 14 additional DCPs in Delhi as opposed to the sanctioned strength of 54. There was a shortage of 20% in the post of police sub-inspectors in 2020-21, who also perform the role of investigation officers," the report stated. It said there were also departments and posts where working staff was higher than the sanctioned numbers. "Among departments, the special police unit for women and children had 14% more personnel deployed than sanctioned. Among posts, there were 17 special police commissioners in 2020 as opposed to the 13 sanctioned,” the report stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-attack-these-kids-awaiting-justice/articleshow/88153165.cms||---

Upon the directions of civic administrator Kadambari Balkawade, the drive to clean up the public places from encroachments began from Monday. On the first day, the KMC team comprising officials and staff from the estate department and anti-encroachment department cleared the encroachments around Rankala lake. Balkawade has appealed to the citizens to click the pictures of the encroachments in their localities, especially those hindering the traffic flow and obstructing pedestrians. At most places, the vendors have occupied the pedestrian pathways and thus forcing people to walk on the roads with the threat of accident. On Tuesday morning, the vendors from Papachi Tickti to Malkar Tickti road, which is a major road along the KMC building, were removed. The officials faced opposition when the staff tried to take away the carts and goods of the vendors. In one such instance, vendors resisted chief estate officer Sachin Jadhav, who had no option but to give up owing to the fierce resistance. “The vendors have occupied the footpaths for several years and they claim the place as if their own. They were asked to shift to other places or else we will seize the belongings. However, many did not listen to us. If the carts and other materials are not seized, then they can once again occupy the place,” said Jadhav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vendors-oppose-kmcs-anti-encroachment-drive/articleshow/88150959.cms||---

A police team will also leave for Kumbla in Kasaragod with Mohammed Mansoor, one of the accused, to confirm his identity. The judicial first class magistrate court in Thiruvalla had on Monday sent the five accused persons in the case in eight-day police custody till December 13.

---||Nagpur||Stop mixing garbage or face action, NMC warns pvt firms||Nagpur: Upset with the city’s descent in the latest Swachh Bharat rankings, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has warned both the firms engaged in door-to-door collection — AG Enviro and BVG India — to improve their performance by December 15 or expect to face action. In the wake of Nagpur’s fall from 18th to 21st position in the rankings, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has stressed the need for scientific disposal of garbage at the dumping yard. He has also directed the solid waste management (SWM) department to lift only segregated garbage. Confirming the development, NMC’s SWM nodal officer Dr Gajendra Mahalle told TOI that even after appointing two agencies, the city’s dumping yard in Bhandewadi was getting mixed garbage. “Though the city generates 1,100-1,200 metric tonnes of garbage every day, only 35%-40% of the segregated garbage is being transported to the dumping yard,” he said. Mahalle added that this is happening despite around 60% citizens handing over segregated waste to both firms. Inspections of various localities have revealed that the workers engaged by both firms are mixing garbage, even though residents are handing over segregated waste. It is learnt that NMC has started the process for 100% processing of the city’s garbage at Bhandewadi dumping yard. With the current situation, NMC’s purpose to treat the waste will be defeated. Deputy municipal commissioner Vijay Deshmukh has asked the companies to lift only segregated garbage during their door-to-door collection. One of the key conditions in the agreements with the agencies is to lift only segregated garbage and transport it to the dumping yard. But the clause is not being adhered to since the appointment of both the agencies, which is presenting a bad image of the city. Deshmukh has directed the companies’ officials to stick to the terms and conditions and improve their working by December 15, or face action. Dr Mahalle added that if mixed garbage was found being transported to Bhandewadi, NMC would impose Rs100 fine per compactor vehicle engaged in transporting door-to-door collection. The firms have also been told to collect only segregated waste by creating awareness in the areas where they are getting mixed garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stop-mixing-garbage-or-face-action-nmc-warns-pvt-firms/articleshow/88152497.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

A relative who was with them was lucky to escape with injuries. The incident happened at Akinepalli village in Dammapet mandal. The deceased were P Daniel (43) and his son P Balu (21) of Ranguvanipally in the same mandal. The two victims along with the relative, Vijay, were going to neighbouring Akinepalli village during the early hours of Tuesday for work when they stepped on the live electric wire trap. “Both Daniel and Balu died on the spot. Vijay was unconscious when he was shifted to a hospital, but now he is out of danger,” Aswaraopet CI Upendra Rao said. “Even the mango grove owner is unaware of the trap. We suspect that someone from Akinepalli or neighbouring villages set it up to catch wild boars,” the CI said. A case was registered under IPC section 304 (ii).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-son-step-on-poachers-live-wire-trap-die/articleshow/88152489.cms||---

---||Rajkot||In this Gujarat village, women panchayat dictates terms||RAJKOT: We are the change that we seek, said former US president Barack Obama while emphasizing on individuals to be the harbinger of change. A similar precept was propounded by Mahatma Gandhi long ago which found resonance with this quaint little village in Gir-Somnath district, Badalpara, several decades later. To revolutionize thinking and changing its societal norms, Badalpara handed over the reins of its panchayat to the women — a bold step in a state tarnished by skewed sex ratio. Located barely four kilometres away from the temple town Somnath, Badalpara village, which has received the Adarsh gram award for its cleanliness, carved its own change by selecting only women members for its panchayat this year. This is the sixth term of the village panchayat, with a population of 2,000, in which all the members — one Sarpanch and eight members — were elected uncontested. This year, the seat of sarpanch was reserved for scheduled caste category and so, Kantaben Vara was appointed to the coveted seat. “In over 70-odd years after Independence, our village has never held any gram panchayat election. This is the sixth term when all women were selected uncontested to rule the village. The villagers have reposed faith in the decisions taken by the women and have been witness to the development the women leaders have brought in after they took charge,” Rajiben Barad, a panchayat member told TOI. Along with pakka roads and 25 CCTV cameras for security, the village has installed 12 public announcement systems too not only for recreation with bhajans and music, but for all important announcements as well. It has 100 percent toilet facility and also has a library. Sign boards have been placed near every street that contains not just the name of the street, but also its residents. Every household here has also been fitted with water connection and water meters. Bikhu Barad, a gram panchayat supervisor, said that the water meters are a measure to ensure nobody wastes water. “We will allow 15 to 18 litres free water per person but beyond that it is chargeable which will be decided by the next panchayat body,” Barad explained. 100% addiction free! What is considered to be its biggest achievement is that the village has rid itself of all addictions in 2004 and nobody here is allowed to consume tobacco or gutkha. Under the hawk-eyed women body, the rule is strictly followed while the panchayat imposes a fine of Rs 500 for the rule breaker. Trying to keep its surroundings green, the panchayat has also planted around 10,000 trees in the past few years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/in-this-village-women-panchayat-dictates-terms/articleshow/88151733.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Suman claimed that even after Medak authorities provided all the proof Rajender continued to deny what happened. “Eatala Rajender continues to accuse the TRS administration and even the district collector of harassing him,” Suman said. He urged Huzurabad people to be aware of facts and question their MLA at all public appearances if found guilty. Suman slammed the Centre for failing to respond to TRS MPs’ demonstrations in Delhi over paddy procurement. “The BJP government is thick-skinned when it comes to farmers’ difficulties. Congress and BJP MPs have failed to raise Telangana-related concerns,” he said, adding that the two parties have no moral right to criticise the TRS whose MPs have been at the forefront of protests in Parliament. “Neither the Congress nor BJP MPs were able to get any problems pertaining to the state addressed by the Centre. Instead, they’re having a good time in Delhi,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/eatala-should-apologise-to-land-owners-state-suman/articleshow/88152502.cms||---

---||Delhi||Doctors’ stir in Delhi sparks emergency as patients left in the lurch||NEW DELHI: Three pregnant women — one in obvious pain, two who had completed the full term and were groaning with labour agony — begged, pleaded, wept and fought with the security staff at Sucheta Kripalani Hospital. But with the doctors on strike there, they were eventually turned away. There were similar moments at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital. At all three, patients were in discomfort, lying outside the hospitals awaiting admission, while services were disrupted by the residents’ protest. Many patients had arrived unaware that a strike was on and kept mumbling about how they didn’t have the money to keep travelling to and from hospital. Jagdish Kushwah, 30, had come with his senior citizen parents to RML from Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh. A dismayed Kushwah told TOI, “Both my kidneys aren’t working well and I need a transplant. We have spent Rs 5,000 reaching here but we did not know there was a strike going on. We don’t have anywhere to go, so we will stay here and see what happens.” At Sucheta Kriplani, Khusboo had come with mother-in law Ram Shani and sister-in-law Preeti and an Asha worker. The 20-year-old had complained of uneasiness and pain. Preeti who was going from pillar to post trying to get the doctors to see Khusboo, all in vain. The family resides in Jhandewalan and had been under the care of obstetricians at SKH. “We first took her to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and then to Lok Nayak Hospital,” Preeti said. “We came there then but nobody is looking at her. The doctors told us that if Khusboo stays here, it is at our risk. She’s in pain and we have no clue what to do now. We don’t have money to take her to a private hospital”. Late at night, when TOI checked with the family, Khusboo had been admitted to a local hospital after her water broke. Two others expecting mothers, Mohini from Sadar Thana and Arti from Baljeet Nagar, also sat in discomfort outside Sucheta Kripalani’s maternity ward. The families of both were distressed at the situation. Neetu, Mohini’s relative, said, “We have been here almost two hours now, but they refused to admit her despite her being in labour. They dismissed our pleas saying we could continue to linger on at the hospital at our own risk.” With so many people coming to the hospitals, many of them from outside Delhi, and finding there were no services available for them due to the strike, the people had made temporary dwellings right outside the hospitals. On the pavement outside RML was Shadab, who had come from UP’s Rampur district. The brain tumour patient was accompanied by his father and his brother, Shehzaad. TOI found the trio had laid out flimsy beds for themselves with a couple of blankets while their bags served as pillows. Shehzaad said, “We earn a living as tailors and we spent Rs 2,500 coming to Delhi. Shadab has been operated on earlier too for his tumour, but we had come to visit the doctors because he was not feeling well. But they are not only refusing to examine him, but they are refusing admission too.” At Safdarjung Hospital, one of the busiest public hospitals in the country, most of the beds in the new emergency ward were lying vacant. An agitating resident said, “We will not stop our protests until the government gives us written assurance on expediting counselling for NEET-PG exams. We care for the lives of patients but our own lives are at stake and we have no choice.” At RML, the administration has issued a warning to the junior and senior residents against participating in the protest. “Non-observance of rules attracts disciplinary action as deemed fit, including termination of service,” the administration warned in a statement. However, the residents said they would continue the protests undeterred.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/docs-stir-sparks-emergency-as-patients-left-in-the-lurch/articleshow/88153198.cms||Sakshi Chand
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Strike announced by PG medicos withdrawn||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The boycott of emergency services announced by the post-graduate (PG) medical students of government medical college hospitals from Wednesday was withdrawn on Tuesday. The decision was taken by Kerala Medical Post Graduate Association following talks between their representatives and state health minister Veena George late on Tuesday night. State secretary of the association Dr Naveen R said the group had a meeting with the minister who assured the recruitment of non-academic junior residents within two days. “Hence, we are withdrawing the ongoing strike and the boycott of all emergency services that was to begin on Wednesday,” he added. The PG medical students decided to boycott emergency services from Wednesday as the government failed to respond to their demands despite their six-day old strike which was carried out without affecting patient care in all medical college hospitals. Senior doctors at medical college hospitals and the state branch of Indian Medical Association supported the PG Medicos strike and also urged the government to settle their issues. Resident doctors across the state were on a protest for days against the delay in NEET PG counselling and the shortage of junior residents in various hospitals in state. The resident doctors of all government medical college hospitals are already overburdened and there are only two batches in place of the usual three now. With the looming threat of a third Covid wave, we are concerned and desperately want the healthcare system to be well prepared with adequate manpower in hospitals, said Dr Naveen. KGMOA to begin strikeMeanwhile, health service doctors have decided to begin an indefinite standing strike before the Secretariat from Wednesday to protest against the anomalies in their pay revision that have not been rectified by the government. Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) and government had several discussions during the last 10 months and a lot of assurance was given. All promises are remaining on paper; health service doctors are neglected by the government, said state president of KGMOA Dr GS Vijayakrishnan. During pay revision the basic pay of the entry cadre was lowered and several allowances were withdrawn. When all other cadres and departments are given due recognition during pay revision, only government doctors are facing this neglect, said general secretary of KGMOA Dr TN Suresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strike-announced-by-pg-medicos-withdrawn/articleshow/88152515.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED quizzes junior minister Prajakt Tanpure in co-op bank scam case||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned Maharashtra’s minister of state Prajakt Tanpure in a money laundering case related to the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam. ED officials started recording Tanpure’s statement at around 3 pm. The questioning went on for seven hours, till 10 pm. While leaving the ED office, Tanpure told mediapersons, “Whatever questions they asked me, I gave them satisfactory replies. There is no truth to the allegations made against us.” Prajakt is minister of state for urban development and NCP MLA from Rahuri in Ahmednagar district. His father Prasad Tanpure is a former MP. Prajakt Tanpure had allegedly purchased a sick sugar mill at rates lower than the reserve price via auction conducted by MSCB around a decade ago. Tanpure’s father, a former MP, was one of the directors in the MSCB when it sold the Ramesh Ganesh Gadkari sugar mill to his son’s company Prasad Sugar & Allied Agro Products via auction. Part of the money used for purchasing the mill came from former MLA Ashish Deshmukh, and that created suspicion as they were managing the mill when it defaulted on payment. Earlier, ED searched the premises connected to Ashish Deshmukh and had recorded his statement in the case. The mill was earlier managed by former Congress minister Ranjeet Deshmukh and his son Ashish Deshmukh. The sugar mill was closed down in 2004 and defaulted on payment of loans of MSCB and other banks totalling over Rs 60 crore. After a few years, MSCB auctioned the mill along with its land parcel. The reserve price of the mill along with the land was Rs 26 crore, but it was sold to Prasad Sugar & Allied Agro Products for Rs 13 crore. The Tanpure family failed to get complete control of the mill and its land after purchasing it in the auction. They reportedly left the land attached with the mill, worth several crore, for the Deshmukh family and shifted the mill’s machinery to another place to start a new sugar mill that they are reportedly running successfully. The ED investigation is into the arrangement between Tanpure and Deshmukh, along with the role of office-bearers of MSCB for auctioning the mill at lower than the reserve price, causing losses to the bank. The ED is probing many sugar mills in the state that defaulted on loans availed from MSCB or financial institutions under it called district cooperative banks. Banks had subsequently auctioned these mills around a decade ago to recover losses. But these mills were mainly sold to close relatives of banks’ directors, mostly senior ministers, or their associates at less than the reserve price, causing losses to the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-quizzes-state-junior-min-in-co-op-bank-scam-case/articleshow/88153928.cms||Vijay V Singh

The Centre had recently announced that this vaccine would be initially introduced in seven states, including Maharashtra. The vaccine is administered using a needle-free applicator. State deputy director of health department (Nashik region) Dr P D Gandal confirmed that ZyCov-D vaccine would be initially administered to unvaccinated beneficiaries of 18 years and above in these two districts, although the launch date is yet to be spelled out by the state government. “The healthcare workers, who would be involved in inoculation with this new vaccine, would be imparted training before the launch,” he added. The training sessions for HCWs has been planned in the two districts on Wednesday. The state government, in association with WHO representatives, will be conducting the training on different aspects of administering the vaccine before the formal launch of the programme. Nashik municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav and Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut said the allotment of the doses to the two districts is yet to be done. “The two districts have been selected to further improve the vaccine coverage. The civic body will plan out the centres where the new vaccine will be available for the beneficiaries in due course of time,” said Jadhav. Raut said the Jalgaon administration was thinking of introducing the new vaccine in the centres where the number of unvaccinated beneficiaries is more than 100. “We are expecting the vaccine allotment within the next few days,” Raut added. At present, Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines are available in the region. According to the state health department data, the total number of beneficiaries (18 years and above) in Nashik is over 51 lakh and in Jalgaon, it is over 34 lakh. Till November end, the firsts dose of Covid vaccines had been given to over 73% beneficiaries in Nashik and over 68% in Jalgaon. Beneficiaries opting for the ZyCoV-D have to take three doses, the second one after 28 days and the third one after 56 days. “ZyCoV-D vaccine will be administered to beneficiaries who are unvaccinated,” officials said. In May and June this year, Zydus Cadila, in association with the Nashik-based HCG Manavata Cancer Centre, had undertaken clinical trials of the ZyCoV-D on 300 children in the 12-17 years age group, and 1,000 adults in Nashik. The trials went off smoothly with none of the children reporting any adverse event following immunisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/zydus-cadilas-vaccine-pilot-in-nashik-jalgaon-districts/articleshow/88150983.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Basic essential items like beds, rugs, blankets and bathing material like buckets, mugs, toilets and geyser as well as water supply were in satisfactory condition here. For entertainment purposes, indoor board games and LED TVs have also been provided in these shelter homes. TOI also found that Covid safety norms are being followed in the shelter homes. Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “Free meals at night are being provided by the civic body. We are also conducting yoga sessions.” LMC officials said that people who want to stay in permanent shelter homes will need to provide an identification card, while those who have no documents will be accommodated in temporary homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/warmth-entertainment-for-homeless-in-shelter-homes/articleshow/88153172.cms||Pranchal Srivastava
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ‘Zero’ November salary for 72,000 MSRTC staffers||MUMBAI: In a major setback to 72,000 employees on strike for the 41st day on Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) announced they will get ‘zero’ salary for November. Also 135 more staffers were suspended. “While this is unfortunate, we cannot help as they are adamant on continuing the strike despite our attempts to give them hikes,” said a senior management official, adding that 6,000 employees who were present for work in November were paid salaries plus hikes up to Rs 11,000 in basic, dearness allowance (12% to 28%) and house rent allowance. As many as 14,000 staffers, who resumed duties after threats of suspension/ dismi-ssal and appeal from the transport commissioner last mon-th, will also receive salaries with hikes in a couple of days, but there’ll be deductions for the days they were on strike. By Tuesday morning, 127 ST bus depots had started operations and this was a good sign, an official said. “Just four days back, only 49 depots were functioning. But after transport minister Anil Parab’s appeal to workers, many resumed duties and made it possible for us to ferry over a lakh commuters,” he added. The MSRTC operated close to 1,000 buses from these depots. “The number is likely to increase to 150 depots in two days,” said an official, adding that he was positive that almost all 250 depots would be operational “very soon”. Sources said the MSRTC’s strategy to transfer those participating in strike—with 600 transfer orders issued last weekend—has helped woo back the workers and restart depo-ts. There were more transfers on Monday and Tuesday too. The state is also examining if it can apply Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act on workers continuing the strike. A final call will be taken by the chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-zero-nov-salary-for-72k-msrtc-staffers/articleshow/88153349.cms||Somit Sen

The ball was set in motion by chief operating officer Saurabh Agnihotri who talked about how WASH is capable of changing the economic scenario through promoting job generation and exploring livelihood avenues through self-help groups (SHGs). The team from Amritsar, led by project manager Arjun Ram, shared live experiences on livelihood generation. Project Manager Naval Kishore Sharma said, “In Udaipur, due to lack of sufficient funds, proper sanitation wasn’t being maintained in schools of Ajmer and Kota (where FINISH Society had already worked).” “However, after motivating the women of Gujjar community, work was executed in schools after dividing them in clusters,” he said. A ‘sanitation fund’ has been created in schools under the school WASH programme, he said, adding that for proper sanitation, 1,098 sanitation messengers have been appointed and employed. Around 200 men and 110 women are earning around Rs 9,000 every month. Prominent among those who took part in the meet were director general, Axis Group of Colleges, Kanpur, Dr Col MZA Siddiquie who spoke on how to distinguish between livelihood generation and employment. Assistant professor, Amity University, Lucknow, Dr Areena Mirza Zainub highlighted key indicators in assessing livelihood generation through WASH linkages. Solid waste expert and plastic recycling business advisor, WASTE, The Netherlands, Sophie Van der Berg and WASH specialist Jeroen Ijgosse discussed global insights in improving livelihoods through plastic recycling and support of policy frameworks. Executive director, ‘Take a Stake’, John Mathai spoke on employment generation through linking companies with WASH practices, while head of SSE, Jaipur, Shalab Mittal shared his experience on SSE women livelihood model being put in place in Jaipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wash-shows-the-neat-passage-to-boost-economy-via-job-creation/articleshow/88153206.cms||---

The Telugu film titled ‘Nayeem Diaries’ is set to hit the screens on December 10. The filmmaker, Daamu Balaji, claimed that he has been getting threats from people objecting to his movie, including its title. “There can be no better person than me who can make a film on the subject that I have chosen as I myself have been a Naxalite, was underground and spent time in jail before joining the mainstream. I know the inside story of how the Naxalites (Maoists) function. I have also gathered first-hand information about Nayeem and his activities and those who benefited from his criminal actions,” Balaji told TOI. Nayeem, a former Naxalite, was killed in a police encounter on August 8, 2016, on the outskirts of Hyderabad. “Nayeem was a disillusioned Naxalite, but police used him. He directly or indirectly helped cops in dealing a deathly blow to Naxalites,” Balaji said. “Let me say this again. Nayeem was a lumpen element and the Naxalites recruited such a person. The very same lumpen element was used by police against Naxalites,” he said. Technically speaking, the film is being called a ‘work of fiction’ based on the life of Nayeem. The filmmaker says reality gets reflected in the film. “For one-and-a-half years, I have worked on the subject. I even spoke to some who were Nayeem’s handlers. Nayeem is not being glorified in the movie but it will certainly raise questions about those who have escaped from being under scrutiny of law for using him,” he said. A retired cop allegedly called up Balaji and took objection to the title of the film. Balaji said there have also been calls from a political party threatening that it would not allow the film to run. “What information is now in public domain about Nayeem is what has been propagated by police. My independent investigation into the life of Nayeem and his activities and association with police gets reflected in the movie,” Balaji said, adding that he would not be cowed down by threats from any section of the society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ex-naxals-film-on-nayeem-raises-hackles/articleshow/88152520.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Engineering CAP round 1 deadline extended||Pune: A clutch of complaints from parents and students to the higher and technical education minister to extend the deadline for admissions in the centralised admission process round 1 to engineering degree courses has led to the state Common Entrance Test (CET) cell revising the schedule. Students who have been allotted colleges in the CAP round I can now confirm their admissions by Friday. Moreover, the deadline to submit the caste proof certificate has been extended to December 21. Higher and technical education minister Uday Samant’s tweet read, “As per the demand of engineering students and parents and as per the instructions from minister of tourism Aditya Thackeray, the deadline for admissions to engineering degree is being extended. The government has also extended the deadline for submission of original certificates of caste verification required for the centralised admission process for the academic year 2021-22 under the technical education department till the last date of the admission in the second round of the centralised process.” The admission process for CAP round 1 started on December 4 and as per the earlier schedule was supposed to end on December 7 at 5pm after which on December 8, the vacancy list for round 2 was supposed to be released. However, the new schedule declared by the State CET Cell, gave an extension till December 10, to confirm their admission for round 1. As per the new schedule, students can confirm their admission by Friday, 5 pm and the vacancy list for round 2, would be displayed on December 12. While many students were happy about the decision, there are also responses on social media about how the extension will further delay the start of the academic session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-engineering-cap-round-1-deadline-extended/articleshow/88153945.cms||Ardhra Nair

The party is seeking votes on the Delhi model. Be it advertisement hoardings or radio campaigns, AAP is not using names of local leaders and appealing residents to vote for Kejriwal. Even on social media, they are running hashtags of Mein Bhi Kejriwal and Chandigarh Mein Bhi Kejriwal.In the advertisements, AAP has promised 24/7 water supply without additional tax burden on the residents. Under the proposal, the party assured that 20 kilolitres of clean and free water would be provided per month. Besides, the party is also promising to make Chandigarh municipal corporation a corruption-free place.AAP has already taken over 40 advertisement sites, including public toilets, on rent.On the absence of a local face, a senior AAP leader said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has delivered results in the capital and the AAP is promising a similar model for the city. Recently, Kejriwal had asked local leaders to contest MC polls and they included Prem Garg, party’s convenor; Pardeep Chhabra, party’s co-in-charge; and Chandermukhi Sharma, election committee in-charge. However, only Chandermukhi Sharma is contesting.‘They are scared of broom’“All the political parties are scared of the increasing popularity of AAP in Chandigarh. The BJP and the Congress used to say a few days ago that AAP will not even get candidates for all the 35 wards. Our election symbol (broom) is frightening the opposition parties, and they are compelled to approach the election commission against us,” said AAP’s Chandigarh in-charge and Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh. Addressing a press conference, he said the Congress had filed a complaint with the EC and requested not to allow the election symbol of broom. He said it was clear how much fear was there in the Congress, “as ours is the only party that has freed people from the corrupt politics of traditional parties.”Jarnail Singh said the Aam Aadmi Party has brought forth youth of Chandigarh and the BJP and the Congress were worried with this strategy. As a result, the BJP has been forced to cancel tickets of 50% of its candidates, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/no-local-face-aap-keeps-kejriwal-as-its-poster-boy/articleshow/88152509.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Delhi||Delhi: Women at receiving end of 73% abduction cases last year||NEW DELHI: Women were at the receiving end of close to 73% of the 4,051 kidnapping and abduction cases registered in the national capital last year. According to a report by NGO Praja Foundation, the percentage of women being targeted for such crimes has grown steadily over the years. It stood at 62% in 2016. In 2019, as many as 5,886 kidnapping and abduction cases were registered, of which 3,672 cases involved women. The report stated that of the total abduction cases in the city, 63% involved the 18-30 years age group. "Women between 18 and 30 years of age were mostly abducted," the report stated. The recovery rate, that is, the victims being rescued alive, fell from 39% in 2018 and 35% in 2019 to 31% in 2020. In 2018, as many as 8,748 people couldn’t be saved. This number was 9,615 in 2019 and 9,507 in 2020. According to the NGO, women and children often bear the brunt of the gaps that exist in the law and order and the judicial system. Last year, 53 human trafficking cases were reported: 224 people were rescued from the clutches of traffickers, but 92% of the targets were trafficked into forced labour. According to Praja Foundation, there was a need to sensitise police officers to involve citizens as partners in policing. They should welcome inputs from the community and act in a collaborative and cooperative manner when it came to reporting cases and leads, the report stated. "For this, training and counselling of police officers in behavioural skills towards citizens needs to be done," the report concluded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/women-at-receiving-end-of-73-abduction-cases-last-yr/articleshow/88153234.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Malaria, dengue strike Kolkata students in exam season||KOLKATA: Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue and malaria, and seasonal ailments, like the common cold and viral fever, continue to strike even though it’s the second week of December, an unusual time for such cases. The worst impact seems to be on students, many of whom have been forced to give their offline exams, even boards first-semester tests, a miss for being down with Covid or other diseases. Several schools have been receiving applications from parents, seeking alternative exam dates so that their sick children could appear for the tests at a latter schedule. Even though unwell, a handful of students have been taking the tests—some of them from isolation rooms—fearing an academic year loss. Doctors, who pointed out that only sporadic cases of dengue were reported around his time in the past two years but the numbers were significantly high this year, warned that dengue, malaria and viral ailments would linger for a few more weeks owing to the recent spells of rain. “Two or three cases of dengue and malaria on a daily basis in December are not unusual. But I have not come across typical monsoon diseases appearing regularly in December like now. Blame it on the unusual rain,” said Institute of Child Health associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri. Doctors pointed out that the puddles left behind by the recent showers brought in by Cyclone Jawad would breed mosquitoes and push up dengue, malaria cases. “Apart from dengue and malaria, we are seeing an increase in the number of viral illnesses, including influenza. Civic bodies have been lax on vectorcontrol measures,” said an internal medicine specialist at a government hospital. CBSE first-term boards exam will continue till December 11, ISC first-semester exams will be on till December 20 and ICSE till December 16. CISCE has allowed students suffering from Covid or any other illness to opt for reassessment upon submitting proper medical reports. CBSE has allowed alternative dates only for Covid-positive candidates. Three Class X students at South Point High School and a Class XII student at Calcutta Boys’ School are among the numerous kids down with dengue. Three students at La Martiniere for Boys have applied for alternative dates for the re-assessment. Some CISCE-affiliated schools have already forwarded requests for alternative dates to the council on behalf of the students. Calcutta Boys’ School principal Raja Mcgee said, “A Class XII boy couldn’t write his papers as he was hospitalised with dengue. The council has allowed him re-assessment.” Among the three unwell students at La Martiniere for Boys, two are Class X students, one down with dengue and the other with Covid, while the third one is a Class XII student, who has missed a few papers due to health issues. “The two Class X students and one XII boy will take reassessment on alternative dates,” said John Stephen, acting principal at La Martiniere for Boys. But not so lucky were the three Class X students at South Point who have had to take their exams despite being down with dengue as CBSE’s re-assessment facility is only for the Covid-positive. “The three wrote their exams from medical room,” said trustee Krishna Damani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/malaria-dengue-strike-students-in-exam-season/articleshow/88152530.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Pandemic gives big push to pharma courses, grads||HYDERABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic has given big push to pharma courses with over 95% seats getting filled in the first phase of engineering, agriculture, medical common entrance test (Eamcet). According to figures released by Eamcet convenor Navin Mittal, 95% seats in B Pharmacy, 99% seats in Pharm D and 100% seats in pharmaceutical engineering and biotechnology were filled in the first phase. Until a few years back, Pharm D graduates were seen protesting against lack of opportunities in the industry. Thanks to the pandemic, many pharma companies, hospitals and insurance firms are now making a beeline to recruit pharma graduates. “The pandemic has definitely changed the perspective towards pharma courses with more number of students coming forward to pursue them. Before the pandemic, starting salary for pharma graduates was as low as Rs 8,000. Today, the demand for pharma graduates is very high with companies recruiting them for a starting salary of Rs 20,000,” said K Ramdass, president, Telangana Pharmacy Colleges Association. Before the pandemic, many pharmacy seats were going vacant due to poor demand for the course. This year, total 73,071 candidates had qualified in Eamcet for pharmacy courses of which 14,384 attended certificate verification. Of the 14,384 candidates, 13,646 exercised options and 8,394 were allotted seats. Total 5,252 candidates had exercised their options but were not allotted seats. “Candidates have to pay the tuition fee on or before December 10 to confirm the allotted seats. The candidate has to report at the allotted college after final phase of counselling between December 18 and December 20,” said Navin Mittal, Eamcet convenor and commissioner of technical education in Telangana. Another round of counselling is expected to be held to fill up the remaining 413 vacant pharma seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rise-in-takers-for-pharma-courses-after-covid-outbreak/articleshow/88152514.cms||---

Interacting with supporters at Shadnagar and Wanaparty, he said that their company has not encroached upon any land. Later in a media conference, he said that the TRS government had failed to keep commitments made to farmers and dalits in the state. “People now see that all of the TRS government’s promises about paddy procurement are untrue.

---||Ahmedabad||In SC, Gujarat admits to 2.6k ‘extra’ death claims than official number!||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government on Monday informed the Supreme Court that the government has till date received approximately 12,718 applications of which it has accepted 6,515 claims and payment has been made. The state government also assured the judges that it will make payment on the rest of the applications before December 10, when the apex court is scheduled to hear the issue further. The official Covid death toll in Gujarat, as declared by the government, is 10,095 so far. As per this submission alone, 2,623 more applications for Covid death claims have been made so far. The Covid compensation has been a contentious issue in the state as experts believe that the actual number of people who succumbed to Covid could be much higher which is expected to result in higher claims for ex gratia of Rs 50,000. “The simple reason for this is that the state, citing ICMR guidelines, counted only those who did not have any co-morbidities as Covid deaths. The others were written off as deaths caused by cardiac failure, respiratory infection, renal failure, multi-organ failure, etc. The actual number will be known only after assessment of all the claims submitted to the state authorities,” said a city-based epidemiologist. According to official figures, Ahmedabad has recorded the highest mortality (3,411), followed by Surat (1,957), Vadodara (788) and Rajkot (726).  In the past, former chief minister Vijay Rupani had rejected claims of under-reporting of Covid deaths. “The method of recording Covid deaths has been stipulated by ICMR and all states, including Gujarat, are following it. Other states are also not recording the deaths of co-morbid patients as Covid fatalities,” Rupani had said. Meanwhile, after considerable prodding by the Supreme Court over its procedure to disburse ex gratia compensation in Covid deaths, the Gujarat government on Monday informed the apex court about its amended procedure. The apex court asked the government to widely publicise that the cause of death mentioned in the death certificate would not be the sole criteria. Upon perusing the revised procedure adopted by Gujarat government, the bench of Justices M R Shah and B V Nagarathna directed, “State must give wide publicity with respect to online portal, the prescribed format, the information with regard to the grievance redressal committee in each district, municipal corporation area and the information that for getting the ex gratia compensation the only requirement is RT-PCR positive report and the death within 30 days. The cause of death mentioned in death certificate shall not be the sole criteria.” During the hearing, the state government submitted that an exclusive online portal has been created and it is in public domain from December 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-supreme-court-gujarat-admits-to-2-6k-extra-death-claims-than-official-number/articleshow/88152524.cms||---

---||Kochi||Brittas seeks access to Parl’s Central Hall as a journalist||New Delhi: CPM Rajya Sabha MP John Brittas has written to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla demanding that he be allowed to pursue his profession as a journalist and be allowed to enter the Central Hall of Parliament on a pass issued to journalists recognised for Long and Distinguished (L&D) services, rather than the one issued to all members of Parliament. The request follows the denial by Parliament security of permission to renew Brittas’s L&D services Radio Frequency (RF) Tag (pass) on grounds that a person can only be issued one pass, and that there is “no precedent” of issuing L&D passes to MPs. “Journalism is my profession and every Member of Parliament, whether an advocate, doctor or engineer is having the right and liberty to practice his/her profession… L&D Pass which I have earned after long stint of journalism is my professional means apart from being a privilege… Any break in my professional facility can seriously hamper my professional pursuit in future,” Brittas has said in his letter to Birla. The CPM MP also suggested that the Speaker may intervene to resolve the issue by granting him only one pass; the L&D pass. Sources told TOI when Brittas approached the Lok Sabha secretariat, the matter was referred to Parliament security, which then refused renewal of his pass on grounds that there is no precedent, and that he already has a superior access pass as MP. The source also said that though many journalists have served as MPs, none have sought entry into Parliament on passes issued to them as journalists. With Brittas pursuing the issue with Birla, though, the matter has now been referred to Parliament security again and is “under examination”. Incidentally, the request to renew Brittas’ L&D category pass comes at a time when Parliament has withdrawn L&D and Central Hall passes to all journalists citing Covid protocols. He was also among several opposition MPs who opposed restrictions on media entry to Parliament and Central Hall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/brittas-seeks-access-to-parls-central-hall-as-a-journalist/articleshow/88152537.cms||Swati Mathur

The 1,800-metre-long bridge, supported by 59 pillars, connecting Shahjahanpur with Budaun and Bulandshahr, was built about 11 years ago. Its foundation was laid in 1992. The team comprising chief engineer from Saharanpur, Sandeep Kumar, chief engineer (SETU) from Lucknow, Ashok Agarwal, along with staff from Bareilly and Shahjahanpur carried out a thorough investigation of all the pillars, soil and other factors. This area was largely affected by floods in the Ramganga, disturbing the settlement of pillars due to soil erosion, the team observed. Settlement is the downward movement of the soil when a load is applied on it. Agarwal said, “The committee inspected the possible reasons for the collapse of a pillar of the bridge and found that there was no structural failure. It was a geological failure due to which the pillar had settled into the soil. This bridge is constructed on 59 pillars and we have marked a few pillars and will observe the settlement in those pillars for a period of 15 days. The soil samples have been sent for lab tests. We have spoken to the experts and have asked them to come here and guide us in repairing the bridge and controlling further damage.” The bridge also connected Kalaan tehsil of Shahjahanpur to the district headquarters. Efforts are on to set up a pontoon bridge across the Ramganga. The public works department has already marked the area for making the temporary bridge and is preparing the approach road. The pontoons are expected to arrive this week. However, locals are unhappy with the progress of the work as they have to shell out Rs 20 one way for every boat trip.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/geological-factors-not-structural-defects-broke-up-bridge-into-3-experts-team/articleshow/88151768.cms||---

According to Delhi government, these ‘modern extraction wells’ can provide six to eight times more water than ordinary wells. The modern wells are designed in such a way that water gets purified within the well and does not require any additional treatment plant. “Delhi government has designed and constructed modern extraction wells in the premises of Sonia Vihar water treatment plant. These wells were constructed as part of a pilot project to determine whether the use of modern technology can result in more water augmentation,” said the water minister after his visit. “The capacity of each well is to supply 1.2 to 1.6 million gallons of water per day, the total supply of water will be increased by 25-30 per cent. This will resolve the problem of drinking water in east Delhi areas.” According to Jain, this pilot project has been successful and the government will now build 70 more such wells in the same premises spread over 150 acres, each of them having the same capacity of the ones constructed now. The system of these new wells is designed in such a way that it will automatically replenish the groundwater during the rainy season. “Delhi government had promised to provide 24 hours’ piped drinking water to all the households and this is a very important step towards turning this promise into reality. These modern wells will help in increasing the availability of water and will drastically increase the quantity of water supplied to the water treatment plants,” added Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/modern-extraction-wells-to-augment-water-supply-in-east-delhi-says-jain/articleshow/88153217.cms||---

He said such camp politics undermines the election process as under section 171 (C), whoever, voluntarily interferes with the free exercise of any electoral right and trying to influence an election is an offence. “Section 171 (E) explains that providing food, drinks, entertainment amounts to bribing the voters. ECI shall act and prosecute,” he added. FGG requested the chief electoral officer, Telangana to take action against the candidates who are committing offences by organizing camps.

The latter was covering the farmers’ protest in Tikunia town on October 3 when he was allegedly mowed down by the minister’s son’s convoy. The application was moved by Raman’s brother, Pawan Kashyap, on November 9. The court had sought the report from police to know if any FIR was already lodged in this matter. Senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told TOI, “The application was rejected because SIT is already investigating Raman’s murder in the FIR registered by the farmers against Ashish Mishra and others. Besides, two FIRs cannot be registered for same case.” Pawan told TOI, “We want justice for my brother and I will check with my counsels over further action to be taken in this matter.” In the violence that took place during a farmers’ protest in the Tikunia area on October 3, Raman and four farmers were killed while several were injured after three vehicles of the minister’s son’s convoy allegedly mowed down the protesting farmers. The farmers in retaliation had lynched three BJP workers on October 3. Two separate FIRs were registered in this matter. The first by the farmers, and the second, was registered by BJP corporator Sumit Jaiswal, who himself was accused of farmers’ murders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/cjm-rejects-journalists-kins-plea-for-separate-fir-for-murder-against-minister-son-in-kheri-violence-case/articleshow/88151783.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

All the private hospitals were busy dealing with a huge rush of Covid patients. Some hospitals could not even renew licences for the last two years due to the Covid. It is mandatory for all private hospitals and maternity homes to renew their licences every three years. The NMC’s health department has given these hospitals time till February next year to renew their licences. Over 400 registered private hospitals regularly renew their licences, however, during the pandemic, most of them failed to do so. Now, the hospitals have time till February end, but they have to renew their licences before that, said NMC officials. During the Covid, around 150 private hospitals had started Covid treatment by providing over 5,000 beds for Covid patients, including 3,900 oxygen beds and 793 ventilators. During the first wave between April 2020 and January 2021, around 80 private hospitals had started treating Covid patients following permission from the civic administration. But the number of private hospitals treating the Covid patients doubled during the second wave that began from February this year. Both the NMC and private hospitals are also prepared for the third wave after the emergence of the new variant Omicron. The civic body officials said they will take action against the hospitals failing to renew their licences after February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deadline-to-renew-hosp-licence-extended/articleshow/88151023.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Kolkata||Fresh rain opens up craters on patched-up stretches||Kolkata: Relentless rain, sometimes giving in to heavy spells of shower, over the past couple of days washed away the top layer on some roads, springing potholes at several places.  The KMC had conducted patchwork repair on several stretches in September before Durga Puja, but waterlogging from the recent showers took a toll on many of those roads, including Rabindra Sarani, Paharpur Road (Garden Reach), NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge), DH Road, Golf Garden Road and Dum Dum Road. “We had carried a patchwork repair for major roads across the city in September. But many of those stretches have freshly developed craters because of waterlogging. Now we have to launch a fresh road repair drive to fill the potholes to ensure safe commute,” said a KMC roads department official. Potholes have also sprung up on various stretches of VIP Road—Kaikhali, Haldirams, Keshtopur and Dakshindari being the worst hit—Jessore Road and the road beside Kolkata airport. The scene is equally bad on the First and Second avenues in Salt Lake as well as on the roads inside the Blocks. In fact, the roads in the township had already been in a bad state as no repair work had been taken up in a long time, and the fresh showers made it worse. In adjacent New Town, large portions of some roads have caved in, posing danger to motorists. While VIP Road is already undergoing large-scale repairs, PWD authorities said work for Jessore Road was also in the pipeline. But repairs for Salt Lake has hit a roadblock with shortage of funds, officials said. Residents complained that most of the times, patchwork was the only kind of repairs that was carried out and the layers were often washed away after a few spells of heavy rain. The stretches got damaged and potholes reappeared at the same patched-up spots, they said. A Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) official said, “There has been excessive rainfall this year as a result of which road repairs have taken a hit. We are trying to get damaged portions repaired with the road contractors with whom we have a three-year maintenance contract.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fresh-rain-opens-up-craters-on-patched-up-stretches/articleshow/88152542.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

On Wednesday, the institute’s resident doctors’ association (RDA) said they will be working with black ribbons. “India is already facing healthcare challenges owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the lower than recommended doctor/patient ratio. Delay in NEET-PG counselling is depriving services of 42,000 MBBS doctors, who would have otherwise joined at least six months back, if the NEET-PG exams and counselling had happened at the usual time,” the RDA said. Resident doctors of Safdarjung, Ram Manohar Lohia and Lady Hardinge Medical College and associated hospitals have been protesting on the issue for 11 days. From Monday, they have also boycotted OPD and other services to press for their demands. The doctors say till now they have only got verbal assurances. “We will continue with our protests until our demands are met,” Dr Aunj Aggarwal, general secretary of Safdarjung RDA, said.

Out of 1.8 crore children enrolled in government and aided schools from classes 1 to 8, verification of 75.8 lakh across 75 districts has, so far, not been done. The pendency report by the basic education department shows verification of 45.8 lakh children is pending with school teachers, while another 22.6 lakh is pending at the level of block education officers. Another 7.3 lakh cases are lying with the district basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) for verification. In addition, bank accounts of 22.7 lakh parents’ of children enrolled in state-run schools are not seeded. District-wise, Ghaziabad, Mathura and Gorakhpur have the highest pendency of 65.3%, 60.4% and 59.8% respectively. In Lucknow, verification of 44.5% — 98,392 out of 2.2 lakh students — is yet to be done. Sultanpur (20.9%), Bhadohi (21.9%) and Rae Bareli (23.2%) are the districts with least pendency. Pulling up BSAs for inordinate delay in transferring the money to the bank accounts of parents due to improper data, basic education director SVB Singh has asked departmental officials to take the DBT scheme on priority. Any laxity in the work will be taken seriously, warned Singh. Under the DBT scheme — aimed at eliminating middlemen and quality issues which erupt almost every year — the government is to transfer Rs 1,100 to the Aadhar seeded bank accounts of parents of each student enrolled in state-run and aided schools from classes 1 to 8 across the state. Of the total amount, Rs 600 is for two sets of uniforms, Rs 200 for a sweater, Rs 125 for a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks and Rs 175 for a school bag. Officials, however, said that with four months for the academic session 2021-22 to end, not all children would be without uniforms, shoes, socks, sweaters and school bags. “Since this was a major governance reform, it took a lot of time. Things should be smooth from next year when kids will have uniforms, bags, sweater, shoes and socks well in time,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/basic-education-dept-yet-to-verify-40-students-for-dbt-scheme/articleshow/88153228.cms||Isha Jain

More than 8,000 cases of dengue and 19 deaths so far have been recorded in the national capital this year. The corporations, which are primarily responsible for controlling the spread of the disease by keeping the city clean, have requested the health and family welfare department of the Delhi government to create a unified online portal, similar to the one existing for reporting Covid-19 cases. “It will be very helpful if there is a common online portal to manage the data and register the cases and other details. We had a meeting with Delhi government officials regarding this and they assured us that it will happen soon,” said an official of South Delhi Municipal Corporation. “The Delhi government is mandated to do this and hence, we have written a letter to them. We are waiting for a response,” said Alka Sharma, additional commissioner, East Delhi Municipal Corporation. According to officials, the portal will help stop the spread of the disease in an area from where a case is reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/civic-bodies-seek-common-online-portal-on-dengue/articleshow/88153230.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: SEC stays local body polls on OBC seats after SC order||MUMBAI: After the SC order staying local body polls in seats reserved for the OBC quota, the state election commission on Tuesday stayed polls on 344 of the 1,802 nagar panchayat seats which will have elections on December 21. Also, on 23 of 105 seats in Bhandara and Gondia zilla parishads and 45 of the 210 seats in the Bhandara and Gondia panchayat samitis. Polls will also be stayed on one of the four by-election seats in municipal corporations due on that date. The state election commission said it will await further directions of the SC on the OBC quota seats. The next date for the hearing is December 13. Meanwhile, the chorus of voices demanding that the polls not be held until the OBC quota was assured continued to grow. State health minister Rajesh Tope, who belongs to the NCP, said, “The polls should be stayed until the OBC quota is ensured. I have communicated this to chief ministerUddhav Thackeray.” State Congress chief Nana Patole said he had placed the same demand before Thackeray. “The BJP is showing double standards. It wants a common law for all citizens and here it is demanding OBC reservations. The Congress has had a pro-reservation stand from the beginning,” said Patole. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil reiterated his demand for the same. “The SC has said that polls should be stayed on the seats reserved for the OBC quota. But it has not insisted that the polls on the rest of the seats be held on December 21. We demand that the entire poll be stayed, or it will lead to social and political problems,” said Patil. State rural development minister Hasan Mushrif claimed the BJP was behind those filing court petitions against the OBC quota. “The BJP claims to support the OBC quota but their own people go to court challenging the quota,” alleged Mushrif. In a setback to the state government, SC had on Monday stayed the ordinance brought by the state to reserve 27% seats for OBCs in these bodies and directed the Election Commission to stay the poll on those seats. It, however, clarified the election commission can conduct polls on the rest of seats reserved for SC and ST and unreserved seats as per the schedule fixed by it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sec-stays-local-body-polls-on-obc-seats-after-sc-order/articleshow/88153949.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

TRS members walked out of both houses and protested outside Parliament. The MPs wore black shirts to mark their protest against Centre’s deadlock over paddy procurement. Earlier, TRS MPs protested and obstructed proceedings in both Houses. In Rajya Sabha, MP K Keshava Rao urged that the Centre promptly acquire pending grain from the state since lakhs of tonnes of paddy will be decomposed if it is not procured. Opposing the Centre strongly, he said the centre is discriminating against Telangana in paddy procurement. They will hold a sit-in protest at the Mahatma Gandhi statue on Parliament grounds, Keshava Rao added. TRS MPs filed adjournment motions demanding discussion on farmers’ issues, national standard procurement policy, and legal assurances that farmers would get the Minimum Support Price (MSP), but the motions were denied. However, the MPs said that the Centre provided no tangible commitments and instead blamed the state government for the delay in the delivery of Custom Milled Rice (CMR). TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao said: “We will announce our next plan after CM KCR gives us direction. We tried to speak to all other MPs who are on the same page on these TRS MPs have disrupted Parliamentary proceedings since the winter session began on November 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-mps-to-boycott-rest-of-winter-session-over-paddy/articleshow/88152536.cms||---
---||Nagpur||10 of Shivaji Nagar family test Covid positive, lens on wedding functions||NAGPUR: Ten members of a family from Shivaji Nagar under Dharampeth zone tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. They had returned from a marriage ceremony in Hyderabad some days ago. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) zonal medical team has identified 30 close contacts of the family and took their samples too. Nagpur district recorded a sudden spike of 19 cases — 16 from city, 2 rural, 1 outside district — on Tuesday. Six new city patients are from other parts. The 10 family members have been admitted to private hospitals and said to be vaccinated, excluding one under 18 years of age. Total 79 flyers landed in the city from the Sharjah-Nagpur flight of which 70 were tested but none was found positive. Rest were below 18 years old. The flyers were allowed to go home after giving their samples unlike last time when they were made to wait till results came. Tuesday’s spurt was second in the last five days where an entire family or more members tested positive. The samples would be sent for genome sequencing. Following spurt in cases, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said NMC’s flying squads will visit marriage venues to randomly test the guests. Also, if violations are found, the venue owner would be fined and certain restrictions will be imposed. Introduction of fresh containment measures would depend on detection of the new Omicron variant’s confirmed cases. So, three international flyers have tested positive and their samples are under genomic study to check the Sars-Cov2 variant they might be carrying. The civic chief cautioned that infection is spreading at marriages and gatherings, so people need to be more alert. Asked if any restrictions would be imposed on such functions, Radhkrishnan said, “It is too early to comment on that. I have instructed our health officials to visit marriage venues and randomly take samples. This is to put some sort of deterrent,” he said. Regarding institutional quarantine for asymptomatic positive patients, he ruled out stopping the measures anytime soon. “Till we have the capacity, we shall continue to isolate all new patients in CCC or a DCH, if they wish. Home isolation would not be an option for new patients as of now,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/10-of-shivaji-nagar-family-test-positive-lens-on-wedding-functions/articleshow/88150978.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

So, the TRS MPs should raise their voice in the house instead of boycotting the proceedings,” he said at a press conference. “I have already said that they will boycott the Parliament session as per an understanding between the TRS and BJP. Why did not CM KCR come to Delhi to protest over the paddy issue when the session is in place,” he wondered.

The PWD has proposed colourful lighting system on the cables as well as concrete structure of the bridge to make it more beautiful. Union minister Nitin Gadkari had approved Rs176 crore under Central Road Fund for this project. TOI was the first to report about commencement of work on October 3, 2019. The bridge was to open for traffic in two years but has been delayed due to Covid-19 pandemic. A team of PWD including chief engineer Sanjay Dashpute, superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh, deputy engineer BD Ramteke and others are hopeful of completing works in June next year. Pune-based T and T Infra Limited is executing the project. The cable-stayed bridge will be 3.5 times longer than the city’s Ram Jhula, which is 200 meter long and has a single span. Earlier, the plan was to construct Ambhora bridge with a 65 meter span at each end, and four 140 meter spans in the middle. Ramteke told TOI, “Now, there are five spans of 140 meter each. All works on two spans towards Bhandara district have been completed. Pylons of remaining three spans are also complete. Others works including installation of cables etc will start soon.” The two completed spans and three pylons stand in the water with a hillock and forest towards Bhandara district in the backdrop. There is an ancient Chaityaneshwar Shiv temple and other religious structures towards Ambhora in the district. The bridge is already attracting tourists. Ramteke said, “Sky gallery is first-of-its-kind in the country. It will be at a height of 40 metre over the bridge. It will be on the third pylon, which is in the centre of the backwater. Work on sky gallery has also started.” Ramteke said stress health monitoring system has been added to the project. “We will get real time stress on the cables, which is important for safety of the bridge. To add to the beauty, we have proposed colourful lighting system,” he said. PWD officials said the bridge will give good connectivity between Nagpur, Bhandara and Gadchiroli districts, apart from generating tourism. Kuhi and Umrer tehsils of the district will be connected with Sakoli and Lakhandur tehsils in Bhandara district. The PWD has already widened the 25km road from Chipli to Ambhora from 3.75 meter to 7 meter. There is a proposal to widen it further to 10 meter whenever traffic increases. Also, PWD has widened road from Chipli to Kuhi and Panchgaon on Umred-Nagpur road. The road towards Kardha and Paoni in Bhandara district is 3.75 meter wide. The PWD has also proposed to widen this road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cable-stayed-bridge-with-sky-gallery-to-now-open-in-june-at-ambhora/articleshow/88152552.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pay GST on full sum if society maintenance over Rs 7,500 a month||MUMBAI: In a comprehensive ruling, the GST Authority for Advance Ruling (GST-AAR), Maharashtra bench, has addressed a host of issues, typically faced by co-operative housing societies. In response to questions raised by Bhandup-based, Mahindra Splendour Co-operative Housing Society (CHS), the GST-AAR bench stated that if monthly charges collected from members (flat owners) exceeds Rs. 7,500 per month, goods and services tax (GST) will be levied and collected on the entire sum and not on the differential value which is in excess of this threshold. To illustrate, if maintenance charges are Rs 9,000 per month, GST will be applicable on this amount and not the differential of Rs 1,500. The AAR bench pointed out that the GST authorities have challenged a decision of the Madras High Court that upheld applicability of GST on the differential sum. A larger bench has issued a stay order and the matter is not yet settled. The AAR added that charges collected by the CHS on account of property tax, electricity charges and other statutory levies that form part of monthly maintenance bills would be excluded while calculating the threshold limit of Rs 7,500 per month. Rulings given by the AAR have a persuasive value and are taken into cognisance by authorities during assessments. However, it should be noted that smaller CHS’ with an annual turnover of Rs 20 lakh or less do not have to register and consequently do not have to comply with GST obligations. Mahindra Splendour CHS submitted to the AAR bench that the basic objective of collecting amounts towards sinking fund, building repair fund, education and election fund is to meet future or unplanned major expenditure. Such contributions are in the nature of a ‘deposit’ and are used for the specific purpose as prescribed in by-laws. Thus, GST should not apply at the time of collection. The AAR bench pointed out that amounts towards sinking and repair funds are collected as per percentage fixed in the CHS’s by-laws and in accordance with circulars issued by the Registrar of Co-operatives. If a sum is a deposit, it can be refunded. However, such funds are not refundable to members. Thus, GST would be triggered on collection and not in the future when it is utilised (say, for painting the building). Likewise, it held that education and election funds are also not a deposit and GST applies at the time of collection. This CHS was suppling water received from the Mumbai municipal corporation through an elaborate storage and pumping system. Further, it had a sewage treatment plant which supplied recycled water to all flats for use in toilet flushing. The AAR bench held that the notification 2/2017 which provides for a nil GST rate pertains to goods supplied and not services supplied. Mahindra Splendour is providing a ‘service of supplying water’ –members are not charged based on the quantity of water supplied. Thus, the notification is not applicable and water supply charges are subject to GST. In the absence of specific details, the AAR bench did not give a categorical reply. However, it pointed out that major repairs involving large expenditure extend the useful life of an equipment – for eg: replacement of a motor in a lift. In accounting, such major repairs are capitalised as assets and depreciation (write-off) over a period of time is available. Input tax credit will not be available against expenses that are capitalised, it explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-chs-if-maintenance-charges-exceed-rs-7500/month-gst-applies-on-entire-sum-in-mumbai-gst-bench/articleshow/88153655.cms||Lubna Kably

---||Delhi||Does religious panel need to check minor encroachments: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday pointed out lack of clarity on whether the religious committee headed by the lieutenant governor to recommend demolition of illegal religious structures is also required to examine encroachment issues of “minuscule nature”.The court’s remark came during the hearing of a plea seeking removal of an illegally constructed temple in front of a property in south Delhi’s Defence Colony. It pulled up the area station house officer and the beat constable for allowing the structure to come up overnight, while directing the police station concerned to depute a staffer for 24 hours at the site and furnish a report, including details of visitors, and listed the matter on December 16. The AAP government earlier submitted that the authorities planned to demolish the illegal structure on October 4, but it had now referred the matter to the religious committee, the high court noted. Since the religious committee has not given clearance for demolition till date, the Delhi government’s counsel said he was not in a position to state anything. The bench wondered if keeping idols inside a structure made by a few bricks overnight could be dubbed a temple, highlighting that idols were kept inside houses also. It said there was merit in the submission of the petitioner’s counsel that once the authorities had taken a stand that the structure would be removed, it couldn’t now take a different view of referring the matter to the religious committee. “I find there is no clarity as to whether the religious committee, purportedly constituted under the LG’s order, is required to deal with encroachment of such a minuscule nature,” the bench observed, seeking the relevant records on the next date. The court had earlier pulled up the Delhi government for not fulfilling its first stand and referring the issue to the religious committee, saying this would lead to chaos and more encroachment. The plea said that during Covid-19, somebody had trespassed and illegally constructed the temple on public land, a footpath, at Bhishma Pitamah Marg, right in front of the petitioner’s property.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/does-religious-panel-need-to-check-minor-encroachments-hc/articleshow/88153256.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The airport authority has been alerted by us. We have sent them a letter along with the name, age, address and photograph of the accused professor to stop him from escaping abroad,” said DCP Murti. After the incident was reported on Friday, the last location of accused Sushil, who left a note saying he was committing suicide after killing his wife and children, was found near Sarsaiya Ghat. Five teams constituted by DCP West launched search and raided his possible hideouts in vain. “All police stations along the Ganga from Kanpur to Fatehpur have been alerted and photographs of the accused have been shared with them. A police team headed by ADCP West Brijesh Srivastava gathered information about Sushil from Prof Pranjal Pankaj, his colleague at Rama Medical College. No passport was found in the house during searches and so we informed AAI,” the official added. “Police teams questioned the maid, inquired about his behaviour from the guards and scanned the bank accounts of his wife Chandraprabha. Two accounts have been found, but there have been no transactions in them after the incident,” the official added. Meanwhile, Rama Medical College administration has suspended Sushil Kumar and ordered a departmental inquiry against him, said an administrative official. “A special meeting of management and principal was held on Monday and the decision was taken to suspend Sushil. Orders for departmental inquiry have been issued after which he may be sacked as per rules,” he added. Sushil was appointed in Rama Medical College as associate professor eight years ago and was later promoted to the post of professor and head of department. In 2019, he was made principal and had contracted Covid during the second wave. The National Medical Commission (NMC) had questioned his research. Later, he was removed from the post of principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/cops-fail-to-trace-doc-alert-airport-authority/articleshow/88153246.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

However, considering the floating population of the city, the civic administration has appealed to those, who might have been left out, to get themselves vaccinated at PCMC vaccination centres free of cost. At present, 68.43% of the eligible population have got the second dose of the vaccine. “In accordance with the revised target sent by the state government for vaccination, we have covered more than 100% with the first dose through organizing camps and door to door drives besides being facilitated with over 29 centres. The target was to vaccinate 5.98 lakh eligible population and we have achieved the target. We will now focus on immunizing the second dose,” said PCMC Commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh. As of now, 6,00,904 people have been able to get the first dose.

---||Hyderabad||Chanchalguda's manhole issue fixed||Hyderabad: A blocked manhole and a dug up road in Chanchalguda was attended to within a week by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) after the issue was aired in these columns by a citizen reporter. A manhole on a stretch at Officers Colony in Chanchalguda was blocked due to which the sewerage water was continuously flowing on the road. Following an initial grievance aired by the citizen reporter on November 13, the GHMC authorities desilted the manhole. However, the on-ground staff failed to remove the debris which was dumped on the road side. “The concerned authorities desilted the manhole covering all the manholes existing on the road side but they left the filth on the road side causing hardships to the passersby. I request the concerned authorities to remove the filth from the road side immediately,” said Mubbesher Mehdi, the citizen reporter. The issue was yet again published on the citizen reporter app on November 29 following which the GHMC authorities cleared the debris. “It took almost 20 days for me to get the authorities attention to clear the manhole as well as the debris. Thanks to TOI, the issue was immediately attended by the concerned authorities after it was published in these columns. They came to the spot, promptly cleared the debris and ensured that the manhole did not overflow yet again,” said Mehdi, expressing happiness over the response. When TOI contacted G Rajnikanth Reddy, deputy commissioner of Malakpet circle in Charminar zone under which the Chanchalguda area falls, said – “It was a storm water drain which was overflowing. In Old City, storm water drains are very old and narrow resulting in frequent overflowing. However, we resolved the issue promptly after it was brought to our notice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chanchalgudas-manhole-issue-fixed/articleshow/88152556.cms||---
---||Pune||AAP seeks probe into PMC promotions||Pune: The Aam Aadmi party (AAP) has demanded an inquiry into promotion of engineers in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) with engineering degrees that the party claimed as bogus. The party members held a press conference on Tuesday at the PMC. “Some of the engineers have furnished degrees from universities in states such as Assam, Rajasthan and various districts of Maharashtra. These institutions are not recognised by the All India Council for Tehnical Education (AICTE). The degrees are bogus, and hence their promotions should be cancelled,” said Abhijit More, spokesperson, AAP. The party has also demanded that a criminal offence be filed in this regard. According to party leaders, 18 people have received promotions as engineers. They include sanitary inspectors and other class two and class three staff members. They have shown that they have completed diploma and degrees in engineering. But they were also working with the civic body at the same time. “How can one person work and study at the same time at two different places? If they have received the degrees through distance learning, then they are not eligible for government posts. Even then, the positions have been allotted to these degree holders. Some of them are working in the mayor’s office, too,” said More.  PMC has refuted allegations, saying that due process was followed in the promotions. “The then promotion committee had taken opinion from the legal department before completing the process. We will see if there was any lacuna or violation in the matter,” said Rajendra Muthe, a senior PMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/aap-seeks-probe-into-pmc-promotions/articleshow/88152558.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||30 ventilator beds await oxygen supply at Mohali civil hospital||MOHALI: With the fear of the third Covid wave looming large and Omicron predicted to hit the region in January, the medical preparations in Mohali are inadequate. The 30 ventilator-supported beds at civil hospital still await oxygen supply to start operation. Though the health authorities have set up Covid wards in Mohali, they are of no use till the ventilators are made functional. The Covid wards and the oxygen generation plants are operated and maintained by the management of Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Mohali. Director-principal of the medical college Dr Bhavneet Bharti said, “We have four oxygen plants at the civil hospital. And only that plant which supplies oxygen to 30 ventilator beds is still to start operation, the other three are functional. This plant will soon start as some modalities are being worked out.” The upgrade of Covid care centre at the civil hospital has also been delayed due to some unknown reasons. Dr Bhavneet Bharti said one pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plant each has been made functional at Dhakoli and Derabassi civil hospitals. Recently, a dedicated oxygen concentrator bank was established in Mohali. Additional deputy commissioner (ADC) Komal Mittal said extending helping hand towards Covid patients, the Red Cross Society has come forward to provide oxygen concentrators free of cost with a dedicated oxygen concentrator bank at district level. Mittal said the concentrators were being provided by the Red Cross on return basis for 15 days free of cost. Rs 5,000 will be charged for this service, but it will be refunded. Patient’s attendant has to submit a self-declaration along with the prescription of the doctor that clearly mentions the need for the concentrator. The district health department claimed that four pressure swing adsorption oxygen plants have been set up at various government hospitals in anticipation of the possible third wave. The department has ensured that there will be no shortage of oxygen. District immunisation officer Dr Vikrant Nagra said one oxygen plant was set up each at the Derabassi civil hospital and Dhakoli, and the remaining two at the Mohali civil hospital. He said, “Arrangements have been made to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen if the third wave strikes.” After facing acute shortage of oxygen during the second wave, the Mohali administration had set up the PSAs to meet any emergency situation in future. The plants will generate around 2,000 litres per minute of oxygen. One PSA plant of 100 litres per minute capacity will also be made functional at Kharar civil hospital soon, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/30-ventilator-beds-await-o2-supply-at-mohali-civil-hospital/articleshow/88152559.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

There has been a steep rise in Covid cases recently, forcing civic officials to check party plots, community halls and clubs on S G Highway to ensure that guests and hosts at weddings and family get-togethers are following Covid safety protocols. AMC officials had to issue warnings at two places after spotting guests without masks and violating safe distancing rules.  “We have also informed the local police that in case an NRG or anyone who is supposed to be in quarantine for seven days is found attending a function then s/he should be booked under the epidemic diseases act,” added the AMC official. A senior civic health official revealed that there were 108 active cases in the city, of which 67 were reported from the western part. Each of the AMC health flying squads have been handed a list of quarantined individuals, most of whom are in the west especially Jodhpur, Thaltej and Bodakdev, officials said. At a few locations, the AMC also installed a vaccination camp to ensure that guests take their second dose. “Nearly 80% of 25 new Covid cases registered in the city on Tuesday were from south-west, north-west and west zones,” said the AMC official. He added, “We are also taking this opportunity to vaccinate those who did not bother to take their second vaccine dose.” Municipal health official claimed they visited party plots in Bodakdev, Jodhpur, Thaltej, SG Highway and on Sindhu Bhavan Road twice since Monday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-cases-rise-in-west-abad-amc-checks-party-plots-clubs/articleshow/88152560.cms||---
---||Delhi||Write answers in cap letters on OMR sheet, says CBSE||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has asked the schools to ensure that candidates henceforth write their answers on OMR sheet in capital letters. Till the exam on Monday, students were using small alphabets to mark their responses. The decision has been taken because evaluators, in some cases, found differentiating between small letters tough and time-consuming. A circular addressed to the principals stated, “Earlier, it was intimated that candidates will write in small alphabets for marking the correct response in the box given in the OMR sheet. But it has been observed that sometimes during evaluation, evaluators are not able to clearly differentiate between small letters. This is taking more time for the evaluators. It is therefore directed that examination to be conducted from December 7 till the end, in the OMR options will be marked by the candidates in capital A, B, C and D for the correct response.” Centre superintendents have been directed to disseminate the above information as soon as possible. Assistant superintendents will announce instructions that new responses must be given in capital A, B, C and D. “Invigilators will check during invigilation that all candidates are giving responses in capital. If not, it should be corrected. Observer will also check that responses are given by candidates in capital during the conduct of his making rounds of the examination centre and also observe the same during evaluation,” added the circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/write-answers-in-cap-letters-on-omr-sheet-says-cbse/articleshow/88153278.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Omicron Not Fatal, But Covid Protocol Still Must||Vaccination certificate will become very important in the future. You may need to carry it to enter malls, cinema halls, hotels etc Q. How dangerous is this Omicron variant and what precautions should one take to keep safe and not contract it? – Manav Parikh A. As per the evidence and clinical studies so far, especially from SA (the epicentre of this Omicron), the variant is not dangerous, does not require hospitalisation and does not cause death. Completing the vaccination process, wearing masks, hand sanitisation, social distancing, avoiding crowded places, will give maximum protection from infection/its complications/need for hospitalisation and certainly from death. Q. What are the symptoms of Omicron? Can it cause severe illness and will existing treatments work? -- Shreshtha Raghuwanshi A. It usually leads to severe body pains, headache, and weakness. The usual symptoms of Covid-19 (loss of smell/taste, respiratory symptoms, breathlessness etc) are not observed. However, it may take a further three to four weeks for it to fully evolve and for us to know much more. Omicron as of now is not causing serious symptoms/disease. The existing treatment protocols for Covid-19 are to be followed and will be effective. Symptomatic, supportive treatment, isolation at home is enough. Q. If one does get infected with this variant, what are the general drugs available in the market that one can use to treat it immediately? – Katuru Durga Prasad Rao A. It is advisable to get tested for Covid-19, get it confirmed by a doctor and then go for treatment, which varies for non-Covid/Covid/other respiratory disease. It is not advisable to use any medicine without a doctor's prescription/supervision. However, it is assured that all required medicines are abundantly available. Q. Should we continue following Covid-19 appropriate protocol like wearing masks\using sanitisers\checking temperatures? Should we again start avoiding crowded places like theatres, malls etc? – Krithika L Rao A. Certainly yes. We need to take all these measures which help in preventing not only Covid/Omicron/ but other commonly communicable respiratory infections as well. Q. How vulnerable are completely vaccinated people to this infection? – Rakesh Kumar A. Omicron as of now is being detected among the vaccinated population too. But the vaccine prevents it from becoming serious, the need for hospitalisation and death. Q. Is the variant more likely to cause serious infection among those who have taken only one dose? – Dhanya Raj A. There is no such evidence so far. However, those who took a single dose and are due for the second dose I suggest they finish the schedule. Q. What are the chances of reinfection among the Covid-19 recovered patients? – Parimala G Tadas A. There are no studies available yet to ascertain this. But it will be a mild disease for people who have been infected earlier. Q. Is the virus also dangerous for school going children between 10 and 17 years of age? Is it safe to send them to school? – Akash Singh A. Though Covid-19 infections have been observed among school going children so far, they have mostly been mild and not life threatening. They have not required any hospitalisation. The same applies to Omicron as well – that is, if at all it occurs among children. It is safe and needed too for children to be sent to school so as to prevent certain other physical/psychological effects observed due to prolonged home stays with online classes. Q. I am a retired person running a small tuition class. As there were growing concerns about the efficacy of the vaccine, I have stayed away from it. But now, with the new variant, I am a little worried. What should I do? -- Joseph Moolayil A. You certainly should take the vaccine since you are certainly susceptible to Covid-19/Omicron infection and its complications, which may be life threatening even if you do not have any pre-existing illnesses, taking your age into consideration. Q. Though we still do not have any Omicron cases in Hyderabad, what measures are being taken by the government to ensure it doesn’t make its way into the state? Also, does this variant spread much faster? – Geetali Banerjee A. As of now, screening of all flyers (especially international), ensuring testing/tracing, enforcing quarantine etc are being taken up by the government. It is up to individuals and community also to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour personally and within their society, to keep the disease at bay. And yes, it does spread much faster than other variants. But thankfully, it is only a mild disease. Q. With the new variant looming large, why is booster dose not being given to people who are ready to take it? At least senior citizens and others with comorbidities can take it, right? – G S Narayana A. Yes, the possibility of a booster dose is being debated and discussed by experts and will be given shortly, based on their recommendations. However, those who took only one dose should receive the due second dose without fail. Q. What's your advice to pregnant women/lactating mothers on Covid-19 vaccination? – Nikhita Menon A. It’s highly recommended for them to take the vaccine since it will protect the mother directly and the baby indirectly (by transferring antibodies) Q. Any special/priority group for vaccination? – Karthik V A. All persons above 18 are eligible. However, senior citizens with comorbidities (DM, hypertension, cancer, respiratory/heart/kidney/liver diseases) should receive Covid-19 vaccine compulsorily. Q. How about vaccination for children? – Neetu Singh A. As per the available information it is going to start in a phased manner all across the country in 2022. Children from 12 to 18 years of age, especially with comorbidities will be given vaccines on priority basis. In the case of children younger than that, data/studies suggest that they have good immunity and Covid-19 is unlikely to become a serious/life threatening issue among them, even if they are infected. Q. How important is the vaccine certificate? – Ramesh Rao A. It is going to be as important as an ID proof we carry for all practical purposes. But, different from a regular ID, you may need to carry it to enter malls, cinema halls, hotels etc in the future. At present, it is mandatory for air travel to all international and some domestic destinations. Q. Any further advice for common people to stay safe? – S S Sekhar A. People should avoid crowded places up to Sankranti. Travel only if compulsory. Make Covid-19 appropriate behaviour a part of your routine life. Senior citizens, especially with comorbidities, young children and pregnant women to be more cautious. Do not panic, do not believe in rumours, irresponsible social platforms, check with reliable health authorities for facts and latest updates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-not-fatal-but-covid-protocol-still-must/articleshow/88152571.cms||---

The state government has asked local administrations to trace those with foreign travel history in the wake of the new Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The authorities have put these 13 travellers under the “untraceable” category. Dr Megha Jogdand, health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said a total of 114 international travellers have arrived in Aurangabad since December 1, of which 99 have tested negative for Covid-19. “A total of four international travellers could not be reached as their mobile numbers are not accessible. Besides, nine others were contacted but they told us that they were outstation. We could not confirm whether these 13 individuals have undergone testing and the outcome,”she said, adding that efforts were on to locate them. Jogdand said international travellers also include two children, who were yet to be tested for Covid- 19. “The families of these children agreed for Covid testing of the duo tomorrow ( Wednesday),” she said. Earlier, a student from South Africa, who had returned to Aurangabad, has tested negative for omicron variant on December 3. In rural parts of Aurangabad district, a total 15 international travellers have been reported, of which 10 have been tested negative for Covid-19 while one could not be traced, shows official data. Aurangabad district health officer Dr Sudhakar Shelke said four more international travellers had arrived on Tuesday and were tested as per the procedure. “We have already registered a police case in connection with the one missing international traveller. Foreign returnees should not compel us to take such action and undergo necessary screening,” he said. Aurangabad district administration has already appealed to all international travellers to undergo Covid testing upon their arrival from foreign countries and share correct contact details. Violation of any procedure will invite stern action, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-health-teams-look-for-13-foreign-returnees/articleshow/88153269.cms||Prasad Joshi

Her photos might have gone viral, being shared on various social media platforms, but Papiya Kar (36) firmly pointed out that she did not care for publicity, her only aim being serving the helpless. Kar told TOI she had regularly been serving food to the homeless for more than 13 years. On Friday, she had gone to the station straight from her brother’s wedding with food for the elderly and sick, whom she had invited to the function. “I had invited the people living at Ranaghat station for the wedding but only a handful of them turned up, while the rest stayed away. So, I took the food to them at night. I was not even aware that someone had photographed me and I didn’t want this publicity. But now that people know what I do, I would like everyone to come forward and feed others if possible,” said Kar, who herself also had her dinner with the homeless at the station on Friday night. People have especially been intrigued by the fact that Kar did not seem to care about the expensive clothes she was wearing as she sat on the ground at the station, distributing food. “I didn’t get time to change. It was already past midnight and I knew I had to rush from the reception to the station, 2 km away so that those people could have their food,” she added. Those who know Kar did not find anything unusual about the act as they are used to seeing her serving food to destitute people as well as taking care of stray dogs and cats around Ranaghat town for several years. “Since July this year, we started ‘Annapurnar Saraighar’, under which I feed 100 people every day. My father has a small shop near Ranaghat station and every day, I serve food from there to the homeless,” said Kar. Six days a week, she travels in a toto, distributing cooked food. It’s an exception on Sundays, when she goes to Esplanade in Kolkata to provide free tuition to street kids and vocational training to their parents. “Back in 2008, a sick woman at Ranaghat station had sought food from me but I didn’t have anything and was also in a hurry. So I had given her Rs 10 and left. The next morning, when I had gone back with cooked food, she had died. That day, I vowed to feed as many as possible and try to ensure that none goes to sleep on an empty stomach,” said Kar. One of her biggest supporters is her businessman husband, who funds most of her work.

India’s footballer of the year made a much-acclaimed move to Croatia in August, but has not yet made his debut. Questions have been asked why Jhingan has been sidelined for so long and the defender has now cleared the air. “I really wanted to show my qualities and kept pushing when my body was not ready,” Jhingan told TOI on Wednesday. “I understand the Indian football fans, and those in Croatia, want to see me play. I love that feeling. I trust myself, and know what I am capable of when fully fit.” Jhingan, 28, is now in India to meet his physiotherapist Gigy George and start the recovery process. It’s a calf injury that has reoccurred four times in the last three months. Everytime coach Mario Rosas told the India defender that it was time for his HNK Sibenik debut and gave him a feel of the match, from the bench, he picked up an injury in the days leading to the game. “I made the (substitutes) bench for the first time against Slaven Belupo (on October 22). The coach had clearly told me this was to get a feel of the game. I was to play the next one (a Cup clash, against the same opponents four days later). At that time, I was 70-80 percent fit and getting better. “Two days before the game when we were training, I again pulled my calf. It was heartbreak. I was trying to get fit, but my body was struggling,” said Jhingan, who will return to Croatia once he’s back to full fitness, expected next month. Jhingan spent the 2019-20 season on the sidelines, recovering from an ACL injury. When he made a return to competitive football, he was outstanding, winning the AIFF Player-of-the-Year award. His consistent performances with the national team and ATK Mohun Bagan earned him a contract from Croatia, a first for any Indian footballer. It didn’t really start well for Jhingan when he landed in Sibenik after 36 hours of flight and road journey. “Whenever I travel, I always head to the gym first before sleeping off. In Croatia, I went for a run and felt tightness in my calf. I didn’t think much and just carried on. Forty-eight hours later at the first training session, I had a chat with the coach. He explained how he’ll use me in the team, what he wanted from me. It was very positive. I was really motivated. “At my second training session, I pulled my calf. Usually this injury takes about four to six weeks, but a lot of people got involved and the treatment went wrong from my side as well,” said Jhingan. Jhingan just didn’t know which path to follow for the recovery process. “The coach was keen to have me back, fighting for my place in the team. The owners were also encouraging. It was great to hear such words. I pushed too much, maybe over my limits. Every week, when I tried to push, I had one or two good days and then my calf gave up, again,” said Jhingan. When it happened for the fourth time, Jhingan, along with his representative Anuj Kichlu, decided it was time to return home. “The best way now to move forward is to first fix my body and then push. The injury is diagnosed and it’s healing. After two weeks, I’ll start jogging again. I am very hopeful of getting fit, going to Croatia and then proving my worth,” said Jhingan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sandesh-jhingan-back-home-to-treat-his-calf-injury-will-return-to-croatia-in-january/articleshow/88172890.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

A micro-environment has been created within, with a fresh air machine that pumps filtered air. Since this was set up at the New Friends Colony in south Delhi, the Air Quality Index inside the school has ranged between 100 and 150 when it has been way above 500 outside. The school has been trying to address the problem of air pollution since 2018. The fresh air machine and the dome are new additions to the earlier created 15000 sq ft play area in the basement where 28 ducts release filtered fresh air, keeping the AQI at a very safe10-15. Shefali Varma, director of the school, said, “The idea was to reimagine the school, evolve and not go backward complaining that we need open spaces for children to play in. This may not be practical. We cannot let our children go out six months of the year due to air pollution. The other two months are too hot outside. We fitted each room with air purifiers but it didn’t help much. So, we first created a safe play area and then worked at creating a dome with clean air.” With such a system in place, Varma is urging Delhi government to exempt the school from closure because “our children are more protected at school, than at home”. Class XI student Vardam Chitkar testified, “I have been coming to school, but haven’t needed a nebuliser to breathe properly. Earlier, I even used steroids to help me breathe easily. When the schools were closed due to pollution, staying at home became troublesome from my health’s point of view.” Close to 900 children are enrolled in the school from nursery to Class XII. The whole project cost the school around Rs 30 lakh and it was assisted by Jai Dhar Gupta of Nirvana Being. Dhar is also part of the pollution and Covid task force at the school. Explaining the technology, Dhar said, “Imagine life in space in a microenvironment — that is what we have done here. We have used an advanced filtration system and allow only oxygenated air on the school premises. This means there is reduced exposure of the children to air pollution.” The filtration system is placed on the terrace and the fresh air is channelled through large ducts to each floor of the building and the classrooms. According to Dhar the filters only require cleaning and there is no need to replace them. “The ventilation is managed in such a a way as to allow the air to be flushed out every hour. No child, therefore, sits in still air. This is science,” said Dhar. “The ambient carbon dioxide is 4,000 parts per million and our goal is to keep it at 800 parts per million. The technology uses Honeywell 14 rated filters. The dual layers of filters result in 85-90% reduction of pollutants.” Watch This Delhi school’s AQI never breaches 150 mark, here’s how||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/under-the-dome-how-this-school-is-filtering-bad-air-out/articleshow/88153283.cms||Shradha Chettri

The dismissal was on the recommendation of the college anti-ragging committee and the parents teachers association executive committee. The college principal AM Shihab had suspended K Mohammed Anzil and Janesh Babu for allegedly ragging a first-year BA computer science student P Ibsan, son of Imthihaz of Parakode, Edathanattukara, last Friday. The duo hit Ibsan on his face and head, resulting in injuries and subsequent admission in a hospital intensive care unit. On Ibsan’s complaint, the two final-year students were initially suspended and have now been dismissed from college, said the principal. A special team headed by Mannarkkad police sub-inspector P Ajithkumar, investigating the case, said that both the accused are absconding and their mobile phones are switched off.

I am doing fine and am able to continue with my office work daily from the quarantine centre. I have carried my laptop and I am working from here as per my routine,” he told TOI on Tuesday. The patient, a working professional, had arrived from Finland in the city and was fine for the first three days. When he came down with fever on the fourth day, his friend advised him to get tested. The patient said, “I had a travel history so I immediately decided to get the RT-PCR test and the result was positive. So I quarantined myself at home. My sample was sent for sequencing to spot the Omicron variant. When it was clear that I had the variant, I was moved to institutional quarantine.” All his contacts from the day of his arrival, including the cab driver, his family and relatives and colleagues he met, underwent the RT-PCR test as per the protocol. “At least 25-30 of my contacts have undergone the test and thankfully none of them have tested positive. There is nothing to worry about, but there is hype around this variant. People should not ignore it but take immediate steps when they experience the symptoms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-variant-patient-from-city-on-vitamins-continues-to-work-from-quarantine-facility/articleshow/88152579.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fifty years on, 1971 war hero’s kin converge on road named after him||Pele wasn't the only 'Black Pearl' of his time. The nickname also belonged to a dusky Tamil Gorkha Regiment commander, just a few months younger than the Brazilian football legend, whose name has adorned a 14,000-foot-high post at Kargil and a sea-hemmed road at Colaba for nearly 50 years.  Navy Nagar's Major Vetri Nathan VrC Marg, formerly Pilot Bunder Road, turned into a memory lane on Tuesday afternoon for five silver-haired siblings of the Param Vir Chakra awardee after whom it was rechristened in 1972. As they parted with reminiscences on the golden anniversary of the martyrdom of Major Vetri Nathan, who died during the 1971 Indo-Pak war at Kargil, biopic-worthy scenes emerged.  Exactly half a century ago on December 7, 1971, the second battalion of the 11th Gorkha Regiment, commanded by Major Vetri Nathan, was given the task of capturing a hill feature on the Srinagar-Leh highway called Point 13620. While the Indian forces had captured this Pakistan-controlled post on the Line of Control during the 1965 war, it was returned as part of the Tashkent Agreement signed on January 10, 1966.  Having conquered a point called 'Black Rocks' along the way, as Major Vetri Nathan's brigade marched towards its target, Pakistan's medium machine gun (MMG) post on the summit opened fire. "In spite of his bullet injuries, he led the company into the attack before he succumbed," said Vetri Nathan's niece, Sukhnandan Vohra, adding that the troops then went on to capture the post which was named as 'Vetri Post' in honour of the thirty-year-old soldier who was cremated near the battleground.  Born on February 2, 1941 to a strict judge-advocate of the Indian Navy named N K Nathan, "Vetri", the second of seven kids, grew up with a prankster's aura in Delhi's Lodhi Garden before the family moved to Mumbai in the 1950s. The boy, who studied at St Xavier's High School and later at Jai Hind College, would tease his elder sister, Kala, for mispronouncing words, clown behind his mother's back and coolly shove all his belongings under a counter pane during his father's surprise room inspections, recalled his younger sister Rayvathi Subramaniam, whose Chennai home is called 'Kargil' in the memory of the brother she last met in 1965.  "We were all sea cadets. He wanted to join the Merchant navy. He even trained to join Dufferin training ship but that dream couldn’t come true due to some lacuna. He felt devastated," said Subramaniam about Vetri Nathan who later joined Dehradun's Indian Military Academy at age 19 and was soon commissioned into the famed 11 Gorkha Rifles Regiment, known for its valiant soldiers and numerous battle exploits. When the second battalion of the regiment was inducted into Mizoram to quell the Mizo uprising in the 1960s, Major Vetri led many counter-insurgency operations and had a heavy price on his head.  The light-skinned Nepalese soldiers in his Company, the men he fondly called 'johnnies', would lovingly refer to their Tamil commander as 'Black Pearl' owing to his dark complexion, recalled Subramaniam. "Once, he spent a full period of his annual leave trekking in Nepal visiting all his johnnies' families," said youngest Mumbai-based brother Janak, who remembered his brother telling him before a precarious search-and-hunt mission in Mizo Hills: "There is a bullet with my name on it. Till that hits me, why should I care?"  Seared into the bones of Major Vetri's Delhi-based brother, Dev, is an incident during a calamity in Bihar. "Vetri told me he had to threaten an upper-caste doctor who was refusing to treat a Dalit patient. At the point of a rifle, the doctor then treated the Dalit," said Dev.  On the eve of the Kargil battle, it's believed that a discussion on whether the army should wait to return from the battle to make the cheques for mess charges, had taken place. "Vetri is said to have held that the possibility of not returning is all the more reason to write out the cheques as one should not go with a debt," said Janak. "He did not return from the battle."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fifty-years-on-1971-war-heros-kin-converge-on-road-named-after-him/articleshow/88153678.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

With no socialising and zero physical contact, I experienced an anxiety within me which was creating more and more unrest by each passing day. Major time was invested in home schooling and managing household chores, leaving very little time for self-development or recreation. Lack of recreational activity made me feel irritated and a prolonged phase resulted in frustration. But as it is said that the solution is always in front of you, you just need to identify and choose the right one. One day while teaching my son Sanskrit, I realised that I am struggling a lot to understand the language though I had chosen Sanskrit as my second language during school days. It brought a mixed feeling-- a feeling of embarrassment and a feeling of excitement to relearn the language. Sanskrit is one of the oldest and meticulously scripted languages. I realised that I have learnt many slokas and mantras in Sanskrit since childhood with a very preliminary understanding of the same. With no delay, I decided to learn Sanskrit with my son. We helped each other and we enjoyed the process. I developed basic understanding of the language through books and to gain deeper understanding we took the help of educational videos available on the internet. It was overwhelming to discover the ocean of material available. I also used language apps which helped polish my language skills. Now while reading Bhagavad Gita, I feel a connection and feel satisfied knowing the verses written in one of the most well scripted languages -- Sanskrit. I shall keep learning and venturing into learning more languages in future.

He is well-known for his direction of dramas, which he has been doing for the past 25 years at annual jatras of villages in the region. He has been unable to arrange money for his daughter’s wedding as plays are not being staged following Covid-19 pandemic. Seeing his plight, the villagers organised a drama at their expense. Though admission to the drama was free, they encouraged the audience to donate as per their financial means. They had invited businessmen, politicians, and other celebrities to watch the play and donate money. They intend to conduct the wedding from the amount raised through the play. The drama, ‘Maiduna Tandha Mangalya’, written by Basavakumar B Savadatti, was staged at Vadaganal village at 10.30pm on Tuesday. ‘Our village’s pride’ RG Tommanagouda, gram panchayat member, Vadaganal, told TOI, “Because the entire state has been experiencing uncertainty for about two years, we can’t predict sequences like lockdown. Hence, we intend to set aside money for his daughter’s wedding. Beyond performing in dramas, he has been singing devotional songs at temples to serve the community during religious ceremonies. He was invited to perform in many villages throughout Koppal, Gadag, Ballari, and other districts. He is the pride of the entire village.” One of the drama’s organisers, Devendragouda Jirli, said a publicity campaign was launched for a month online and offline. “We used to have over 5,000 people as audience when we used to organise dramas with tickets. People sat in open areas with social distance, while we ensured Covid-19 norms were met,” he said. When asked about the expenses of organising the drama, he stated that 12 youths who are performing in the drama have each contributed Rs 3,000, while many villagers have generously contributed to meet the Rs 1 lakh requirement. Hugar sid he has no agricultural land and that music is his life. “Ratnamma, my wife, is a daily wage worker. We have three children, as well as an elderly mother. Despite our poverty, we have never had difficulty living a normal life because the villagers are generous and have a high regard for artistes like me. They arranged the budget and presented the instrument to me when I was unable to purchase a musical instrument. They have now decided to assist me by resuming the drama. Their generosity has left me speechless,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/villagers-hold-drama-raise-funds-for-musicians-daughters-wedding/articleshow/88151294.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Pune||Keep vigil; Omicron sporadic & travel-related, say experts||PUNE: Public health experts and the state Covid task force members on Tuesday claimed that the Omicron cases in the state as well as the country were currently sporadic and there was no community transmission yet. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force, told TOI, “The Omicron variant cases in India are sporadic and travel-related. The cases detected are mild, and most of the patients are asymptomatic and under observation. As of now, cases have not been found in any major clusters and there is definitely no community transmission, as had been reported in South Africa or even the UK.” He said they (the task force members) did not see the state implementing any “lockdown” because the cases were too few now. The state till Monday evening had reported 10 Omicorn variant cases — seven from Pune and three from Mumbai. Besides, cases were reported from Karnataka, Gujarat and Delhi. With the country stepping up vigil to track international passengers, Dr Joshi said there was a need for citizens with travel history to make voluntary disclosure. If any of them tested positive, the government authorities could follow it up with genome sequencing, the expert said. “The Delta variant is phasing out, but there is no clue if it would be displaced by Omicron in. Anyway, the number of cases is too small,” he said, iterating that there was no need to panic. He said the residents should behave responsibly, follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and go for double-masking. Besides, the pace of vaccination should be increased, he said.The data currently shows that maximum Covid cases reported now are still of Delta variant. Irrespective of the variant, Dr Joshi said, the current strategy for the state should be to ensure zero Covid deaths, no severe disease and contain cases if there was a spurt in some cluster. “According to early trends, the Omicron variant may not be as severe as Delta because this has come about when a good percentage of population has been vaccinated. The outcome will only be known in two to three months. Currently, the signals are it is a mild disease and we need to follow the public health protocols correctly,” said the expert. Dr Sanjay Oak, the chairman of state task force, said masking and following Covid-appropriate behaviour were the way forward for the state, along with increased vaccination. “As of now, there is no need to panic even if cases are detected. The administration should keep a strict watch on any sudden spike, he said. Dr Oak said the state had requested the Centre to allow administration of booster dose to immunocompromised people and commence paediatric vaccination soon. Another task force member, Dr Rahul Pandit, told TOI that he did not see the third wave coming immediately and that people should only need to be cautious. “The public health response has been good in tracing the travellers, testing and carrying out genomic sequencing,” he said, adding that masking and quickly finishing vaccination were the way forward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/keep-vigil-omicron-sporadic-travel-related-say-experts/articleshow/88152583.cms||Nisha Nambiar

These two are among the five named in the FIR filed against 16. “It has come to our notice that two accused named in the FIR -- Mohd Asad and Mohd Haris -- left for the UAE a day before the attack to avoid any suspicion. There are chances others have also left. We have issued a lookout notice against four at the moment,” said SSP Bulandshahr Santosh Kumar Singh. Four of the accused are nephews of Mohammad Yunus, who was the main target in Sunday's shooting attack in which four were injured and one died. Yunus escaped unhurt. Later, he filed an FIR and his security was heightened. Notably, the genesis of the Sunday shootout goes back to the alleged murder of political heavyweight and two-time MLA from BSP, Aleem, in 2018. Aleem was the brother of Yunus. Soon after the death of Aleem, a bitter rivalry between Yunus and Aleem's immediately family came out in the open so much so that both groups accused each other of Aleem's murder. At present, Aleem’s son, Mohd Anas Aleem, is lodged in jail for the murder of his father. Now, another son, Asad, who has been named in the attack on Yunus, is on the run. “There is an ongoing dispute over properties as well. For instance, a clash took place between Yunus’ supporters and Aleem's sons over the ownership of Aligarh-based meat factory,” said SSP Santosh Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bulandshahr-attack-case-2-accused-left-for-uae-lookout-notices-issued/articleshow/88151899.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Delhi||Delhi: ‘Casteist’ allegation vague, court discharges school vice-principal||NEW DELHI: A city court has discharged the vice-principal of a Delhi-based private school in a complaint alleging that she made casteist remarks against an employee of the school. Allegations levelled against her by the complainant are “too general, vague and omnibus,” it observed. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana said the complaint failed to specify the exact date, time, place and omitted to reveal the specifics of the alleged offence. “It merely makes a general allegation that for the past two years, the complainant has been harassed by the accused using caste-related words against her. It neither mentions the specific words which offended her nor she mentions that when and where the accused used these words and in whose presence, she was intentionally humiliated by the accused,” the court said in an order on December 6. It noted that even in the supplementary statement, which was recorded on February 6, 2019, after about two months of the initial complaint, the complainant simply mentioned that the alleged incidents took place in October 2018, and omitted to mention the specific date of the incident. The court further said that in order to invoke Section 3 (1) (r) (intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view) of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the complaint should bare minimum reveal that there was intentional insult or intimidation by a person, who is not a member of SC or ST community and the insult must be with an intent to humiliate the victim at a place within public view.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/casteist-allegation-vague-court-discharges-school-vice-principal/articleshow/88153288.cms||---

This came even as one of the girls gave a statement on the ordeal to the magistrate on Tuesday and police changed their stance from a day earlier when they said medical test of the girls was "unnecessary". ASP Krishna Kumar said, "One of the girls has already given her statement before the magistrate. "The statement of the other girls will be recorded on Wednesday. We will also conduct a medical examination," Kumar added. Two men, the owner of a school and the principal of another, had hatched a plan to have the girls stay over at the institution for "practical exams". In the evening, the duo then allegedly spiked the food of the girls with drugs and molested them. Though the incident happened 17 days ago, it took the parents of some over a fortnight to get the FIR lodged, that too after a local MLA intervened. Back in the village, some of the Thakurs TOI spoke to said that the Sainis want to besmirch the name of their community -- the school principal is a Thakur -- and the Sainis said pressure is being put on them to keep silent. Many of the girls are Sainis. The parents of some of the girls who reported the abuse have already sent them away -- to the houses of friends and family in other villages. An elderly Saini man said, "Look at the way they had to run around just to lodge a case. Shouldn't it have been done automatically? Had the MLA not spoken, the FIR may never have been filed. Who do you think is calling the shots here?" Two km away, the Thakurs were united. The brother of the school principal -- who has now been arrested -- said, "The case is baseless." The big house outside which a sedan was parked was crowded with people, all of them prepared to answer queries from reporters. "There is nothing to investigate," one of them said. "Some of the girls were at fault."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/abuse-of-17-girls-in-school-up-village-divided-along-caste-lines/articleshow/88151892.cms||Ishita Mishra

In comparison, those who got the second shot rose from 48% to 76% — recording 28% rise. In all, for every first shot administered, the state administered seven second shots during the period. “About 81% of those who have got the first shot have adhered to the schedule and have got the second shot,” said a senior state health department official. “State-wide campaign is on by various authorities including incentivizing the vaccination and calling up those who are due for their second shot. In some areas, door-to-door vaccination has also been initiated.” However, analysis of district-wise status reveal that Botad has the lowest compliance of first dose at 69% of eligible 5.62 lakh population, followed by Patan (74%) and Amreli (75%) – all three have less than 20% of state average. Likewise, Dang (46%) and Botad (60%) have 20% lesser second dose coverage than the state average. Among cities, Ahmedabad has reached 99% coverage of first dose whereas Bhavnagar, Gandhinagar, Junagadh, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara have recorded 100% coverage. Gandhinagar has highest coverage of second dose at 88% and Ahmedabad has lowest 66% coverage. All other cities have 75% to 85% coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/81-stayed-on-schedule-for-second-vax-shot-in-gujarat/articleshow/88152595.cms||Parth Shastri

The residents said the road was in terrible condition, making it difficult to navigate the area and vehicles would skid, leading to accidents. Autorickshaws, ambulances and other public transport vehicles also refused to go to the area because of the poor roads, they alleged. Residents gheraoed Tingre while he was on his way to inaugurate a project in Lohegaon, and demanded that the roads be repaired immediately.  “If we take autorickshaw to reach home, the drivers drop us at a distance and refuse to come to this area. We have to reach home walking, often with children and luggage,” said Nirmala Khese.  Band Raut, another resident of the area, said it is difficult in cases where elderly people fall sick and need to be taken to the hospital. “Ambulances are also not able to navigate because of the huge potholes. The recent rainfall has only added to our woes and the potholes are now filled with rain water. Many two-wheeler riders have fallen and injured themselves,” said Raut.  When contacted, Tingre said the area was owned by two farmers and they were not ready give their land for road and repair work. “The area is still categorised as farm land and the development plan for this area has not been finalised. The two farmers are asking for compensation for their land,” said Tingre.  “With the development plan not being finalised, how will the civic body pay the compensation to these farmers? It is a tricky situation but we are trying to resolve it,” the MLA said. Tingre also said that talks are on with farmers carry out repairs of the pothole-ridden roads that were causing a lot of inconvenience to residents of the area. “After a lot of persuasion, the farmers agreed to let us fill the potholes with some debris to level the roads and make it motorable. The repair work will be done on December 10,” said the MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-gherao-mla-tingre-over-pothole-ridden-roads-in-lohegaon/articleshow/88152600.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Pune||90% health, frontline staff in Maharashtra totally vaccinated||PUNE: Complete vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers in Maharashtra against Covid still hovers around 90% despite the state striving to further speed up inoculation following the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the contagion. The state’s target was to vaccinate all adult beneficiaries with the first dose and those who had skipped the second shot by December 31. However, Maharashtra is yet to vaccinate 100% beneficiaries in the healthcare and frontline worker categories, with whom the inoculation programme had started. Maharashtra on Tuesday crossed the 120 million (12.02 crore)-Covid vaccine dose mark. Official records till December 5 (Sunday) revealed that 4.37 crore people have so far received both doses of the Covid vaccine. As many as 17 districts continued to lag in terms of vaccinating the health workers. In the frontline worker category, 19 districts were behind the state average. The lowest complete vaccination among health workers has been registered in Jalna (79.4%), followed by Aurangabad (82.5%) and Sindhudurg (82.9%). In the frontline worker category, the lowest vaccination has been registered in Gondia (79.6%), followed by Jalna (82.1%) and Osmanabad (83.1%). A senior government official attributed the trend to the possibility of many frontline workers taking their second dose in the general category. For the health workers, he said, there would be a district-wise assessment on the possible delay. “It’s been 10 months since the vaccination started. There is no other possible reason other than vaccine hesitancy. This needs to be assessed in all districts. All healthcare and frontline workers should have got their second doses by now,” the official said. A senior health official said, “There are definitely some issues with the data. We have been told that many frontline workers might have taken the vaccine in the general 18-44-year category. The data need to be assessed and the list drawn out to arrive at the final figures before the end of December.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/90-health-frontline-staff-in-maha-totally-vaxxed/articleshow/88152604.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s chief immunisation officer, Suryakant Devkar, said around 8 lakh residents had taken their first jab in September. After 12 to 16 weeks, they became eligible for the second dose (most of them in December), he said. “As we have received around one lakh doses from Bajaj group for the mega vaccination drive, it will prove useful to cater to the rush of the second dose beneficiaries at our 187 vaccination sites. Over the past few days, we are observing that the vaccination rate has gone up to around 35,000 to 40,000 doses per day, with most of the beneficiaries are opting for the second dose,” he said. Devkar said their stock under the CSR funds would exhaust by Thursday with the current vaccination drive, but more than one lakh doses had been promised by the Bajaj group. Apart from that, the doses are provided by the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-8-lakh-beneficiaries-eligible-for-second-dose-in-pmc-limits-in-dec/articleshow/88152598.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Now, see how faithful he remains to Hinduism,” said the patron of Jamiat Dawatul Muslemeen Ishaq Gora. Rizvi had courted controversy when his book ‘Mohammad’ criticised Islam. Gora, however, added, “There is no coercion in Islam. Besides, we have a democracy where everyone has the right to live his life according to his own belief. But, no one is allowed to criticise any religion, and thus, action should be taken against such people.” Ittihad Ulama-e-Hind national vice president Maulana Mufti Asad Qasmi said, “We do not consider him a Muslim, so we don’t have any objection if he adopts any religion." Shia Personal Law Board national general secretary Maulana Yasoob Abbas said, “Rizvi, alias, Jitendra Narayan Singh Tyagi, was already expelled from Islam for his objectionable activities. Everyone in the country has the freedom to follow a religion of his choice, but this freedom does not allow anyone to malign any religion or religious books.” BSP MP from Saharanpur Haji Fajlur Rahman, too, criticised Rizvi, saying: “He is only making an effort to shield himself from the ongoing CBI investigation into the corruption charged levelled against him during his tenure as Shia Waqf board chief.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/deoband-clerics-bsp-mp-criticise-wasim-rizvi/articleshow/88151916.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Delhi||Why There Is No Common Ground On Entrance Tests||New Delhi: The directive of the University Grants Commission (UGC) asking central universities to take “appropriate measures” for conducting the Common Entrance Test (CUCET) for admission in undergraduate and postgraduate courses from the next academic session has given rise to several concerns – from mushrooming of coaching centres to students from marginalised families missing out on opportunities. Others, however, see it as a step in the right direction and believe it will keep steep cutoffs in check. The computer-based test, which will be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in 13 languages, was envisaged in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. So far, only 12 universities in the country have been conducting admissions under CUCET and the ones in Delhi are yet to implement it. While Delhi University (DU) and Ambedkar University (AUD) take Class 12 marks into account, Jamia Millia Islamia and Indraprastha University conduct their own entrance tests. Several teachers and heads of institutions TOI spoke to sought wider consultations among stakeholders on CUCET and more clarity on how universities and colleges will be ranked once the merit list is prepared. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Lather said the university plans to implement CUCET but will have further discussions before taking a final call. “Once the entrance test is over, a merit list will be drawn and students can decide which institution they want to apply for depending on eligibility,” she added. At DU, some college heads said CUCET was a welcome move against the soaring cutoffs. According to Indraprastha College for Women principal Babli Moitra Saraf, “The admission process, as a whole, needs to be streamlined, given the sky-high nature of the marks that the boards award. It is unrealistic.” Pointing out that once a common entrance examination is rolled out, colleges will also be able to avoid ‘over admissions’, Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava said, “I am sure authorities will devise a mechanism of ranking the colleges and universities. My understanding is that the intake numbers will be known to us. For example, we might decide to call rank 1 to 40 and if seats are vacant, we go to the next pool of students.” For Alok Kumar, who teaches commerce at Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC), the concept of CUCET works as “everyone will get a level playing field”. “A Bihar or Jharkhand board student would not get the kind of marks other board students would. Having said that, the exam should also give some kind of weightage to Class 12 marks. Several years of learning need to be considered and questions should be based on them in a multiple choice format,” said Kumar. However, a senior teacher at St. Stephen’s College felt a quiz cannot be the basis for evaluating merit. “Aptitude is more important and for this, wider consultations with all stakeholders are the key. It has to be a fair objective evaluation. The new system should not leave anyone out,” he said. However, Abha Dev Habib, who teaches Physics at Miranda House, described CUCET as “a filter that works against the disadvantaged section”. “Admission through CUCET will lead to additional stress and expenditure for students and parents. It is a business model and will see a massive rise in the coaching business. Recent reports on NEET show that entrance exams shift admissions into the pockets of the urban population. And there is also the possibility of paper leaks,” said Habib. A senior JNU professor, however, countered that coaching institutes exist even for the entrance exam at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) or other minor tests. “It is a separate business sector altogether. Even books for some entrance tests are sold to aspirants. With CUCET, even though this (coaching) industry might gain, its scale will not be of the same magnitude as that of the institutes for JEE and NEET,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-there-is-no-common-ground-on-entrance-tests/articleshow/88153321.cms||Shradha Chettri

The Union ministry for road transport and highways (MoRTH) had then set up a committee to inquire into the incident and found that the approved scaffolding design had not been adhered to and safety norms had been overlooked, which led to the accident. “The approved drawing was not complied with at site. There were lapses in erection of scaffolding framework and its loading. The committee observed that third parties engaged by the contractor, namely design team, proof check consultant, safety consultant, site engineers, plant manager have lapses on their part,” states the expert committee report to MoRTH. The incident occurred on March 13 and the ministry, taking serious note of the accident, formed an expert committee by March 28, 2019. After the expert committee submitted its report last year, MoRTH called a meeting of all the stakeholders in the new Zuari bridge project and the state PWD was asked for an explanation. While the PWD said that corrective measures have been taken and warning letters have been issued to the contractors, MoRTH issued a letter to the state department reminding it that the ultimate responsibility lies with the PWD. “Since you are the authority as per the provision of the contract agreement, you are hereby suggested to be more cautious and ensure the safety during design, construction and maintenance stage of the project,” special secretary Praveen Kumar told the state in the letter. The PWD had told the ministry that it had issued warning letters to the contractor, the design proof consultant, the safety consultant as well as the additional proof consultant, which is IIT Bombay. They were warned to be ‘extra vigilant as regards to the safety of the public during construction and take due care in design and construction of all temporary as well as permanent structures’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/safety-lapses-led-to-2019-zuari-bridge-accident/articleshow/88153718.cms||---

Shah had recently returned from a trip to Turkey and had been warned of legal action if he breached isolation rules. When his family informed the team that Shah had gone to get his car repaired, the team filed a complaint with the Vasna police against the businessman. Dr Hardik Mevada, medical officer deployed at Praveennagar-Vasna UHC, told police that Shah, a resident of Sadanand Society, had arrived from Turkey on December 2. As part of the protocol to prevent the spread of the new Omicron variant of Covid virus, Shah was instructed to isolate himself at home for 14 days. Shah was warned that he would face legal action if he violated rules. The AMC medical team made a surprise visit to Shah’s house around 8pm on December 4 and found that he was not at home. His family members informed them that he had gone out to repair his car. Shah returned around 8.15pm. As this was unacceptable, Mevada asked police to book Shah for disobeying the notification issued by a public servant under IPC as well as sections of disaster management act and epidemic act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quarantined-man-goes-out-in-car-booked/articleshow/88152613.cms||---

A Maruti Swift Dzire car, mobile phones and SIM cards were seized from them. The accused were identified as Yogesh Patel, a 22-year-old DJ from Madhya Pradesh, Pankaj from Aligarh and Jitender from Mathura. DCP Pramod Singh Kushwaha said they received a tip-off about a gunrunner coming to Sarai Kale Khan to deliver a consignment. A team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan mounted surveillance and tracked down the suspect. Patel was then nabbed with a dozen pistols of .32 bore. Patel came in contact with arms traffickers while playing music at a wedding function in 2019. He disclosed that he had delivered a consignment to criminals in September too. He purchased a pistol for around Rs 8,000 from the manufacturer and sold it for Rs 25,000-35,000 depending upon the customer’s profile. Police suspect he may have sold over 200 pistols, the details of which are being verified. Raids are being conducted to identify the receivers of arms and the manufacturers based in Damoh, Madhya Pradesh. In another operation by Special Cell’s northern range, two traffickers were arrested from Rohini when they arrived to deliver a consignment in their Dzire car. A team comprising inspector Krishan Kadian and others received a tip-off after which the accused, Pankaj and Jitender, were arrested with 15 pistols. DCP Rajiv Ranjan said Pankaj (20) participated in wrestling tournaments earlier. He then came in contact with an arms trafficker while sitting idle at home during the pandemic and joined him for easy money. He also roped in his driver, Jitender, to assist him in supplying the weapons. The duo drove to Khargone in MP and collected the consignment at a discounted rate. The weapons were then sold to budding criminals at high rates. Jitender was paid Rs 20,000 per consignment, apart from car rental, while Pankaj kept the profits. They are suspected to have supplied over 100 pistols till date. Police are scanning the mobile phones seized from the accused to identify other members of their network.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dj-wrestler-among-3-arrested-by-spl-cell-in-2-separate-arms-busts/articleshow/88153313.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 20 officials given BMC notice for delay in purchase of medicines||MUMBAI: The BMC has begun a probe into the delay in purchase of medicines and testing kits to tackle monsoon-related ailments. Around 20 officials of the central purchase department (CPD) have been issued show-cause notices after it emerged that the office of mayor Kishori Pednekar allegedly sat on the Rs 53-crore proposal for eight months and then the file reportedly went missing. Pednekar has maintained she does not have powers to clear proposals over Rs 75L. Alleging corruption, BJP MLA Mihir Kotecha, and corporators Prabhakar Shinde and Vinod Mishra had last week filed a complaint with ACB seeking a probe into the missing file. According to a proposal placed before the civic standing committee last week, the CPD had sent the proposal to the mayor for approval in September 2020. But the department stated that the proposal was not approved till May 2021. The CPD stated 18 reminders were sent to the mayor, to no avail. The CPD stated the mayor’s office informed it was sent to the deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) of CPD but it could not be located and so a duplicate proposal was created.  “The mayor doesn’t have powers to clear any proposal above Rs 75 lakh. I don’t know why this Rs 53-crore proposal was sent to me. My office had returned the proposal and sent letters to the department clarifying that it is not in the mayor’s powers. It seems that some officials have played mischief. I have asked for a high level enquiry into this. Officials responsible for this delay and those who have misled us must be suspended,” Pednekar said.  Additional municipal commissioner (health) Suresh Kakani had asked deputy municipal commissioners Sanjay Kurhade (public health) and Sanjog Kabre (special) to conduct an inquiry and submit a report in seven days. “The mayor’s office had replied to the CPD on July 2, 2021. Why was no cognizance taken of her letter and why was the file still sent to her? Where is the file now? These are the questions posed to the erring staffers. They must reply in three days,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-20-officials-given-civic-notice-for-delay-in-purchase-of-medicines/articleshow/88153698.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The test would be made available within two weeks at the airports in India and other places. The companies have been asked to scale up production amid Omicron concerns. The molecular-based technology used in this rapid test kit neither requires expensive machines like RTPCT, high-speed centrifuges nor a skilled workforce to conduct the test. “The test — RT-LAMP — has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. It takes only 30-40 minutes to churn out the result, which can be visually interpreted. Also, the test can be easily deployed at the airports, docks, railway stations and other entry points for the screening of patients for Covid-19 as it does not require sophisticated machinery and skilled workforce,” said a senior ICMR official. Newer platforms need to be technically less demanding, require minimum equipment, and reduce turnaround time for reporting results. This testing approach, along with measures such as masking, frequent handwashing and social distancing, might be enough to prevent and contain the spread of Omicron, experts said. “The colorimetric RT-LAMP fulfils all the criteria, hence it can be a gamechanger for diagnosis of Covid-19 amid current concerns over the new variant. RT-LAMP will not be able to differentiate between variants of SARS-CoV-2. But it can be used to increase the national testing capacity for Covid-19,” said another ICMR official. The RT-LAMP kit is validated by the National Institute of Biologicals, Noida. “The kit will be way cheaper than rapid RTPCR as it requires sophisticated and expensive PCR machines and high speed centrifuges,” a senior ICMR official said. As against the current rapid PCR test which costs Rs3,900 and takes an hour, the ICMR-NIV-developed test kit is likely to be costing not more than Rs3,000. ICMR-NIV Mumbai unit scientists Shyamsundar Nandi, Upendra Lambe, Sonali Sawant, Trupti Gohil, Jagadish Deshpande have developed the RT-LAMP Kit. The Chennai-based AcrannoLife Genomics is gearing up to make the rapid kit available at airports in major cities across the country. “We are in an advanced stage of discussions with a few key airports and plan to establish operations soon,” said the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer Agragesh Ramani. The company got the DCGI approval for manufacturing the RT-LAMP kit in October. “We can manufacture up to 10 lakh kits per month. However, awareness about this technology with key stakeholders is critical to ensure the benefits to millions of people in India,” Ramani said. Delhi-based Rapid Diagnostic Group of Companies could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-niv-rapid-test-can-cut-cost-turnaround-time/articleshow/88152607.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Ahmedabad||Engagement excuse for violating isolation||Ahmedabad: Since December 1, when quarantine curbs were imposed on those returning from the 11 Omicron-affected countries, municipal officials have been flabbergasted with the requests they receive from quarantined people. For instance, a special municipal team had to be deployed in Naroda where a young NRI who had arrived on Monday wanted to venture out on Tuesday to get engaged! “That was irresponsible behaviour in the quarantine period,” said a senior AMC official of the north zone. “Even before he arrived, the individual knew that curbs would be imposed. Yet he was adamant.” The official added: “We threatened to file a police case and had the event cancelled.” A middle-aged woman doctor cited her medical condition and requested the AMC to change her quarantine location. “In this exceptional case, we shifted her to the requested location in an ambulance. We made her wear a PPE kit during the transfer,” said a health official of the west zone. “These requests are granted only in special circumstances.” Civic officials said that requests from senior IAS officers from the secretariat cause much dread. A senior official of the west zone said that a “state guest” had an IAS officer recommend that an exception be made to travel to Vadodara. “What do you do in these cases? Should we allow the person to travel, wearing a PPE kit? Should we make an exception in case of state guests?” the official said. “The whole purpose of quarantine gets defeated. I get recommendations from ministers and MLAs as well.” Of the 250-odd people who had arrived in Ahmedabad till Tuesday from the restricted countries, close to 40% are here to attend weddings or engagement ceremonies, undergo inexpensive medical treatments, or visit families. Unlike earlier, when NRGs used to spend a month, most visitors are here for periods between 10 and 15 days and had planned trips months in advance. “Spending seven days in quarantine is a loss of holiday for many,” said a senior AMC official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/engagement-excuse-for-violating-isolation/articleshow/88152660.cms||---

They heard a petition filed in December 2018 by Hanuman Koliwada Macchimar Vikas Maryadit saying dumping of waste on mangroves is impacting fish breeding grounds. Its advocate Meenaz Kakalia said two metric tons of waste is dumped on mangroves daily.  Collector (Raigad) Mahendra Kalyankar, UMC chief officer and MPCB member-secretary were present. Kalyankar said he will visit the place and hold a meeting. “Enough of meetings in the last three years. Learn to act,” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges asked chief officer (CO) Santosh Mali about his 2018 statement that a plot is identified. He replied that following opposition by villagers, they could not inspect it. The CO sought time to give further details. “He has come all the way from Uran to say ‘after a week I will answer queries of the court’,” said Justice Kathawalla.  HC said the collector and CO have no answers. “Our blood boils. These people are not bothered. Why should we not come to the conclusion that your administration has failed? If a developer comes offering you crores of rupees, lands are available. When land is required for public purposes, you do not have any,” said Justice Kathawalla.  MPCB said it had directed UMC to pay compensation for not scientifically disposing of solid waste. “To burn mangroves? You are not a collection agency. They kept paying and you kept accepting. Are you not supposed to take it up with higher authorities? It is your duty to protect the environment,” said Justice Kathawalla.  HC said except for assuring “we’ll have a meeting”, agencies are not giving concrete answers. “They should all step down if they cannot perform. Unless you do that no one will work,” said Justice Kathawalla. HC directed AG to hold a meeting with Thackeray “to resolve the issue which the higher officials present before us have failed to resolve in the last more than 3 years”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-high-court-tells-minister-aaditya-to-resolve-uran-dump-yard-delay/articleshow/88153716.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Surat||Man gets death for rape, murder||SURAT: The 35-year-old man convicted for rape and murder of a two-year-old girl was sentenced to death by the special court for Protection of Children for Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act on Tuesday. The convict Guddu Yadav had committed the brutal crime in Pandesara area on November 4. On Monday, the local court had announced the judgment in the record time of 21 days of the chargesheet being filed. The court ordered compensation of Rs 20 lakh to the victim’s family.  The court of judge PS Kala had completed the hearing within five days and examined 42 witnesses. Police had filed a 264-page chargesheet on November 15, within seven days of Yadav’s arrest.  The minor was kidnapped, raped and murdered on November 4 and her body was found on November 7. Yadav was arrested the next day after his identity was ascertained based on scanning of footage from over 500 CCTVs.  Police got various important scientific testing like GAIT analysis, DNA profiling, viscera testing and CCTV footage analysis done in a short period. Police also carried out reconstruction of crime, test identification parade and recording statements of witnesses under CrPC section 164.  Over 200 cops had joined the investigation when the minor’s kidnapping was reported initially. “The prosecution argued that it is a rarest of rare case where the convict deserves capital punishment .It was a heinous crime and based on strong scientific evidence, the punishment was announced by the court. The judgment will prove a deterrent in preventing such crimes in future,” said Nayan Sukhadwala, district government pleader. “The judgment has been announced in a record time. Top courts, government and police are extremely concerned over such crimes. Our priority is to prevent such crimes but if these occur, our efforts will be to ensure that justice is done at the earliest,” said Ajay Tomar, city police commissioner. State’s junior home minister Harsh Sanghavi said this is the third case pertaining to rape in which the court delivered the verdict swiftly. “Chief minister Bhupendra Patel in today’s Cabinet meeting congratulated the entire police department for doing a fabulous job. I also thank the judiciary for the verdict. This is the third such case wherein justice has been delivered in such a quick time. It’s a historic moment not only in Gujarat, but probably in the country,” Sanghavi told reporters.

Police have booked an unidentified security man and a truck driver following a complaint lodged by the deputy general manager of the plant. The needle of suspicion points at the Ahmedabad-based security agency whose contract was terminated on November 20 as their work was not satisfactory. “The cylinders are suspected to have been stolen between August and October this year. The thefts came to light after discrepancies were found in audits done on July 31 and October 2,” a senior official from Kuvadva Road police station said. Earlier, the security agency RN Gupta was hired for a one-year term ending January 2, 2022. On November 20, IOC hired another Ahmedabad-based agency. The security agency is responsible for keeping a track of all LPG bottles coming and going out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/1487-lpg-cylinders-stolen-from-ioc-depot/articleshow/88151956.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Laxmi Road as ‘open street’ on December 11 raises questions||PUNE: The civic administration is organising an “open street mall” on a 500-metre stretch of Laxmi road on December 11, which is part of the Pune mayor’s initiative to encourage citizens to walk and observe the day as the city’s annual Pedestrian Day. But the initiative has raised questions from a section of society about its appropriateness especially with the Omicron variant making its way into the city. Many said Laxmi road and adjoining areas are always crowded during festival times, with people ignoring Covid norms. “Open street” holds the potential of similar crowding, they felt. However, Pranjali Deshpande, committee member, Non Motorised Transport, had a different view. “When maintaining social distance and wearing masks is very important with the new variant having emerged, people will have more space to follow the protocols without vehicles around,” she said. “As the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is trying to encourage fitness among citizens, we are putting more focus on initiatives and activities that will facilitate the same. Starting this year, the open street mall will be a trial to help us make it an annual event,” said Deshpande. The stretch from Nagarkar Talim chowk to Kunte chowk and then on to Umbrya Ganpati chowk will be shut for traffic on the day. Deshpande said, “Laxmi Road is chock-a-block with traffic during any festive season, which makes it a difficult experience for pedestrians. Shopping is more of a pedestrian experience anyway, where one can go from shop to shop on foot.” A garment store owner on the road said, “Contrary to the notion that there will be less sale with restricted traffic flow in the area, we are expecting sales to go up that day since customers can move along this usually busy street at ease and shop at leisure.” Rutuja Shinde, a regular shopper in the area, said, “Whenever we go to Laxmi Road, we have to park elsewhere and walk down as we can never get parking space. .” Dinkar Gojare, executive engineer of the PMC road department, said there is a tentative plan for three electric vehicles to ply from Deccan Gymkhana, SP College and the PMC building to the “open street”. “We have made a list of areas that need safer facilities to encourage walking among. On December 11, such facilities will be inaugurated at Gadital Chowk on Solapur Road, Datta Mandir Chowk in Viman Nagar, Athavale Chowk on Law College Road, Pen Chowk on Senapati Bapat Road, Karnataka School Chowk on Gulawani Maharaj Road, Sant Kabir Chowk on Nehru Road, and Khadi Machine Chowk in Kondhwa. Supplementary programmes will be arranged along Prabhat Road, Sarasbaug to Puram Chowk, Shastri Road and from Ambedkar Chowk to Alandi Road,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/laxmi-road-as-open-street-on-dec-11-raises-questions/articleshow/88152677.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Meerut||RLD, SP hold first joint rally, declare alliance for Uttar Pradesh polls||MEERUT: The Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) held their first joint rally at Meerut's Dabathwa village on Tuesday and announced from the dais that they have formed an alliance for the coming assembly elections. This is also the first time that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and RLD president Jayant Chaudhary have shared a stage in preparation for the upcoming state polls. Addressing a well-attended gathering, former UP CM Yadav said, “BJP’s sun will set in the west (western UP) forever. Farmers suffered a lot, and this time they have decided to shut the door to the BJP. Farmers wanted their voices heard but instead were crushed under a jeep.” It was not surprising that both the leaders chose to talk at length about farmers and their issues at the rally. The farmers' protests against the recently repealed farm laws had received huge support from this western belt of UP. A string of mahapanchayats organised by leaders of the agitation has seen thousands in attendance. Chaudhary promised to erect a memorial for farmers who died during the agitation on the Delhi border. "Farmers have fought a huge battle and, perhaps, for the first time forced Modi ji to bend. They have paid a huge price. More than 700 farmers were martyred," he said. The rally came on a day when PM Narendra Modi, while addressing a rally in Gorakhpur after inaugurating several development projects, said, “Red cap is a red alert for UP”. The red cap is worn by SP members as a symbol of allegiance to the party. Reacting to Modi's remarks, Yadav later tweeted: "Red alert for BJP is the rising inflation, plight of farmers, oppression of women and youths, Dalit girl’s death in Hathras, Lakhimpur violence in which farmers were mowed down by convoy of Union minister’s son, etc. Lal topi (red cap) will throw BJP out of power this time.” Several rounds of talks were earlier held between Chaudhary and Yadav for a possible alliance in west UP. Though the two leaders have announced a pre-poll alliance, they are yet to arrive at a seat-sharing agreement, revealed a source in RLD. “Preparations had been going on for weeks for today’s rally, and the presence of a large crowd is itself a message to BJP. The saffron party doesn't stand a chance in the coming election,” said Meerut district president of SP, Rajpal Singh, who presided over the rally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/rld-sp-hold-first-joint-rally-declare-alliance-for-up-polls/articleshow/88151958.cms||---
---||Pune||Treat Omicron positive patients' release just like severe Covid cases: Maharashtra govt to districts||PUNE: The Maharashtra public health department has directed districts to discharge Omicron-positive patients just like severe Covid cases are released in accordance with the current guidelines, a detailed Directorate of Health Services order has stated. The current guidelines state that a severe case can only be discharged after complete clinical recovery and a negative RT-PCR result on the 10th day. On the public health measures to be undertaken in the backdrop of Omicron emergence, every district and municipal corporation has been asked to revisit their line list of positive cases from November 1, 2021. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “This list should be searched for any positive case with history of international travel. Lab samples of such cases, which are with respective labs, should be referred for whole-genome sequencing as a part of routine surveillance.” Awate said the state is sharing with districts the line list of international travellers received from the Bureau of Immigration and downloaded from Air Suvidha App. Every district and civic body should track such cases and conduct RT-PCR tests. If found positive, such samples should be referred for Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS). “Positive cases will be admitted as per symptoms in three-tier Covid-treatment facilities and treated as per the prevalent protocol. If found negative, patients would have to undergo seven days of home quarantine and tested on the eighth day. If found positive, the samples will be sent for WGS, while the positive passengers will be sent to a dedicated Covid facility,” Awate said. A similar procedure will be followed post airport screening. Other measures include proactive search of cluster/break through infection/reinfection cases/uncommon symptom cases to be tested with RT-PCR, ILI/SARI survey in high-risk groups and reactivation of fever clinics to screen ILI/SARI cases from the community. All district administrations have also been asked to focus on ramping up testing capacity in the districts: Minimum 140 tests per million per day with proportion of RT-PCR: RAT being 70:30. Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We have been tracking all international travellers, the list of whom, has been provided by the airport authorities. Efforts are also being made to track those travellers, who are not in this list and are either from at-risk countries or other nations.” Deshmukh said those coming from at-risk countries are being tested with RT-PCR, while in case of travellers coming from countries not enlisted as “at risk”, 2% passengers in the international flight have to undergo RT-PCR test on arrival. He added that with the emergence of the new variant, daily tests in Pune district are likely to be increased by 50% in comparison to the current average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/treat-release-of-omicron-infected-patients-just-like-severe-covid-cases-state-to-dists/articleshow/88152669.cms||Neha Madaan

Police have arrested the man. On December 3, police received a phone call about the crime around 10.30pm. A police team that reached the spot found that a three-month-old baby lying injured on the ground. “The child's father, Ravi Rai, was also present in the house and was in an intoxicated condition. The baby was rushed to a hospital where the doctors declared him dead. As per medical reports, the child’s skull had been severely injured,” said a police officer. During investigation, the neighbours told police that the couple were newcomers in the area, having lived there for around a month. “They said that the husband and wife quarrelled almost every day. They also said that while the husband used to stay at home, his wife was employed in Azadpur mandi. The couple often fought over the man being unemployed and over their financial problems,” the officer added. Police found that on December 3, the pair was having another heated argument. “The child was also in the same room where they were fighting,” said the officer. “Then in a fit of rage, Ravi Rai apparently picked up the boy and smashed him into a wall. When the child collapsed, his mother rushed in and began screaming hysterically that her husband had killed their son. Based on her complaint, a case was registered and the man has been arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-smashes-head-of-infant-son-during-a-quarrel-with-wife/articleshow/88153334.cms||---

Instead of nakas, these officers will carry out checks at intersections. Though launched last weekend, all the 50 sergeants from the traffic guards hit the roads on Tuesday night, as the weather improved. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha said, “Sergeants have been told to be active on road even at night. The exact time for the anti-drinkdriving checks will be decided by the traffic control room.” Sources hinted the checks would be held between 1am and 4am to curb early-morning accidents, a majority of which are caused by drinkdriving. “Afer we stepped up measure, prosecuting even drunk riders of cyclists and horse carriages, 490 have been prosecuted from November 1 to Monday and licences of 129 suspended,” said an officer. A section in Lalbazar claimed the move was also to make sergeants accountable. “This will keep them awake,” claimed an ACP though officers at traffic guards denied they slept or rested at night. “Whether it is GPS-enabled patrolling or arranging for tea for truck drivers in the cold, we are always on the road,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/breathalyzer-tests-to-be-held-beyond-1-am/articleshow/88152681.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

There were several injury marks on his body that was found dumped into bushes outside Rithani village, said police. The family had lodged a missing complaint on Monday afternoon, while the body was recovered late in the night. Police sources said that the victim’s two friends — Shivam Kumar and Chitransh Singh — were questioned in this connection, but Chitransh told them that they parted ways on their way back home. Additional SP Vivek Yadav said, “We have sent the body for postmortem. A dog squad and a forensic team were pressed into service. We have found some vital clues and fingerprints. The investigation is on. We will soon crack the case.” Police said they were probing all possible angles — like whether the boy was murdered elsewhere and then his body was dumped into the bushes or any personal or family enmity. The murder was reported a day after the body of a 22-year-old unidentified woman was found packed in a trunk in the Kharkhoda region of the district.

No new works can be approved once the election code is enforced. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said he was aware of the councillors’ demand and would call a meeting shortly. Senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor and party district president Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “Regular meetings are required if we have to resolve public issues. There are many important issues like sewerage, water supply and even roads not only from one ward but from other wards. I had spoken to the mayor about this and he assured that the date of the meeting would be announced shortly.” He said he would talk to the mayor again and urge him to call the meeting as soon as possible. With elections around the corner, councillors want pressing issues addressed. BJP councillor Sunita Rani said, “The major issue around my ward is that of parking. There is very less space for parking and people keep taking it up. However, the area is thickly populated and there is hardly any space available.” She also raised concern about mushrooming of encroachments in various wards, including hers and said that this would be one of the issues to be taken up in the meeting. The timing of development works has also rankled some. Lok Insaaf Party councillor Swarandeep Singh Chahal said, “We are against this policy of MC officials to construct roads at the end of the year, when temperature is low because of the winter season. The MC could not complete construction of main roads so what will they do in internal areas? Also, roads constructed at low temperature will not survive for long.” He said they would raise the issue of corruption among officials in the house meeting. Mayor Balkar Sandhu assured, “We are going to call the house meeting very shortly and important resolutions will be approved.” The last MC house meeting took place on July 14 at Guru Nanak Dev Bhawan. Thereafter, no meeting could be scheduled. 11 house meetings since 2018 While the MC Act says that one house meeting should be held every month, in the past three years, during the tenure of mayor Balkar Sandhu, only 11 such meetings have been held. According to councillors, public issues cannot be addressed when meetings are not conducted regularly. Members of the ruling party attribute the erratic meetings to the pandemic and ensuing lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/councillors-pitch-for-house-meeting-before-code-of-conduct-is-enforced/articleshow/88151142.cms||---

---||Delhi||Court quotes Gita, American poets in trademark case||New Delhi: While deciding a trademark infringement suit filed by TTK Prestige Ltd, engaged in the business of manufacturing, marketing and sale of kitchen appliances, against an online retail platform, a court has quoted from the Bhagavad Gita to American poets. The suit has alleged that the online platform was selling its products under the trademark PRESTIGE and its logo without its consent. The court dismissed TTK’s claim of trademark infringement. While giving a summary judgement in the suit, district judge Man Mohan Sharma said it was the duty of the court to show an exit door to a litigation without following the entire ritual of trial, if the same could be done within four corners of the law. The court quoted a poem by American poet Shel Silverstein: “Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout Would not take the garbage out!... Poor Sarah met an awful fate, That I cannot now relate Because the hour is much too late. But children, remember Sarah Stout And always take the garbage out!” The provision of summary judgement gives a right to any party to a commercial dispute under Commercial Courts Act, 2015 to get a claim decided in its favour without going through the process of recording the oral evidence. It is an effective tool for deciding cases where it can be demonstrated that a trial is unnecessary. Undertaking the task of considering a case or a claim for a summary judgement is indeed a task that must evaluate a host of factors, the court said. It observed that the situation could be aptly described by referring to a verse of the Bhagvad Gita, which means logic for an action must be known, so also the logic for inaction, and that the logic for a prohibited action must also be known, therefore the practice of karma is profound. “The plaintiff has no real prospect of succeeding on this claim of inducement of breach of contract and there is no compelling reason for this claim to proceed to trial. Any oral evidence...would only be a superfluous exercise. No evidence, which is contrary to the pleadings, can be allowed to be adduced. Thus, contemplating that by some iota of evidence the tables may turn is nothing but wishful thinking without any legal basis,” it said. The judge then quoted from the poem “One Times One Is Eight”, written by American poet Ogden Nash. “Either old magic or new math Into our house has beat a path. How else could Einstein or Diogenes Explain an exploit of our progeny’s? While at the table with his ilk A child upsets a glass of milk. The glass held half a pint when filled, And half a gallon when it spilled.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-quotes-gita-american-poets-in-trademark-case/articleshow/88153353.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A video of the trees being hacked has gone viral on social media. “The vegetation is being cleared in broad daylight for the past two days by migrant workers hired by owners of a private resort. This is being done barely 50m from the beach on sand dunes at Khobrawaddo, which is in the no-development zone of the CRZ. We want the minister for environment and others concerned to come and see for themselves what is going on, and know about the destruction of the environment,” a resident said. The incident comes days after a Calangute-based NGO claimed that an illegal road is being constructed barely 20m from the high-tide line at Gauravaddo by clearing beachside vegetation, resulting in irreversible damage to the coastal beachside environment. A complaint about the illegal road was filed by the Calangute Constituency Forum with the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority last week. “All this is happening because the elected members of the panchayat and ministers are busy with the coming elections,” residents said. Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins, when contacted, said they have received a complaint from locals about the incident. “I have informed the police and they went to the site,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-villagers-upset-over-clearing-of-beachside-vegetation/articleshow/88153731.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi: Vendors under EDMC hawk eye for hygiene||NEW DELHI: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday issued guidelines to street food vendors for obtaining health trade licences. A senior official said it is the first civic agency in the city to come out with a policy that would ensure vendors serve food in a hygienic manner. “Operations of street vendors will be allowed through hand-driven carts or means approved by the vending committees. We will ensure there will be no nuisance from odours, litter, noise or obstruction to traffic,” said EDMC mayor Shyam Sundar Aggrawal. Aggrawal said about 2,500 food vendors in east Delhi have been identified by vending committees, which are headed by deputy commissioners, and issued certificates of vending (CoV) as per the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. The new policy, added Aggrawal, is expected to come into force as soon as the committees identify sites for the vendors. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said licensees and food handlers suffering from any infectious disease will not be permitted to work. “Proper arrangements for collection of waste material will be made by the licensee as per the Solid Waste Management Rules. This initiative will bring street vendors under the licence network and the corporation will get revenues as well,” he added. Aggrawal said the civic agency, in association with the Centre, is already carrying out training and skill development programmes. “It will be compulsory for applicants to get their training done through us or Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) before applying for a health licence,” he added. However, Arbind Singh, coordinator, National Association of Street Vendors of India (NASVI), said the civic body was “creating confusion” through the policy as vendors are required to obtain only a certificate from the committees and a food safety certificate from FSSAI.“In 2014, we moved Delhi high court against the civic agencies’ move to penalise vendors under the Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act citing unhygienic conditions and cholera fears. The court categorically stated that vendors would need two certificates, of vending and food safety,” he said. An EDMC official countered by saying that the civic body has the right to issue health trade licences and check the quality of food being served by vendors under the DMC Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/vendors-under-edmc-hawk-eye-for-hygiene/articleshow/88153347.cms||Vibha Sharma

It is no different this election season. In fact, with the area being the cradle of recent protests against farm laws, the poll outcome may well be decided by the way the electorate in the region casts its ballot. The emergence of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), headquartered at Sisauli village in Muzaffarnagar, is a major factor which will make political analysts watch out for voting patterns in the region. The manner in which BKU fought tooth and nail against the three farm laws, may make it a formidable opposition to the ruling party, observers feel. Primarily supported by Jats, who are backed by powerful khaps, BKU has strong support in rural belts of Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli, Meerut and other districts of west UP. According to political observers, this may be cause of worry for the BJP despite repealing of the farm laws as the farmers’ demand for a law on MSP remains, which the BKU has already made into a poll issue. However, the saffron party remains confident. A senior BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said, “Our numbers might come down in terms of seats won but we are coming back.” The other opposition parties in the region, namely the SP and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) are heavily banking on the Jat-Muslim combination. The RLD, led by Jayant Chaudhary, is leaving no stone unturned to bring together Jats and Muslims, who had parted ways after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, by organising “bhaichara” (brotherhood) committees. As RLD state spokesperson Sunil Rohta put it, "Thanks to BJP, farm laws have removed caste and religious fissures, and today, not only Jats and Muslims but even other communities believe they are farmers first and everything else later.” The Jat-Muslim division had proved costly for the RLD in the past as it failed to open its account in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and won just one seat in the 2017 state polls. If 7% of Jats and 29% of Muslims come together, statistics might change drastically for BJP in the forthcoming polls, feel observers. In the 2014 general elections, the worst communal riots that jolted the region a year before in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli, played a major role in restructuring of religious and caste equations across UP with some resonance in the country as well. No wonder, BJP secured 71 out of the 80 parliamentary seats in the state, which has the largest representation in the Lok Sabha, leading to the formation of the first-ever BJP government at the Centre with a full majority. In the 2017 state assembly polls, Kariana’s exodus issue found a mention in BJP's manifesto. The saffron party used it as a weapon to tear into the incumbent Samajwadi Party (SP) government on law and order issues. Again, BJP and its allies secured a handsome 312 assembly seats out of 403, attaining absolute majority with 39.67% vote share. In the same polls, out of the 73 assembly seats in western UP, where polling was held in the first phase in 15 districts, including Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Hathras and Agra, BJP bagged 61 seats and added one more to the tally as the lone RLD winner from Chaprauli constituency of Baghpat switched over to BJP soon after the saffron party swept the polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/why-west-up-holds-the-key-to-2022-assembly-elections/articleshow/88151969.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand HC hears petition challenging Arvind Kejriwal’s free electricity card||NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) heard a petition challenging Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal's promise of a free electricity guarantee card, which is meant to provide 300 units of free electricity to residents of Uttarakhand if the party elected to power. After hearing the matter, the court fixed the next date of hearing on December 8. Sanjay Jain, who is a resident of Vikasnagar and a former member of the Uttarakhand Minorities Commission, filed the petition. He requested the court to declare the conditions set by the party to get free electricity unconstitutional. These include giving a missed call on the mobile number issued by the party, after which the card will be issued. Then, ensuring that the card is kept intact by the residents, without which they will not get free electricity. The petitioner asked the court to declare that getting registered in writing is unconstitutional. The petitioner has made the election commision India, election commision of Uttarakhand and Ajay Kothiyal of AAP a party in his petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-hears-petition-challenging-kejriwals-free-electricity-card/articleshow/88151970.cms||---
---||Nagpur||In her first visit to Gadchiroli, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to give e-cycles to tribal girls||NAGPUR: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will visit Gadchiroli on December 14 to distribute e-cycles to about 10,000 tribal girls. It would be her first visit to the Maoist-hit district. The programme will be held at Zilla Parishad ground from 10.30am ro 11.30am. Gandhi would be flying directly from Lucknow to Nagpur and then by helicopter to the district. Costing about Rs15,000 each, the e-cycles are battery operated machines which can run for 5kms on one charge. These could be recharged by pedaling or through electric connection. Interacting with the media at Gadchiroli on Tuesday, Maharashtra relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that Priyanka would be coming on the invitation of his daughter Shivani, Maharashtra Pradesh Youth Congress general secretary, and the entire concept of distributing the bicycles to poor tribal girls was hers. “The battery-powered bicycles will be distributed to school and college girls in remote areas of the district. It was Shivani’s suggestion to donate these only to girls due to lack of public and other transportation facilities in the district. I would have distributed those in Chandrapur, but she insisted on Gadchiroli stating that the former is already an industrial city,” the minister, who was accompanied by his daughter, said. About 5,000 e-cycles would also be distributed in Bramhapuri, which is Wadettiwar’s constituency. Many companies have donated funds under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) for purchasing the products. “Priyanka is an icon for women across India and she always promotes their empowerment as well as girls’ education. Shivani emailed her about her concept, which she liked and readily accepted her invitation. Despite her busy schedule ahead of next year’s Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, where she is in-charge of the Congress, she granted her consent to visit Gadchiroli. The detailed programme is yet to be finalized,” Wadettiwar said. On account of Gandhi’s first visit, the local unit of the party has planned big celebrations across the district, where she would interact with activists and elected members. “She would not be coming to Bramhapuri bdue to her busy schedule. The entire country is looking at her with a hope just like they used to do during the tenure of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-her-first-visit-to-gadchiroli-priyanka-to-give-e-cycles-to-tribal-girls/articleshow/88151092.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The rapid response teams have not been able to trace them as the foreign mobile numbers provided by these people at the time of check-in at hotels are either not reachable or switched off. Besides, the phone numbers of at least 10 people recorded at the hotels are wrong. The health department has sent a list of these people with the available details to the local intelligence unit to identify and trace them. Following reports on rapid transmission of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the health department in Agra district had sounded an alert on November 27. Four rapid response teams were constituted to identify foreign visitors and those having recent travel history overseas. Talking with TOI, chief medical officer (CMO) of Agra district, Dr Arun Srivastava said, “Following passport data tracking, it surfaced that 175 foreigners had visited Agra in November. Out of these, 45 foreign visitors from different countries have so far not been traced. We are not able to contact them as the phone numbers are wrong.
