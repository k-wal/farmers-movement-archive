---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru hotspots gear up for the party season in December||Is the Omicron variant of COVID truly a potential 'super spreader'? Or is it, as the New York Times dubbed it, ‘a dress rehearsal for the next pandemic’? Whatever, the hospitality industry is taking no chances as the city enters party mode. Here’s a look at what’s going on behind the scenes to keep party-goers and social animals safe this season. Periodic temperature checksOne tell-tale sign is heightened body temperature. Many places are looking at getting routine temperature checks in place. Chethan Hegde from 1522 says, "People are aware of the danger of Omicron and are, hence, more cautious. We do three rounds of temperature checks for staff and guests are told to get their temperature checked and use sanitizer. We encourage guests to wear masks while walking in the restaurant." Hitesh Tulsani, sales and operations manager, Raahi Neo Kitchen and Bar, says, "Our brand conducts hourly temperature checks for all staff at the outlets. All the staff have been provided with fully protected kitchen gear and they wash and sanitize their hands for 20 seconds every 20 minutes." Social distancing between tablesThe biggest buzzword over the past 18 months has been social distancing. Restaurants are now ensuring they follow the same. Suraj Shetty, founder of Mahesh Lunch Home, Indiranagar, says, "We will ensure that social distancing between the tables is maintained and we are not operating over the allowed capacity." Some restaurants are banking on their large spaces to ensure safe distances between diners. Kiran Kumar, director, Gawky Goose, (KG Hospitality), says, "We have a huge floor plan and enough spaced-out seating with large outdoor areas, which keeps our customers as safe as possible." Testing of staffTo ensure there are no infected staff working, many restaurants are looking at periodic tests. "We're looking at a bi-weekly, random testing exercise for the team since their safety too is of utmost importance to us," shares Ajith GS , co-founder, FLO Restaurant and Bar, Church Street. Contactless serviceThe biggest innovation in the F&B industry has been contactless service and will be the biggest trump card to ensure safety. "We ensure sanitization of all touch points as well as encourage contactless dining. Due to the upcoming festivities, we have also refrained from any brunch or special buffet events," says Terence Prasad, general manager, URU Brewpark. Self-parking facilitiesWhile valet parking has been a big boon for diners and revellers, given Bengaluru's limited parking areas, but it’s not the ideal thing during a pandemic. Kiran says, "We have a self-park space of our own which can handle 220 cars, in case patrons are uncomfortable about giving their cars to our valet." Dedicated COVID ambassadorsSome spaces have put in place dedicated staff members to ensure proper safety protocol and cleaning measures. "While the pandemic is still affecting our daily life, we continue to follow the latest safety standards, with fully vaccinated staff, disinfecting every table by a dedicated COVID safety ambassador, and allowing only vaccinated guests," says Arun Prasanna, head of operations, Byg Brewski Company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-hotspots-gear-up-for-the-party-season-in-december/articleshow/88320692.cms||Sunayana Suresh

---||Lucknow||If socialism means anarchy, then it should be done away with: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: In a fierce attack on SP and its president Akhilesh Yadav, CM Yogi said that socialism for some is about dynastic rule, mafia, and terrorism. We need Ram Rajya in the country which implies the well-being of all, Yogi said. Earlier, a horse cart was brought from England to celebrate Saifai Mahotsav, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi thought of ensuring that even those wearing slippers can afford flights, Yogi said. “When SP was in power, there was darkness everywhere. If darkness, anarchy and ‘mafiagiri’ mean socialism then such socialism should be done away with,” the CM said. We do not kick out our father and uncle like some politicians did: CMOur government is promoting sports also and has adopted wrestling and badminton, but SP leaders may not be knowing about cricket, bat or ball, because their sport is country-made pistol, Yogi said while addressing the Assembly during the winter session on Thursday. “We respect our elders and do not kick them out, like some politicians who kicked their own father and uncle from their political party and home,” the CM said, adding, “We have doubled the elderly pension from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000, raised Divyang pension from Rs 500 to Rs1,000 and leprosy patient pension to Rs 3,000 per month.” Yogi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has realised the dream seen by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia 60 years ago. “Dr Lohia Ji once said that no power in the world will be able to remove a government which gives freedom from open defecation to the poor by constructing toilets for them and ensures the burning of stove in their houses, for the coming 25 years,” he added. “Our government worked on the principle of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ and we are making Uttar Pradesh free of poverty, corruption, communalism, and casteism. UP is on its way to Ram Rajya,” the CM said. Expressing confidence of winning the 2022 assembly elections, the CM said, “Some said Covid-19 third wave will come in August or September, but I assure you that we will come back in 2022 and put all efforts to stop the third wave. But one thing is certain that many of you (Opposition) will not come back.” Slamming the previous governments, he said, “Instead of reducing the burden of people, the previous governments were themselves a burden.” He said economic progress of the state is not measured by the person who is at the top of the ladder but by the one who is at its bottom and our government has worked for the well-being of the poor and underprivileged. The CM said, “A worthy king does not move according to the situation but changes the circumstances instead.” Asserting that UP is now one of the most investorfriendly states and investors no longer worry about their safety and security or that of their investments, the CM said, “Today every big investor is eager to invest here.” Even when the whole world was witnessing a meltdown in the corona period, Uttar Pradesh got an investment of Rs 66,000 crore. The first display unit was set up in UP and started production amid pandemic, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/if-socialism-means-anarchy-then-it-should-be-done-away-with-up-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/88327010.cms||---
---||World||Santa Claus isn't coming to town: Covid sparks St. Nick shortage||NEW YORK: Christmas is just around the corner but you may struggle to spot a Santa spreading joy in the United States this holiday season.  That's because the pandemic has caused a shortage of Father Christmases, according to a booking company and Santa Claus training school.  After festivities were kept to a minimum last year due to Covid-19, parties are back for Christmas 2021 but the supply of plump, white-bearded men in red is way behind demand.  "There's a tremendous shortage of Santa Claus entertainers," Mitch Allen, founder of Texas-based rental agency Hire Santa, told AFP.  Allen said there has been a 120 percent increase in demand for Santas this season compared to 2020 as businesses, schools and shopping malls host celebrations again.  But the number of Santas on his books has dropped 10 percent compared to 2019, meaning he has a shortfall of "over 1000 positions" this season.  "Unfortunately, we're just not able to meet the huge demand that we're receiving right now," said Allen, wearing a green elf costume on a video call.  The supply slump is despite many organizations having decided to cancel activities, fearful of the highly transmissible Omicron variant that has once again put the world's health systems on high alert.  Contributing to the shortfall have been the deaths from coronavirus of more than 335 of Allen's Santas this year, he said.  Many, given that they are high-risk due to their age, have decided to hang up their red suit and bobble hat for the time being while others have opted to retire.  In a good year, a Santa Claus can earn between $6,000 and $10,000 over the course of the early November to Christmas Eve season, said Allen.  - Santa school - But the pandemic has meant fewer candidates are aspiring to be Old Saint Nick, according to the Professional Santa Claus School in Denver.  The academy has suffered a 25 percent drop in applications since the pandemic, according to founder Susen Mesco, despite training moving online.  "In the last two years, 28 Santas graduated when the usual number is 120," she said in an email to AFP.  "Age is an important factor," since most of the Santas are over 70 years old, Mesco added.  Allen predicts that the shortage will continue "for years to come."  "This year, we have people already booking for 2022. We never had that before," he explained.  But Allen's not about to lower standards to boost numbers.  "Not everybody can be Santa. You have to have to look like Santa Claus. You gotta have that twinkle in your eye and that love for Christmas."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/santa-claus-isnt-coming-to-town-covid-sparks-st-nick-shortage/articleshow/88327040.cms||---

The school was holding a celebration to mark the end of the school year.  The children who died included two boys and two girls in year 6, which would make them 10 or 11 years old, said Tasmania police Commissioner Darren Hine. Police later Thursday confirmed a fifth child died in the hospital.  Five other children were being treated, including four in critical condition. Hine said an investigation is underway.  Images published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation showed police officers consoling each other as paramedics provided first aid to victims.  Parents arrived at the school gate to collect their children as helicopters ferried the injured to hospitals.  Tasmania state Premier Peter Gutwein called the incident "simply inconceivable... I know this is a strong and caring community that will stand together and support one another."  Tasmania police commander Debbie Williams told reporters "several children fell from the jumping castle. It appears they may have fallen from a height of approximately 10 meters."  "This is a very tragic event and our thoughts are with the families and the wider school community and also our first responders," Williams said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/5-children-die-in-bouncy-castle-accident-in-australia/articleshow/88327085.cms||---
---||World||Pakistan marks 7th anniversary of attack on Peshawar school||ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan on Thursday marked the seventh anniversary of the terror attack on the Army Public School in the northwestern city of Peshawar, parents of the slain children, activists and politicians lambasted prime minister Imran Khan and his government for offering an olive branch to the terrorist group responsible for the massacre of over 150 people, including 131 kids. Currently, the Khan government has been seeking reconciliation with the Tehreek Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella organisation of several terror factions, which had accepted responsibility for the attack on the school on December 16, 2014. The attack had prompted Pakistan’s civilian and military leaders to act against the terrorists based in the volatile tribal regions bordering Afghanistan. The military offensive against terrorists in the tribal belt was part of a 20-point National Action Plan (NAP), a security plan announced by ex-PM Nawaz Sharif to defeat what many had come to believe existential threat to Pakistan. The military assault had forced the terrorists to cross into Afghanistan, where they regrouped and started targeting Pakistan with lethal suicide bombings. Following the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in mid-August this year, Pakistan, through the Haqqani Network, an ally of the Afghan Taliban, had started consultations with TTP in the war-battered country. Last week, the group had cancelled a month-long ceasefire that it had unilaterally announced on November 9. Since TTP has announced an end to truce, Islamabad has yet to confirm whether its dialogue with TTP was still intact or halted. “What right does the government have to hold negotiations with TTP when it is our children who were killed in the APS attack,” asked Muhamad Amin, father of a slain kid. Ishaq Amin, Amin’s elder son, was killed in the attack while his younger son Amir Amin, who was critically injured, is yet to recover from the shock and trauma that he went through. “Who are they to pardon the killers of our children,” asked Shahana Khan. Her 15-year-old son Asmat was one of the victims of the APS attack. “I’ve seen the bullet-riddled body of my son. They (PM Khan and his government) should feel ashamed for their offer of general amnesty to terrorists,” she said, asking the Supreme Court to stop the government from granting amnesty to killers of their kids. In a message to mark the APS anniversary, PM Khan claimed the country has “successfully defeated terrorism” and vowed to never “let down the survivors and parents” of those martyred in the tragic incident. Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif called it a painful day for the nation and asked: “Have we learned any lessons and corrected our course?” Expressing concern over non-implementation of NAP, Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said December 16 will always remain a painful day for the nation. “The nation still feels the pain of this great tragedy. Everyone is still waiting for justice to be served to the innocent souls,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-marks-7th-anniversary-of-attack-on-peshawar-school/articleshow/88327100.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Addressing the 50th Vijay Diwas celebration function to mark the country’s victory in the 1971 war, Sinha said India “will not forget or forgive those behind breeding terrorists. We are determined to completely dismantle their terror ecosystem”. Describing India as a “supporter of peace”, the LG said it has never opted for expansionism despite being a “superpower”. He said: “We have lived the values of peaceful coexistence and mutual harmony, and believed in the philosophy of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family). But we never lowered our guard and successfully conquered every challenge.” The Union Territory of J&K would not be cowed down by terror activities, he said, adding, “We will not be deterred by terrorists. We will continue with our mission to develop an ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) Jammu and Kashmir.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-lg-warns-indias-neighbour-to-remember-defeats-of-past/articleshow/88327228.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

A defence spokesman said the terrorists had forcefully intruded into a residential house and taken two girls hostage. “The terrorists had forcefully taken shelter in a house in the village. It was also learnt that the terrorists in a cowardly manner had taken two innocent girls hostages. The security forces responded swiftly, surrounded the house and carried out a sustained and careful operation. They rescued the beleaguered girls and handed them over to their families. Soon after the rescue, the terrorists in the house exchanged fire with the forces and were eliminated in the process,” the defence spokesman added. A joint team of police, Army’s 1 RR and CRPF launched a cordon and search operation on a specific information about the presence of terrorists in Redwani Bala on Wednesday evening. A senior police official said that as the presence of terrorists got ascertained, efforts were made to evacuate the civilians in the area and surrender offers were repeatedly given to the hiding terrorists, which they rejected. In the ensuing encounter, two LeT were killed and their bodies were retrieved from the site of encounter. “They were identified as Amir Bashir Dar resident of Kujjar, Frisal, and Adil Yousuf Shan, a resident of Sursano Hatipora, Kulgam,” the police spokesman said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2-let-terrorists-killed-in-kulgam-encounter-2-hostage-girls-recused/articleshow/88327529.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||House panel moots penalties up to Rs 15 crore for data violations||NEW DELHI: The joint parliamentary committee on personal data protection has re-introduced a recommendation of heavy penalties for serious data violations in its final report with fines up to Rs 15 crore, or 4% of global turnover, while lesser violations will have a limit of Rs 5 crore, or 2% turnover. The provision, if it becomes a law, will pose a strong deterrent for social media giants and top tech companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The final report, submitted in Parliament on Thursday, brought back penalties -- the provision had been left to the government in the draft report -- much in line with the original provisions in the 2019 Data Protection Bill, as well as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The joint parliamentary committee had seen heated discussions on the proposal to drop the clauses, and committee chair and senior BJP leader PP Chaudhary had agreed that the penalties need to be restored with a cap on the terms of the quantum of fines after opposition MPs registered their objections. Read AlsoData protection Bill: Report tabled amid bonhomieNEW DELHI: The joint parliamentary committee's (JPC) report on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, which recommends wide ranging changes, including widening the scope of the Bill to include non-personal data and pitches for all social media platforms to be declared 'publishers' - was tabled inInterestingly, the turnaround by the committee comes after the provision had been dropped in the draft report, where the committee had left the matter of penalty quantification in the hands of the central government. “In the Committee’s view, such quantification may not be feasible as there are no clear mechanisms to quantify the ‘world-wide turnover’ of the company and that too along with its group entities. Also keeping in view the rapidly changing dynamics of the evolving digital technologies, the committee feels that it would be prudent to enable the government to quantify the penalties,” the panel had said in its draft report of November. The panel members include Jairam Ramesh, Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha, and Gaurav Gogoi (from the Congress), Derek O'Brien and Mahua Moitra (from the Trinamool Congress), and Amar Patnaik and Bhartruhari Mahtab (from the Biju Janata Dal) who had voiced their objections to the specific formulation on penalties being done away with. The lack of specificity would have spelt relief for internet giants, especially since many of them have been under regulatory scanner across the globe over massive user-info violations, data breach, unlawful processing and lax oversight. In the final report, the committee also brought back the penalty clause of the higher of Rs 5 crore, or 2% of global turnover, for certain provisions, including failure to take prompt and appropriate action in response to a data security breach; failure to register with the proposed data protection authority; failure to undertake a data protection impact assessment or conduct a data audit; and failure to appoint a data protection officer. The top penalty of the higher of Rs 15 crore, or 4% of global turnover, comes for violations in processing of personal data of users and children; failure to adhere to security safeguards; and violations in transfer of personal data outside India. The re-introduction of the penalties will be a worrying fact for companies such as Facebook and Instagram, who have been under a probe in India over various violations, including a CBI inquiry over the Cambridge Analytica episode. The difficulties for companies have only been compounded after revelations by former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen, who had highlighted the ineptness of the social media giant in content moderation across the world as well as in India, accusing the group of prioritising profits over safety. There have also been allegations of data violations against Amazon and its handling of data in India. The panel report says in case of violations by a state, the penalties will be capped at Rs 15 crore for serious breach and Rs 5 crore for those of a lesser nature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/house-panel-moots-penalties-up-to-rs-15-crore-for-data-violations/articleshow/88327786.cms||Pankaj Doval

According to sources, the current Delimitation Commission had sought the report of its predecessor panel, presented by chairperson Justice K K Gupta in 1995, from the J&K government around a month back. The purpose was to study the basis on which it had allocated the seats to the three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, so as to assess and correct any anomalies in the current exercise. However, the UT administration reverted saying that the report of Justice K K Gupta commission — set up under the J&K Constitution and J&K Representation of the People Act — was not traceable in either the state assembly, state government records or archives. As a result, the current Delimitation Commission had to make do with whatever records and figures of the last delimitation exercise are available in the public domain — including the notification relating to the 1995 delimitation award — to put together its first delimitation draft. A source indicated that the search for Justice K K Gupta panel report began much earlier, around the time of abrogation of Article 370 in J&K on August 9, 2019. However, the report was nowhere to be found, leaving officials baffled as to how such an important document, which may have had more than one copy, vanished from all records. An official even indicated that it may be several years and, possibly, decades since the report is missing. Interestingly, all the elections in J&K since 1996 have been held based on the delimitation award given in 1995. The tentative allocation of seats worked out by the panel led by Justice (Retd) Desai with chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and chairman of J&K state election commission as ex-officio members, takes into account facts gathered during its tour of J&K in July this year. Around 280 representations were received from various groups and 900 persons appeared before the commission. As per indications, while the number of constituencies reserved for Scheduled Castes may remain at seven, nine seats may be reserved for Scheduled Tribes, spread over both Jammu and Kashmir regions. The proposed delimitation draft to be discussed with the associate members next week seeks to correct anomalies such as allocation of seats to Kashmir region even where population density is less, while not doing the same for similar areas in the Jammu region. “For example, there are large but thinly populated constituencies allocated in Kashmir areas like Gurez and Karnah (Kupwara). Yet the same formula was not applied while allocating constituencies in Jammu region, particularly in a big area like Kishtwar with less population density but far-flung habitations,” an officer pointed out, hinting at a possible allocation of additional constituencies in Kishtwar as part of the latest delimitation exercise. Sources added that there is also likelihood of a separate constituency being carved out of the border district of Samba, to accommodate villages close to the border where the residents have unique concerns like shelling from Pakistan. These concerns can be addressed better if they have their separate MLA, it was felt. The delimitation commission has not just gone by population criteria in earmarking constituencies but taken into account physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units, facility of communication and public convenience, as required by Section 9(1)(a) of the Delimitation Act, 2002. Once the suggestions of associate members or the five MPs have been considered, the reworked draft delimitation proposal will be placed in the public domain for objections. Public hearings may be held by the panel in Jammu and Srinagar, followed by the final delimitation award.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1995-jk-delimitation-report-missing-data-in-public-domain-helps-new-draft/articleshow/88328162.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Ousted McDonald's CEO returns $105M after misconduct||NEW YORK: Former McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook has paid back more than $105 million in equity awards and cash to the burger giant after it learned that he had lied about the extent of his misconduct while he was its top executive. "During my tenure as CEO, I failed at times to uphold McDonald's values and fulfill certain of my responsibilities as a leader of the company," Easterbrook said in a prepared statement issued Thursday by McDonald's.  "I apologise to my former co-workers, the board and the company's franchisees and suppliers for doing so." McDonald's fired Easterbrook in late 2019 after he acknowledged exchanging videos and text messages in a non-physical, consensual relationship with an employee. At the time of his firing, Easterbrook told the company there were no other similar instances and an inspection of his cell phone seemed to back that up. McDonald's board approved a separation agreement "without cause" that allowed Easterbrook to keep tens of millions in stock-based benefits and other compensation. Then, in July 2020, the company received an anonymous tip from an employee claiming that Easterbrook had engaged in a sexual relationship with another employee. After an investigation, McDonald's confirmed that relationship as well as two other physical, sexual relationships with employees in the year before it fired its top executive. The company said Easterbrook had removed evidence of those relationships from his phone. McDonald's board sued Easterbrook in August 2020, saying it wouldn't have terminated him without cause if it had known the extent of his misconduct. The company sought the return of equity awards granted in 2018 and 2019, since Easterbrook's separation agreement made clear he would forfeit those if the company determined he had engaged in "detrimental conduct." The settlement announced Thursday holds Easterbrook accountable and affirms the board's decision to pursue the case, McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. said in a prepared statement. "The resolution avoids a protracted court process and allows us to move forward," Hernandez said. The action against Easterbrook came amid a larger reckoning at the company over sexual harassment in its ranks. Over the last five years, at least 50 workers have filed charges against the company, alleging physical and verbal harassment and, in some cases, retaliation when they came forward. In October 2019 - a month before Easterbrook was fired - McDonald's introduced a new harassment training program for its 850,000 US employees, but franchisees weren't required to provide it. McDonald's went further this spring, saying it will mandate worker training to combat harassment, discrimination and violence in its restaurants starting next year. The training will be required for 2 million workers at 39,000 stores worldwide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ousted-mcdonalds-ceo-returns-105m-after-misconduct/articleshow/88328232.cms||---

The move is in compliance with a National Green Tribunal order. In an order issued earlier this week, the transport department said a no-objection certificate (NOC) will be issued to the owners of these vehicles so that these can be re-registered at other places. However, the department will not issue an NOC for vehicles that have completed 15 years or more on the date of applying for an NOC. On October 29, 2018, the Supreme Court had prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the national capital. A 2014 order of the NGT had banned even parking of vehicles that are older than 15 years at any public place. “We have been taking action against old diesel vehicles, and till date, around 1 lakh such vehicles have been deregistered. Now all such vehicles will be stringently de-registered from January 1, 2022,” said a Delhi government official. “Around 2 lakh diesel vehicles that are at least 10 years old will be de-registered from January 1.” He said the transport department has been issuing a series of public notices to draw attention of the people to the legal position of these vehicles. “Diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old and the petrol ones that are more than 15 years old cannot ply in Delhi according to the guidelines for scrapping of motor vehicles notified by the department,” said the official. Officials estimated the number of overaged vehicles in Delhi at 38 lakh. “This includes 3 lakh diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old and around 35 lakh petrol vehicles that are more than 15 years old,” he said. The green tribunal had in July 2016 ordered that its direction for deregistration of diesel vehicles more than 10 years old be complied with effectively and without fail. “Deregistration of diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old was to be taken up first. In compliance with the NGT’s direction, the transport department deregistered a number of vehicles. Now, a new set of diesel vehicles completing more than 10 years in Delhi is due for deregistration,” the transport department said in its order. An NOC for diesel vehicles that are up to 10 years of age and petrol vehicles that are less than 15 years of age can be issued for any place in the country. “This will be subject to the condition that such an NOC will not be issued for places which are identified by the states as restricted areas in keeping with the order of the NGT, which had directed the states to identify areas where the dispersion of air is higher and vehicular density is the least,” the order said. The department has provided some relief for vehicle owners in the form of an option to convert their 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles to electric if they wish to continue to ply them in the capital. “The retrofitting of such vehicles with empanelled electric kits will have to be done through agencies approved by the transport department,” the order stated. The empanelment process for electric kits is under way. Delhi: Should you convert your old diesel car to electric?

---||India||Change of mindset needed in lower judiciary to encourage bail, not jail for accused: SC||NEW DELHI: Observing that if there are hundreds of reasons for denying bail then there are also hundreds of reasons for granting it, the Supreme Court on Thursday expressed concern over trial courts showing reluctance in granting relief despite various directions to encourage bail and said the mindset of such courts needs to change. The apex court, in a slew of orders, held personal liberty as an important aspect of constitutional mandate and that arrests should not be done in a routine manner when the accused is cooperating in a probe and there is no reason to believe that the person will abscond or influence investigations. The court had in October passed guidelines as per which if an accused had cooperated in the investigation — and was not arrested during the probe — then s/he should not be taken into custody at the time of filing of chargesheet. It held that a trial court cannot also refuse to accept a chargesheet simply because the accused had not been arrested and produced before the court. Noting that the guidelines were not followed by trial courts, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said the signal that the SC wanted to send has not reached and lower courts remained apprehensive in granting bail. "The idea was to encourage bail and not the reverse but it is not happening... It is all about mindset. But the mindset is to find a way to deny bail. It has to be changed," the bench said. The court said it is troubling that courts are spending substantial time in deciding only bail matters instead of main issues and cases which should have been decided by high courts reach the SC. The bench said the result is that the top court is flooded with bail petitions. "The endeavour was to reduce the bail application but it has, in fact, increased," the bench said. "It cannot be that everybody has to be put behind bars in every case. Bail should be encouraged and not jail," the bench said, noting that investigation goes on for years and during that period people should not languish in jail, which also causes overcrowding in prisons. It further said the investigating agencies lack sufficient manpower to conduct probes in a time-bound manner and there is also a lack of infrastructure, like paucity of labs, resulting in inordinate delays. "In those circumstances, we have to take a call on the issue as the probe goes on for years," the bench said. Senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Amit Desai, appearing for some accused who had not been granted by the trial court, said the SC's order was being wrongly interpreted by the trial courts and pleaded that some clarification was needed. The bench thereafter directed all the lawyers, including additional solicitor general S V Raju, appearing for the CBI, to sit together and come out with suggestions. The apex court had in October issued guidelines for different categories of offences. Referring to "A category" of offences (punishable with imprisonment of seven years or less), the court said ordinary summons be issued to accused to appear through the lawyer at the time of filing chargesheet. If there is no appearance then first bailable warrant be issued and later a non-bailable warrant. "Bail applications of such accused on appearance may be decided without the accused being taken in physical custody or by granting interim bail till the bail application is decided," the court said. For "Category B" offences (punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for more than seven years) and "Category D" (economic offences not covered by the special Acts), the bench said bail application be decided on merit on appearance of the accused in court. For "Category C" offences (punishable under Special Acts containing stringent provisions for bail like NDPS, PMLA, UAPA etc), the court said it would be same as Category B & D with the additional condition of compliance of the provisions of bail under the specific laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/change-of-mindset-needed-in-lower-judiciary-to-encourage-bail-not-jail-for-accused-sc/articleshow/88328383.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||India||HC judge who gave ‘skin-to-skin’ Pocso order to go back to district court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has taken the tough decision of refusing to continue Justice Pushpa V Ganediwala, who stirred a controversy in January this year with her back-to-back judgments taking what was seen as a warped and insensitive view of sexual crimes against children, as an additional judge of the Bombay high court. Now, with the collegium headed by CJI Ramana remitting her case back to the Bombay HC, Justice Ganediwala faces the prospect of being sent back as district judge. The collegium comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar decided not to grant further extension of the tenure. Her two controversial judgments, including one that held skin-to-skin contact is must for constituting a sexual offence, had forced the earlier collegium headed by then CJI S A Bobde to withdraw its January 20 recommendation to the government to appoint her as a permanent judge of the HC. It then had recommended to the Centre to grant her a two-year extension as additional judge. However, the government disagreed and granted her a one-year extension, which will end on February 12, 2022. On January 16, 2019, the collegium headed by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi and comprising Justices A K Sikri and Bobde had recommended her appointment as an additional judge of the HC. At the time of initial consideration of the Bombay HC collegium’s proposal to appoint her as additional judge, the consultee judges in the SC — Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud (both having Bombay as parent HC) — had conveyed their serious objections. Nonetheless, the SC collegium approved the HC proposal and she was appointed as additional judge on February 13, 2019. Her profile in the Bombay HC website says: "She was meritorious throughout her educational career and awarded gold medals in BCom, LLB and LLM examinations". She was appointed as a district judge in 2007. Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had again registered their objections with the collegium prior to its January 19, 2021 decision recommending her appointment as a permanent judge. After the unsavoury developments, when the issue of deciding the fate of Justice Ganediwala was taken up by the present collegium this week, Justices Khanwilkar (now part of the three-member collegium for appointment of HC judges) and Justice Chandrachud opposed grant of further extension to her. Justice Ganediwala had stunned many with her January 19 judgment acquitting a 39-year-old man of Section 7 offence under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on the ground that groping a 12-year-old girl without removing her top did not entail skin-to-skin contact and hence was not an offence under the Act. A Nagpur trial court in February 2020 had sentenced the man to three years’ imprisonment under Section 8 of the Pocso Act and Section 354 of IPC (outraging the modesty) for the unwanted contact. "Admittedly, it is not the case of the prosecution that the appellant removed her top and pressed her breast. As such, there is no direct physical contact i.e. skin to skin with sexual intent without penetration," the judge had said. Justice Ganediwala had said "stricter proof and serious allegations are required" given the stringent punishment of three to five years’ imprisonment that "sexual assault" entails under Pocso. "The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside the top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of ‘sexual assault’." Within nine days of such an interpretation, Justice Ganediwala on January 28 delivered another judgment showcasing her judicial mindset. She gave a ruling acquitting a 50-year-old man that holding the hand of a five-year-old kid and unzipping pants in front of her could not be categorised as a sexual offence under Section 7 of the Pocso Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-judge-who-gave-skin-to-skin-order-to-go-back-to-district-court/articleshow/88328473.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Govt works to raise legal age of marriage for women to 21||NEW DELHI: With the Cabinet approving the proposal to raise the legal age of marriage for girls from 18 years to 21, bringing it at par with men, the government has set in motion the process for a major change in law that has been a point of debate for long. The big test for the bill will be passage in Parliament as any change in age will have far reaching implications. Despite a decline over decades, underage marriages remain a concern even though there is a long-standing prohibition on child marriage. As many as 23.3% of women aged 20-24 were married before they turned 18, the legal age of marriage, as per National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21). The latest survey shows the problem is more prevalent in rural India at 27% whereas in urban regions, underage marriage accounted for 14.7% of all marriages. The government sees the proposed legislation as a strong measure to bring women on equal footing with men in keeping with the vision of the Constitution on gender equality. "As India progresses, further opportunities open up for women to pursue higher education and careers. There are imperatives for lowering Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and improvements of nutrition levels as well as increase in Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB). These are the main reasons for effecting the proposed legislation," an official source said. The move is also being cited as a step that will allow women to attain psychological maturity before marriage, exercise their reproductive rights better and take decisions on family planning and use of contraceptives. Read AlsoProgressive step or bane for the poor? Rights groups divided in their opinionNEW DELHI: Women rights groups are divided in their response to the government's proposal to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. While a section sees this as a progressive step to empower women with a "choice", thereThe age of marriage for women was increased from 15 to 18 in 1978 by amending the erstwhile Sharda Act of 1929. The first indication of an upward revision in the age of marriage of girls came in PM Narendra Modi's speech on Independence Day last year. On Wednesday, the Cabinet approved the introduction of 'Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021' for amending 'The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA)'. The bill is expected to be taken up in Parliament soon. According to sources, the bill once approved by Parliament, will be followed by consequential amendments in laws relating to age of marriage. These include personal laws governing marriage of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis and 'the Special Marriage Act, 1954' and 'the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969'. Under scrutiny are related laws like 'Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956' and 'Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956.' In his Independence Day speech last year, the PM said, "To end malnutrition among girls, to assess what should be the age of marriage, we have set up a committee."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-works-to-raise-legal-age-of-marriage-for-women-to-21/articleshow/88328524.cms||Ambika Pandit

The strange clotting problem has caused nine confirmed deaths after J&J vaccinations - while the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines don't come with that risk and also appear to be more effective, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  It's an unusual move and the CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, must decide whether to accept the panel's advice.  Until now the U.S. has treated all three COVID-19 vaccines available to Americans as an equal choice, since large studies found they all offered strong protection and early supplies were limited. J&J's vaccine initially was welcomed as a single-dose option that could be especially important for hard-to-reach groups like homeless people who might not get the needed second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna options.  But the CDC's advisers said Thursday that it was time to recognize a lot has changed since vaccines began rolling out a year ago. More than 200 million Americans are considered fully vaccinated, including about 16 million who got the J&J shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/cdc-panel-recommends-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-over-jj-shot/articleshow/88328557.cms||---

During the current tenure of the assembly, she is the first BJP MLA to resign. BJP reacted swiftly with the state unit president Sadanand Shet Tanavade expelling her from the party for anti-party activities. “We will file a disqualification petition against her,” Tanavade told TOI. Saldanha, who participated in a party meeting on Wednesday evening to finalise plans for PM Narendra Modi’s visit to the state on Sunday, did not give any intimation to the speaker’s office and submitted her resignation to the legislature secretary. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar is yet to accept her resignation. “I have resigned for a valid reason. The party seems to have forgotten all its principles and there is bedlam in the state. Nobody knows who is coming into the party and who is going out,” she said after quitting. Saldanha has been in the forefront of agitations against three linear projects that cut across the Mollem biodiversity hotspot and has been opposing the rail double-tracking passing through her constituency, as “it will destroy at least 100 houses”. “As a representative of the people, it is my duty to stand by them in times of dire needs. I cannot betray their trust. But this party has lost all respect,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-sees-its-first-exit-in-goa-as-two-time-mla-quits-to-join-aap/articleshow/88328607.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||Govt has given ‘in-principle’ approval for setting up 6 N-power reactors at Jaitapur: Minister||NEW DELHI: The Centre has accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for the site at Jaitapur in Maharashtra’s Ratnagiri district for setting up six nuclear power reactors of 1,650MW each in technical cooperation with France, which will make it the largest nuclear power generating site with a total capacity of 9,900 MW. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, atomic energy minister Jitendra Singh said currently techno-commercial discussions with French multinational electric utility company EDF for the project are in progress. On nuclear power capacity, the minister informed that the present installed nuclear power capacity in India is 6,780 MW and the share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation is 3.1% in 2020-21. The installed nuclear power capacity grew from 4,780 MW to 6,780 MW in the past seven years — an increase of over 40%. Singh said the net zero targets are expected to be met through a combination of various clean energy sources, including nuclear power. In this context, the current nuclear power capacity of 6,780 MW is planned to be increased to 22,480 MW by 2031 on progressive completion of projects under construction and accorded sanction. More nuclear power reactors are also in the offing. The nuclear power plants have so far generated about 755 billion units of electricity saving about 650 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, he said. In reply to another question raised in the Lok Sabha a day earlier, the minister said India is pursuing an indigenous three-stage nuclear power programme to provide the country with long-term energy security in a sustainable manner. In addition, light water reactors based on foreign cooperation are also being set up as additional facilities to provide clean electricity. The minister also informed that Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant’s (KKNPP’s) 3 & 4 (2X1000 MW) project units implemented by PSU Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) in Tamil Nadu has achieved a physical progress of 54.9% as of November this year. He said the KKNPP 3 & 4 units are expected to be completed by March 2023 and November 2023, respectively. The fast reactor fuel cycle facility (FRFCF) project is currently being executed by the Nuclear Recycle Board, BARC and the department of atomic energy. The project progress as on November 30 is 32% and is expected to be completed by December 2027. He said that the 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) being built by Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (BHAVINI) at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu is under integrated commissioning stage. “The project was originally sanctioned in 2003 and expected completion by September 2010. According to the latest approval, the revised completion target for the project is October 2022,” Jitendra Singh said. He said the government has allocated Rs 250 crore for the pre-project activities of FBR-1 & 2 to be built at Kalpakkam. Detailed design and analyses of FBR-1 & 2 are under progress at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, taking into consideration the commissioning and operational feedback of PFBR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-has-given-in-principle-approval-for-setting-up-6-n-power-reactors-at-jaitapur-minister/articleshow/88328732.cms||Surendra Singh
---||India||After 28 yrs, HCs to take up debt-recovery cases as tribunals hit||NEW DELHI: After a gap of 28 years, the High Courts will take up debt recovery cases for adjudication, albeit temporarily, on the request of the Supreme Court, which on Thursday found that crippling vacancies have rendered Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and appellate tribunals (DRATs) dysfunctional severely impeding banks and financial institution from recovering dues. If on one hand the banks and FIs have been crying hoarse over the stalling of recovery process during the pandemic forced lockdowns, they appeared to be on their knees because of further delay caused due to non-availability of presiding officers and members as well as support staff in DRTs and DRATs because of long pending vacancies. Attorney general K K Venugopal informed a bench of CJI N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao that a peculiar problem has arisen in Madhya Pradesh, where the work of the DRT was assigned to the Central Administrative Tribunal, but the latter declined to take up additional work citing existing huge pendency in its hand. He attempted to justify the Centre's decision to entrust Jabalpur DRT's caseload to DRTs at Lucknow and Chandigarh saying the proceedings could be carried out through video conferencing. Senior advocate NIdhesh Gupta suggested that instead of making the banks, FIs and their lawyers to run through such uncertainties, it would be better to entrust the debt recovery cases to the High Courts till the DRTs and DRATs were made functional through expeditious filling up of vacant posts. The bench accepted the suggestion and requested the HCs to entertain debt recovery pleas from banks and FIs till further orders.The DRTs and DRATs were established under the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 with the specific objective of providing expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to Banks and FIs. A total of 39 DRTs and five DRATs have so far been set up. But, 18 of the 39 DRTs are non-functional because of huge vacancies. Thus after 28 years, the HCs are back to square one being asked to deal with debt recovery matters. “Adjudication of debt recovery cases by DRTs and DRATs are critical for the stability of banking and financial institutions and, by extension, the economic health of the country,” banks and FIs had said in their plea and pleaded with the SC for an early solution. The CJI-led bench asked the Centre to expedite the filling up of posts, possibly within the next fortnight. However, the AG had some good news to share with the bench. He said out of the 28 names recommended by a selection panel headed by a SC Judge for appointment as judicial and technical members of Income Tax Appellate Tribunals, the government has cleared the names of 22 who would be appointed by December 31. The SC wanted to know what was the government's objection on the remaining six names and asked its officers to bring the relevant file for scrutiny by the court on January 26. The CJI informed the AG that on Wednesday the Centre sought nomination of a SC Judge for heading the panel for selection of members for National Green Tribunal. "I am sending the name today. Please ask the government to expedite the appointments to the NGT," the CJI said, adding that steps are being taken to fill vacancies in Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-28-yrs-hcs-to-take-up-debt-recovery-cases-as-tribunals-hit/articleshow/88328751.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

"Prima facie, we are of the view that the matter with respect to implementation of Kannada language as a compulsory subject in higher studies on the basis of implementation of National Education Policy (NEP) is a question which requires consideration. As such, the state government at this stage, shall not insist on making Kannada language compulsory. Students who have already taken Kannada language on the basis of their choice may do so but those who do not wish to take Kannada language shall not be compelled to pursue the language till further orders," a division bench headed by Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi observed in its order. Earlier, MB Nargund, Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Centre, informed the court that making any language compulsory in any particular state on the basis of implementation of NEP would have vast ramifications and as such the central government has to take a decision in consultation with the state governments in this regard. He said that necessary meetings for this purpose could not be held so far and as such he is not in a position to spell out the stand of the central government in respect of making Kannada language compulsory in Karnataka. Nargund submitted that a detailed counter affidavit on behalf of the central government in this regard would be filed shortly and requested for four weeks' time.Shridhar Prabhu, counsel for five students, said that the court by means of an interim order passed on December 13, 2021, directed the state government and Bangalore City University not to precipitate the matter with respect to making Kannada compulsory. He requested the court to further clarify by saying that the petitioner students are free to choose the language they want as they have taken admissions in the current academic session. However, Advocate-General Prabhuling K Navadgi, referring to the petition filed by the five students claimed that they have in fact already studied Kannada up to class 12 and as such they cannot have any objection in studying Kannada in higher classes. The court is hearing two petitions on this issue, a PIL by Samskrita Bharati (Karnataka) Trust, Bengaluru and three other institutions associated with promotion of Sanskrit language/ study and another filed by the five students. In both the petitions, the validity of government orders dated August 7,202 in so far as making Kannada as a compulsory subject and September 15,2021 order stipulating that interstate and international degree students pursuing graduate program will be compulsorily instructed in "functional Kannada" in one of the semesters in the 1st year has been questioned. The petitioners have claimed that both these orders are against the very intent of the National Education Policy(NEP) 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-to-govt-dont-force-degree-students-to-take-kannada-language/articleshow/88328783.cms||---

For this, the varsity has to amend its own Act and the matter will be taken up at the ongoing Belagavi session. RGUHS authorities said some doctors were asked to provide their final degree certificates when applying for higher studies abroad. In a communication sent to medical education department’s principal secretary on December 7, medical education minister K Sudhakar directed the officer to propose amendments to enable issue of degree certificates as soon as the candidate secures eligibility. Recently, a doctor from Andhra Pradesh, who is in Karnataka and has completed internship in 2020, sought a degree certificate prior to the convocation, stating he required it for higher studies abroad. He wrote to the governor and that’s how the discussion came to the forefront, sources said. “In some universities abroad, while scrutinising documents for admission, in the absence of degree certificates, they ask for additional documents from students to be certified by RGUHS, which we regularly do,” RGUHS sources said. If the amendment is brought, it will help many students, say officers. “Soon after results, we provide provisional degree certificates. The gap between issuing provisional and final degree certificates is 7-8 months depending on when the convocation is held. The amendment would help doctors taking up higher studies abroad,” said Dr Jayakara SM, in-charge vice chancellor, RGUHS. He said that at a recent meeting, higher officials discussed possible options to provide degree certificates to those who need it soon after results are announced. “At present too, the Act gives us an option to conduct a mini-convocation in case of emergencies. But that has not happened so far. We are mulling taking up an option employed in Delhi University, wherein based on the affidavit filed by the candidate, the degree certificate is issued prior to the convocation. We’re looking into the Delhi University model,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/degree-certs-before-convocation-if-needed/articleshow/88328804.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Primary and secondary education minister BC Nagesh informed the assembly on Thursday that the state has decided to implement NEP for pre-primary and primary students at least in a few schools or areas on an experimental basis. He was replying to a question by Congress MLA Mahantesh Koujalagi, who raised concerns about huge vacancies in teaching staff in government schools. “The government needs more teachers if it wants to implement NEP. But there are more than 51,000 vacancies in government schools. How is it going to address this problem,” he asked. Nagesh said the government is already in the process of recruiting 18,000 primary and 5,078 high school teachers on temporary basis. Also, 15,000 permanent teachers will be recruited soon. “There won’t be any shortage of teachers by the time we implement NEP. Moreover, the prescribed teacher and student ratio of 30:1 in the new policy is already being maintained in the state,” he added. He said the government is mulling availing the services of anganwadi teachers to teach pre-primary students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-roll-out-nep-for-nursery-primary-kids/articleshow/88328805.cms||---

Seeking two weeks, the government advocate told the court that requisition for grant of sanction under section 19 of PC Act, submitted by ACB, was forwarded to the home minister by the home secretary, as the officer was a group A officer and under the rules, nod of the minister is necessary. An application seeking exemption from appearance vis-a-vis the home secretary was also filed by the state government, citing that he is away from the city and the same was allowed by the court. The case was adjourned to February 1, 2022 for further consideration. On an earlier occasion, the court had directed the state government to do the needful within 30 days regarding the requisition sent by ACB seeking permission to prosecute four officers in the case. ACB counsel told the court that after preparing the final report in mid-July, a requisition for sanction to proceed against the officers was forwarded to the government and nod was not given and clarifications were sought. Sasikala, a close associate of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, was convicted in a multi-crore disproportionate assets case and served a four-year term at the Bengaluru prison.

With the sky clearing out over the city, days ahead are going to be mostly sunny and the maximum temperature is likely to increase. A scientific officer from IMD said, “Winter always sets in once rain stops. If the sky is cloudy, the radiation doesn’t escape, leaving surface temperature warm. Hence, it is important for the sky to clear out for the mercury to dip.” The easterly winds that bring moisture along with them have completely stopped and there is a change in weather pattern. North, northeasterly winds are blowing into the state and they are dry in nature. Hence, dry weather is likely to prevail over the state. On Thursday, Bidar recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.6 degrees Celsius in the state. “Minimum temperature will dip gradually, while there may be no significant difference in the maximum or day temperature,” the officer added. Fog or mist is likely to increase across the city during the wee hours. On Thursday, visibility dropped to 50 metres due to thick fog at Kempegowda International Airport. “Fog and mist are going to be there till March, sometimes there may be a thick for cover and sometimes it might be very little,” the officer explained.

Indians faced a total of 86.6 million data breaches, according to a study by VPN services company Surfshark. The affected accounts showed an increase of 356% from last year’s 19 million. The top five countries with the largest number of data breaches (US, Iran, India, Russia and France) account for more than half of all leaks this year. In the first 11 months of the year, 953 million accounts were breached, meaning that 1 out of every 5 people were affected globally. This was marginally higher than the 922 million breaches recorded during the same period of the previous year with a 3.4% growth, or 31 million, year-over-year. Some of the biggest data breaches this year included COMB, Clubhouse, Facebook and Raychat. The report suggested that more than 150 million Iranian accounts were compromised during the 2021 Raychat.io breach. The breach pushed Iran to the second rank because the Raychat app is one of the most popular messaging platforms in that country. Bleeping Computer had reported that Domino’s India disclosed a data breach after a threat actor hacked the systems and tried to sell stolen data on a hacking forum. It said in April that the threat actor created a new topic on the hacking forum, claiming to have 13TB of stolen data for sale, including details for 18 crore (180 million) orders and 1 million credit cards from Domino’s India. Earlier this year, SITA, which provides IT and telecommunication services to the air transport industry, alerted Air India that the latter had suffered a cyberattack. That was in relation to a potential data breach linked to SITA’s systems containing credit card data, ticketing data, revenue integrity data and frequent flyer data processed by SITA on behalf of Air India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-3rd-in-data-breaches-till-nov/articleshow/88328816.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Indian invt in pvt markets soaring||Bengaluru: Over 40% of family offices have doubled their allocation to private markets in the past five years and the interest of larger cheque writers to have a direct participation in a startup’s cap table is increasing, showed Trica’s Private Monitor Report. Nimesh Kampani is the co-founder and CEO of Trica, a LetsVenture company.Respondents said their private market portfolio comprised 47% direct startup investments, 32% exposure to PE/VC funds, and 11% to venture debt funds. The report said that private market investments remain the alternative investment of choice with allocations to startups and VC funds comprising 18% of the overall pie. This is quite aggressive when compared to a 15% allocation to other alternatives (real estate, infrastructure, art), 20% allocated to fixed income, and 36% to listed equities. “With IPOs coming in, exit visibility is much clearer than what it used to be. If you look at the fund raise, of this year's $30 billion, 90% is coming from foreign money and this trend will change going forward. Indian VCs have raised record money this year, almost Rs 25,000 crore, plus the direct investments made by family offices. It's a very good signal for the Indian economy,” said Kampani. The first edition of the report has been brought out by Trica in partnership with AZB & Partners and EY.33 of India’s 71 unicorns were created this year as of October and reports have pegged India as having 150 unicorns by 2025. The report said 50% of family offices surveyed preferred the seed to Series A stage to enter a startup investment, 40% preferred late to pre-IPO transactions. “A large portion of India’s family offices and UHNIs have been late to participate in the startup boom. The cap tables of present Indian unicorns are dominated by global VC and PE funds and this has meant lower exposure of family offices to tech startups that are in the IPO pipeline,” the report said.But digital platforms are now making it easier for founders of large companies to run more frequent liquidity transactions in a simple and scalable manner. In fact, 39% respondents preferred secondary opportunities versus 46% who prefer primaries and 15% who actively explore convertibles.Fintech and enterprise tech were the top two sectors of choice by a clear majority. For fintech, a massive opportunity has been opened by Aadhaar, UPI and the account aggregator framework and India has seen the fastest pace of unicorn creation in this space. Enterprise tech is riding the wave created by the large number of Indian software product companies that have successfully gone global - the recently Nasdaq listed Freshworks being the poster boy of Indian SaaS. "A surprise was seeing muted conviction for the consumer tech space and this preference being at par with frontier tech opportunities," the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indian-invt-in-pvt-markets-soaring/articleshow/88328823.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

---||Chennai||Rare idol of Vinayaki discovered near Chennai||Chennai: A 5th century stone sculpture of Vinayaki, (female form of Lord Ganesha), from the pre-Pallava period, has been discovered by a team of Archeological Survey of India (ASI) officials at a village in Chengalpet district, about 100 km south of Chennai. The three-ft-tall sculpture on a granite stone is a rare antique piece comprising details of the donor inscribed in early Tamil script. While Vinayaka (Lord Ganesha) is worshiped widely in Tamil Nadu, there are very few idols of Goddess Vinayaki with a trunk. Interestingly, another sculpture with identical inscriptions and similar seating position was unearthed a kilometre from the first sculpture in the village called Irumbedu near Cheyyur by the three-member ASI team. However, examination is still on to identify the second sculpture, which villagers say is Goddess Gangai Amman. Both sculptures are being worshiped by the residents in open spaces that are not part of any temple. The inscription had three identical sentences 'Jeyam Patta Muthiravarigan Madavati’. The archaeologists have interpreted them as saying that an individual named ‘Madavati’ donated them as a mark of victory. “The inscriptions are early Tamil scripts that can be traced to about 1,500 years ago. Vinayaki, the female form of Lord Ganesha, is largely worshiped in North India and is very rare in the south, particularly in Tamil Nadu,” assistant epigraphist P T Nagarajan, who was part of the ASI team, told TOI. The other members are assistant archaeologists Dr. R Ramesh and M Prasanna. Ramesh said that the locals worship the sculpture as ‘Vinayagar’ (Lord Ganesha). The team had visited the village, following an alert from residents over the unique sculptures with inscriptions. The discovery will soon be published in the annual report on the Indian Epigraphy of ASI, the team added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rare-idol-of-vinayaki-discovered-near-chennai/articleshow/88328829.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Chennai||As app-based auto rides get costlier, bike taxis in demand||Chennai: With app-based auto rides getting expensive in Chennai from next month, demand for bike taxis is likely to shoot up. Experts said the state government has been largely unsuccessful in regulating auto rickshaw fares in the city. The transport department in 2013 announced that GPS-based fare metres will be made mandatory for auto-rickshaws here. Apart from trial runs, not much progress has been made in this aspect. When cab-aggregators Ola and Uber introduced auto booking services in 2016, there was some form of transparency in fares. But now the estimated base fare will rise because the Union government has introduced a five percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) for auto rides booked through mobile apps. The new regime is expected to come into effect from January 1. Cab-aggregators like Uber have requested the Centre to repeal this announcement as it might affect the earnings of the auto drivers and the government's digitisation attempts. Transportation activists have termed the move “regressive”. Rama Rao from the Traffic and Transportation Forum, Chennai said, "The move to impose five percent GST will greatly affect the office-goers and middle class section of the commuters as cab-aggregators will definitely pass on the financial burden onto the public". Auto drivers in the city were among the worst-affected during the pandemic. This move will cause more financial problems to them, he said. Experts predict that more people might opt for bike taxis instead. They are at least 30% cheaper compared to autos. Currently, there are more than 6,000 bike taxis. It was less than 500 during the launch two years ago. The state is yet to clear legalities associated with bike taxis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/as-app-based-auto-rides-get-costlier-bike-taxis-in-demand/articleshow/88328830.cms||Ram Sundaram

They serve as ‘shock absorbers’ to protected areas like important parks and sanctuaries. Unless states make some specific changes, usually the buffer space covers a radius of 10km.During the previous AIADMK regime, wildlife authorities sent a proposal to the government to reduce the sanctuary area from a radius of 5km to 3km, said a senior wildlife official. Activists protested alleging that the move was being done to facilitate some industries functioning in the sanctuary’s vicinity. However, the AIADMK government did not notify this reduction while in power. The DMK government has decided to scrap the earlier proposal once and for all, said the official. Only a few years ago, the sanctuary boundary was redrawn to the present 5km radius, said a forest official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/proposal-to-reduce-vedanthangal-limits-nixed/articleshow/88328837.cms||---

In a statement, the former CM pointed to the rise in the prices of fish and the demands of the fishermen associations to increase diesel subsidies.  “The cost of construction per square foot increased to 2,100 from 1,800 and there is an unprecedented shortage of construction material. A bag of cement costs 480 and per cubic feet of M-Sand is sold at 80, and substantial rise in prices of blue metal and steel rod,” OPS said.  M-sand and sand lorry owner associations have announced demonstration on December 27 and indefinite strike from January 27 to stop illegal operation of 4,000 quarries and crushers and sale of aggregates. The state should convene a meeting of office-bearers of the federation and check the malpractices, Panneerselvam said. Recalling the CM's statement that his work would not only make those who voted for the DMK happy but also those who did not vote for the party, OPS said those who voted for the DMK are getting upset for not having voted for the AIADMK. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/price-rise-those-who-voted-for-dmk-upset-now-says-ops/articleshow/88328843.cms||---

The existing rate of interest ranging from 9.5% to 12.65% results in payment of 7,000 crore interest annually, and a cut in interest rate would mean savings of 1,400 crore annually, sources said.In a memorandum submitted to Union power minister R K Singh, a copy of which is available with TOI, Tamil Nadu electricity minister V Senthil Balaji said Tangedco’s activities were capital intensive and interest cost accounted for a major portion of its revenue expenditure. At least 80% of the capital expenditure of Tangedco is met by these financial institutions. “Tangedco, like other utilities, has suffered huge revenue loss due to the outbreak of Covid pandemic. Despite the stringent (strained) cash flow, Tangedco is clearing its outstanding loan and interest promptly without any default,” Balaji said, while demanding that the Centre consider withdrawing Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and allow state-owned distribution licensees to continue to supply quality power at affordable rates. Senior officials in the state government said the Union government has responded positively to consider the demands made by the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-urges-centre-to-cut-interest-on-tangedco-loans/articleshow/88328846.cms||Julie Mariappan

Saint Gobain’s plaster boards, construction chemicals that are used as additives in ready mix concrete, fasad, insulators and ceilings are witnessing strong demand from the construction sector. “With 46% of the population in top 7 cities spending more than Rs 90 lakh on their homes, the need is to offer solutions rather than sell products,” B Santhanam, CEO of Saint Gobain, Asia-Pacific said. Saint Gobain operates in two broad businesses, viz., construction materials and second abrasives, ceramics, refractories. While globally the construction materials contribute to 85% of revenues and the remaining from the other business. “In India 70% comes from construction materials. This is growing at a fast pace,” he added. Towards achieving the target, the French major’s Indian arm is getting aggressive on the B2C segment. It acquired a strategic stake in LivSpace, a home interior and renovation company, which will push its products to customers. “There are many acquisitions that we are working on. The focus is clear,” he added. As part of its sustainable initiatives in the materials space, Saint Gobain has signed up with two companies, one each in Delhi and Chennai. “Our focus is to build products that are fully recyclable. We will never launch anything which cannot be fully recycled. We want to create a circular economy and towards this we are looking for companies and agencies who will help in recycling construction debris. He said it was a taboo to think that ecologically sensitive construction materials were expensive. “It isn’t, the cost equation remains the same. And shaping the ecosystem will be at the heart of what we do,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/saint-gobain-wants-to-triple-revenues-in-10-yrs/articleshow/88328848.cms||---

Gospel For Asia (GFA) and Gospel For Asia World (GFA World) have been at the receiving end of lawsuits in US and Canada over alleged fraud and misuse of funds. In 2017, FCRA registration of Gospel For Asia’s Indian arm and affiliates like Believers Church etc was scapped over alleged FCRA violations. While Holy Spirit Ministries received over Rs 49 crore worth of foreign contributions between 2017-18 and 2019-20, New Hope Foundation’s receipts from foreign sources over the same period totalled more than Rs 42 crore, a study of their FCRA returns shows. The main foreign donors of Holy Spirit Ministries include US-based Unconditional Love, Canada-based GFA World and South Africa-based GFA. New Hope Foundation’s foreign funds between 2017-18 and 2019-20 came from US-based donor In His Steps, GFA World, GFA arm based in Finland, Road to Peace and Grace in Action, the latter two based in the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/registration-of-two-christian-ngos-cancelled-over-fcra-violations/articleshow/88328861.cms||Bharti Jain
---||India||HC stays ban on cross-gender massages in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday stayed the prohibition on cross-gender massage services in the city, saying there was no "reasonable connection" between the ban and preventing trafficking or prostitution at spas. "I am of the prima facie view that this kind of absolute ban on cross-gender massage can't be said to have any reasonable connection with the aim of the policy, which is to regulate the functioning of spas and ensure no illegal trafficking or prostitution takes place in the city," Justice Rekha Palli noted. The high court said though the authorities ought to regulate spa centres to check illegal activities, the policy to impose a ban was framed without any consultation with professionals involved in spa services. Noting that only 400 out of 5,000 spas have valid licences, the high court directed Delhi Police and municipal corporations to carry out an inspection in their areas within one week and take appropriate steps to close all unlicensed spas. In case any illegality is found during the inspection, the police will register cases and immediately pass the information to the municipal bodies for action, the HC said. The court was hearing a batch of petitions by owners of some spa centres and therapists challenging the Delhi government's move to ban cross-gender massages and the consequent directions passed by the municipal corporations. Meanwhile, Delhi government and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) defended the policy, saying such a ban was meant to protect women and children from the menace of prostitution at the spa centres. DCW told the court it conducted extensive inspections, an independent inquiry and also interacted with young girls and women engaged in the trade and found that the provision under which spa centres permitted cross-gender massage was being grossly misused. However, the high court said that a ban can't be imposed suddenly without any consultation when petitioners have valid licences and added that it is also aware of the fact that the pandemic has affected their livelihoods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-stays-ban-on-cross-gender-massages-in-delhi/articleshow/88328890.cms||---

Byju’s offers online education and caters to all age groups. It has benefited by a boom in online education as schools and in-person classes were forced shut by the pandemic. At $21 billion, it is the country’s most-valued startup.Discussions with Churchill Capital’s special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) about the deal, that could happen in mid-2022, are in advanced stages with plans to raise around $4 billion, the source added.While the negotiations are not final, Byju’s will also consider a dual listing and if the deal does not come through, the company could seek a listing in India next year, the source said.Indian startups have been on a tear in 2021, with several of them entering the unicorn club of $1 billion valuation, while high-profile names such as Paytm, Zomato and Nykaa have made their public market debuts via huge IPOs.In the US, several companies have used the SPAC route to go public. SPACs are publicly listed investment vehicles that have no operations and are raised with the intention of merging with a private company.Earlier this year, top startups like Swiggy and Byju’s wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to expedite a policy that allowed Indian firms to list directly on foreign exchanges.Byju’s, which also provides learning programmes for competitive exams like IAS, has 50 million registered students and 3.5 million paid subscriptions, according to its website.Byju’s declined to comment, while Churchill Capital did not immediately respond.

However, chairman Chandrashekar Shetty and member Ganesh Kini cannot vote in the committee meetings, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi observed while admitting a writ appeal filed by them. Earlier, Gopal Krishna and three other members of the management committee had challenged Shetty’s election as chairman. They claimed Shetty and Kini were no longer members of the committee following their resignation on March 24 and April 15, respectively, and hence they could not have participated in the meeting held on April 26 and Shetty could not have been elected chairman. Last month, a single-judge bench upheld their plea and held the election as invalid. In their writ appeal before the division bench, Shetty and Kini claimed they had withdrawn their resignations before they were accepted. They said they had resigned as they were disillusioned with the non-conduct of management committee meetings and this was reflected in their communication.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hc-relief-for-two-temple-committee-members/articleshow/88328801.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Woman ends life after lover concocts his suicide story with friend’s help||BENGALURU: A 30-year-old man concocted a story of attempting suicide in an effort to convince his girlfriend’s parents to agree to their relationship. But the plot went awry as the 24-year-old woman was falsely informed about his death, following which she hanged herself from the ceiling of her residence on Wednesday. Sakamma, who is from Channarayapatna in Hassan district and worked in a supermarket in Yeshwantpur, hanged herself with a sari at her residence in Muneshwara Layout, near Doddabidarakallu, north Bengaluru, on Wednesday afternoon. According to Peenya police, Sakamma was in love with her colleague Arun. After a two-year courtship, they informed elders about their love affair and sought permission to get married. Both families opposed the idea. Arun recently managed to convince his parents to agree to his relationship, but couldn’t get Sakamma’s family to come around. So, he hatched a plan to get her family members to agree to their marriage. Friend pretends to be copActing on Arun’s instructions, his friend Gopal called Prajwal, Sakamma’s brother-in-law, over phone and introduced himself as a policeman from Basaveshwaranagar. Gopal informed Prajwal that Arun had attempted to kill himself and was in hospital. He asked Prajwal to arrange Arun and Sakamma’s marriage and threatened them with a criminal case if they failed to do so. Gopal even asked Prajwal to bring Sakamma to the police station. Prajwal informed Sakamma’s mother Lakshmamma about the development. She asked him to bring her daughter to Channarayapatna and not take her to the police station. Prajwal called Sakamma and informed her that Arun had committed suicide and asked her to get ready to go to Channarayapatna. Believing Arun was actually dead, Sakamma took the extreme step. “I was pained by the opposition of both our families to my marriage with Arun. I can’t live without him,” she wrote in a suicide note. Lakshmamma alleged that the fake call arranged by Arun and made by Gopal was the main reason behind her daughter’s death. She has filed a complaint against them. Peenya police have registered a case of abetment to suicide under IPC section 306 and arrested Arun and Gopal. Further probe is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-ends-life-after-lover-concocts-his-suicide-story-with-friends-help/articleshow/88328798.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: Three held for running fake firm under Microsoft banner||CHENNAI: A city firm that had been functioning illegally under the Microsoft banner for eight years was busted by the CB-CID’s cyber crime wing unit on Thursday. Three directors of iTrope Technologies in Ambattur were arrested and a hunt was launched for two others. The arrested __Vivek, Mohammad Umar, and Rajesh Philomin who studied computer technology together__ floated the company in 2013 and became board of directors. They expanded operations to Australia under a different name. In 2019, the Australian branch was raided and closed down. Despite this, the trio continued to operate in Ambattur. Thursday’s raid led by SP Rohit Nathan found there were about 100 employees working round-the-clock and receiving salaries in cash. Explaining the modus operandi, a CB-CID officer said the company floated an ad on Google, offering Microsoft services. The advertisement also displayed toll-free numbers customers could reach. Those who approached the company were made to believe it was associated with Microsoft. They were convinced to install applications that would allow the firm access to their personal computers. By gaining such access, the company often cooked up fake technical issues, resolved them and collected money for the services rendered. Based on a complaint from Microsoft India Private Limited, the firm was searched for about eight hours. Several incriminating documents and material were seized. The arrested will be remanded on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/3-held-for-running-fake-firm-under-microsoft-banner/articleshow/88328905.cms||---
---||Dehradun||BJP govt ignoring role of Indira Gandhi in 1971 War: Rahul||Dehradun: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the BJP government of ignoring the contribution of his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi in securing victory against Pakistan in the 1971 war, as India celebrates the 50th anniversary of the victory as Vijay Diwas. Launching Congress’s poll campaign from the Parade ground in Uttarakhand, he said, "Today, a function was held in Delhi to mark 50 years of India's victory in the 1971 war against Pakistan. There was no mention of Indira Gandhi. The contribution of the woman who took 32 bullets for the country was completely sidelined as this government is afraid of the truth. This reflects their fear." Addressing a huge gathering, he tried to strike an emotional note with them, saying he shared a "close bond" with the state. “Like the sons of Uttarakhand who gave the supreme sacrifice, my father and grandmother also laid down their lives for the country. I understand and share the pain of their kin. This is my connection with the people of the state," he said. His rally in Doon was named "Vijay Samman rally", and he honoured ex-servicemen who had fought on behalf of the country in the 1971 war. He also met family members of those who died in the battlefield. He met kin of Major Chitresh Bisht from Dehradun, who sacrificed his life while defusing an improvised explosive device.  The swastina mantra, a peace chant, was recited by purohits and a two-minute silence was observed in memory of defence personnel, including the country's first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat. A huge cut out of General Rawat was put on the Parade ground. Stressing on the importance of staying united, Rahul said, "Pakistan was defeated within 13 days, and it was possible only because of the unity shown by the entire country. It was a win for each and every individual of the country. This shows that no one can defeat us if we remain united.” The BJP government was focused on "dividing the nation" and "making a brother fight against another brother," said Rahul, and accused the ruling government of "wasting financial resources by buying planes and tanks in a bid to win wars." He said unity was the answer to many of the country's problems. Gandhi also touched upon the local problems, saying unemployment and inflation were among top issues faced by people of the hill state. “While international rates of petrol and diesel are falling, India has a very high rate of tax on petrol. When you pay steep prices for petrol, the money goes into the pocket of a handful of industrialists, who are doing marketing for PM Modi,” he said. Gandhi also accused the government of "ruining" the business of job providers such as small industries and traders. Talking about farmers' protests, he said, "It is unfortunate that the BJP government is unwilling to give compensation to farmers who died during the protest. While the PM apologised for farm laws, the government did not maintain data of those who died. I presented a list of 400 farmers of Punjab and 70 from Haryana in Parliament.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-govt-ignoring-role-of-indira-gandhi-in-1971-war-rahul/articleshow/88325341.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Kolkata||On Vijay Diwas, B’desh starts visa centre at Sec V||Kolkata: On Vijay Divas, as Bangladesh celebrated the golden jubilee of its independence, 50 years of Indo-Bangla friendship and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahaman’s birth centenary, the Bangladesh government inaugurated a new visa application centre in Sector V which will be operational from December 20. However, right now, Bangladesh is not issuing tourist visas due to the pandemic. Bangladesh foreign minister A K Abdul Momen inaugurated the new visa application centre virtually from Dhaka and said that it is aimed at providing better services to the visa seekers from India. He added that the maximum number of visa seekers to Bangladesh are from Kolkata, and the new visa application centre was planned keeping them in mind. The centre, which is going to have a help desk and Wi-Fi facilities, is spread across 13,000sqft. So far, visas to Bangladesh had been processed from the Bangladesh deputy high commission’s office. However, for the procedure at the new centre, there will be a visa processing fee since the processing is being outsourced. India, too, charges for outsourcing visa processing. The deputy high commissioner of Bangladesh, Toufique Hasan, said the new visa centre will receive applications from 9am to 3pm on working days. Meanwhile, at a programme at the Bangladesh deputy high commission (BDHC) complex, speaker of state assembly Biman Banerjee said the Teesta issue is a long-standing one and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is engaging in a dialogue with Delhi so that it turns into a win-win situation for Bengal. He said he often gets requests from Bangladesh for resolving the Teesta issue, and, in lieu of it, Bangladesh will send Hilsa. Banerjee praised the role of Bangladesh in providing shelter to the Rohingyas from Myanmar amid a global economic crisis and said that when India had accepted millions of Bangaldeshi refugees, at that time too, the economic condition of India was not good. But India still showed an example of brotherhood and that friendship is continuing. Earlier in the day an the BDHC complex, the Bangladeshi national flag was hoisted and floral tribute was paid to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and martyrs of the Liberation War.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-vijay-diwas-bdesh-starts-visa-centre-at-sec-v/articleshow/88326891.cms||---

The ED also made prayers in the chargesheet that orders be issued for confiscation of Dadan’s immovable and movable assets worth Rs 67.99 lakh which had been allegedly amassed from proceeds of crime by laundering money. The assets of Dadan which have already been attached by ED are seven plots in Usha’s name in Dumraon worth around Rs 14.11 lakh, four plots in Kartar’s name at Dumraon and Baliya in Uttar Pradesh worth Rs 5.15 lakh, five vehicles in Dadan’s name worth Rs 27.88 lakh and one in Usha’s name worth Rs 2.66 lakh, two SUVs in Kartar’s name worth Rs 17.97 lakh and Rs 21,903 in bank account of the couple.

He added it was for the first time that electronic voting machines (EVMs) were used during the elections to the panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) in the state. “Besides, a software was developed and end-to-end digitization of the entire election process was done for holding free and fair elections with complete transparency and by removing any scope for bogus voting, rigging and poll violence,” he said. “The net outcome of it was that 90-95% of the elected mukhiyas, panchayat samiti, zila parishad and even ward members of villages are all new faces,” Prasad said, adding that 100% new faces were elected in around 15 panchayats of the Ghosbari block of Patna district near Mokama. “As per the feedback we are getting from the fields, a major chunk of the newly elected members is in the age-group of 21 to 30 years. They are also from diverse backgrounds, like MBA degree holders, MGNREGA workers and even physically challenged persons. Women voters outnumbered the male folks at the booths on the polling day,” Prasad also said. In fact, state election commissioner of Puducherry, Roy P Thomas, who accompanied Prasad, said he has been in Bihar for six days and was overwhelmed by the Bihar Model of rural election. “I never expected it. I must tell you that it adds to the glory of Bihar,” Thomas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pris-to-start-functioning-by-end-of-this-mth-sec/articleshow/88326216.cms||Abhay Singh

The court sentenced the convict to rigorous sentence apart from Rs 10,000 penalty. If he fails to deposit the penalty then his sentence would be extended by another six months. He has also been convicted for seven years for causing disappearance of the evidence and Rs 5,000 penalty. All the sentences will run parallelly. According to case details, the 40-year-old victim had gone missing on November 8, 2018 after she went out to graze her goats in the afternoon. By evening, the goats returned home but the woman didn’t come back. Following this, her husband accompanied by locals went in search of her when her body was found on the outskirts of Methi village on November 9. The police had then filed a case of rape and murder at Karjan police station and investigations led them to Vasava who works as a casual labourer. The police said that Vasava attacked the woman at an isolated spot and first strangulated her leading her to lose consciousness. The accused then dragged the victim to a nearby field and raped her. After the act, the accused then picked her up and took her to another spot next to the field of a local villager, Raju Patel, where he again raped her. This time he bludgeoned the woman with a stone on the head and face killing her instantly. Accused later picked the body and dumped it at a isolated spot nearby. He covered her body with the sari that she had been wearing. Looking at the barbarity of the heinous crime, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/life-term-for-man-who-raped-murdered-woman/articleshow/88326416.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar passed the order while hearing a batch of PILs on pandemic situation in the state. It got irked after observing that a counter affidavit signed by health department additional chief secretary (ACS) Pratyaya Amrit had incorrect information about health infrastructure like sanctioned posts and available number of doctors, beds in government health centres and hospitals. In some districts, sanctioned and available count of doctors was shown as zero while no information regarding demand and supply of oxygen was mentioned in the affidavit. The court came down heavily on the ACS and lawyers representing the state government. The incorrect and contradictory information were highlighted by amicus curiae Parul Prasad. The court has also asked the ACS to appear before it on Friday when the matter will be taken up for hearing through virtual mode. “It seems the affidavit is false,” the court orally observed. To this, additional advocate general Anjani Kumar sought permission to withdraw the affidavit. However, the court denied the permission since the affidavit was supplied from the office of advocate general. The AAG also submitted that State Health Society executive director may appear before the court as additional chief secretary was out of station, but the plea was outrightly rejected by the court. The bench simultaneously also directed ACS to file a fresh affidavit within next four working days, detailing the infrastructure available at the hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-summons-civil-surgeons-seeks-details-on-infrastructure-in-hospitals/articleshow/88325998.cms||Debashish Karmakar

During a meeting, which was attended by Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma, SP (rural) Vineet Kumar, SP (central) Ambareesh Rahul and others, Agrawal asked civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari and district immunization officer Dr S P Vinayak to ramp up testing and begin contact tracing of the infected patients. He also directed the other officials to constitute a team for verification of all the labs testing Covid samples in the district. The officials concerned told the divisional commissioner that people could get any Covid-related information by dialling 0612-2219080 or 2249964. They said a contact tracing cell had been activated and necessary action taken after getting in touch with the people who had been in contact with Covid positive patients. “The inoculation drive has been accelerated in Patna district as 65,79,305 people are vaccinated against Covid here. A 112-bed isolation centre has also started functioning at Patliputra Sports Complex and arrangements have been made for cryogenic oxygen tanks at the Patna Medical College and Hospital, Nalanda Medical College and Hospital and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences,” the officials claimed. Agrawal urged everyone to wear masks, stay alert and be careful. The district administration has been carrying out a mask-checking drive in Patna since December 13. A sum of Rs 49,950 has been collected as fine from the violators so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-officials-asked-to-ramp-up-covid-testing/articleshow/88326007.cms||Faryal Rumi

All hotels were also asked to prominently display toll-free numbers issued by the government for complaints related to violation of prohibition law. The toll-free numbers have also been displayed at several prominent places of the city. The government has made it clear that the identity of the complainants would be kept secret. Agrawal asked the DM and SSP to act tough against the complaints of home delivery of liquor. “Identify the people indulged in this illegal trade, earmark the places and carry out surprise raids to bring the culprits to book,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/take-no-liquor-declaration-from-guests-hotels-told/articleshow/88326056.cms||VK Tripathi

For instance, the annual average level of Delhi is 97ug/m3 and that of Agra 20% lower at 78ug/m3. But during early winter this year, the weekly average PM2.5 level in Agra was 282ug/m3 and exceeded by 5% that of Delhi’s 270. Track the pollution level in your city“This analysis has put a spotlight on the cities of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and NCR to understand the synchronised pattern of pollution during winter... This shows even smaller cities with lower annual average levels record pollution levels that are as bad or even worse than Delhi. This demands action at scale and speed across all key sectors of pollution in the larger region,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at CSE. While the entire north India is vulnerable to the pollution build-up, the overall annual average of NCR is among the highest in the region. This year, Ghaziabad has been the most polluted city in the region with the average as high as 110ug/m3 till November 30. Moradabad is the most polluted city outside NCR with the PM2.5 level at 96ug/m3. NCR cities also saw a two-fold rise in nitrogen dioxide. The long-term trend shows that average fire radiative power — the rate of emitted radiative energy by fire — in Punjab has been increasing since 2017 and this season’s average is the highest since monitoring started in 2012. “This, coupled with overall increase in fire count in Punjab, may have also contributed to the increased severity of smog this year,” states the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-smog-overstays-its-welcome-in-delhi-ncr/articleshow/88327639.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Police said the murdered woman, Shanti Devi, owned immovable property worth Rs 2 crore. The woman’s adopted son was identified as Amrendra Kumar. The charred bodies of the duo were found inside a room at their house around 8am. Villagers later dragged out Shanti’s niece Madhuri Devi (45) and her daughter Sudha Kumari (21), the prime suspects in the case, from their paternal home located near Shanti’s house and thrashed them. Shanti’s husband Lal Das and Madhuri’s father Lal Bahadur were brothers. Police rushed to the village after getting information and rescued the two women from being lynched. They were later arrested. Villagers said Madhuri had picked up a fight with Shanti on Wednesday evening. A villager raised an alarm after sensing foul smell emanating from Shanti’s house on Thursday morning. SHO of Naubatpur police station Samrat Deepak Kumar said Madhuri and Sudha were arrested. “Police are interrogating them. Madhuri’s two sons Sonu and Sunny and her husband Ravindra Kumar, a constable in Bihar police, are evading arrest,” he said, adding Sonu was last spotted at the village on Wednesday night. “Shanti owned 3-kattha land worth Rs 2 crore along Bihta-Sarmera road and Kanhauli. Madhuri was eyeing her property,” the SHO said. Kumar added Madhuri, who resides in Taregana, had come to her paternal home at Karnpura village two days back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/widow-adopted-son-burned-to-death-over-property-dispute/articleshow/88326171.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The Tirupur central police identified the victim as Deivanai, a native of Tirunelveli district. She is survived by a son and a daughter. Her husband had died 15 years ago. An investigation officer said Deivanai was residing in the rental house at KVR Nagar for more than a decade. “She was working in a banian company where she fell in love with a colleague. He was married and residing with his family.” Deivanai, the officer said, had often pestered her lover to marry her. “Hence, he started avoiding her. She then lodged a complaint with the Tirupur south all-woman police, seeking their intervention to unite her with the lover.” Police held talks with them and advised them not to fight. However, Deivanai was frustrated, as her demand was not fulfilled. “On Wednesday, she came out of her house, doused her with kerosene and set herself ablaze. She died on the spot,” the officer said. When alerted, the Tirupur central police sent the dead body to the government hospital for postmortem. Meanwhile, the CCTV footage of the woman setting her ablaze on the street went viral on social media. The Tirupur central police have registered a case under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and further investigation is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/jilted-lover-sets-herself-ablaze-in-tirupur-dist/articleshow/88326944.cms||---

The survivor, who is now 55 years old, conveyed to the court that she did not want to pursue the litigation as she was married to another man and is mother to grown-up children and did not want to endure legal proceedings any longer. She made this statement by way of a pursis (a written statement) and urged the court to close the case, which additional sessions judge D M Vyas recorded in his order. The court exonerated the accused of rape charges for want of evidence, on November 30 this year. According to the case details, a taxi driver from Mumbai had allegedly eloped with the woman from the Sarkhej area of Ahmedabad on June 30, 1980. A friend of the woman joined the couple on their journey to Mumbai. The friend returned to Ahmedabad on July 3 that year and the woman was traced by police on July 8. Through testimonies of four witnesses including the woman’s father, the court came to know that the taxi driver took both the women to Mumbai. A witness told the court that the driver had put up the woman at her house in Walkeshwar. The court observed that the woman had not been confined by the accused. Another witness told the court that he had solemnised the taxi driver's marriage on July 1, but he said he did not see the bride. He said the bride had stated that she was 20 years old. Since the Sarkhej woman central to the trial refused to testify, the court said that in the absence of direct or indirect evidence, the testimonies of other witnesses pale into insignificance. The court said that the wedding of the accused on July 1, 1980, had been established. But it was not proved that the accused had married the Sarkhej woman. The court said the evidence did not establish her abduction, marriage, or rape.

There was also a suggestion to field party bigwigs against the tall leaders of rival parties in the assembly elections for big fights. Sources said Jakhar said that if not the government, then the party could have remembered the achievement of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi under whose leadership the Army achieved a victory over Pakistan 50 years back. He added that many people had not liked his earlier tweet on Gandhi’s death anniversary, wherein he had said: “... I can understand BJP trying to erase ‘Iron Lady of India’ from history but don’t we still have a Congress Government in Punjab.” Sources said that towards the end of the meeting, party working president Kuljit Singh Nagra suggested that their tall leaders look beyond securing their own seats and take on the opposition party biggies. However, the suggestion did not get much endorsement from the panel members. “Nagra said everyone wants to become the chief minister or a minister but for that senior leaders should volunteer to take on the tougher fights as most of them also have the resources to manage a big contest. Channi retorted by saying that it seems that you want to contest against SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal,” said a party leader. The election committee also passed the customary resolution authorising AICC president Sonia Gandhi to take the final decision on ticket distribution and asked the panel members to give their suggestions. The third resolution was in support of Priyanka Gandhi for her efforts in Lakhimpur Kheri. Sources added that in the meeting, NSUI president Barinder Dhillon said Channi and Sidhu were accepted by everyone after the party leadership had appointed them. He also made a case for considering the members of frontal organisations. Sidhu has been appointed as chairman of the election committee while Channi is a member. Rana Gurmeet Sodhi stays away: Former minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi stayed away from the election committee meeting. When contacted, Sodhi said he could not attend as he had events scheduled in his constituency. It is believed that Sodhi has been unhappy at not being rehabilitated by the party leadership in an active role Ticket applications by Dec 20: The party has asked ticket aspirants to fill forms by December 20.

Bachol, a firebrand Hindutva leader, said he would send a letter in this regard to chief minister Nitish Kumar as well as DGP S K Singhal. “I received an anonymous phone call on Wednesday evening from an international number. The caller told me that I should stop talking about open namaz and opposing those who do not sing ‘Vande Mataram’. If I don’t, I will be killed,” he told TOI on Thursday. Bachol has been vocal on issues related to Hindutva and nationalism. Apart from demanding a ban on open namaz, he had sought a separate room on the premises of the Bihar legislative assembly for Hindu MLAs where they could recite the Hanuman Chalisa or read the Bhagavad Gita. This happened in September after the allotment of a room for offering namaz in the Jharkhand legislative assembly. The Bisfi MLA had also strongly criticised the MLAs of the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM, including their legislature party leader Akhtarul Iman, for not singing ‘Vande Mataram’ on the closing day of the recently-held winter session of the state assembly. He had called Iman “anti-national and communal” and his stance “seditious and influenced by Jihadi mindset”. Bachol said he would continue speaking on the issues of national interest. “I will not be intimidated. I will continue to raise my voice,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-mla-who-opposed-open-namaz-alleges-threat-to-life-lodges-complaint/articleshow/88326226.cms||Piyush Tripathi

A woman purchasing vegetables from a grocery store, a goat climbing up steps, a child playing with a tricycle in his house, a cow sleeping under a staircase and children playing together are some of the mural arts that Trespassers, a group of artists from of Kerala, have done on the walls. It is part of the Ukkadam ‘art district’ initiative that is being jointly implemented by St+art India Foundation, city corporation and Asian paints. The recent mural arts were created by Jinil Manikandan, Arjun Gopi, Pranav Prabhakar and Sijoy Paulose from Kerala. It took them 25 days to complete the work. The first four days were, however, spent on visiting the houses, interacting with the residents and getting to know their routine and things they most love in their houses. Jinil Manikandan, a 26-year-old artist from Chalakudi in Kerala, said they hadn’t had any preconceived ideas. “When we interacted with the people, they said it was fun for them to get confined in the houses during the lockdown, as it gave them more time to interact with neighbours and share light moments. We wanted our work to reflect how they spent their time in their tiny houses.” One of their artworks features local kid Aishwariya, who stood against her alcoholic father, trying to protect her sibling and mother. The left side wall on block 10 depicts her image. Apart from Trespassers, artists from various parts of the country are engaged in the project. S Akmal, assistant project manager, St+art India, said five walls were taken up this time and mural paintings on four of them were ready. Trivendra Krishna, a self-taught artist from Nainital, is doing the final wall. He is in the process of depicting Coimbatore as a place of migrants. Last year, four walls were taken up under the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mural-arts-add-charm-to-ukkadam-housing-unit/articleshow/88326954.cms||V Devanathan

This will ensure that the elderly who are afraid to step out due to Covid will get a feel of the celebrations closer to home. “The caravan will roll out at 8pm on December 21 and travel to different parishes. Leading the caravan will be an open-top double-decker bus with carol singers on the top deck. This will be followed by a motorcade for which 20 motorists and 17 bikers have already registered. Santa Claus will ride on an open-top SUV,” said Catholic Association of Bengal (CAB) president Angelina Mantosh Jasnani. The caravan will roll out from the CAB office at Middleton Row, travel through Park Street, cross AJC Bose Road at Mullick Bazar and then head towards EM Bypass. It will then turn into Kasba, pass by Acropolis Mall, head to Gariahat and Ballygunge en route to St Paul’s Cathedral after which it will return to Park Street. Some want the caravan to travel to Behala as well which has a large Christian population but that would mean an additional hour that could pose a problem given the night restrictions that are in place till December 23. The state government has announced lifting of curbs between December 24, 2021 and January 1, 2022. Transport minister and former mayor Firhad Hakim will flag off the caravan in the presence of MLAs Mala Roy and sDebashis Kumar among others. Father Dominic Gomes, vicar-general, Archdiocese of Calcutta, will do the opening hymn. “The first edition of the caravan was held last year but the tour of the city was a hurried one.

---||Ahmedabad||DRT can hear Essar Steel matter, HC tells Ruia||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition that sought its intervention to prohibit the Debts Recovery Tribunal from hearing a matter where secured creditors wanted to enforce the personal guarantee given by promoters of the Ruias-controlled Essar group for the erstwhile Essar Steel India Ltd. The court told the petitioner -- Prashant Ruia of Essar Group -- that DRT was the competent authority to hear the matter and it should be taken up there. The petitioner had argued that the issue of debt had been settled before the National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad where the corporate insolvency resolution process was initiated against the debt-laden Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd’s corporate resolution plan for the steel company was accepted by the committee of creditors led by State Bank of India (SBI), with the requisite majority, and approved by NCLT. The financial package offered by ArcelorMittal to the lender, including SBI, is to the tune of Rs 42,000 crore. “The tribunal will have to adjudicate and decide whether, with the assignment of debt by the secured creditor (SBI) to the resolution applicant (ArcelorMittal), all other liabilities and obligations of the writ applicants as guarantors stood discharged,” the court observed in its order. The secured creditor of Essar Steel had earlier approached DRT and sought enforcement of personal guarantee given by the corporate debtors. The Essar group promoters contested the move and challenged it in the high court, which referred them back to DRT on Thursday. “We leave it open to the applicant to file an appropriate application before the DRT for being impleaded as a party in the main proceedings. If such applications are filed, those should be decided in accordance with law on its own merits,” as per the court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drt-competent-authority-to-hear-essar-steel-matter-hc/articleshow/88326962.cms||---

Starting with the Center for Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (CBCS), the interview schedule for the vacant posts of assistant and associate professor in this center has been declared on the official website of the university. In the weeks to follow, varsity would be announcing the dates for holding interview against vacant teaching positions in other departments too. AU has around 550 vacancies of teachers. Sources informed TOI that AU administration has expedited the process, especially in view of the new variant of the coronavirus. “We are moving at a great pace with the process of the screening of the applications. If conditions remain favourable, we will keep holding the interviews as we get the dates of the visitor’s nominee and the members of the selection committee,” said AU’s public relation officer, Prof Jaya Kapoor. Moreover, sources inform that AU administration is trying to hold the selection committee in such a way that interviews of one big department can be clubbed with a relatively smaller department, so that time and resources could be managed in a more efficient way and the process is completed as soon as possible, following the norms laid down in view of pandemic. Interviews for the vacant teaching positions would be held at the camp office of the vice-chancellor located at the official residence of AU VC, at MNNIT campus. Interview will be held for assistant professor position from 8.30am and for associate professor from 10 am. AU authorities are conducting recruitment process for 596 vacant teaching positions on the campus, including that of assistant professor, associate professor and professor. Applications were received during October-November, this year. The teacher recruitment includes 356 posts of assistant professor in 47 subjects, 170 posts of associate professor in 40 subjects and 70 posts of professor in 36 subjects. Prior to holding of selection committee, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has raised objections on the issue of calling less numbers of candidates against the vacant positions. The student leaders have alleged that against three posts of assistant professor st CBCS, 15 candidates have been called and five candidates have been called against three posts of associate professor, which is against the decision taken in the executive council. However, those associated with the faculty recruitment on the campus has refuted the baseless allegations of the student leaders. They maintain that all the decisions, taken in the EC are followed in letter and spirit and the number of candidates, that have been called for interview, depends on the vacancy, roaster and suitable candidates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-to-begin-recruitment-of-teachers-from-dec-22/articleshow/88327629.cms||---

Several prominent Congress leaders, including MP Dr Amar Singh, Kamil Boparai, industry minister Gurkirat Singh Kotli, Kuljeet Singh Nagra and Lakhvir Singh Lakha were also present. Addressing the gathering, Navjot Singh Sidhu said, “Opposition parties do not have any agenda to develop Punjab, they are only making false promises and misguiding people. Every other day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is nothing more than a big fraud, announces something or the other, without even explaining how that promise will be fulfilled. Recently, he announced that he will construct a airport at Jalandhar, but he forgot that we have already completed Punjab’s biggest airport in Ludhiana’s Halwara. Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is working hard for the betterment of the state. In this direction, several steps like reducing power rates and demolishing the cable and sand mafia, have been taken. We want all round development of Punjab, and will make special efforts to save farmers and youth.” Meanwhile, hinting that Kamil Boparai (son of MP Dr Amar Singh) might be the party candidate from Raikot, Sidhu said, “Under the leadership of Dr Amar Singh, developmental projects worth Rs. 500 crores have been completed. I urge the people of Raikot that they should push for change, and for successful implementation of Punjab Model, youth should ensure victory of Kamil Boparai in upcoming Assembly elections.” Sidhu also used the occasion to praise transport minister Raja Warring and said that due to Warring’s efforts, Punjab Roadways has now turned into a profitable undertaking and is earning a daily profit of Rs. 1 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kejriwal-a-big-fraud-only-makes-false-promises-says-sidhu-at-raikot-rally/articleshow/88327631.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Victory for farmers and animal lovers, says MVA govt||Mumbai: The Supreme Court's decision to allow resumption of bullock cart races in Maharashtra on the basis of the amendments made by the state to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act has been welcomed by the state government as well as by political leaders cutting across party lines. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray called the decision a “victory” of the long fight fought by animal lovers. “Bullock cart race is a tradition and has been going on for a very long time. Preservation of indigenous cattle will get a boost with this decision,” said Thackeray, who also appealed to farmers to ensure that the rules laid down should be strictly followed. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Thursday, “With this decision, the ox farmers have won a long battle.” He added that NCP chief Sharad Pawar, other leaders and social activists had contested the ban vigorously. As per the amendments made in 2017, the state has made it mandatory to have the collector’s permission to organise races. The races have to be recorded and a copy made available to the collector’s office; in case of cruelty in the race, there is a provision of a penalty and also a jail term of upto three years. The Supreme Court had stayed bullock cart races in 2014 after animal rights activists approached the apex court citing cruelty and physical trauma caused o the animals during such races. The BJP-led Maharashtra government had in 2017 passed the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Maharashtra Amendment) Bill by amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1960) to allow the races to resume. However, it was stayed by the apex court. The three-party coalition Maha Vikas Aghadi government moved the court seeking an early hearing in the matter. Ramkrishna Takalkar, a representative of Akhil Bharatiya Bailgada Sharyat Sanghatna, said that the nod to hold the races makes it necessary to adhere to the rules and regulations made by the state government in 2017. “Since the Supreme Court has given conditional permission, we appeal to all the bullock cart owners to hold races by adhering to the rules and regulations.There were accusations against bullock cart owners that they mistreated the animals, but all these accusations were wrong. The fact is all the owners treat the bullocks as their own children,” Takalkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-victory-for-farmers-and-animal-lovers-says-mva-govt/articleshow/88327652.cms||---

While there is a toilet on platform number one of the terminal, passengers are hesitant to use the same, as it lacks cleanliness. Most of the people prefer to relieve themselves in open places outside the terminal. Passengers have demanded the city corporation to improve the cleanliness of the toilet and set up additional toilet facility to meet the growing demand. The e-toilets on the bus terminal premises have been dysfunctional for months together. They were in use only for a few months after the installation, passengers said. V Pavithran, a regular passenger, said he had used the toilet, which was unclean, only once. “However pressing the need to relieve myself, I won’t use the toilet at the bus terminal. I will wait to reach home or the destination that am I headed for. While adequate water is available at the toilet, cleanliness is compromised.” The toilet for disabled people is, meanwhile, always kept locked. Anti-social elements are using the facility for consuming liquor, say vendors at the terminal, the premises of which is filled with waste materials and garbage. Robin Benifer, district coordinator, Spinal Injured Persons Association, said while Gandhipuram bus terminal was the only bus terminal in the city to have separate toilet for the disabled people, the same was not being used. “Many disabled people hesitate to come out of their houses because of lack of ramp and toilet facilities for them.” When contacted, a corporation official said it was the public who damaged the e-toilets. “It was a pay and use facility. Users had to insert coins to use the toilet. They damaged it while trying to use the facility without inserting coins.” He said the cleanliness of the existing toilet would be improved soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/unclean-toilets-premises-at-gandhipuram-bus-terminal-continue-to-vex-passengers/articleshow/88326971.cms||V Devanathan
---||Allahabad||UP’s first plant to convert construction waste into bricks starts ops||Prayagraj: In a first, a manufacturing plant which makes tiles and bricks from the construction waste has been made functional in the Sangam City. Located at Baswar, this is first-of-its-kind manufacturing unit of the state, that uses debris and construction waste that lies unused on the roads and causes air pollution, to make bricks and tiles. Constructed at a cost of over Rs 5.5 crores, the plant has the capacity of handling 100 metric tonnes (MT) of construction waste per day. The plant is capable of recycling 50-100 MT of waste generated daily from the urban areas of the city. By recycling the debris, bricks, curb stones, tiles and slab covers, material to be used for road construction and interlocking would be manufactured. The C&D waste plant was inaugurated on Wednesday jointly by Mayor of the city Abhilasha Gupta Nandi, Divisional Commissioner Sanjay Goyal and Municipal Commissioner Ravi Ranjan. With the inauguration of the plant, Prayagraj has become the first municipal corporation of the state to start C&D waste plant manufacturing unit. Throwing light on the working of the plant, Municipal Commissioner Ravi Ranjan said debris from roads, buildings and other construction/demolition works often creates various environmental pollution related problems as well as issues such as clogging of drains and obstruction in the movement of roads. “This waste plant will prove to be an effective way of turning these waste materials into something so useful”, he added. The manufacturing unit has been constructed at a cost of Rs 5.63 crores of which an amount of Rs 4.13 crore was sanctioned from Smart City Project and Rs 1.5 crore from National Clean Air Programme. The purchase of bricks, curb stones, tiles and slab covers made from C&D Waste Plant will be done by the Municipal Corporation at a concessional rate. So far, about 15000 metric tonnes of construction and demolition waste has been collected from which recycling work is going on. Now that the plant has been made functional, all C&D waste generators like land owners, builders, contractors, government/private organisations will be able to dispose their waste at reasonable rates. The agency identified by the municipal corporation will also do the work of collection of debris from various sites in the city. On this occasion, Divisional Commissioner Sanjay Goyal appealed to all the residents of the district to get the debris generated from their homes disposed of at this Baswar plant. “A simple step by the denizens will make them more responsible and at the same time it will help keep Prayagraj clean and prevent various types of pollution arising out of debris,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ups-first-plant-to-convert-construction-waste-into-bricks-starts-ops/articleshow/88327644.cms||---

---||Mumbai||SC permits bullock cart races to restart in Maharashtra||NEW DELHI: Maharashtra will witness resumption of traditional rural bull-racing sport, popular as 'bailgada sharyat', 'chakkadi' and 'shankar path', as the Supreme Court on Wednesday said these traditional events should be permitted as Maharashtra, like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, has passed laws exempting these from the ambit of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar said the court cannot chart a different course for Maharashtra when two states, whose Assemblies have passed amendments exempting rural sports involving bulls and buffaloes from the ambit of the PCA Act. It lifted the Bombay High Court's stay on bull-racing events following the Supreme Court's 2014 judgment banning any sports involving racing of bulls and buffaloes saying when the validity of the amendments passed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were pending before a constitution bench of the apex court, Maharashtra's law giving similar exemption to its traditional rural sport could not be made to remain inoperative. It referred the Maharashtra legislation for scrutiny before the five-judge bench, where the TN and Karnataka legislations are pending adjudication. On May 7, 2014, the SC had banned the popular post-harvest Jallikattu or bullfights in Tamil Nadu and bullock-cart racing in Maharashtra, Punjab and other states, saying they violated provisions of the 50-year-old PCA Act. The SC had favoured grant of constitutional status to rights of animals like citizens. It said, “Parliament, it is expected, would elevate rights of animals to that of constitutional rights, as done by many of the countries around the world, so as to protect their dignity and honour.” Striking down the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009, the SC had ruled, “Bulls cannot be used as performing animals, either for the Jallikattu events or bullock-cart races in the state of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country.” Following the judgment, huge protests broke out in the two southern states for enactment of a law to step around the SC-imposed ban on traditional rural sport. Tamil Nadu took the lead and passed an amendment to the PCA Act on January 23, 2017 exempting jallikattu (bull-taming sport). Less than a month later, Karnataka Assembly followed suit and passed a similar amendment on February 13, 2017 exempting 'kambala' (traditional buffalo racing) and bullock cart racing sports from the ambit of PCA Act. Maharashtra Assembly was the last to take the same route and amended the PCA Act on April 6, 2017 to permit the bullock cart race. Many petitions were filed in the SC challenging the constitutional validity of the amendments by TN and Karnataka. The SC in February 2018 framed five issues and referred them to a constitution bench, where it is pending for over three years. On Thursday, the SC referred the Maharashtra amendment also to the five-judge bench, which would. test its validity alongside scrutiny of the TN and Karnataka laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sc-permits-bullock-cart-races-to-restart-in-maharashtra/articleshow/88327636.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On Thursday, uproarious scenes were witnessed in both Lok Sabha and UP assembly with opposition parties demanding the minister’s resignation even as Teni attended office. Referring to the SIT report on the Kheri incident, Tikait said, “When the investigation team has said what happened in Khiri was a planned act, why should the minister, who tried to save his son, continue in office.” He was referring to the violence that took place at Tikunia in Kheri on October 3, when four farmers and a journalist died while several were injured after three vehicles of the minister’s son’s convoy allegedly mowed down the protesting farmers. Commenting on PM Narendra Modi's speech in Gujarat urging farmers to opt for organic farming, the BKU leader said,’ Where is the market? If there is profit in natural farming, then the farmers will adopt it.” On stubble burning by farmers, Tikait said the government should introduce technology to tackle the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sack-mos-if-he-doesnt-resign-rakesh-tikait-tells-govt/articleshow/88326143.cms||Mohd Dilshad

A high-level team of the Election Commission (CI), comprising CEC Chandra and election commissioners Rajiv Kumar and Anup Chandra Pandey, was on a two-day visit to take stock of preparedness ahead of the state assembly elections. Chandra said the commission was examining the complaint. “Elections and governance are two different phenomena. Any official found not following the norms will not remain on the post, not for a single day,” he added. In its representation, SAD had also urged the EC to appoint a regular DGP on merit in the state and to deploy central forces at polling booths. It had also called for videography at all polling booths, besides urging the EC to issue directions to the state government to stop misleading and bogus advertisements at the cost of taxpayers money. After meeting the political parties, the commission reviewed overall poll preparedness with the district election officers-cum-deputy commissioners and districts and city police chiefs as also the chief electoral officer, state-level police nodal officer and the CAPF nodal officer. The commission also met with nodal officers of enforcement agencies. The poll panel discussed the administrative support, budget and election-related arrangements with the chief secretary, DGP, home secretary, secretary finance, secretary health and other senior officials of the state. The CEC stressed the commission had zero tolerance towards abuse of money power or government machinery. The district officers have been instructed to monitor expenditure sensitive constituencies and ensure comprehensive, coordinated actions. The enforcement agencies have been asked to step up their vigil to ensure that interstate and cross border movement of drugs, liquor and cash is effectively checked.

---||Dehradun||BJP govt ignoring role of Indira Gandhi in 1971 War: Rahul||Dehradun: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused the BJP government of ignoring the contribution of his grandmother and former PM Indira Gandhi in securing victory against Pakistan in the 1971 war, as India celebrates the 50th anniversary of the victory as Vijay Diwas. Launching Congress’s poll campaign from the Parade ground in Uttarakhand, he said, "Today, a function was held in Delhi to mark 50 years of India's victory in the 1971 war against Pakistan. There was no mention of Indira Gandhi. The contribution of the woman who took 32 bullets for the country was completely sidelined as this government is afraid of the truth. This reflects their fear." Addressing a huge gathering, he tried to strike an emotional note with them, saying he shared a "close bond" with the state. “Like the sons of Uttarakhand who gave the supreme sacrifice, my father and grandmother also laid down their lives for the country. I understand and share the pain of their kin. This is my connection with the people of the state," he said. His rally in Doon was named "Vijay Samman rally", and he honoured ex-servicemen who had fought on behalf of the country in the 1971 war. He also met family members of those who died in the battlefield. He met kin of Major Chitresh Bisht from Dehradun, who sacrificed his life while defusing an improvised explosive device. The swastina mantra, a peace chant, was recited by purohits and a two-minute silence was observed in memory of defence personnel, including the country's first chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat. A huge cut out of General Rawat was put on the Parade ground. Stressing on the importance of staying united, Rahul said, "Pakistan was defeated within 13 days, and it was possible only because of the unity shown by the entire country. It was a win for each and every individual of the country. This shows that no one can defeat us if we remain united.” The BJP government was focused on "dividing the nation" and "making a brother fight against another brother," said Rahul, and accused the ruling government of "wasting financial resources by buying planes and tanks in a bid to win wars." He said unity was the answer to many of the country's problems. Gandhi also touched upon the local problems, saying unemployment and inflation were among top issues faced by people of the hill state. “While international rates of petrol and diesel are falling, India has a very high rate of tax on petrol. When you pay steep prices for petrol, the money goes into the pocket of a handful of industrialists, who are doing marketing for PM Modi,” he said. Gandhi also accused the government of "ruining" the business of job providers such as small industries and traders. Talking about farmers' protests, he said, "It is unfortunate that the BJP government is unwilling to give compensation to farmers who died during the protest. While the PM apologised for farm laws, the government did not maintain data of those who died. I presented a list of 400 farmers of Punjab and 70 from Haryana in Parliament.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-govt-ignoring-role-of-indira-gandhi-in-1971-war-rahul/articleshow/88325370.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Jaipur||Barring poll victories, an uneventful 3rd year for Gehlot govt||Chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s third year in office remained largely an uneventful one except for the public spectacle of his one-upmanship against competitor Sachin Pilot. The ruling party’s victory in four of the five assembly bypolls and successes in municipal and panchayat bodies’ elections could be considered a highlight of the year. The state government made a couple of public welfare moves like launching the Chiranjeevi insurance scheme or organising government camps to address people’s problems in rural and urban areas, but for larger part of the year the chief minister’s attention was focused on fighting off the demand for a cabinet rejig to keep his flock of MLAs together. Until September, Gehlot confined himself to the chief minister’s residence citing Covid and personal health. The governance was limited to review meetings, while the opposition targeted the Congress government for lack of law and order, especially women security, in the state. Unemployment and corruption in recruitment exams disillusioned the youth. Farmers protested for irrigation water and fertilisers in the agrarian belts. Policies for contractual workers and for transfer of government employees continued to be promises. The Centre was targeted over skyrocketing inflation but Rajasthan still had highest power tariffs and fuel prices because of local taxes. Gehlot, nonetheless, appeared confident that the Congress government would get repeated in 2023 and he would be the chief minister for the fourth time. The septuagenarian foretold about him remaining active in politics for the next 15-20 years even if it made “some people” unhappy. Pilot (44), his bete noire, missed no time in declaring that people do not stay in offices forever and he too was not going anywhere for the next 50 years. People got entertainment in full amount but development in bits. Political happenings in other Congress-ruled states forced Gehlot to finally go for a cabinet rejig and accommodate his critics in the government. As expected, the cabinet reshuffle and expansion in November last week left a lot of heart burns in his team that had stood up against the rebellion by Pilot in July-August 2020. The chief minister had to quickly undertake appeasement steps like appointing six MLAs as his advisors and cajoling the independents and BSP-turned-Congress legislators. As the third year of his government ends, chief minister Gehlot is yet to leave a mark of governance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/barring-poll-victories-an-uneventful-3rd-year-for-gehlot-govt/articleshow/88327660.cms||---

---||Delhi||Evolve strategy to maintain good AQI in Delhi-NCR round the year, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the statutory Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas to frame a long term strategy in two months to tackle the perennial air pollution menace in Delhi and NCR by inviting suggestions from all quarters and setting up an expert group to study the ideas for giving shape to a concrete action plan. A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana, D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant appeared satisfied with the steps taken by the Commission, as outlined by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, but insisted on a round-the-year dynamic strategy to tackle the AQI level often fluctuating towards severe level in the national capital and NCR. Mehta informed that the Commission would take a decision on resumption of construction activities on Friday even though it has already been permitted for hospital buildings. In its order, the three-judge bench led by the CJI said, “So far as construction activities are concerned, the Commission is going to take a decision on Friday. In view of that, we will list the matter for further hearing in the first week of February. Meanwhile, we direct the Commission to invite suggestions from the general public, scientists as well as experts about devising a permanent mechanism to solve the pollution problem in Delhi and adjoining areas.” “The suggestions so received will have to be considered by an expert group constituted by the Commission,” the bench said. The SG assured the court that the Commission would consider each and every suggestion received from all quarters. The Commission in its affidavit said that it has already permitted 24X7 resumption of milk and dairy processing units and pharmaceutical industries in NCR. “Industries related to paper and pulp processing, distilleries and captive thermal power plants shall be permitted to schedule their operations (without any restrictions on number of hours per day) only for five days per week, that is, from Monday to Friday and shall remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays,” it said. The SG said the Commission has spaced out the functioning of the industries in such a manner that they remain closed two days a week on rotation. Industries related to paddy/rice processing shall also be operating five days a week but remain closed on Mondays and Tuesday, he said. Similar five day a week operation was permitted for industries related to textiles, garments and apparels including dyeing processes, which will remain closed on Thursdays and Fridays. “Those Industries/Units which were closed on account of non-switching to PNG, have been given relaxation to operate for a restricted period of eight hours only from Monday to Friday and shall observe complete closure over the weekend,” Mehta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/evolve-strategy-to-maintain-good-aqi-round-the-year-sc/articleshow/88327661.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The state’s initiative for ‘Universal Health Coverage’ is a game changer in healthcare. Along with universal health coverage, the health department has taken initiatives to improve health infrastructure by creating more community health centres by introducing janta clinics. So far, 1.33crore families in the state have been registered under the Chiranjeevi Swasthya Bima Yojana. A health department official said, “The aim of the universal health coverage is to provide cashless treatment to all families of the state. Those families who do not fit in free premium categories have to pay just Rs 800 annually as premium to get coverage of Rs 5 lakh.” The health department is now encouraging people to get registered under the scheme, so that they can get cashless treatment at empanelled hospitals under the scheme. Under the scheme, 788 government and 590 private hospitals have been empanelled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1-3cr-families-have-health-insurance/articleshow/88327665.cms||---

But while the elevated sections of the DME and NH-9 at UP Gate as well as the portion of NH-9 below the flyover next to the MCD toll opened for Delhi-bound traffic, police barricades stayed put on the lanes for Ghaziabad-bound traffic below the flyover, prolonging the wait for a full return to normalcy. A Delhi Police official said the barricades were being removed in a phased manner. “Except for the Delhi to Ghaziabad side of NH9, we have removed barricades for traffic movement to resume and the remaining ones will be removed in a day or two,” said the official without ascribing a reason for it. The last batch of farmers cleared out of UP Gate on Wednesday, after which the lanes for inbound Delhi traffic, where the protesters camped for more than a year, were opened. The drive is still not as smooth as it originally was with a structure yet to be dismantled near the entry into the DME at Khora. The National Highways Authority of India inspected NH-9 and concluded that there was “no significant” damage. “We are in a position to open NH9 completely after Delhi Police removes barricades below the flyover on NH-9 for Delhi-Ghaziabad traffic,” said Arvind Kumar, an NHAI official. Vehicular movement on the DME was light on Thursday. “Though we have stationed traffic police at junctions to guide commuters on DME, not many are aware of the development and as commuters come to know about it, we expect traffic movement to resume in full flow in a day or two,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, SP traffic, Ghaziabad. The confusion led to several vehicles getting into the access-controlled expressway instead of the NH-9 lanes for city traffic and turning into the wrong side near the MCD toll on the expressway to exit via the entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gzb-delhi-traffic-back-on-track-not-all-barricades-gone/articleshow/88328300.cms||---

In a veiled comment against the AAP, its former alliance partner BJP and even the Congress of being allegedly ‘outsiders’, Sukhbir said, “Punjabis will not let outsiders govern them and will impose trust in the SAD (B) that represents regional aspirations. Just like Mamta Bannerjee was successful in West Bengal, we will also defeat all three forces pitted against us to emerge victorious in 2022.” However, while talking to media persons after addressing a public rally in support of party candidate Raj Kumar Gupta from Sujanpur assembly constituency, Sukhbir claimed that the SAD(B) would defeat BJP, AAP and the Congress. At the same time, the SAD(B) president questioned AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as to why he had allegedly filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court to close down four thermal plants situated in Punjab. “The AAP government had similarly filed affidavits demanding criminal cases be registered against farmers of Punjab for burning the stubble residue. Kejriwal also stands for handing over the river waters of Punjab to Haryana and Delhi,” alleged Sukhbir. Taking a dig at Kejriwal promising Rs 1,000 per month to all women of Punjab, if voted to power, “Punjabis are asking why not one woman in Delhi has received Rs 1,000 per month till now?” He also questioned why the Kejriwal was talking about regularizing all contractual employees in Punjab whereas he had not regularized 10,000 contractual employees of Delhi in years.“We have always stood by all commitments made in our election manifesto, all were fulfilled immediately after the formation of the government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sukhbir-raises-outsider-bogey/articleshow/88327666.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Coimbatore||Coimabtore: Police adopt new patrolling principle to prevent crimes||COIMBATORE: Rather than patrolling the city in a conventional manner, police have identified around 50 crime-prone areas across the city and intensified patrolling during day and night hours to prevent crimes from happening. The system, which is in place in the city for the past 10 days, is based on “Koper Curve Principle”, developed by Christopher S Koper, an associate professor at George Mason University from Virginia in the US and a senior fellow at the university’s Centre for Evidence-Based Crime Policy. The principle works on the basis that most crimes were committed in certain areas in a particular jurisdiction. Koper’s studies indicated that as much as 50% of crimes occur in less than 5% of blocks or streets. By focusing on these hotspots, Koper’s research found, crime rates can be reduced substantially. Stationing officers in one place or making them patrol the entire city is costly and ineffective. Instead, the principle recommends proactive, random and intermittent patrols of the hotspots for 10-16 minutes every two hours. Koper’s research showed that the likelihood of criminal activity within 30 minutes of a patrol drive-by was 15%. When random police stops lasting 10-16 minutes were incorporated, the likelihood of criminal activity dropped to 4%. “We have identified around 50 crime-prone areas in the 15 police station limits. The cops who are deployed for night patrol would conduct vehicle checks randomly and they won’t be stationed at one place. They will question suspiciously looking people roaming around the city during late night hours,” said city police commissioner Pradip Kumar. Since the system has been introduced, police visibility on the streets has increased. Police officers and the public are giving positive feedbacks about the system, he said. “Every day more than 250 cops were deployed for night rounds and most of them are using face recognition software in their mobile phones. The software is connected to the CCTNS (crime and criminal tracking network and systems) network. The cops click a picture of suspicious-looking people and check it with the CCTNS network to identify miscreants,” said Pradip Kumar. As of now, as many as 650 cops have installed the face recognition software on their mobile phones and on average each click 200-250 pictures a day to check them with the database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/police-adopt-new-patrolling-principle-to-prevent-crimes/articleshow/88326980.cms||A Subburaj

On Thursday, most of the grocery shops were closed because the shopkeepers either hadn’t yet cleaned their premises or claimed they did not have the funds to replenish stocks. Rajveer, who had a clothes and grocery business near the Alipur police post, said, “I have had to close down one of my shops. I am cleaning the other in readiness to restart business. Neither the farmers nor the government will give us anything and make up for the losses we suffered after the agriculture protest affected us for a year.” Rajveer shut down both his shops when the road at Singhu was occupied and blockaded by the protesting farmers. Losses has forced him to shutter his cloth shop, leaving him only his grocery business to rely on for income. “Initially we thought that the road would open up in time, but when nothing happened, I had to shut my cloth shop as the stocks were getting damaged,” he said. “We are re-starting our lives.” Grocery shop owner Prem Prakash hasn’t opened his business yet. Asked why, he said, “I do not have any money to purchase stocks. I suffered losses of lakhs of rupees.” Most of the other shopkeepers complained that the protesters had dug huge drains in the area that are yet to be covered. The only businesses that appeared animated on Thursday were the petrol pumps. Saral Tanwar has found life taking a complete about turn and he now is searching for other means to run his household. “I had two shops here — a government liquor store and a confectionary shop. Plus, a load weighing station for trucks. Because of the new excise policy, the liquor store was closed down, while the confectionery shop is now overrun by rats,” said a dispirited Tanwar. “The weighing station, on whose installation I spent Rs 30 lakh, was damaged after the protesters tethered their horses there. Water has also collected at the spot because the farmers bathed there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/traders-still-picking-up-pieces-business-slow/articleshow/88328302.cms||---

The party was more in news for the internal rift between BJP state president Satish Poonia and former CM Vasundhara Raje than posing a collective front against the Gehlot government. Even during the political crisis last June-July, BJP was looking for the opportunity to form its government while at the same time having to rush his MLAs to Gujarat fearing defection. The power struggle started with the death of its state president Madan Lal Saini followed by a strong pitch by Raje to appoint her loyalist as the next chief. Raje’s efforts didn’t yield desired results as the party high command surprised everyone by appointing Poonia for the top post in September 2019. The decision didn’t go well with the established state leaders who considers him inexperienced. Like any other president, Poonia started building movements against the state government by raising issues like unfulfilled promises—Farm laws, unemployment allowance, rise in power bills etc amid internal bickering. His position grew stronger with the appreciation for leading an aid programme during the first and second waves of Covid by PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. While Raje’s conspicuous absence from the party meetings, the sudden rise of groups like Team Vasundhara Raje proclaiming her the sole leader in the state, her religious cum political tours have put her in direct confrontation with party high command. Raje’s recent three-day visit to Udaipur and Ajmer division has created a ripple effect in the political circles of the state. Her prominent presence in Union Amit Shah rally in Jaipur on December 5 is seen as toeing the party line. The absence of collective fight by the opposition has given Congress a walkover on several issues such as electricity crisis, price rise and poor law and order situation. The recent defeat of BJP candidates in Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad bypolls has raised the alarm bell in the party’s central leadership. The situation forced the Union home minister Amit Shah to hold a rally and public address in Jaipur to revive the party carder. The visit will be followed by BJP’s national president JP Nadda who will visit in January 2022 to push the party to show a collective face in the state..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-continues-to-struggle-to-put-up-a-united-face/articleshow/88327691.cms||---

It is not a challenge but an opportunity if used wisely,” said Ashish Jaiswal, president of Maharashtra State Mining Corporation. He was addressing the gathering during the inaugural function of the three-day national conference of Green Ashcon and Green Buildcon 2021 on the use of green building materials and fly ash which kickstarted in the city on Thursday. Stating that there is optimum use of fly ash in construction, Jaiswal said that even export of it can be seen as opportunity and appealed to the government to take steps in this regard. Coordinator of the conference Sudhir Paliwal said that the goal is to bring carbon emissions under control and promote productive use the fly ash produced from coal-based power plants. “While it is not easy to curb carbon emissions, efforts need to be made to use the by-products that are produced and to promote industries based on them,” he added. Chandrapur Thermal Power Station and its substations are producing large quantities of fly ash, which is being exported globally. Citing this, Sanjay Khandare, chairman and managing director of Mahagenco, said, “Fly-ash based industries in the country and Vidarbha should come forward. We will provide them with as much fly ash as they need.” M Sivakumar, executive director of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), appealed to all to help in creating social awareness about fly ash. “Fly ash can be an alternative to stone pellet and illegal sand extracted from rivers. Currently, the product is being used in many industries and even in the construction sector, which is a matter of great pleasure," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fly-ash-from-thermal-power-plants-have-good-usageexperts/articleshow/88327673.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Restarting bullock cart races to boost rural economy: Maharshtra minister Sunil Kedar||NAGPUR: Maharashtra animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar on Thursday hailed the Supreme Court decision to lift the ban on bullock cart races, stating that it would significantly boost the rural economy. The apex court’s decision was celebrated by farmers by distributing sweets in the rural areas of the region. In Nagpur district, these races used to take place at Sawargaon village in Narkhed taluka. They are known as Shankarpat. The top court permitted restarting the races, four years after it granted a stay, on the condition that the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act would be strictly complied with. “The entire farming community is elated by the development and are celebrating the occasion. For the last four years, the event was stayed by SC. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government followed it consistently for the last couple of years. Our team of lawyers headed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni strongly argued the case for restarting the races,” the minister said. Kedar, who was conducting review meetings with all political parties in this regard, said farming is carried out mostly by tractors and other equipment nowadays, which has reduced the need for bullocks in the fields. “However, such popular events would encourage farmers to keep bullock pairs with them and the economy would be strengthened. We will also offer concessions for these events, like in other states. The people should believe in the judiciary,” he said. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) had promulgated an ordinance under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, banning such races across all states on the basis of cruelty. Several farmers’ organisations from the state had challenged the order in the top court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/restarting-bullock-cart-races-to-boost-rural-economy-kedar/articleshow/88327685.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

No government in the state, be it of the SAD-BJP alliance, one led by Capt Amarinder Singh or of the present CM Charanjit Singh Channi, has done anything to deliver justice. I have decided to sit on indefinite protest and will continue it till justice is delivered,” he said. Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), Dal Khalsa and AAP’s Kotkapura MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan have lent support to Sukhraj in his protest. SAD(A) president Simranjit Singh Mann and Dal Khalsa’s Kanwarpal Singh accompanied Sukhraj to the protest site and announced that party activists will sit at the spot for the safety of Sukhraj. Alleging total failure of the justice system and the Punjab government’s insincerity in delivering justice in Bargari and Behbal Kalan incidents, they said, “Sukhraj’s decision is personal but we have endorsed it and extended moral support to the cause. Our members will join him in rotations.” Sandhwan alleged the Congress government had failed in delivering justice in sacrilege and the killing of protesters. “We want justice to be done at the earliest and I fully lent support to protest,” he said. Krishan Bhagwan and Gurjit Singh had died in alleged police firing at Behbal Kalan when they were protesting against the act sacrilege at Bargari on October 12, 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/behbal-kalan-victims-son-begins-indefinite-protest/articleshow/88327682.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Delhi||Delhi AQI likely to improve a bit over 2 days||NEW DELHI: Pollution levels in the city continued to be in the “very poor” category for the fourth day in a row on Thursday, even as improvement is predicted over the next two days. A few areas of the capital, including Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, Mundka, Nehru Nagar and Shadipur, remained in the “severe” air quality zone. The weather conditions continued to be unsupportive for dispersing pollutants with high moisture and low wind speeds of variable directions. The day-time temperature dropped by 3 degrees Celsius. According to Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI) on Thursday was 368 as against Wednesday’s 363. PM2.5 oscillated between 163.1 and 186.4 units. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, “Shallow foggy condition is likely to keep AQI ‘poor’ for the next two days. From December 17, AQI is likely to improve due to high wind speeds and stay within ‘poor’ or ‘lower end of very poor’ category.” According to the earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management of Delhi, local transport contributed about 13% in Delhi’s PM2.5. Across NCR, Bagpat district contributed about 12%. “The minimum temperature may drop to 5 degrees Celsius over the next two days,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aqi-likely-to-improve-a-bit-over-2-days/articleshow/88327697.cms||---
---||Delhi||Repair work on, it’s slow road to recovery at Singhu border||NEW DELHI: A day after the traffic movement at Singhu border was restored, minor repair and cleaning work continued on Thursday. When TOI visited the border in the afternoon, the traffic load was relatively lighter than earlier. The local residents said that since the road had opened only on Wednesday evening, many people were perhaps unaware of this and may have continued taking the detour necessitated by the road closure due to the protest by the farmers. They expected the traffic volume to grow in the coming days. TOI noticed that the traffic signal at the border wasn’t functioning on Thursday, presumably because the power wires and other electrical equipment had been damaged in the one year of the area’s occupation by the farm agitators. Repairs are under way. On Thursday afternoon, the petrol pumps on either side of the road were carrying out repairs and the premises were being cleaned. The various locations there showed evidence of such repairs and the potholes on the roads were quite visibly only recently filled up. The road is not in ship-shape condition and needs some help. “Earlier, the road had asphalt and was in great shape,” noted mechanic Mukesh. The mechanic also said that though the road was now opened for traffic, there weren’t many vehicles around. “I think people will learn of the road opening gradually and resume using the highway,” said Mukesh. “And not only the road, but the drains also need to be cleaned first.” He also pointed out the concrete barricades employed to deter passage were being removed by the cops. However, he noted, the service lane on the carriageway from Delhi to Chandigarh could not be used for some time because water had accumulated there. The toll point for commercial vehicles was also up and running, although entry tax officials said that the volume was minimal, with only the CNG tempos and trucks being allowed into Delhi due to pollution protocols. Traffic police officials deployed at the border were overseeing the repair work being done on the light lights. “We have been posted here to manage traffic in the absence of the traffic lights,” said one of the traffic cops. “We have found that the wires need to be changed. Other teams have been deployed to check vehicles entering Delhi. Since the morning, we have been booking people who were travelling without pollution certificates or with unpermitted number plates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/repair-work-on-its-slow-road-to-recovery-at-singhu-border/articleshow/88328318.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Rape cases keep surging, cops improve probe time||There has been a record surge in rape cases in the state even as police introduced a slew of measures including dedicated units for speedy investigations and mandatory registration of FIRs. In 2019, the state registered a total of 5,997 rape cases, the highest in the country. Even during pandemic year 2020, Rajasthan topped the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) list with 5,310 rape cases. The series of rape cases continued at a steady pace in 2021 wherein a total of 5,877 rape cases has been filed till November. While rapes have certainly increased in the state over the years, an average of 45% of cases were also found to be false during the investigation, said additional DG (crime) Ravi Prakash. Rajasthan police said spurt in cases is indicative of increased accessibility. “The increase is also due to the mandatory and free registrations of FIRs at all police stations. No one can turn down any complainant and this has empowered people about their rights,” Prakash said. After the horrific Alwar gangrape of 2019, wherein a 19-year-old Dalit girl was violated, Rajasthan police enforced strict adherence to new norms that stipulated that all FIRs must be filed and if station house officers (SHOs) flounder in their duties, then SPs could file FIRs from their offices without having to rely on SHOs. Police also shunted out multiple SHOs who failed to timely file the FIRs. In fact, Rajasthan is probably the only state in the country where SP offices were empowered in a way to directly lodge FIRs. This led to a significant number of cases being directly filed at the police stations, for instance in 2017, 33.4 % of FIRs were registered following court complaints but in 2021, the figure came down drastically with only 16% of cases filed through courts. Similarly, the average investigation period in women atrocities cases has come down from 117 days last year to 76 days in 2021 in the state. This was also due to special cells constituted in each state to probe crimes against women under an Additional SP (ASP) rank official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rape-cases-keep-surging-cops-improve-probe-time/articleshow/88327706.cms||---

The MahaMetro has approached CMRS to conduct a physical inspection of the priority stretch that will pave the way for commissioning of Metro services for commuters. Two rounds of inspections have already been done and now there will be a third assessment to check the safety aspects at Metro stations, running of trains, signalling system, provisions for commuters and other things. The MahaMetro has said that it has submitted the technical- and safety-related details of priority stretches to CMRS. The 12-km-long priority stretches are: PCMC-Dapodi (7km) and Vanaz-Garware College (5km). Both the sections are elevated and have 10 Metro stations five each on every stretch. The MahaMetro is eyeing completion of all the works on both the stretches, including the station works, by December end. An official from MahaMetro said, “The inspection and assessment are not a day-long process. We have submitted the progress details to CMRS on time-to-time basis for the past few months. The review is underway. The physical inspection is part of this procedure. We are expecting it to be held in the last week of December. The MahaMetro has expedited the works on both the sections. More than 10 different agencies are working at the sites. We will be completing all major works in the next two weeks.” The MahaMetro has said works at most stations were in the final stages. The trials of a new aluminium rake have started on the Vanaz-Garware College section a few days ago, while works at the Vanaz and Agriculture College depots have also been expedited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/safety-inspection-of-metros-priority-stretches-in-dec-end/articleshow/88327005.cms||Sarang Dastane

The results were published by National Crime Records Bureau on the basis of monthly scores over the past 12 months. At the annual conference on Good Practices organised by the Union home ministry on Thursday, the capital’s force was declared to have topped all major states with an overall score of 98.6% in implementing the law and order software. Delhi Police was also announced as achieving 100% data entry for registration of FIRs, arrest, property seizure and final reports or chargesheets. Delhi Police has a distinct feature of real time stamping of data entry in CCTNS. An officer explained, “The time is taken from the central server of the data centre. Delhi Police has 100% connectivity among its 209 police stations, so the work is never disrupted on this account.” The officer said that the force, in addition, had deployed hardware and software in all its police stations with a state-of-the-art data centre at Kamla Market in Delhi and data recovery centre at Pune. “Why Delhi Police topped the other forces is also because we integrated ICJS with CCTNS, allowing all final reports to be sent to the courts online,” the officer added. “The courts have received 1.2 lakh final reports through this application. Moreover, we have also implemented an advanced version of the complaint redressal system called Integrated Complaint Monitoring System.

The child was playing in the courtyard of her house when the man, pounced on her, held her tight and bit the flesh straight off of her cheek while the girl struggled to free herself from his grip. The man let her go after bystanders beat him up with sticks. The girl was rushed to district hospital by her father, Sunil Kumar. Doctors said she would need plastic surgery. The accused is also admitted to the same hospital. The girl hails from a Dalit family and her father works as a daily wage labourer in the village, under jurisdiction of Bhojipura police station. Her father said, “I was at home when I came to know that my daughter was attacked by a man who looked intoxicated. The flesh on the left side of her face was missing. I was told that this man attacked my daughter like a cannibal. My daughter is having panic attacks and her condition is serious.” Circle officer Dileep Singh rushed to the spot and saw the accused lying unconscious with multiple injuries on his body. He was also sent to hospital under police custody. The man has been identified as Chedalal Gangwar, a resident of Khajua Jageer village. His family members told police he was undergoing treatment at a mental hospital and he was kept inside his house. He escaped on Wednesday and attacked the child. The man gained consciousness on Thursday afternoon and created a ruckus in the hospital. He tried to attack the medical staff as well. Dr Shailesh Sharma, a clinical psychologist, told TOI, “Such acts are often committed by psychopaths. A similar case was reported from Pilibhit a few years ago. Such patients are rejected by society and they derive sadistic pleasure by harming others. They usually look normal but can suddenly attack anyone. They can be extremely dangerous as they don’t feel that they are doing anything wrong. Treatment is possible, and counselling is important." Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “This looks like an act of a mentally ill person. We have registered an FIR against the man under section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a weapon or other means) and other relevant sections of IPC. We will send him to mental hospital after doctors provide a report about his condition.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/mentally-ill-man-bites-chews-flesh-off-toddlers-cheek/articleshow/88326201.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Tender coconut price crashes in Dharwad; vendors dismayed||HUBBALLI: For the better part of 2021, starting from the summer and throughout the extended rainy season, the price of the tender coconut continued to soar, but the onset of winter has resulted in the cost plummeting in Dharwad district. Where one tender coconut was being sold for between Rs 35 to Rs 40, a glut in the market has pushed the price to Rs 20, much to the dismay of the vendors, who have been hit hard by the sudden drop. Dharwad and the other districts of North Karnataka are supplied tender coconut from various districts of South Karnataka. The drop in temperature adversely impacted the wholesale market for tender coconut in Mandya and Maddur taluks. Consequently, the crash in wholesale price – the rate dropped to Rs 12 to Rs 18 – resulted in many traders deciding against going ahead with transporting the tender coconut due to be supplied to Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab. This resulted in the traders flooding the markets of North Karnataka, pushing the retail price down. Parashuram, a wholesale trader, said, “We think that the wholesale price may fall further. It could drop to Rs 10 or even as low as Rs 8.” Zaheer, who sells tender coconuts by the side of Club Road, said that he, and other vendors, were eager to dispose of their stock at the earliest lest the price nosedive again. “We are forced to sell the tender coconut, earning very little profit in the process. As of now, we are selling the tender coconuts for Rs 20 or Rs 25, but we fear the retail price may crash to Rs 18,” Zaheer feared. Fellow vendor Ashraf, who sells tender coconuts on Gokul Road, said, “There are more than 500 tender coconut vendors, and few people want to drink tender coconut water in the winter. So, the crash in prices is a double whammy for us.” Senior physician Dr GB Sattur said that people must not shy away from drinking tender coconut during the winter. “During summer months, tender coconut helps supplement potassium levels in our body, since we readily lose it through sweat. But tender coconut water can be consumed throughout the year. But people may not prefer to drink it in the winter owing to its taste,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/tender-coconut-price-crashes-in-dharwad-vendors-dismayed/articleshow/88326197.cms||J Abbas Mulla
---||Delhi||Pollution curbs in Delhi hit construction industry hard||NEW DELHI: The ongoing ban on construction activities and entry of trucks carrying construction materials in Delhi and other parts of the National Capital Region has impacted the industry and has also hit their finances, industry associations said. They said restrictions imposed because of air pollution in the NCR will scare businesses and there is no practice so far to give any compensation to the contractors for stopping the construction work due to such restriction. The ban has not only hit the private projects such as construction of apartments but has also impacted the other public infrastructure works. Sources in government road construction entities said the works have almost come to a standstill. “You don’t get materials as crushers are not operating and trucks carrying cement and steel can’t enter. So, how do you work?” asked an official. A senior executive of a major construction firm said in some cases, they are able to carry out works such as welding and other activities in underground stretches. “But you can’t achieve the progress as set by the government or private entities in such a situation. On top of that no one compensates or gives any financial assistance for stopping work. We need to keep labourers at camps even when there is no work and keep paying the charges for machines standing idle. That costs a lot,” he said. Vice chairman of NAREDCO and managing director of Hiranandani Group, Niranjan Hiranandani said the ban on construction activities extends a very challenging situation and enhances the difficulty quotient. “From possession deadlines going haywire to financial impact on project finance due to increased interest costs plus delays in construction and labour moving away to other geographies as they see stoppage of work in Delhi-NCR, it is an unfortunate fall-out of the air pollution problem. There are many reasons why the region faces the challenge of poor air quality, and construction is among the first sectors to bear the brunt of the stoppage of work. The continuing environmental problem in the NCR will scare businesses in the region.” He added that development in the NCR will necessitate construction work. The Delhi Public Works Department has written to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) appealing against the ongoing ban on construction activities in the national capital. The Commission is likely to take a decision on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pollution-curbs-hit-construction-industry-hard/articleshow/88327743.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Jaipur||Gehlot govt at 3 years: REET paper leak dented the govt’s image||Gehlot government’s third year was marked by REET cheating and paper leak case (2021), leading to a series of arrests across multiple cities and protests by unemployed youths for over 50 days. Following protests by unemployed youths under the banner - Rajasthan Berozgar Ekikrit Mahasangh - the state government was compelled to announce that it would bring an ordinance to further strengthen the law to prevent malpractices in recruitment exams. Rajasthan police said they had arrested 20 persons so far for their alleged involvement in the REET cheating case, which was unearthed on September 26 in Sawai Madhopur. It claimed that mastermind Prithviraj Meena and another accused Ravi Pagdi had taken money from students on the pretext of providing question papers. The unemployed youths had called off their 53-day protest over the state government’s delay in fulfilling their 21-point demands after assurance from chief minister Ashok Gehlot on December 5. President of Rajasthan Berozgar Ekikrit Mahasangh Upen Yadav said , “While nine out of our 21 demands have been fulfilled, another 5-6 demands will be fulfilled this month. Gehlot ji has assured us that most of our issues will be resolved soon. Though we had demanded a CBI probe into the paper leakage incident, we didn’t get an adequate amount of support from the candidates on this. Therefore, we had to drop this demand.” According to Yadav, the list of laboratory assistant recruitment, 2018, will be released in a week as promised by the state government. “The calendar for appointment of 4,100 posts of panchayati raj LDC, 2013, will be released this month. The advertisement for recruitment of about 2,600 new posts of panchayati raj junior engineers will be issued in January-February,” said Yadav. Yadav said the release of advertisement for technical helper recruitment for 1,512 posts will be issued this month. “It was agreed upon to release the advertisement for recruitment of 1,000 special teachers under REET-2021 soon. On nursing recruitment, 2013, and teacher’s recruitment, 2012, the government has assured us to take the side of the candidates in the high court,” added Yadav. “In the REET recruitment case, 2018, it was agreed upon to get the recruitment process solved by involving the advocate general,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-paper-leak-dented-the-govts-image/articleshow/88327728.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Gehlot govt at 3 years: Except renewable energy, investments fall to a trickle||Recently, grocery and essentials focused social commerce startup, DealShare, set to be valued at $1 billion, shifted its base from Jaipur to Bengaluru without expressing publicly reasons for the decision. People who know of the development say Jaipur or Rajasthan does not attract talent and it is no more the low-cost destination for both businesses and talent. Low cost of doing business, touted as a major reason why companies would relocate to Jaipur, no longer holds any water now. It’s not only true for startups or businesses in the services sector, but also the manufacturing industry. “Cost of power, auto fuel, and even land rates are much higher in Rajasthan compared to other states. Companies already operating in Rajasthan are struggling to stay competitive against their counterparts in other states,” says NK Jain of Employers Association of Rajasthan, a non-profit. On the contrary, RIICO says it has sold record number plots in the past couple of years. The statistics of the corporation vouch for that. But industry representatives say these are small plots and cannot be the basis to assess how industrialisation has progressed in the past three years. As the government in power celebrates completion of three years, there is bound to be assessments over how much investments it has received during the period. “Barring renewable energy, there has been almost no investments of any significance that the state has attracted in the past three years. Even in renewables, it is a real estate play and the investments do not have a major impact on job creation and revenue generation for the state,” said an industry representative preferring anonymity. In the past one year, the industries department has launched a record number of industrial zones in the state, over 100. But having industrial areas does not translate into investments. Jain says, “Even in Industrial areas, the rates are so high that investors would prefer other states. It is a landlocked state and the logistics cost is too high if you are not in the vicinity of the NCR,” adds Jain. The state would be holding an investment summit next month. Though it has claimed MoUs and letter of Intents for investments of close to Rs 5 lakh crore so far, much of the proposals are recycled, says the industry representative cited earlier. In mining, the department has not been able to announce a policy so far in the current regime of the government. Tourism has not been any different. The government announced a fund of Rs 500 crore to develop and promote. But the fund is yet to see the light of the day. Drying up of investments affects most sectors of business and trade, halting job creation and reducing expendable income needed to prop up other industries and businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/except-renewable-energy-investments-fall-to-a-trickle/articleshow/88327742.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Girish Park repair||Kolkata: What was initially planned to resume this week after proper illumination and road repairs could not wait for the work to get over. The Kolkata traffic police took special permission from KMDA and used one flank of the Ganesh Talkies and Girish Park stretch to pass cars and other slow moving vehicles headed towards Girish Park after TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee's rally from Howrah Bridge to central Kolkata saw traffic slowing down on MG Road and CR Avenue for a considerable period of time on thursday afternoon. The stretch has been closed for the past four odd months owing to the ongoing razing work of the Vivekananda Road (Posta) flyover. "We had to use the road stretch for four hours - starting around 2.30 pm and continuing till around 6.30 pm - when both MG Road and CR Avenue normalized. However, we used only one flank of the road for this purpose. There was pressure from motorists to continue movement on this stretch for some more time given that it definitely cuts down traveling time. However, we did not agree nor did the KMDA. The leveling of the road surface has just started after the removal of heavy machinery from the stretch. The entire street light too has to be set up once again. Hence, there is a chance of accidents if we are not careful. The full-fledged reopening is set to get delayed by a few more days," said an officer from Jorabagan traffic guard. Learning from the past experience on the Strand Road stretch after dismantling work was completed in that stretch earlier last year, the Jorabagan traffic guard had earlier requested both KMDA and KMC to arrange for three crucial things before the stretch gets reopened. Since none of the three criterias have been fulfilled yet, cops shut the stretch even before full fledged office time traffic resumed. "Primarily, we have requested the road surface be relaid after all the heavy digging and setting up of machines has left its top surface completely battered. We have also asked the KMC to set up the uprooted street light pools so that there is enough illumination of the road. Finally, we have also requested KMDA to ensure at least some fencing (on the northern lane) is removed near the important crossings. At present, all the lanes and bylanes like Balaram De Street are shut. Unless that is opened, there will be very limited gain in running traffic on this stretch. A decision on allowing buses will be taken after studying the traffic volume after the reopening of the road," explained an officer who attended the coordination meeting in this regard at Lalbazar last week. The road, once reopened, is set to bring relief in the Posta-Jorabagan-Malapara-Rabindra Kanan-Beadon Street stretch - and ensure that traffic will flow smoother through the day. The KMDA plans to initiate the third phase work of dismantling of the Vivekananda (Posta) flyover from December 20 onwards on the stretch from Ganesh Talkies and Malapara, a distance of about 160 meters on KK Tagore Street.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/girish-park-repair/articleshow/88327032.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Creative writers and thinkers can bring about immense change in society through motivation and guidance,” he said. Pillai recalled the struggle of the people of Bangladesh for independence and its formation in 1971 and said that the Bangladesh independence struggle was a struggle for the cause of humanity, which was led by students. “There must be a persistent effort, for only creative minds can change the society,” he said. On December 16, 1971, Pakistani soldiers surrendered to a joint India-Bangladesh force, formally making Bangladesh a new nation. The day is annually observed as Victory Day to commemorate the liberation movement. Lokayukta of Kerala, retired Supreme Court judge Cyriac Joseph released a coffee table book titled ‘Thirty Days of Mission Humanity’ at Raj Bhavan.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 47 cops lost jobs for indiscipline this year, up from 17 in 2019||The termination of DSP Heera Lal Saini and a woman constable for being involved in sexual activities in presence of the constable’s minor son was not a lone case in which the state government took stern action. Be it connivance of police with narcotics gangs in Bhilwara, which led to the death of two constables, or alleged involvement of cops in crimes against women, 47 police officers lost their job this year. Senior police officers at Rajasthan police headquarters said the state government has been observing a zero tolerance policy when it comes to any complaint, lodging of FIR, judicial custody of policemen on duty. “Negligence towards duties and any act which has tarnished the image of police can’t be tolerated. In every case, be it connivance of policemen with narcotics gangs in Bhilwara which led to the death of two policemen or their indulgence in sexual activities in front of minor child, we handed over the inquiry to the vigilance wing and referred the case for termination,” said DGP ML Lathar. Police had organised decoy operations in the past three years to see the response of police stations when it came to complaints related to lodging of FIR, transport of illegal gravel and liquor and irregularities by traffic policemen and other complains. “In 2019, we have had 17 departmental inquiries against policemen which went up to 38 in 2020 and 45 in 2021 so far,” said a senior police officer. “With growing complains, our work has also increased in past couple of years,” said Biju George Joseph, additional director general (ADG), vigilance. Cases like that of Heera Lal Saini and the woman constable put a huge dent in the image of Rajasthan police. “It came as big embarrassment to us but both have been terminated from the services to give a loud and clear message that such things are not acceptable in Rajasthan police,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/47-cops-lost-jobs-for-indiscipline-this-year-up-from-17-in-2019/articleshow/88327754.cms||---

Since this person had come from a non-high-risk country, he was asked to go for self-isolation by the health authorities from the airport. Health minister Veena George said he had visited a lot of places, including shopping malls and restaurants, flouting all the isolation norms. The contact list of this person, which is huge, is being prepared and also the route map. The minister said the people who have come into contact with this person will be tested and will be isolated. The minister expressed concern over the way the people who are coming from abroad are flouting the self-isolation norms. The government will have to act tough against such people who are putting the lives of others also in huge risk, she added. The minister said those who are coming from the high-risk countries will have to strictly go for seven-day quarantine and get RT-PCR done on the eighth day. Even if this test is negative, they will have to continue in quarantine for seven more days at home. Those who are coming from other countries also should go for self-isolation for two weeks, she added. The test results of two people who had come into direct contact with this person who had come from Congo have become negative. One person is his brother and the other is the one who received him at the airport and travelled along with him to his house. Even though these two people have been tested negative, they have been put under seven-day isolation. The minister said the samples of those who are coming into contact with the positive people (who are coming from abroad) will be sent for genome sequencing. Even if they are coming from non-high-risk countries the samples will be sent for genome sequencing, she added. The minister, who convened a high-level meeting in the wake of five positive cases of Omicron reported in the state, has directed all the district health administration to keep ready Covid wards in major hospitals. The people who are coming into close contacts with the positive people will be isolated in these wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/omicron-patients-contact-list-huge-min/articleshow/88326225.cms||---

After the number of boats for safari was increased in October, Palighat region is witnessing more than 1,000 tourists every weekend. Deputy conservator of forest (DCF), National Chambal Sanctuary, Anil Yadav said, “To explore the new wildlife destination, a good number of tourists are flocking. The average revenue is approximately Rs 11,000 per day, which is expected to increase more as tourists gradually knowing this destination.” At present, there are 15 boats operating for tourists in the NCS. Out of this, 12 boats are being operated at Palighat, Sawai Madhopur and three boats in the Dholpur area. “The river section between Palighat and Rameshwarghat in Sawai Madhopur can become the natural hotspot for development given the good connectivity from Sawaimadhopur and the established tourist traffic to Ranthambore,” said an official. In the 2021 Budget, chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced augmentation of tourism facilities in the NCS. As part of this announcement, infrastructure like floating jetty, camping facilities, nature trails, and boating are being planned. A senior forest official said, “Ecotourism has immense possibilities in Rajasthan, given the huge variety. The chief minister had announced that NCS would be developed in the 2021-22 Budget and tourism infrastructure upgraded. A plan has been chalked out to showcase the sanctuary in a sustainable and responsible manner so that not only the sanctuary is protected, but wildlife enthusiasts can also experience the beauty and thrill of exploring a hitherto unexplored destination.” The NCS comprises 625km of the river in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and UP. In Rajasthan, the NCS was notified in 1979 – the stretches between Jawahar Sagar Dam and Kota Barrage and Keshoraipatan to Gadi Tidawali. The easiest access points to the river are at Kota, Palighat in Sawai Madhopur and Dholpur. An official claimed that Chambal has huge potential to be the most preferred destination for wildlife tourists. “Rajasthan has more to offer than its tigers. The gharial is among the largest of crocodiles and can grow up to more than four metres in length. It has an unmistakable elongated snout and its unique characteristics can attract thousands of wildlife tourists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/tourists-flock-to-palighat-for-chambal-boat-safari/articleshow/88327759.cms||---

Justice CD Singh on Wednesday issued notice to the family members of the petitioner woman and other respondents in the matter, while also making it clear that if any lapse occurs in the security/protection of the couple, the ACP of Ashok Vihar and the SHO, Keshav Puram police station, will be liable. The cops sought time to file the status report in the matter and assured the bench that requisite protection shall be provided to the petitioners. Advocate DK Santoshi, counsel for the petitioners, submitted that the couple had a love affair and got married at Arya Samaj Mandir, Delhi as per Hindu rites and ceremonies. He further submitted that since this is an inter-religious marriage, there are serious threats to the life and liberty of the petitioners from the family members of the woman’s side. The plea submitted that on December 11, 2021, a family member of the girl thrashed the petitioner severely. The counsel also informed the court that the girl is educated and is 26 years old, and has also completed her graduation.

---||Delhi||77 trees ‘missing’ in south Delhi, forest dept orders inquiry||NEW DELHI: The forest department has ordered an inquiry into claims by environments that at least 77 trees have ‘gone missing’ from south Delhi’s Sarvodaya Enclave. The activists said they had conducted a citizen-driven tree census in their area after they notices the missing trees in 2019 end. Although a complaint was registered with the concerned department, no action was taken due to the pandemic, they said. The activists in December 2020 moved the Delhi high court, which ordered the forest department in October this year to take action. Times ViewIn a city that’s become synonymous with pollution, 77 “missing” trees is a matter of concern and should be a subject of investigation. After all, trees don’t vanish on their own.“Finally, some action has come from the forest department. At least 77 trees were missing when we tallied the census in 2019 with the older ones. We are yet to ascertain what type of trees these are, their age, species and the reason,” said Padmawati Dwivedi, one of the petitioners. She added that prima facie, this was a clear violation of the provisions of the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. According to the petitioners, the first tree census report in Sarvodaya Enclave in 2012 had found 787 trees. Despite an addition of 21 new trees to the locality over the next seven years, a similar census in 2019 found only 731 trees. Forest officials said they have written to PWD and SDMC seeking marking of the trees and old census records to assess which species may be missing. “We will also see if any felling orders — legal or illegal — were issued. Or, there could be natural causes like winds or storms,” said Amit Anand, tree officer and DCF, south forest division. According to Bhavareen Kandhari, another activist and co-petitioner, trees have gone missing in other colonies as well. “You go to any newly-constructed house and you see that trees are missing. There is a lack of awareness about the importance of green cover or having a tree next to your house. It is not that there are no ways around it. There are options to build a house around the tree, there are architects and people who are doing the same,” Kandhari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/77-trees-missing-in-s-delhi-forest-dept-orders-inquiry/articleshow/88328360.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Insurer told to pay claimant Rs 83,000 rejected sum for eye operation||MUMBAI: The insurance ombudsman on Wednesday directed National Insurance Company to pay Rs 82,785 to a claimant who had undergone a cataract operation and whose claim had been partly paid. The ombudsman said the insurer’s reasons that the expenses related to the treatment for correction of eyesight due to refractive error less than 7.5 diopters (measure of lenses’ power) and the amount was not reasonable, was unjustified. Sridhar Ramamurthy had undergone cataract surgery (phacoemulsification) with intraocular lens implant for both the eyes in May this year at Shanmukhananda Eye Care Dept and lodged claims for an amount of Rs 1,44,060 with National Insurance Company. The claims for both the eyes were partially settled for Rs 61,275 and Rs 82,785 was rejected citing various reasons, including the reasonable and customary expenses clause. Responding to a query filed under the Right to Informaton Act (RTI) by Ramamurthy, NIC said the claim was rejected because a bifocal lens was used for correction of refractive error. “Cataract surgery is aimed at removing the cloudy lens from the eye and replacing the same with Intra Ocular Lens (IOL) and restoring clear vision. The monofocal lens is adequate to treat this condition; multifocal lenses correct the refractive error along with treating the cataract condition. Correction of refractive error less than 7.5 diopters is excluded from the scope of the policy,” the company said in its response. The treating doctor had said that the refraction in the patient's right eye was -7.5/+0.25x90 and the left eye -6.5/+0.25x40.  “Being an employee of the Bank of India he has to work continuously on the computers and handle figures for which a fine vision is necessary. He was suggested different types of lenses along with the cataract surgery and the option of the multifocal lens was given to him which would help him professionally”. The policy was a group health cover for Bank of India which was by National Insurance. The insurer’s representatives were absent for the hearing. Citing the insurer’s reasons as unjustified, the ombudsman said, “Under the facts and circumstances of the case, National Insurance Co Ltd is directed to settle the above claim for the balance amount of Rs 82,785/- barring non-medicals, if any, in favour of the Complainant within 30 days from the issuance of this order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-insurer-told-to-pay-claimant-rs-83k-rejected-sum-for-eye-op/articleshow/88327760.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After claims of rigging, only 3 bids for mega redevelopment project||MUMBAI: Only three construction firms, Adani, L&T and Naman Developers, have submitted bids to redevelop Mumbai’s largest housing project, Motilal Nagar in Goregaon (west), worth Rs 35,000 crore. Last Sunday, TOI had reported that many builders have complained that the tender floated by the state housing authority, Mhada, has been rigged and tailor-made to benefit a select few developers. “The three bids received will be scrutinised over the next few days and a decision will be taken soon,” said Yogesh Mhase, chief of Mhada’s Mumbai board. Two top developers, Godrej Properties and Bengaluru-based Prestige Group, formally protested and wrote to Mhada about a controversial clause in the tender which makes most builders ineligible for the huge contract. The clause says only developers with a net worth of not less than Rs 9,000 crore as on March 31, 2021, can qualify. Monday was the last day to submit bids for the project spread over 143 acres, comprising Motilal Nagar I, II and III. Mantralaya sources claimed that the builders who have objected did not raise the issue during the pre-bid meeting. They questioned why the letters were written just days before the bids deadline. These sources also said the clause in the tender was mandatory as Mhada was only following Central Vigilance Commission guidelines. According to them, the guidelines mandate that the bidder’s net worth must be at least 30% of the project cost. Godrej Properties, one of the country’s largest developers, alleged in a letter to Mhada that the qualifying parameter of Rs 9,000 crore is “discriminatory” and eliminates other bidders, including Godrej. “It will also act as an undue advantage to a handful of entities who may not even have the requisite on-ground experience to provide housing, accommodation or rehabilitation,” said the letter. Motilal Nagar was built in the 1960s as a rehabilitation and resettlement colony for citizens displaced from different locations in the city and suburbs. Then PM Jawaharlal Nehru had laid the foundation stone of this resettlement colony. The Mhada tender has been floated under the public-private partnership model to rehabilitate about 3,717 Mhada tenants and 1,600 slum dwellers. The master plan envisages integrated redevelopment, including rehabilitation buildings for existing eligible residential and commercial users, as well as shopping centres, offices, recreational centres, schools, healthcare centres and apartments of various sizes for sale. The winning contractor will receive a floor space index (FSI) of 4 to redevelop Motilal Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-claims-of-rigging-only-3-bids-for-mega-redevpt-project/articleshow/88327757.cms||Nauzer Bharucha
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: 5 dead, 15 injured in chemical unit blast||VADODARA: Five persons were killed and around 15 others were injured in a blast at a chemical unit in Ghoghamba taluka of Panchmahal district on Thursday morning. Later in the day, villagers vented out their anger by pelting stones at the factory in which one policeman was injured. The blast occurred at around 10am at the unit of Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd. Such was the intensity of the blast that the sound was heard at a long distance. Smoke started billowing from the plant as it caught fire soon after the blast. As rescue operations began, two bodies were recovered from the plant in the morning. Later, three more bodies were found inside the plant. The bodies of all the five victims were badly charred and they could not be identified. Panchmahal district superintendent of police (SP) Leena Patil said that the reason behind the blast would be clear only after experts analysed the site. She added that nine injured persons have been hospitalized. Others who had received minor injuries were discharged after primary treatment. Chaos had prevailed at the site as fire tenders from various industries and Halol rushed to the plant. The top brass of the district administration also reached the unit. Chief minister Bhupendra Patel also spoke to the district collector and asked him to take up rescue and relief work on a war footing. The loud blast triggered vibrations that shook up the nearby dwellings leading to panic. People residing in the nearby areas either locked themselves inside their homes or fled the area. Till night, the process of cooling the unit was being carried away. One policeman was injured when villagers resorted to pelting stones on the plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/5-dead-15-injured-in-chemical-unit-blast/articleshow/88326441.cms||---

Shreesha Bhat, mentor, and managing trustee at Akansha said, “This is a volunteer driven project launched in association with Udupi zilla panchayat. Currently, volunteers from two private colleges—Trisha Vidya College, Katpadi and Moodlakatte Institute of Technology— are assisting in the effort. Programmes and events are being held at the respective libraries every Saturday for two hours, from the past five weeks, followed by a regular attendance system.” “As many as 60 students are part of this project, that also focuses on personality development. We selected class VIII students so that by the time they reach class X, they are well groomed to face the next phase of life. IAS officers Uma Mahadevan, Priyanka Mary Francis and Udupi ZP CEO Naveen Bhat Y were present during the virtual inauguration of the programme,” he said. The project is also an attempt to introduce students to the gram panchayat libraries, and in turn make these libraries student friendly. A team of experts have already created a curriculum, and currently the volunteers are focussing on improving basics in maths and science of these students. “Several other programmes have been planned. There will be life skill sessions, app-based learning, education-based films will be screened, various competitions based on reading skills and special sessions with a focus on the National Talent Search Examination will be held,” said Bhat. “Meanwhile, to improve the library, book donation camps will be organised, and the libraries will be cleaned by volunteers and students. Public awareness programmes will also be held. Health check-up camps, book fairs, an open house for the public on various issues, and talks related to agriculture activities and government schemes will be held,” said Bhat. The team plans to introduce Grantha Mitra to three more libraries this academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/granta-mitra-initiative-launched-in-govt-school-libraries/articleshow/88326237.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Kolkata||Commerce-creativity synergy led to Puja tag||Kolkata: The Indian team working on the bid to get Durga Puja inscribed on the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list had encountered a challenge when the Unesco officials, who are evaluating the dossier, raised questions about the adverse impact of commercialisation on the festival, its sustainability and its academic interest. The timely and nuanced replies convinced Unesco, leading to the heritage tag. Replying to the query on commercialization, the team pointed out that not only was the festival’s fabric intact, commercialization had helped Durga Puja evolve from a religious festival to a grand socio-cultural event that promotes artistic activities while keeping traditional rituals intact. “Puja is also the period of heightened consumption and the best time to publicize products and commodities and therefore attracts commercial advertising. It has also developed a unique synergy between commercial houses and community pujas in Kolkata with corporate sponsorship directed towards those that cross new thresholds of artistic creativity, environmental sustainability, and civic virtues,” the draft reply to the query stated. Victoria Memorial Hall curator Jayanta Sengupta, who had drafted the reply, explained that it is corporate sponsorship that has helped unleash the creativity of designers and artisans who have long existed on the fringe of the mainstream art world. “They now turn the city into a museum or exhibition, transforming everyday spaces into gigantic creative exercises and enhancing awareness and sensitivity about civic virtues and responsibilities,” he pointed out. Addressing the concerns on sustainability and wider relevance was relatively easier. The use of bamboo, hay and clay to make the Durga idols, their immersion after the festival and recycling of the bamboo structures to make another set of idols all point to sustainability. The reply also cited the mandatory use of water soluble, non-toxic paints and natural dyes, disposal and recycling of ritual worship material in sanitary landfills and the stringent assessment of water quality before, during, and after immersion, among many other measures. On the academic interest in it, the team pointed out that the artistic, sociological, anthropological, economic and emotional aspects of the festival have been examined and documented in important scholarly books, articles in peer-reviewed journals, dissertations, and reports. Workshops and training modules on the festivities are organised, from a nine-day workshop on the ritual aspects of Durga Puja to the festival being featured as a management case study by a business school, the report added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/commerce-creativity-synergy-led-to-puja-tag/articleshow/88327046.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Delhi||Diesel blow: Experts laud Delhi's green move, users fume||NEW DELHI: Welcoming the decisions to deregister diesel vehicles older than 10 years with an NOC and completely scrapping those older than 15 years, experts have said removing older vehicles from the city roads will reduce the toxic exposure. Experts, however, also asserted that while the decision would help the national capital breathe a little better, the government must also provide lucrative scrapping options to the owners, who, though saw it coming, still had a fairly short window as the new year was less than three weeks away. Road transport in Delhi accounts for the biggest contributor to the local particulate pollutants. According to the data available from the transport department, at least 2,64,721 registered diesel vehicles are over 10 years older. “This is a good step to control toxic emissions from older vehicles. There had always been special concern for diesel emissions as they are extremely toxic. Replacing the older vehicles with the new one that comply with much cleaner BS-VI-standard fuel can reduce toxic emissions and toxic exposure considerably,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of Centre for Science and Environment. In an order issued this week, the transport department stated that all diesel vehicles older than 10 years would be deregistered with an NOC so that they could register elsewhere, while those older than 15 years won’t even receive an NOC. The order came in compliance with a 2016 order by National Green Tribunal. Asserting that while at this point it will be difficult to quantify the reduction in toxic exposure, Roy Chawdhury pointed out one BS-VI diesel car emitted 10 times less particulate matters compared with a BS-III diesel car. “According to WHO, diesel emissions are class-I carcinogen and is in the same category as that of tobacco smoking for its strong link with lung cancer. Older diesel vehicles were designed to emit several times more particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons,” she added. According to Sewa Ram, professor at School of Planning, while the decision would come hard on a number of people, it was “needed”. “It is a very important decision that has removed all the ambiguity as vehicles with BS-II-compliant engines had been running on city roads. There is always an argument from the people that they keep their older vehicles well maintained and fit, but it is to understand that even a vehicle registered in 2010 emits much more than that running on BS-VI-compliant engines, because the technology has changed a lot,” said Ram. He, however, pushed for rewarding scrapping policies. “This order will create issues as telling people that their vehicles will be deregistered from the new year is a very short time. Also 10 years are not that long time either. The government has to be rewarding and bring very good scrapping policy that would help people switch to new vehicles,” Ram added. The owners of the affected vehicles, however, came stronger on the decision. “The government has given us a very short notice. Telling us in the middle of December that our vehicle will be deregistered over the next 15 days is cruel,” said Kartik Kumar, a resident of Mayur Vihar. Another resident said the government must deregister vehicles failing the emission tests. “We keep our car well maintained and it’s an expensive affair. Where will we go to register this car? By this logic, I am allowed to run my car in Noida or Ghaziabad, but not in Delhi. How much difference would it make?” wondered R S Pandey, a resident of Dwarka. “We understand that there is a pollution situation in Delhi, but this is a very short window. The government must phase out vehicles not meeting the emission standards first before seeing the date of registration. Extension should be given to the vehicles that are fit,” said Jalaj Awasthi, another Dwarka resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diesel-blow-experts-laud-green-move-users-fume/articleshow/88328370.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Jaipur||Playing politics in name of religion is dangerous: Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday warned against communal politics saying that it is dangerous for the country. He said, “Those who do politics in the name of religion in this country should understand that even a nation was formed on the basis of religion, it is not possible to stay together citing the example of Pakistan. Pakistan became a nation on the basis of religion, but was divided into two countries.” He was speaking to media after paying tributes to the martyrs of the Bangladesh Liberation War on its 50th anniversary. He said Bangladesh was created in 1971 despite the fact that majority population in Pakistan was Muslim. “Doing politics in the name of religion is easy, provoking people in the name of caste is easy, spreading hate is easy but difficult to control when it is spread. “I would like to tell those who do politics in the name of religion, please look at the future of the country … what will happen after 25 years or 50 years,” he said addressing a programme at ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti' after paying tributes to martyrs on Vijay Diwas. He urged people to look into reasons and understand why India remained intact after Independence and why Pakistan was divided. “Pakistan became a nation on the basis of religion but what was the reason that despite there being one religion it was divided?” he asked. There was only Urdu or Bengali spoken in Pakistan but only one religion, still could not remain one. “But in our country, there are many languages and multiple religions … We all should live with love and harmony and this is what Mahatma Gandhi has taught us. This is our religion,” he said. He said, Russia, a great power was divided into 16 pieces. The fight should be of ideology in a democracy, but personal fight or politics in the name of religion, caste is dangerous. People of all religions live in India, yet the country remains intact even after 75 years of Independence and under different governments, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/playing-politics-in-name-of-religion-is-dangerous-cm/articleshow/88327771.cms||---

Having visited the city after a gap of over three and a half years, the virtuoso singer said in a chat with TOI, “After staying indoors for over two years, I started doing live concerts again almost two months back and Bhopal remains a favourite destination. Agreed, there is fear of virus having mutated to various other levels, but then one has to wear the mask, use sanitiser and keep a safe distance at all times. After all, life has to go on.” He made it clear that even though he had recently gone to Dubai for a concert, he will not travel to the countries where you have to be quarantined for certain days. “I’m just not ready to be quarantined in a foreign land, so it is better to visit places where things are straight and simple.” When asked about the impact of pandemic in his life and other well-known artistes’, Hariharan said, “It is true that lesser-known artistes, actors, singers, painters, theatre persons had no or little savings, so they suffered more. But we all had to dip deep into our savings to pay the EMIs, rents and to run the home. In my case, I also had to pay a staff of 10 people and I didn’t cut a penny from their salaries. So, life was tough for all of us.” The ‘Ei-Hairat-e- Ashiqui’ singer clarified that pandemic has been one of the greatest teachers too. When asked about its biggest takeaway, he said, “Pandemic has taught us all that people matter more than fast life. All of us were busy spending long hours on social media or busy in commercial pursuits. But Covid lockdown made us introspect and value what we have in life. I spent even more time on riyaz and focussed deeper on my craft.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pandemic-taught-us-that-people-matter-more/articleshow/88337514.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC takes up pedestrian cause, to free pavements of all hurdles||MUMBAI: Expect better footpaths and street furniture in the suburbs soon. After a pilot project in south Mumbai, the BMC has initiated work on improving the walkability quotient in the eastern and western suburbs. The work will benefit pedestrians and the differently-abled as it aims at universal accessibility. Currently, in Dadar East, the stretch between Ruia College to St Joseph's High School, Wadala, is being improved through interventions like minimalistic bus shelters, standardized street furnitures, universal accessibility with at-grade crossings, ramps and median refuge islands.  "Walking is a big part of our community," said Parsi Colony resident Kayomi Engineer. "Ours is a predominantly residential area with a large population of elders. With better pavements and protected pedestrian crossings, senior citizens will be able to get around easily. In developed countries, parents are seen moving their child's stroller around comfortably on streets but in Mumbai, it's a nightmare as footpaths are uneven or broken. Post pandemic, it will be important for people to use public spaces in the right way," she added. Corporator Amey Ghole of Shiv Sena said the project is an attempt to enhance walkability for citizens in the Wadala-Parsi Colony-Matunga belt. Other locations where similar work is proposed are Chembur (Chembur station to Diamond Garden), Bandra (Kalanagar to BKC on one arm and MHADA office on the other arm), Goregaon (SV Road to Link Road). Data from the Mumbai Traffic Police shows that 42% of all road crash fatalities last year were pedestrians. "When more than 50% of all journeys in the city are done on foot, pedestrians deserve better. For instance, pedestrian crossings should be marked after every 400-500 metre stretch," said activist AV Shenoy of the Mumbai Mobility Forum. Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu has directed civic officers to take up work only on a 100 metre stretch in each area so that pedestrian movement is not affected. "Once the work is completed in totality, the next portion along the same stretch would be dug up. We are focusing on improving the pedestrian experience by trying to make use of only those things that would be low on maintenance," Velrasu said. A concreting technique called cast-in-situ concrete is being used on the footpaths as its long-lasting. "We are also placing data ducts below these stretches so that telecom companies wanting to excavate for laying of fibre optic cables do not tamper with the entire footpath. The pilot project at Fort was well received and so we wanted to replicate it at more stretches," said conservation architect Pankaj Joshi, who is a consultant with the BMC for the project. Precast street furniture would also be used as a part of the project so that it doesn't get vandalized. "When a stretch is universally accessible, it would benefit not only the differently-abled but also elders, pregnant women or individuals with serious injuries," said accessibility activist Jasmina Khanna, who lives with cerebral palsy. "It's essential that accessibility guidelines are adhered to if the BMC's project has to become a success," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-takes-up-pedestrian-cause-to-free-pavements-of-all-hurdles/articleshow/88327777.cms||Richa Pinto

In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the housing and urban affairs ministry said on Thursday that the projects would require six years from the date of sanction for completion. The two projects with a cumulative length of 243km have not yet been sanctioned by the government. The urban affairs ministry on Monday had informed the Rajya Sabha that the Centre had not recieved the Delhi government’s approval for its financial commitment on the detailed project reports (DPRs) of Delhi-Gurugram-SNB and Delhi-Panipat rapid rail corridor projects. In a written reply to Congress MP, Deepender Singh Hooda, the ministry had said the DPR and the feasibility study were received from NCR Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for Delhi-Gurugram-SNB corridor in December, 2018 and for SNB Urban Complex to Sotanala in June, 2020. The DPR of Delhi-Panipat corridor was also received from NCRTC in June 2020. Sources said the ministry is likely to put the proposals before the Cabinet before going ahead with the tendering process.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: If caste was the criteria, I could not become CM, says Ashok Gehlot||JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot has targeted his political opponents for questioning his popularity. In the first convocation ceremony of Bhimrao Ambedkar Law University, Jaipur held at Birla Auditorium, Gehlot said, “I became the CM of the state for the third time. According to the caste arithmetic, I did not have a chance. There is only one MLA from my caste and that is myself. If the people belong to all castes (chathis kom) did not love me, did not believe in me, today I would not be in a position to stand here in front of you and say a few things.” Chief minister has been trying to bringing home the point that even today he has the support of all sections of people. Gehlot has responded to the critics that he is the chief minister not because of caste but because of the popularity. This is not the first time he made such a claim. Gehlot said the dream of setting a university in the name of Ambedkar has finally come true. “I feel that to fulfil that dream, the people of the state have made me the chief minister for the third time.” Gehlot said last time his government set up law university in the name of Ambedkar and journalism university in the name of Haridev Joshi. But our government changed and both the universities were closed by the BJP government. But when “I got a chance to become CM again, we made Acts of both the universities and started them again." Speaking on the occasion, governor Kalraj Mishra called upon the law students to work to remove inequalities, gender discrimination, sexual offences existing in the society and to create awareness about the rights of women and the underprivileged. Mishra said that while the Constitution has given us rights, we have also given fundamental duties. We all need to be aware of them. In this direction, an initiative has been taken to establish Constitution Park in the universities of the state so that the new generation could connect with the lofty vision and ideals of the Constitution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/if-caste-was-the-criteria-i-could-not-become-cm/articleshow/88327783.cms||---

The child was playing in the courtyard of her house when the man, pounced on her, held her tight and bit the flesh straight off of her cheek while the girl struggled to free herself from his grip. The man let her go after bystanders beat him up with sticks. The girl was rushed to district hospital by her father, Sunil Kumar. Doctors said she would need plastic surgery. The accused is also admitted to the same hospital. The girl hails from a Dalit family and her father works as a daily wage labourer in the village, under jurisdiction of Bhojipura police station. Her father said, “I was at home when I came to know that my daughter was attacked by a man who looked intoxicated. The flesh on the left side of her face was missing. I was told that this man attacked my daughter like a carnivore. My daughter is having panic attacks and her condition is serious.” Circle officer Dileep Singh rushed to the spot and saw the accused lying unconscious with multiple injuries on his body. He was also sent to hospital under police custody. The man has been identified as Chedalal Gangwar, a resident of Khajua Jageer village. His family members told police he was undergoing treatment at a mental hospital and he was kept inside his house. He escaped on Wednesday and attacked the child. The man gained consciousness on Thursday afternoon and created a ruckus in the hospital. He tried to attack the medical staff as well. Dr Shailesh Sharma, a clinical psychologist, told TOI, “Such acts are often committed by psychopaths. A similar case was reported from Pilibhit a few years ago. Such patients are rejected by society and they derive sadistic pleasure by harming others. They usually look normal but can suddenly attack anyone. They can be extremely dangerous as they don’t feel that they are doing anything wrong. Treatment is possible, and counselling is important." Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “This looks like an act of a mentally ill person. We have registered an FIR against the man under section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a weapon or other means) and other relevant sections of IPC.

The news of Durga Puja winning accolades and laurels at an international stage triggered celebrations in Kumartuli and inspired the artisans to start working on Durga idols months before the festival in autumn. Several artisans and workers congregated in the narrow lanes and distributed sweet among people to celebrate the news of the Unesco tag. “This is a great honour for all the artisans in Kumartuli because the deity takes shape in the workshops located in the narrow lanes of this locality. We are happy that Durga Puja has been bestowed with such honour internationally. It was overdue,” said Kartik Pal, secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity. The Unesco heritage tag is expected to create more awareness about the festival globally, attract more tourists from different parts of the world and increase investment. Durga idols made in Kumartuli travel to different parts of the world, where Bengali diaspora celebrates the festival. “The festival has grown in scale and stature in the past few years and has given several artisans a scope to showcase their talent,” said Pal. There are around 500 workshops in Kumartuli and these are run by the families that have been into idol-making and pottery for several generations. Months before Durga Puja, many people from neighbouring districts come to Kumartuli in search of livelihood. Idol makers hope that the government will try to showcase Kumartuli too as an integral part of Durga Puja and this will turn the spotlight on the living conditions of the idol makers as well as the infrastructure of the workshops at Kumartuli. “Most of the workshops in Kumartuli are in a very bad shape. The roofs are leaking and drains are clogged. The artisans face problems in monsoon when they give a shape to the idols. I hope that the government will give attention to the living conditions of the artisans at Kumartuli, which is an integral part of the festival. Kumartuli should be decorated and showcased as a heritage site as a part of Durga Puja,” said Bubun Pal, a veteran artisan in Kumartuli.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-global-recognition-kumartuli-wants-govt-help/articleshow/88327071.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The agency is investigating if these officials obtained their posting through consideration during Deshmukh’s tenure. Shrirame said he didn’t want to comment. On Friday, Akola superintendent of police (SP) G Sreedhar will appear before the ED. Earlier, he had denied any connection with the case and had said that he will cooperate in the probe. DCP Raju Bhujbal, who is posted in Mumbai, has also been summoned. Earlier, the ED had recorded his statement related to dismissed API Sachin Waze’s claim that he was aware about Deshmukh’s alleged Rs 100-crore demand from bar owners. While some of those summoned are state police service officers of the rank of SP, others are direct IPS rank officers. Sources said the CBI had recently recorded the statem-ent of some of these officers in the corruption case it is probing against Deshmukh. A source said, “The ED is ascertaining if these officers had got desired posting with the help of Deshmukh for consideration. The ED is examining if there were any financial transactions between them.” —Vijay V Singh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-grills-pune-traffic-dcp-summons-5-ips-officers/articleshow/88327801.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Delhi||Services at Delhi public hospitals may be hit as resident doctors to go back on strike||NEW DELHI: Patient services at Delhi’s leading public hospitals, including Safdarjung, Ram Manohar Lohia, and Lok Nayak, are likely to be seriously affected on Friday. This is because the resident doctors, who are the backbone of healthcare services in these medical institutions, have decided to withdraw from all services, including elective surgeries and trauma care, to protest the delay in NEET-PG counselling. Only the faculty members, senior doctors, will be available to man the OPDs and other critical services at the hospitals. “We do not want to inconvenience patients. That’s why we suspended our protest for a week and requested the government to take necessary action to expedite NEET-PG. But nothing has been done so far and, therefore, we are forced to take this step,” the resident doctors said. On Wednesday, the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association of India had written to union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya to inform him about their planned agitation. “With the threat of a third wave of Covid-19 pandemic looming large, the best the authorities could have done was to expedite the counselling and subsequent admission process. Instead, there is inaction and a lack of urgency in the matter. Hence, as informed earlier, resident doctors are left with no choice, but to go for withdrawal from all services in healthcare institutions from December 17 onwards,” FORDA said. Resident doctors have been protesting since last month over the issue of delay in NEET-PG counselling. They claim healthcare institutions across the country were running short of an adequate workforce of resident doctors, with no admission in the current academic year yet. “With the possibility of future Covid-19 pandemic waves looming large, the situation will be disastrous for the healthcare sector with its bearing on the country’s population,” the doctors say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/services-at-public-hospitals-may-be-hit-as-resident-docs-to-go-back-on-strike/articleshow/88328397.cms||---

There are around 30 lakh eligible youths for jobs but the state government could provide unemployment allowances to only 1.50 lakh in the last three years of its governance, alleged Poonia, who was in Kota on Thursday. “Jobs are the same, of which advertisements were released in the previous state BJP government.

---||Mumbai||Maintenance not paid? Vacate mom’s home, Bombay HC tells son||Mumbai: The Bombay high court has directed a man and his family to vacate his parents’ house in Lower Parel after taking serious view of his flouting an order to pay his 73-year-old mother maintenance every month. Justice Sandeep Shinde, on Tuesday, “forthwith” vacated an October 6 interim stay on a direction in the March 8 order of a Dadar magistrate “to remove themselves from the house in the name of the husband of the applicant [mother] within a period of one month.” In her application filed under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the 73-year-old had said that her son and daughter-in-law were trying to evict her husband and her from the room in Lower Parel. She had sought maintenance saying she has no income and is suffering from ailments. Metropolitan magistrate S V Pimple had directed the couple to pay jointly Rs 20,000 compensation for the mental agony caused to the mother and the son to pay her Rs 5,000 monthly maintenance. The couple was also prohibited from “causing violence” to the mother. The son and his wife then moved the HC and urged it to quash the magistrate’s order claiming it was harsh. On December 9, the mother was present in the HC and complained about the non-payment of maintenance. Her advocate, Ajay Jaiswal, said that the arrears of maintenance had touched around Rs 2.1 lakh, including the compensation awarded by the magistrate. The son’s advocate then sought time to verify whether the maintenance was paid. On Tuesday, Justice Shinde refused to grant further adjournment. The son’s advocate said that his client cannot pay now as his wife is unwell. But Jaiswal argued that the harassment continues and the son has not paid a penny to the septuagenarian. Justice Shinde questioned why the son had not paid till now and added that he should have given some money to his mother. Justice Shinde pointed out that the HC’s October 6 order did not stay the direction to the son to pay Rs 5,000 monthly maintenance to his mother. “The fact remains that the petitioner has not paid maintenance to his mother. In consideration of this fact, in my view, the interim relief granted on October 6 needs to be vacated. Accordingly it is vacated forthwith,” he added. Justice Shinde posted the matter for further consideration in February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maintenance-not-paid-vacate-moms-home-bombay-hc-tells-son/articleshow/88327807.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Workshop for senior cops focuses on 26/11 lessons||KOLKATA: With the KMC elections barely a couple of days away, and Christmas and New Year just round the corner, the Kolkata Police STF gave a unique presentation to all senior officers up to the level of OCs on how to thwart terror activities and read the signs early. Using actual 26/11 footage, cops were shown how to activate various anti-terror drills. Lalbazar said the training was organized to make the metropolitan police ready for any eventuality. A few senior officers of STF have just received training on this at the national level. The presentation by STF was organised to share some of the basic training with colleagues, said sources. Commissioner Soumen Mitra was present during the presentation. “While each Mumbai Police officer who fought the terrorists that day was a braveheart who put duty before everything, there are always things to learn from previous incidents. Such study of past incidents is not limited to coordinated terror attacks. It can help study any major crime. We can always try to implement the best possible response based on the latest technology and intelligence. This is all the more important as the local police will, in all likelihood, be the first responders,” said an officer. “The session was divided into segments and there were both CCTV and video footage of the Mumbai attack. As with any coordinated attack, we were told, that the attackers, too, will be innovating and it was important we stayed a step ahead of them,” said another OC who attended the presentation. The police also used the class to introduce to its officers several equipment that can act as authentic anti-sabotage tools. Earlier, with a budget of around Rs 7.5 crore, the Kolkata Police ordered for Non-Linear Junction Detectors (NLJD) and Explosive Vapour Detectors (EVD), which will be used by the Special Branch to secure VVIP zones and also the STF to detect plastic explosives in crowded corners. Lalbazar has decided to procure nine EVDs with explosives and improvised materials detectors and an amount of around Rs 2 crore has been allotted for that. It can detect military and plastic explosives including TNT, C4, RDX and home-made explosives. Lalbazar has also issued tenders for seven NLJDs at a cost of around Rs 1 crore. The NLJD detects the presence of electronics, regardless of whether they are radiating, hard wired, or even turned off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/workshop-for-senior-cops-focuses-on-26/11-lessons/articleshow/88327087.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

This collaboration aims to prioritise initiatives that have an effect on knowledge through immersive industry-based learning. The courses are designed to level up students’ skills and help them meet the knowledge requirements of today’s fast-paced and tech-enabled business environment. The curriculum includes courses on cyber technology, IoT, mobile app, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, cyber security, robotics and drone technology. “Collaborations with industry are the cornerstone of Bennett University to close the education-employability gap. This MoU will help in the amalgamation of industry and academia,” said Bennett vice-chancellor Prabhu Kumar Aggarwal. Referring to current job trends, Vishesh C Chandiok, CEO of Grant Thornton Bharat, said, “The collaboration is essential to reduce the divergence between the domains of industry and education. Lack of industrial exposure in the education sector and the job-readiness disconnect are driving the two domains to join forces in solving real-world challenges.” Being a leading business consulting firm, Grant Thornton Bharat “aims to prepare industry professionals with the necessary frameworks for standards and quality assurance”, Chandiok added. The MoU will provide multiple opportunities to the students and faculty members to work on collaborative projects, research and development, internships, placements and certification programmes on the latest industry trends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bennett-univ-consulting-firm-ink-mou-to-make-students-industry-ready/articleshow/88327805.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cops light bonfire, 3,000kg drugs go up in smoke||MUMBAI: Over 3,000 kg of narcotic drugs that had been seized over a period of time were destroyed on Wednesday by the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) of the city police. The value of the contraband that was incinerated has been pegged at Rs 14.65 crore, said the police. “The destroyed drugs had been seized in 26 cases by the anti-narcotics cell,” said deputy commissioner of police Dutta Nalawade. The destroyed drug included over 3,000 kg of ganja, 3kg of charas, cocaine, mephedrone, heroin, amphetamine, 11,271 bottles of cough syrup. The drugs were taken to Taloja which houses an incinerator facility where the entire contraband weighing over 3,000 kg of drugs were torched. The facility, said police officials, houses a chimney. It took over four hours to torch the seized material. As mandated by procedure, members of the drug disposal committee and a police team stood by for the material to get completely incinerated. After the material is destroyed, the committee issues a certificate of destruction of contraband, said an officer. Of the entire stash of the narcotic drug, the biggest haul that had been seized in a single case was 1,800kg of ganja valued around Rs 3.5 crore which had been seized in February this year. Two people had been arrested in the case. The ganja had been hidden in a cavity under the tempo in which it was transported. The cavity was then covered with coconuts. The police said that this consignment, which was originally meant for Surat, had been diverted to Mumbai at the last moment since the person who was to receive it in Surat had been arrested by Gujarat police. The police said that charge sheets in all the 26 cases have been filed and the matters are before the court. As per Central government’s notification of January 2015, any agency which wants to destroy the seized drugs must take permission from the trial court. This follows an inventory procedure. “As per section 52A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act, the police must file an application in court, seeking permission to destroy the seized drugs,” said an officer. Once the application is sanctioned, the seized contraband is taken to court, if the quantity is small, where the magistrate checks it to establish correctness of the seized items. “If the quantity is huge, a magistrate can also visit the storeroom where the seized drugs are kept to check it. As primary evidence, one sample of drug is kept for trial stage,” said an officer. Photographs of the seized drugs are taken and they are weighed too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cops-light-bonfire-3000kg-drugs-go-up-in-smoke/articleshow/88327814.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Udaipur||Rajasthan: Gulab Chand Kataria hits out at Rahul Gandhi over Hindutva remark||UDAIPUR: Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria during BJP’s Jan Akrosh rally in Udaipur lashed out at Rahul Gandhi for his comment on Hindutva. The BJP’s rally was organised on Thursday against three years of Congress government rule in the state. During the rally, Kataria said that Rahul says that I am a Hindu but I am not like this. Does he (Rahul) have the courage to speak such words about the other community? People of other community will hit you in the skull if you speak such words about them. You propagate hatred just because Hindus are tolerant, he said. Kataria said if you are a Hindu, then show at least one photograph of the three generations of the family celebrating Diwali, Holi or Rakshabandhan as a proof of your being a Hindu. Congress MLAs use unrestrained language against soldiers of India. The party which once ruled the country is shrinking by its own actions, he said. Kataria said petrol and diesel prices are the highest in Rajasthan. It would be satisfactory if Rahul had instructed the Congress government to bring the fuel prices on a par with Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana or Delhi. The law and order situation in the state has worsened and it tops the list in the country. Rajasthan has the most expensive electricity in the country. The Congress should disclose amount of allowance given to unemployed or permanent employment given to those on contract.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/kataria-hits-out-at-rahul-over-hindutva-remark/articleshow/88327809.cms||---

In October, a person had filed a case under relevant sections of IPC and POCSO act against the lekhpal Ranjit Barwar, Karan and two unidentified persons for gang-rape of his 15-year-old daughter and threatening to kill her when she became pregnant. On Monday night, the girl’s health deteriorated following which her family rushed her to Shivrajpur CHC on Tuesday morning. After giving her first aid the doctors referred the girl to LLR’s maternity and child care wing. After giving birth to a stillborn there, the teenager also died during treatment. The police arrested the accused lekhpal- Ranjit Barwar on late Tuesday night and sent him to jail on Wednesday morning. On Thursday, SDM Gulab Chandra Agrahari, suspended the accused lekhpal and said that the action has been taken after getting information about his arrest from the police. Meanwhile, during the postmortem of bodies of the girl and her stillborn baby, the doctors had taken blood samples of both for the DNA test. The samples will be matched with the blood of the accused, said the police. Kakwan police station in-charge Kaushalendra Pratap Singh said that an application has been given in the Mati Court on Thursday for procuring blood samples of the accused for DNA test and the application is likely to be heard on Friday. Rachna Singh and Vinay Yadav from Samajwadi Party and Usharani Kori of Congress reached the village and expressed their condolences after meeting the family member of the victim.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee showcases Unesco tag for Puja before civic polls||KOLKATA: Invoking Bengali pride in the backdrop of Durga Puja getting Unesco’s heritage tag, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said, “We work more, talk less. This is a matter of great pride for Kolkata, that our Durga Puja is being applauded not only in India, but also the world over.” Taking a dig at BJP, she said, “And, they (BJP) said Mamataji toh Durga Puja karne nahi deta hai (Mamataji doesn’t allow Durga Puja). Now where will you take your lies to? Unesco? Bengal doesn’t need your certificate. Let people vote only on this point.” A visibly emotional Banerjee said, “We have been trying for this since 2016. We extend our gratitude to Unesco. Durga Puja is a festival, which is a confluence of humanity. Durga Puja started here (in Kolkata). And next year, it will be a special festival. Bolechhi, Bangla ke sreshtha kore chharbo (I have promised to make Bengal the greatest). Every vote in Kolkata will shape India’s future. We don’t seek publicity but work silently; it isn’t a dip in the Ganges before elections and hurling bodies in the same river during Covid.” At the three meetings she attended at Kalighat, Bagha Jatin and Behala on Thursday, Banerjee addressed hyper-local civic grievances dogging the KMC-added areas in south Kolkata, cautioned party councillors, and repeatedly harped on her plans to usher in growth in Bengal with more industries. “Industry is my next target” was the refrain. She also sent out a strong message to her party workers: “I believe Bengal still values truth, values and ideals. We must protect them at any cost. One cannot be allowed to spoil it. If need be, throw out the rotten snails from your midst.” She added, “You have to walk with your eyes on the ground. As a councillor, your phones should be on from 9am to 10pm. If I can respond to 400 messages daily, I hope you can respond to at least 100. You have to receive calls, hear people out and get the work done. Also, I notice this tendency of owning 50 homes. Who will stay in those? There is a tendency to save money at all costs. Will it ever last? People can’t even have food properly these days even if they can afford it.” At Bagha Jatin and Behala, local civic problems, such as poor drinking water supply, repeated water logging and ongoing Metro work, came up in her speeches. At Bagha Jatin, Banerjee promised that no settler would be evicted from vested lands. Stressing her resolve not to impose water tax, which she said came at the cost of not getting World Bank funds, the chief minister said, “That is for the World Bank to decide but we will not impose (water) tax on people. Instead, we are upgrading Palta waterworks and Garden Reach. Piped water will reach every Bengal household.” Addressing the waterlogging woes in Behala, the CM said, “Construction materials can’t be dumped on roads as it clogs drains. Metro work has led to it at times. But we also need to ensure water bodies are revived.” The chief minister also referred to the state’s ambitious plans to set aside Rs 18,000 crore for a flyover, linking Behala to south Kolkata, to decongest roads. She said she hoped this, along with Metro, would change the face of Kolkata in the next few years. “Bobby (Firhad Hakim) , you need to prioritize this,” Benerjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-showcases-unesco-tag-for-puja-before-civic-polls/articleshow/88327093.cms||---
---||Delhi||Loan default: South Delhi school up for auction||NEW DELHI: As astounding as it may sound, a school in the city is being auctioned for defaulting on a loan payment. Raisina Bengali School in south Delhi’s Chittaranjan Park took a loan of Rs 2 crore in 2005 from United Bank of India, but after failing to repay the money, the principal and the interest now stand at Rs 8 crore. The Debt Recovery Tribunal has ordered that the school will go under the hammer on January 14. The property to be sold houses the school’s senior section where approximately 900 students currently study. The sale proceeds, if the auction is carried out, will go to ASREC India Ltd, a company which acquires non-performing assets from banks. The order passed by DRT on November 11 observed that the school had failed to repay the debt despite being provided given numerous opportunities to do so. DRT also said that the school had earlier been permitted to sell the land to garner the amount due. “The undertaking and assurances given by the new management of the (school) were considered in true spirit by this forum. This shows that a lenient view has been taken by this forum but its seems that the (school) is not interested in repaying…Any further opportunity will derail the recovery proceedings and will cause unnecessary delay as nothing concrete has been offered by the (school),” the order read. According to members of the school’s current governing body, which was installed in 2019, the liability was a result of “impermissible and unlawful acts” by the previous members. Chitra Maji, a member of the current body, alleged, “The loan was transacted by some of the then office bearers without the approval or permission of the governing body of Raisina Bengali Schools Society. We have pursued all possible measures to settle the disputes and ensure statutory compliances after taking over in July 2019, but non-completion of accounts and non-auditing since 2015-16 has hampered our efforts.” Maji added, “We took steps to get the pending auditing completed, but due to non-compliances from 2016-17 onward, huge penalties have instead been imposed on the school by income tax authorities.” Appealing for help from patrons, Maji said, “The society and the schools run by it are completely dependent on donations or voluntary contributions from patrons. All well-wishers as well as the public are earnestly requested to make the maximum possible contribution.” The East Bengal Displaced Persons Association has now requested intervention by Delhi government. In a letter to deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who is also the education minister, the association secretary, P K Paul, said, “With our association’s efforts, land was earmarked and allotted by the ministry to a few prestigious schools, Raisina Bengali School being one of them. We have been approached by many ex-students and social groups to try and find a solution to resolve this matter so that the school can be saved from being auctioned.” He also urged the government to initiate an enquiry into how the loan was sanctioned against the mortgage of a leased plot of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/loan-default-s-delhi-school-up-for-auction/articleshow/88327825.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Second generation of political families takes legacy forward||KOLKATA: Following in the footsteps of their politician parents has not been an easy option. But for some of the “second-generation”, politics seems to be a more fulfilling path than any other career option. While several from the next generation of political families made their poll debut in 2015, the trend is continuing in 2021, too. Faiz Ahmed Khan, son of Trinamool minister Javed Ahmed Khan, who studied business administration in Australia, contested the 2015 KMC elections. Six years down the line, he has made a name for himself, largely credited for solving drinking water scarcity and waterlogging problems in his area to a great extent. He has also taken a lead in a fight against environmental degradation. Faiz, who claims he owes his training to his father, who worked as an MMiC from 2000 to 2005, was also part of a project that converted the roof of a water reservoir into a park for children at Topsia off EM Bypass. Commerce graduate Sana Ahmed has big shoes to fill in. Daughter of former KMC deputy mayor Iqbal Ahmed and niece of Lok Sabha MP Sultan Ahmed, she has taken it upon herself to carry on the family political legacy. Her ‘Badeh Papa’ (Sultan Ahmed) is no more, and her father is unwell. Encouraged by her father, Sana first stepped into politics in 2015 and won the KMC polls. Sana has been involved in several development work, including beautification of Wellesley Park (Gol Talab), laying the foundation of a KMC-run English-medium school and launch of a vocational training centre for women among others. In the next five years, Sana plans to take up several other development projects for the benefit of her voters, including upgrade of an existing health centre in her area. Saurav Basu, who quit his job of a senior marketing executive, has been working largely behind the political scenes since 2018. This year, Basu, Trinamool minister Chandrima Bhattacharya’s son, has made his debut in electoral politics. “My mother’s blessings are with me. But she did not influence me into contesting the polls. I have been a party worker since 2018,” Basu said. Bhattacharya, who campaigned with her son, said, “Most residents in this ward love me like their daughter. I appeal to them to shower the same love on their grandson.” Politics for Sandipan Saha has been rewarding. Saha, an IIMC alumni, plunged into politics in 2015 and won the civic polls from Janbazar, from where the family—his father is Trinamool’s Swarnakamal Saha— had never lost since mid-80s. Sandipan has no regret about leaving a promising IT career as he took a leap into politics. Saha served the KMC as an IT adviser for the past three years. “When I joined the 2015 civic polls, my only identity was my family. But in the past six years I have learnt the nuances of civic administration. I am ready to take forward the political legacy of my father Swarnakamal Saha who has been in electoral politics for more than three decades,” he said. Puja Panja, daughter of Trinamool minister Sashi Panja and granddaughter of the late political veteran, Ajit Panja, has politics in her blood. But according to Sashi, her daughter never thought of joining electoral politics till recently. Puja, who has done her masters in social welfare, is an avid social worker. And like Ajit Panja, she has acquired a special skill in public relations. “She is a bit nervous. But that doesn’t mean she has no experience in politics and social service. She helped me a lot during the peak of Covid and earned love from Shyampukur locals,” Sashi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/second-generation-takes-political-legacy-forward/articleshow/88327098.cms||Saikat Ray

Elaborating on the ill-effects of burning up the farmland refuse, Modi said, “We see that when heated, mud becomes a brick. It is so strong that a building can be made with it. But burning the remains of crops has become a sort of tradition,” he said, adding that experts too are of the opinion that fire reduces the fertility of farmlands. In his online address, the PM said that the world was going back to the basics, attempting to reattach to the roots and farmers know very well how to achieve this. “21st century Indian farmers are going to lead the ‘Life, Lifestyle for Environment’ mission,” said Modi, mentioning that he had given a call to make it a global mission. The PM said that though the use of chemical fertilizers played a key role in the green revolution, we must work on finding their alternatives. Now is the right time to take steps in this direction, he said. Modi said that natural farming can help in improving the financial condition of farmers. He suggested that each panchayat should attempt to have one village that is involved in natural farming. Ancient texts written by sages have given us valuable insights and understanding of agriculture, the PM said. He also stressed on combining ancient wisdom with modern technology to get the best results. Union minister for home affairs and cooperatives Amit Shah said that the ministry of cooperation was working to ensure that farmers adopt natural farming. He said that work had been started to ensure that such farmers get the right price, access to global markets and establish brands. “The task is to supply certified organic products with a brand name to the international market. The Ministry of Cooperation is making efforts to set up a network of laboratories in the country which will certify not only organic products, but also certify that land in which they were grown is also chemical fertiliser-free,” Shah said, adding that soil testing laboratories will be established in two states within a year. Governor Acharya Devvrat, CM Bhupendra Patel and other dignitaries too addressed the the conclave held at the conclusion of the 3-day Pre-Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit held at the Anand Agricultural University (AAU).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/stubble-burning-is-old-farming-mistake/articleshow/88326463.cms||---

The concessional rate will be given to consumers who charge electric bikes, cars or any other EVs from 10pm to 6am. The state government had kept the rate of EV charging to as low as Rs 5.50 per unit — which is lower than the residential rates for electricity. “And now, this is a further concession of one rupee for those charging vehicles late at night,” the official said. The MSEDCL has also announced setting up of 18 EV charging stations in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for the public — four in Greater Mumbai, six in Thane, four in Navi Mumbai and four in Panvel. Seven of these charging stations have almost been set up, said sources. The power utility firm has prepared a roadmap for setting up a total of 500 charging stations close to its sub stations in various districts of Maharashtra over two years. MSEDCL supplies power to 2.6 crore consumers across Maharashtra and will promote setting up of e-charging points in housing complexes/societies. A recent survey had shown that in Mumbai, 85% housing societies (respondents) had shown interest in setting up e-charging points within the complex. As for the e-charging stations planned on highways across the state, they will be set up close to MSEDCL substations so that there is uninterrupted supply, officials said. These will be fast DC charging stations. In this setup, it will require 45 minutes to an hour to charge a vehicle completely. On Tuesday, the power firm, along with the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, had organised a roadshow in Navi Mumbai to promote e-vehicles such as bikes, three wheelers, cars and buses. At the same time, Tata Power has tied up with petrol pumps in Mumbai to set up EV charging points at nearly 100 locations, besides having them in malls and office buildings in Mumbai. BEST has also set up charging stations at four depots and will have this facility for the public at 23 other depots and 10 bus stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msedcl-offers-addl-concession-for-late-night-ev-charging/articleshow/88327820.cms||Somit Sen
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Residents feeding strays run up lakhs in soc fines||Thane: A woman living in the NRI Complex in Navi Mumbai has alleged that the management committee of her residential society has imposed a fine of over Rs 8 lakh on her for feeding stray dogs inside the premises. Anshu Singh said that from July the society began imposing Rs 5,000 per day littering charge for feeding strays. “My cumulative fine amount till now is over Rs 8 lakh.” She said many strays are found in the complex, which has over 40 buildings. The cumulative fine amount on another resident is Rs 6 lakh, she added. A resident, Leela Varma, said that the society watchmen note down the names of those feeding dogs.  Vinita Srinandan, secretary of the complex, said children run after the strays and senior citizens are too scared to move freely. “Then there are issues related to cleanliness and hygiene as these dogs soil the parking space and other areas and create a nuisance. The residents cannot sleep properly at night as the dogs keep howling throughout,” she said. The society has created a dog enclosure, but some members still feed the strays in the open, she said.

---||Kolkata||Green contest: Jodhpur Park-Lake Gardens residents want plastic-free belt with more trees||KOLKATA: Return of the green canopy, plastic-free neighbourhoods and restoration of water bodies: these seem to be high on the demand list of residents of Jodhpur Park-Lake Gardens from their councillor ahead of the KMC polls. Ward 93, which writers, film-makers, singers, playwrights and bureaucrats, have made their home, is one of the most prized locations for real-estate development. But residents are against the matchbox-like apartments replacing the old bungalows. “The green cover is our top priority. Our neighbourhood has grown grey. We also want to get rid of filthy plastic, which is littered all over Jodhpur Park,” said Uday Guha, a retired government officer. The area, which bears the signs of initial attempts at town planning, has been robbed of a large number of full-grown trees, which were felled in the successive cyclonic onslaught. In the contest among Trinamool’s Mousumi Das, CPM’s Gopa Roy Chwodhury, BJP’s Sumita Dasgupta and Congress’s Sampa Ghosh, most have made ‘environment’ their poll plank. Author Shirshendu Mukherjee, who lives in Jodhpur Park, said, “If they fulfil even a part of their promises, our area will be a more livable place.” Ward 93 houses 19 large housing complexes, including South City, and 14 slums. “While high-rises see 34%-35% turnout, slums score above 85%,” said Bijoy Dutta, a Trinamool leader. Arun Kanti Sur, a local BJP leader, said Jodhpur Park had been witnessing several “trouble spots” in the past few years and those should be addressed. “Conservancy and waterlogging are two issues with which residents of the area are completely fed up. We want to replicate the Swachh Bharat model in this ward,” Sur said. Sunirmal Gupta, a Jadavpur University employee and a Left supporter, said, “Jodhpur park has not seen any other face but Trinamool since 1995. I think, it’s time for a Left candidate to get an opportunity to prove his or her efficacy.” Madhuchhanda Deb, a septuagenarian CPI leader who has retained the neighbouring Ward 92 (Dhakuria), also has green cover on agenda. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday also urged candidates to encourage sapling plantation. “Due to global warming, we are facing unprecedented rainfall. Only nature can be nature’s succor. We have to plant trees to revive the green cover.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/green-contest-jodhpur-park-lake-gardens-residents-want-plastic-free-belt-with-more-trees/articleshow/88327108.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The matter came to light in Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad after one of the girls' fathers lodged a police complaint. In his complaint on Thursday, the father alleged, “Three boys belonging to another faith often came to our locality and molested our girls. Last night, when my daughter was returning home, these boys started molesting her and even threatened to kill her.” Based on the complaint, an FIR under IPC sections 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), along with the SC/ST Act, was registered against the three youths. The boys remained tied to a tree and beaten for several hours until they were rescued by police, sources said. A second FIR was then registered on a complaint of the mother of one of the boys who alleged that her son was in the market when the kin of a girl caught her son and thrashed him for several hours. A purported video also surfaced in which a girl can be seen slapping the boys. Police registered the FIR under sections 147 (rioting), 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC against four identified and several unidentified people.

---||Delhi||DU executive council’s ok to censure of ex-HoD in ‘harassment’ case||NEW DELHI: Delhi University’s Executive Council has finally accepted its internal complaints committee report on the sexual harassment accusations against former head of the chemistry department, professor Ramesh Chandra. ICC had found Chandra guilty of the offences and suggested censures. On his part Chandra contested the EC accepting a 2018 report, saying he had submitted a representation to the university against the EC resolution of August 31. The professor added that two different committees constituted after the ICC findings had found him not guilty. In December 2017, a female teacher had filed a complaint of sexual harassment against the selection committee of which Chandra was the chairperson. The complaint was then looked after by ICC as per norm. Its report said, “Chandra shall be censured for his misconduct. Other members shall be issued warnings in writing. They shall not participate in the interviews of the complainant in future.” The report also noted, “In the course of the inquiry, many instances of mental harassment and improprieties as head of the department were reported before ICC. Since other forms of harassment do not fall within the mandate of ICC, in the given circumstances, ICC recommends to the university the constitution of an independent inquiry committee to examine other forms of harassment.” Recently, the complainant wrote to vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh questioning why ICC’s recommendations hadn’t been executed. According to Chandra, “My representation made to the university on October 27 against the EC resolution is yet to be considered. The university said they would separately look into the matter. When the university 2018 did not accept the ICC recommendation in 2018, why is it doing so now? This is clear vindictiveness on the part of a few people in positions of power.” When the then ICC submitted the report, it was reviewed by a sub-committee of DU’s EC, which said that the complaints were false. The then VC, Yogesh Tyagi, then constituted a three-member committee headed by retired justice S N Dhingra. Chandra said, “Justice Dhingra’s committee advised the university to hear both parties as an appellate authority. The authority was headed by S L Bhayana. It was then ruled there was no case of harassment. The panel’s report was accepted by EC. But with the pandemic and absence of VC Tyagi, things changed.” Chandra alleged, “Some people tampered with the report and it has now been accepted by EC. The action is mala fide and against the principles of natural justice.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-exec-councils-ok-to-censure-of-ex-hod-in-harassment-case/articleshow/88327844.cms||Shradha Chettri

During the current tenure of the assembly, she is the first BJP MLA to resign. BJP reacted swiftly with the state unit president Sadanand Shet Tanavade expelling her from the party for anti-party activities. “We will file a disqualification petition against her,” Tanavade told TOI. Saldanha, who participated in a party meeting on Wednesday evening to finalise plans for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the state on Sunday, did not give any intimation to the speaker’s office and submitted her resignation to the legislature secretary. Speaker Rajesh Patnekar is yet to accept her resignation. “I have resigned for a valid reason. The party seems to have forgotten all its principles and there is bedlam in the state. Nobody knows who is coming into the party and who is going out,” she said after quitting. Saldanha has been in the forefront of agitations against three linear projects that cut across the Mollem biodiversity hotspot and has been opposing the rail double-tracking passing through her constituency, as “it will destroy at least100 houses”. “As a representative of the people, it is my duty to stand by them in times of dire needs. I cannot betray their trust. But this party has lost all respect,” she said. Saldanha said she will continue to oppose these projects as her “conscience will not permit me to support them”. She said she was not meant to be a politician but stepped into the shoes of her late husband and former tourism minister Matanhy Saldanha after he died of a heart attack. “If he was here today, he would have been fasting somewhere or the other to protect the people and to protect Goa,” she said. Former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had brought Alina into politics after the demise of her husband in 2012. Parrikar ensured that she won the 2012 byelection unopposed. She was re-elected on a BJP ticket in 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-sees-its-first-exit-alina-quits-as-mla-joins-aap/articleshow/88327864.cms||Murari Shetye

The crackdown will continue in days to come and the citizens are requested to get themselves immunized at the earliest amid the threat of Omicron strain of Covid-19.” A total of 15 civic squads have been deployed by the AMC administration in different parts of the city for checking the vaccination status of the citizens. As reported by TOI, the municipal limits of Aurangabad had over 2.7 lakh vaccine defaulters before the start of the crackdown, which has already stoked the controversy. While pushing for its action of penalising vaccine defaulters, the AMC has also highlighted the detection of fresh cases of Covid-19 in the city on a daily basis. 6 new cases in city Aurangabad on Thursday reported six fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the tally of active cases to 35, as per the official data.

Five of the nine accused have now been arrested. Cyberabad police commissioner Stephen Raveendra on Thursday told media that the five accused, Y Aravind, N Murali Sridhar, P Venkat Rao, S Sandeep and P Mohan, were arrested from RC Puram railway station and 1.276 kg gold seized from them. The absconding accused are M Jashwanth, Sai Baba, Srinivas and C Srinivas. All the nine men hail from East and West Godavari in AP. The plot was put into motion by robbed real estate businessman Venkata Subramanyam’s own employee Jashwanth who has been working with him as a collection agent for almost 18 months. Cops said that Jashwanth knew Aravind and Sandeep as he frequented their restaurant in the same commercial complex in Banjara Hills where Subramanyam has an office. “Jashwanth informed Aravind and a few others during a drinking session about how his rich boss did not pay income tax. Accused then hatched the plan to pose as I-T officials to rob him,” Raveendra said. The men waited for right time when Subramanyam left for work, gained entry into his home by flashing fake I-T ID cards they had created and left with gold and cash before the family could recover from the shock of an ‘income tax raid’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/gang-followed-bwood-script-to-rob-family/articleshow/88327113.cms||---

Although the duration of the days for which the House is in session has reduced due to the pandemic, the questions asked by the MLAs also decreased by a massive 70%: from 8,777 questions raised between winter session 2014 and budget session 2016, to merely 2,620 questions raised during the winter session 2019 and budget session 2021. An analysis by Praja shows that in the first year of the 12th (2009-2014) and 13th (2014-2019) assembly, members met for a duration of 47 and 50 days respectively. However, in this current term, the members met only for 22 days in the first year. “Of the 2,620 questions raised from the winter session 2019 to Budget session 2021, only 378 were related to health. This low number is shocking as the state was facing a health emergency in the last two years,” said Milind Mhaske, director of Praja.

The two-day strike will continue Friday. These included employees in major cities and towns such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Palanpur, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Bharuch and Valsad, among others. Representatives of the Maha Gujarat Bank Employees’ Association (MGBEA) organised a rally from JP Chowk in Khanpur to Vallabh Sadan on Ashram Road in Ahmedabad. Transactions worth Rs 15,000 crore were hampered in one day according to MGBEA estimates. While online transactions continued, a lot of physical transactions were hampered around the closing of the quarter, which affected business operations according to industry players. “The issues of bankers may be genuine but when we have to fulfil orders or get letters of credit, public sector banks being shut does affect business operations,” said an Ahmedabad-based industrialist. “The bank strike was successful on Thursday. Banks will not open on Friday as well. The government must strengthen public sector banks and not weaken them or shut them down. It is public sector banks which not only help implement government schemes but also execute financial inclusion programmes, taking banking to the remotest places. Privatization will not do the banking sector any good,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, MGBEA. An estimated 4,900 bank branches remained shut across Gujarat for the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/psb-staff-want-banking-regulation-bill-withdrawn/articleshow/88327158.cms||---

Forest officials, who had earlier said they would sensitize villagers about behaviour of lions who are expected to make a permanent home here, cited complaints by locals for capturing the lions. Wildlife experts were of the opinion that lions were venturing into a new territory and the natural process should not be obstructed. On Wednesday night, cages were put in villages of Gondal and all three lions were captured. Chief conservator of forest (wildlife), DT Vasavda, said, “There were complaints from villagers and we also had discussion with local staff before taking the decision to rescue them. These lions will be released back in the wild after due process.” According to sources, the farmers wer afraid of going to their field, especially during the current winter season to water their fields, due to presence of lions in their vicinity. The loss of livestock was also an issue of concern though the forest department expedited the process of compensation. Bhushan Pandya, a member of Gujarat State Board For Wildlife said, “Gondal is a new area and people are not familiar with wildlife movements. If lions go very near to human habitat, the forest department needs to intervene because they can’t wait for human-animal conflict.” The lions have been coming to Rajkot district for the last three years and this is the third time the lions have been captured and taken back to the sanctuary area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/three-lions-near-gondal-captured-sent-to-sasan/articleshow/88326367.cms||---

Mohd Arshad Malik, who was appointed as a professor in the architecture department in 2017, alleged in his complaint that he was wrongfully terminated by the dean of the department in 2018. He had further alleged that the faculty members, in connivance with each other, fabricated his signatures on the acknowledgement book to prove that the termination notice was received by him. A magistrate court had on July 20, 2019, dismissed his petition seeking registration of FIR on his complaint, following which he had approached the sessions court against the order. Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal said the entire evidence was within the possession of Malik and no investigation by police was required for collection of any evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-court-rejects-plea-of-sacked-jamia-professor/articleshow/88327861.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government has started online portal for the relatives to apply for the ex-gratia. The relatives are, however, facing difficulties in getting the documents from the KMC — such as death certificate and treatment-related documents — if the patient was admitted in KMC run Covid treatment centres. As many as 1,261 citizens from Kolhapur city have succumbed to Covid infection as per the data available with the office of district civil surgeon. Kolhapur Municipal Corporation administrator Kadambari Balkawade said, “The relatives should bring relevant documents such as Aadhaar card, bank account details, death certificate, RT-PCR test report and other medical documents sought by government to apply to the portal. The relatives also have to submit self-declaration. The camp will help the relatives know about the process.

---||Goa||Digambar Kamat, Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco in Congress 1st list of candidates for polls||PANAJI: Breaking away from its practice of finalising the candidates at the eleventh hour, Congress on Thursday released its first list of eight candidates for the assembly elections in Goa scheduled early next year. Former CM and opposition leader Digambar Kamat and Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco names figured in the first list. However, party insiders said the second and third list of candidates are unlikely to be announced anytime soon given the chances of poaching and dissent setting in. “We had promised that we would give fresh faces and if you see the first list, most of them are new faces. Today, we have announced our candidates much in advance, much before the other parties,” state Congress president Girish Chodankar said. He said the second list of candidates will come at a later stage once the state election committee and the central committee arrive at a consensus on the candidates. The announcement of the first list marks a significant departure from the earlier trend when Congress would release the names at the last minute, making the candidates sweat it out to file the nominations. “I think it is a good thing. The second list will be released as per the laid down election screening process,” said Kamat. Besides Kamat and Lourenco, Congress has picked Sudhir Kandolkar for Mapusa constituency, former Panaji mayor Tony Rodrigues for Taleigao, Rajesh Verenkar for Ponda, Sankalp Amonkar for Mormugao, Yuri Alemao for Cuncolim and Altone D’Costa for Quepem. Verenkar is the son of former MLA Shivdas Verenkar and his selection comes after former Ponda MLA Ravi Naik quit Congress to join BJP. Despite a severe incumbency factor against BJP, Congress faces an uphill task in the coming elections. Covid-19 mismanagement, cash-for-jobs allegations and haphazard development in eco-sensitive zones has fuelled resentment against BJP. With AAP and TMC on an overdrive in the state, Congress has struggled to grab the initiative to challenge BJP’s 10-year stint in the sunny state AICC Goa desk in charge Dinesh Gundu Rao and senior election observer for Goa P Chidambaram have been touring every constituency to enthuse the party workers. Chidambaram has promised all the block workers that their choice of candidate would be given the ticket. However, most blocks have nominated three to four candidates per constituency, making selection of candidates difficult. On November 21, Congress had said that it would announce the first list of its candidates by November-end or first week of December, while making it clear that the MLAs who had defected and joined other parties would not be considered. Congress, usually known for indecisiveness and its inability to finalise candidates or the alliance partners, makes it brutal and nerve-wrecking for ticket aspirants. For the 2017 assembly polls, voters saw a comedy of sorts as the party asked Joseph Silva and Rohan Chodankar to file their nominations from Fatorda and Siolim constituencies, respectively. By then Silva had already filed his nomination on a Goa Vikas Party ticket and went on to file another on Congress ticket. The party high command later directed both the candidates to drop out of the fray. This time around, Congress appears to be singing a similar tune, speaking about a probable alliance with Goa Forward Party, only to reject the notion the next day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/digambar-reginaldo-in-cong-1st-list-of-candidates-for-polls/articleshow/88327857.cms||Newton Sequeira

---||Pune||As schools reopen, parents expect learning gap to taper over time||Pune: The reopening of city schools for Class I onwards on Thursday, after a gap of almost 20 months, came as a huge relief for parents struggling to ensure comprehensive education of their wards at home. A group of parents were of the view that the schools should stay open to compensate for the learning gap the students have incurred. A majority of parents agreed that their children had been waiting to go to school, in spite of their apprehensions on the safety aspects due to Covid 19. Swati Kalve, whose daughter studies in Std II at Ratnaprabha Mohite-Patil School, said her child would not sit still and attend the online classes. “She would become restless after five minutes and then it was a task to make her sit and listen. We were really looking forward to the school reopening. Yes, there has been some fear of Covid 19, but then even at home, she goes out and plays the whole day long. So, we thought she would be safer in school too,” Kalve said. Vaishali Ghate, mother of two, said the school reopening has been the best decision as far as children from economically disadvantaged families are concerned. “We do not have the finances to fund two cellphones, two internet recharges, among other things. We just have one smartphone in the house. This was alternatively used by both my children, which means every day, one of them had to miss the class,” Ghate said. Meenal Dalvi, another parent whose daughter attended Class III at Meenatai Thackeray PMC school, said for students living in slum areas, reopening the schools has been a blessing. “Even if we gave her a smartphone, there is no space in the house where she can sit quietly and study. The slum is always noisy,” Dalvi said. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said they had planned to call 50% of the total students every alternative day, to school. “On day 1, we had 50% attendance of the 50% who were supposed to come. We are sure that the attendance will rise in the coming days. The PMC education officer gifted pen to all our students,” she said. While PMC education department’s Minakshi Raut did not respond to calls or messages on the attendance of students on Day 1, Smita Gaud, education officer of PCMC, said in 128 PCMC schools, 60% of the total 45,000 students enrolled, attended classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/as-schools-reopen-parents-expect-learning-gap-to-taper-over-time/articleshow/88327163.cms||---

The SOPs include mandatory use of masks for all students and bus staff and provision of hand sanitizers in the vehicles. It has also been said that the driver, conductor and female attendant in each bus should be fully vaccinated. Also, every bus can carry students to only 50% of its respective capacity, the SOPs stated. If any student shows symptoms, their parents must be immediately contacted. Proper social distancing has to be maintained at all times and only buses with proper valid permits and papers will ply.

---||Delhi||Riots: Witnesses ‘reliable’, charges framed against 10||New Delhi: A court has framed charges of rioting and arson against 10 people in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying from their utterances, as mentioned by witnesses, it is clear that their object was to create panic in the minds of “the people belonging to Hindu community, (and) to threaten them to leave the country”. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said on December 13, “The material on record prima facie discloses that the accused were allegedly the members of an unlawful assembly on February 25, 2020, which had been formed with the object to create fear and panic among the people belonging to Hindu community, to threaten them to leave the country and to cause arson, loot etc as well as to set ablaze the shops/houses belonging to them.” If the evidence, as annexed with the chargesheet, remains unrebutted, the conviction of the accused is reasonably possible, the court said. “Thus, there is no escape from the conclusion at this stage that the accused were members of a unlawful assembly, which resorted to vandalisation, rioting etc. and in the process robbed & set ablaze the workshop belonging to the complainant’s son,” it added. The court framed charges of rioting, mischief by fire, house trespass with preparation to assault, robbery and unlawful assembly against Mohd Shahnawaz, Mohd Shoaib, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali, Parvez, Mohd Faisal, Rashid and Mohd Tahir. It noted that the fact that the three police witnesses had recognised different sets of the accused in the mob participating in the riotous acts indicated that they were truthful and reliable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-witnesses-reliable-charges-framed-against-10/articleshow/88327876.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

While only 51 villages in the district have achieved 100% full vaccination. Interestingly, the villages with the most vaccination coverage are from the hilly tehsils of the district. For instance, Chandgad tehsil, which is located at the southernmost part of the district has 107 villages, where 100% first dose vaccination has been completed. Ajara and Radhanagari, both the hilly tehsils have 25 and 24 villages each with 100% full vaccination. Gaganbawda tehsil has one village which has achieved 100% full vaccination. Apart from these tehsils, not even a single village has completed 100% vaccination with both doses. District collector Rahul Rekhawar has asked the health authorities to focus on the villages with poor vaccination turnout. The authorities have claimed that in most villages, 80% of the beneficiaries have been given the first dose and in many villages, more than 60% of the beneficiaries are fully vaccinated. “In the next one or two weeks, we aim to achieve 100% first dose vaccination across all 1,212 villages. The villages in the hilly areas have achieved high vaccination because of sparse population. Despite the distantly located hamlets, we have managed to get the beneficiaries to the nearby place where our vaccination van could reach,” said Sale. The district administration has set a target of vaccinating 30.14 lakh beneficiaries above 18 years of age. So far, 91% of the beneficiaries have been vaccinated with the first dose, and 61% with the second dose. The administration is focusing on the village for vaccination to ensure that the herd immunity is developed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/413-kolhapur-villages-achieve-100-first-dose-vaccination/articleshow/88325593.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Shifting of industries beyond Outer Ring Road may take at least 2 years||HYDERABAD: Though the industries department and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure have begun shifting of over 1,700 polluting industries outside the Outer Ring Road (ORR), the entire process is likely to be completed only after two to three years. The reason, of the 1,700 industries which were categorised as red, 800 are pharma companies that would be relocated to Hyderabad Pharma City, which is being readied at Mucherla. Also, the pharma companies need to get approvals from various agencies. “Though pharma companies are technically demarcated as red, they are not causing any major air and groundwater pollution and not emanating any toxic gases as the pollution levels are being monitored by the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB). There is no major threat to the residents also. Necessary safety measures are in place now,” Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary of Telangana industries and commerce department told TOI on Thursday. However, all the polluting industries would be relocated outside the ORR in a phased manner as lands have already been identified for shifting them. At the same time, the industries department has begun insisting some industries to shift their units beyond ORR limits. The TSIIC has fixed deadline for shifting of 35 steel and iron industries from Katedan and Jeedimetla to Rakamcherla in Vikarabad district before April, 2022 and the firms have been asked to submit detailed project reports (DPRs) on their plans of relocation of the units before January 10. “We had conducted a meeting with iron and steel industries a couple of days ago and asked them to shift immediately. If they complete the relocation works before April, 2022 to identified 150 acres in Rakamcherla, their units will be closed and their permissions will be cancelled by the government,” TSIIC chairman Gyadari Rajamallu said. He said the companies were first given notices in 2008 itself. Official sources said the TSIIC had identified as many as 22 locations for shifting of polluting industries by the EPTRI. “Industrial park, Buchinepally in Zaheerabad for shifting of edible oil industries, industrial park at Indrakaran in Sangareddy for textile industries and industrial park at Rakamcherla in Pudur mandal in Vikarabad district for steel rolling industries were identified. Infrastructure facilites have already been provided at the industrial parks,” a senior official of TSIIC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shifting-of-industries-beyond-orr-may-take-at-least-2-yrs/articleshow/88327175.cms||Koride Mahesh

In the Omicron variant of Covid-19, S-gene is absent in the RT-PCR tests and the kit will be useful in early detection of the variant. Chhagan Bhujbal, the district guardian minister, who conducted the Covid review meeting of the officials said that since genome sequencing for Covid patients is done at NIV Pune, it takes a lot of time before they conclude the presence or absences of variant. “So we have decided to buy these kits and use them specifically for the persons with a travel history and their high-risk contacts as the Omicron virus has the ability to spread fast,” Bhujbal said. The regular RT-PCR kit costs Rs 70, while the one used for S-gene testing would cost Rs 210 per kit. “The kits are costly but important to contain the spread of the virus. We will, therefore, keep these kits at stand by to ensure we test high-risk people and save time,” Bhujbal said. Kailas Jadhav, the NMC commissioner said, “In cases of Omicron positive patients, the health and the administrative authorities will be able to act more precisely with help of these kits.” Speaking about the Covid situation and preparedness, Bhujbal said that currently, the situation is normal. “At the peak of the second wave, we required 135 MT of oxygen. Now, we have 373 MT oxygen at government establishments and 200 MT with the industries. We are further increasing the storages in the next few days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-purchase-10000-s-gene-rt-pcr-test-kits/articleshow/88325603.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Rawat went on to say that it was the Congress that restoed the lost glory of Kedarnath after the June 2013 disaster. “I was made the CM in 2014 and still remember Rahul Gandhi telling me to see that the works at Kedarnath should be completed at the earliest and also ensure that pilgrims felt safe and the yatra resumed as soon as possible,” said Rawat. “It was an outcome of the works done by Congress government that the yatra resumed and devotees in large numbers came for the Kedarnath yatra. We created an environment of safety. Rahul Gandhi himself trekked to Kedarnath to send out a strong message across the country.” The former CM pointed out that on the lines of the protest against the farm laws, Uttarakhand, too, witnessed an unprecedented protest against the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. “Following intense protests by the priests, BJP government was forced to repeal the law,” he said. Bringing up the rising inflation issue, the former CM said, “Due to the anti-people policies of government, men are suffering due to price rise and kitchen stocks are at the brink.” Assuring the huge turnout at the Parade ground of a corruption-free government if voted to power, Harish Rawat said, “We will see that people are given employment and tourism prospers in the state.” Leader of Opposition Pritam Singh said, “The state is going through a tough phase and people have high expectations from Rahul Gandhi. Farmers are depressed and disappointed. People sitting in power had promised to waive farm loans, but they failed to deliver on the promise. Even as we stand on the threshold of election, the youth are still unemployed.” Singh said that the Congress has stood with the farmers and the youth. “The government is being run by the land, mining and liquor mafias. Government has proved a failure in handling Covid-19 situation and the corruption has been rampant. If voted to power, we will appoint Lokayukta in the state,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-restored-kedarnaths-lost-glory-harish-rawat/articleshow/88324815.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Mumbai||Matter of principal: I-T appeals in capital gains case of Rs 1,329||Mumbai: In a recent hearing, the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Mumbai bench, found before it an appeal filed by the tax department in a dispute where the capital gains amounted to just Rs 1,329. The appeal was filed by the income-tax (I-T) department as the scrip traded by the taxpayer was among those under the penny stock scam radar. Penny stock scam refers to manipulation of scrips of small companies that are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Typically, cash is paid by the trader, who then receives capital gains via banking channels. This facilitates conversion of black money into white. To cut down on litigation, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had in August 2018 notified that the I-T department can file an appeal with the ITAT only if the tax effect is Rs 50 lakh. Tax effect means the difference between the tax on the total income assessed by the I-T department and the tax levy without considering the income relating to disputed issues. In exceptional cases, such as tax evasion, though, the I-T department can file an appeal, irrespective of this threshold. In this case, the I-T department referred to the exception available for tax evasion cases and filed an appeal with the ITAT. To take a step back, the I-T officer had received information from the investigation wing that the taxpayer had traded Rs 1.6 lakh in the scrip of SVC Resources. Certain individuals had been penalised from manipulation of various scrips, including those of this company. Thus, the I-T officer held Rs 1.6 lakh to be an unexplained cash credit in the hands of the taxpayer. This sum would be taxable under Section 68 at the rate of nearly 84%. All instances of trading in a scrip which is under the scanner cannot be seen as tainted and facts of each case have to be seen, was the firm view taken by the appellate commissioner. The taxpayer explained that during fiscal year 2010-11, he had purchased 1,300 shares of SVC Resources for Rs 2,61,099, sold it for Rs. 2,62,428 and earned a capital gain of only Rs 1,329. These transactions were carried out via his demat account. Based on these facts the commissioner (appeals) passed an order in favour of the taxpayer . Aggrieved by this order, the I-T department filed an appeal with the tax tribunal, which was dismissed. The ITAT reiterated that the amount of capital gains was meager and the transactions were via demat. In its recent order, it said: “The I-T officer has not even bothered to find out what is the gain and what is the cost price. Without any application of mind, he has treated the entire amount of Rs 1.6 lakh as taxable under Section 68.” Further, the I-T officer does not even mention whether any action had been taken against the taxpayer by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which could strengthen the alleged assumption of manipulation, the ITAT pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/matter-of-principal-i-t-appeals-in-capital-gains-case-of-rs-1329/articleshow/88327878.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Offline HSC, SSC exams in March||PUNE: The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will conduct offline examinations for Class X (SSC) from March 15 to April 18 next year, while those for Class XII (HSC) will be held from March 4 to April 7 next year. The curriculum was earlier trimmed by 25% due to Covid-19 pandemic. Keeping this in mind, exam questions will be from the reduced syllabus only. Practicals, grade/orals and internal assessment for HSC and SSC exams will be held from February 14 to March 3, 2022, and February 25 to March 14, 2022, respectively. The board will release a exam timetable, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted on Thursday. “Based on the feedback and consultations with diverse stakeholders, we are hereby announcing the examination schedule for Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) and the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) board exams. Our efforts are to declare the HSC results by the second week of June 2022, and SSC results by the second week of July 2022. The health and wellbeing of students remain our priority. To ensure a conducive environment for the students, we held a series of consultations with schools, principals, headmasters, teachers and experts regarding the assessment mode and exam schedule. Their suggestions were incorporated,” the minister tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/offline-hsc-ssc-exams-in-march/articleshow/88327180.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 50% 1st year Inter students fail exam||HYDERABAD: More than half of all Intermediate first year students, from the 2020-21 batch, have failed to clear the examination, triggering massive angst among students and parents. The results announced on Thursday showed that 49% cleared the exam while 51% could not. Owing to the pandemic, the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE) had provisionally promoted first year students, admitted in the 2020-21 academic year, to second year. After a long wait, the TSBIE conducted first year exams from October 25 to November 3. Many students attributed their failure to the lack of understanding lessons through online classes. Barring 40 days of regular physical classes, the TSBIE and college managements arranged all classes through Doordarshan, T-Sat and online lectures. “I failed to clear my Maths paper as I could not grasp anything that was being taught in the online classes,” said S K Shafi, an intermediate student. Apart from Maths, majority students failed to clear main subjects like Physics, English and Biology. Parents blamed the TSBIE for conducting the exams amid a pandemic, despite promoting students to the next year. They claimed it built additional pressure on students. “The results revealed the board’s inappropriate decision to hold exams during a difficult time. Now that all the students are in second year, what about their fate? The TSBIE must award minimum pass marks to all failed students. Those who wish to reappear for supplementary exam should be allowed,” said Nagati Narayana, president of Telangana Parents Association. Although the TSBIE had cut the syllabus by 30% last year, teachers claimed that the number of academic days were fewer resulting in non-completion of syllabus in many colleges. Poor access to online education, especially in rural areas, reflects a further divide, they said. “Students from urban areas with better facilities fared better than their counterparts from the rural areas. It reflects poor penetration of online education, especially in rural areas,” said Madhusudan Reddy, president of Telangana Government Junior Colleges Association. As per data, less than 30% students from Medak and Vikarabad have cleared the first year Intermediate exams. Despite multiple attempts, Omer Jaleel, secretary, TSBIE could not be contacted for a comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/50-1st-yr-inter-students-fail-exam/articleshow/88327177.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Lawyers seeking adjournments reason for delay in appeals’||MUMBAI: Observing that in “most” pending criminal appeals “where accused is on bail”, lawyers tend to seek adjournments over one reason or another, the Bombay high court said “it is in such scenario that there is pendency of criminal appeals”. “It is difficult for courts to expedite hearing of criminal appeals since there is no proper cooperation from advocates on record in the respective matters. Bar Council is requested to take note of this fact,” said the bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan while hearing a 23-year-old criminal appeal against conviction, when advocate appearing for appellant sought an adjournment. “It is commonly seen that advocates do not take responsibility of conducting criminal appeals at the final hearing stage,” said the HC. “In one case, the accused brought before the court upon issuance of bailable warrant informed us that they did not know the advocate representing them,” said the HC. The HC said in many cases it has had to first issue a bailable warrant and then a non-bailable warrant. The bench also said that in certain cases, it had issued notice to the accused in custody informing that their “advocates do not appear or are now representing the prosecution and therefore, unable to conduct the matter.” The Court directed issuance of non-bailable warrant against the appellant in the case—a Solapur resident, and had posted it for Thursday, December 16. It was an appeal against conviction in a murder case. On Thursday, the appellant appeared before the HC on his own, wheelchair bound. Advocate Rushikesh Kale appearing for him on Thursday said since 1998 lawyers were not in contact with the convict, though the matter had appeared on board for hearing in 2005, in 2018 and on many dates since. Kale said the appellant met with an accident in 2002 and submitted his disability certificate. Additional public prosecutor Arfan Sait said he learnt of the accident only now. On an oral plea by Kale who said his client approached him on Wednesday, the HC then recalled its order of NBW against the appellant accepting Kale’s oral plea in the interest of justice and fixed the appeal for final hearing on January 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lawyers-seeking-adjournments-reason-for-delay-in-appeals/articleshow/88327881.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||New defence corridors putting established defence ecosystems at disadvantage||Hyderabad: The Telangana government feels that new defence corridors, that provide various sops for investors, are creating disadvantages for investors who are keen on setting up base in established defence ecosystems such as Hyderabad or Bengaluru, a top Telangana government official said on Thursday. “One gets additional advantages in terms of offsets when one sets up units in defence corridors. While companies are keen on participating in defence and aerospace manufacturing in an established ecosystem like Hyderabad, they feel that the level playing field is no longer there and they are at a disadvantage,” Telangana IT and industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said while addressing participants virtually at the CII Telangana Defence Conclave. However, Sanjay Jaju, additional secretary, department of defence production, said the sops offered in the defence corridors is a very small factor and any investors, who look to invest in the country look at multiple factors and Hyderabad scores well due to its matured ecosystem. The Centre has decided to set up two defence industrial corridors in the country -- one in Tamil Nadu and the other in Uttar Pradesh. Satheesh Reddy, secretary, department of defence R&D, and chairman, DRDO, said Hyderabad is a strong base for the defence and aerospace sector and is expected to flourish in a big way in the future due to the massive opportunities that the sector will offer because of the Atmanirbhar campaign. Rudra Jadeja, MD & CEO, Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems, said that the Indian defence sector needs to increase investments in R&D and also tap exports opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/new-defence-corridors-putting-established-defence-ecosystems-at-disadvantage/articleshow/88327192.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Rahul Gandhi defamation case deferred by Bombay HC to Jan||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday deferred beyond January 25 the proceedings in a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi. Hearing a petition from Gandhi to quash the case, the HC adjourned the matter to January 18, and directed the Mumbai magistrate court to defer proceedings in the defamation case to beyond January 25, 2022. The defamation complaint is related to an alleged remark posted on social media about Prime Minister Narendra Modi in September 2018, following a rally in Rajasthan. The complainant Mahesh Shrishrimal (46), a member of the BJP Maharashtra Pradesh Committee from Mumbai, submitted that inherent powers of the HC to quash must be exercised with caution and circumspection, especially when there is alternate and efficacious remedy available in law. The complainant said the Girgaon Magistrate had issued summons after considering the preliminary evidence produced before it and hence sought dismissal of Gandhi’s petition. Gandhi seeks dismissal of the defamation complaint on the ground that “there is absolutely no truth to the complaint”, and terming it “frivolous and vexatious litigations by his political adversaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rahul-gandhi-defamation-case-deferred-by-bombay-hc-to-jan/articleshow/88327889.cms||---

CryptocurrencyLiveIn its latest report, ‘Highlights & Observations From 2021: The Year Of Crypto,’WazirX has stated that for 44% of its respondents, crypto comprises up to 10% of their overall investment portfolio. “Interestingly, only 11% of respondents in the age group of ‘51 years and above’ said they have allocated over 50% of their total portfolio to crypto whereas the same is true for 29% of respondents in the age group of ‘18 - 24 years,’ the report said. As per the report, more people are relying on crypto as a hedge to protect their traditional investment portfolios against inflation. In fact, WazirX witnessed a record trading volume of over $43 billion in 2021 and its user base touched 10 million in November this year as compared to less than a million users in November 2020. Commenting on the findings, Nischal Shetty, CEO, WazirX said that investors are evolving and recognising crypto as an emerging alternative asset class. “The government’s impetus towards a regulated approach for crypto would put India on the world map with other developed countries dealing in crypto,” he said. Not just as a mode of investment, crypto investors are even fancying a career in this emerging space as 54% of respondents stated that they would be interested in pursuing a career in the crypto space, with entrepreneurship, finance and business development being the top career choices. As per data from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph team, in India the crypto industry, directly or indirectly, employs about 50,000 people. According to a Nasscom report, the crypto market in India has the potential to create over 8 lakh jobs by 2030. When it comes to investment, an interesting fact is that Bitcoin dominance has been on a steady decline as with higher awareness, people are investing in other popular cryptos like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano, among others. “2021 saw a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s dominance in trading volume from 70% to 40%. Although Bitcoin was the most traded crypto on WazirX in 2020 as well as in 2021, its contribution to our overall trading volume has plummeted,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/cryptocurrency/bitcoin/investors-increasing-share-of-crypto-assets-in-overall-investments-portfolio-report/articleshow/88327184.cms||Swati Rathor

Malik said the suit filed by Dnyandev Wankhede is with “oblique intent to suppress illegalities committed” by him and his son, which Malik claimed he brought to light. Malik in his reply said, “The suit is filed with mala fide motive to mislead this court and obtain favourable orders, and in that manner, restrict my fundamental rights and prevent me from revealing the illegalities committed particularly by...son Sameer Wankhede.” Wankhede has alleged that Malik posted defamatory tweets about him and his family as the NCB had arrested his son-in-law in a drugs case earlier in the year. He was later released on bail in September. Last month, the HC single judge bench of Justice Madhav Jamdar had observed in an ad-interim order that tweets made by Malik, a spokesperson for the NCP were “actuated by malice or personal animosity”. The court, however, did not grant a blanket order to restrain Malik as sought by Wankhede. In an appeal by Wankhedhe before a division bench, Malik undertook not to comment against Wankhede and his family till an interim plea is decided. The HC is to hear the matter in the new year. Malik in his reply said, “The NCB has been cracking down on persons, especially celebrities, who were found in possession of small quantities of drugs as opposed to arresting drug traffickers. The NCB seemed to be interested in arresting consumers of drugs instead of affording them an opportunity to reform…” He said in November 2020, he had in his capacity as NCP spokesperson said that “NCB was interested in targeting celebrities to seek publicity”. Malik said, “evidence published by me shows the illegal manner in which Mr Wankhede has acquired his job…under scheduled caste category thereby depriving a genuine SC candidate opportunity of employment and livelihood by suppressing that he was born a Muslim.” Dnyandev Wankhede, a retired police officer had submitted before the HC a caste certificate and his son’s tenth standard school leaving certificate to counter Malik’s claims. Malik’s affidavit says, “material available on record shows that Sameer Wankhede is leading a dual life — as a Muslim and a Hindu.” Wankhede will now file his rejoinder to Malik’s reply||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-defamation-suit-bid-to-mislead-court-says-malik/articleshow/88327910.cms||---

On Wednesday morning, she left for work while the girl and the man were at home. On her return, the woman found the flat locked from outside, which was unusual,” an officer said. She made a call to the accused to find out about her daughter, but he allegedly gave a suspicious response, the officer said. The door was forced open and the girl’s body was found. The woman and her daughter used to fight with the man over his liquor addiction, and the victim often insulted him, police were told.

The legacy, or whatever pretensions that had remained of it for BJP, ended on Thursday with Alina severing her ties with the saffron party after she resigned as MLA, clearly disillusioned with the party’s departure from its once lofty principles. “I was never meant to be a politician,” she said after submitting her resignation to the speaker.“If I am here today it is because I am in the shoes of late Mathany who died of a heart attack out of sheer exhaustion having worked hard to win as BJP MLA. If Mathany were to be here today, he would have been fasting somewhere or the other to protect his Goa.” BJP sources said that the party had already decided not to field Saldanha in the forthcoming assembly elections considering her dwindling political stock, and that her exit wouldn’t affect the party’s fortunes. Political observers seem to agree with the party on that count. “Alina is no longer politically relevant for BJP, nor for any other political party,” said political commentator Prabhakar Timble. “The warmth of emotions following Mathany’s untimely demise that led her to victory is now obviously no longer felt. Besides, though Alina tried to take up people’s issues, she was clearly cold-shouldered by the party. Considering that she was carrying Mathany’s baton, she failed to live up to people’s expectations.” Besides, with Alina’s supporters harbouring a deep-rooted aversion towards BJP, political observers feel it was unlikely she would have had a smooth sailing as a BJP candidate in the forthcoming polls. Timble felt Saldanha’s political stock took a downward spiral after BJP overlooked her for a cabinet position during her second term in the assembly. “Had she taken some aggressive steps then, may be launching a movement, or resigning and re-contesting, BJP would have come under pressure and her fortunes probably risen.” Nevertheless, Alina’s exit from BJP has left her bete noire, panchayat minister Mauvin Godinho, elated. Speaking to reporters, Godinho said that with Alina’s resignation as MLA, he was now “more sure of getting all four seats” of Mormugao taluka for BJP – Cortalim, Vasco and Mormugao, besides Dabolim, his home constituency. “I can say with all emphasis that BJP will win all four seats, because last time I had a very difficult time getting Alina elected,” Godinho said. Political observers have sniffed the emergence of another power centre in Godinho in the wake of the latest developments. “Godinho now gets a free hand,” Rajendra Kakodkar, a political observer said. “After Atanasio Monserrate, Michael Lobo and Vishwajit Rane, Godinho will now be the fourth power centre in the government, claiming to have his dominion in all four constituencies of Mormugao taluka.” With Saldanha now joining AAP, and Olencio Simoes who had contested on the AAP ticket in the 2017 polls having now joined Congress, and MGP which has forged an alliance with TMC set to contest the seat, the stage is set for a multi-cornered contest in Cortalim. While the situation appears fluid, political observers said that with parties yet to zero in on their candidates, several names are being tossed about.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-alinas-exit-from-bjp-mauvin-likely-to-hold-reins-of-4-seats-in-s-goa/articleshow/88327927.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

The joint committee will have representatives from the Union environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Telangana PCB, National Wetland Authority and State Wetland Authority. NGT, in the order, said: “The government report does not give a complete picture of the remedial measures, as was expected. There is a continued concretisation and construction in the lake and a change in the FTL markings. It is orally explained by the officer of the State PCB that two STPs of 10MLD and 5MLD are operating and the sewage received in 10MLD STP from Kings Colony, Rasheed Colony and Raghavendra Colony is 1MLD. Fencing work is being undertaken. These facts are orally stated, but not mentioned in the report. The same needs verification also.” Activist Lubna Sarwat had filed a petition in NGT against the encroachments and sewage treatment drains into the lake. “Since satisfactory action still remains to be taken and exact status is not clear, it is necessary to constitute an independent committee to verify the actual status. The committee may ascertain compliance of the Wetland Rules,” the NGT said. Earlier TSPCB had filed a report to NGT. In the report, PCB said: “Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials have laid two diversion pipelines. One diversion box channel is laid from Kings Colony to Rasheed Colony. No sewage water is entering the lake from Kings Colony and Rasheed Colony. Another pipeline coming from Raghavendra Colony to the existing box drain is completed. No sewage water is entering the lake from Raghavendra Colony. The entire sewage water is diverted from the lake through two diversion lines and finally joining STP at Mir Alam Tank for treatment.” “The construction and demolition waste, which was earlier lying near the lake, has been removed and no further dumping was observed. The GHMC officials have installed four CCTV cameras to monitor the illegal dumping of construction and demolition waste. The fencing work is partly provided for Bum-Rukn-Ud-Dowla Lake. Fencing in remaining parts has not been taken up due to court cases,” the PCB report added.

The United Federation of RWAs (UFERWAS), the apex body which leads over 4,500 RWAs in Greater Hyderabad and its periphery, has got about 250 RWAs to put on paper various issues such as poor sanitation, bad roads, flooded streets and saving the city’s lakes for the corporators to chew on in the meeting. “The feedback we got is that many colonies have bad roads and poor sanitation, mainly in GHMC periphery,” said UFERWAS general secretary B T Srinivasan. Even before the GHMC polls last year, UFERWAS had done a marathon exercise of getting feedback from citizens under ‘My City-My Choice’ campaign and forwarded it to contesting candidates. “But after they were elected, they ignored it all,” said Dasarath Reddy, from an RWA in Tarnaka. One major demand of RWAs is constitution of ‘ward committees’ with at least 50% of their members. Congress corporator M Rajitha said, “I have sent questions on expense between 2014 and 2021 for road repair, funds to SRDP and SNDP, and sharing of central and state funds to GHMC commissioner, but till date I have not got a reply.” While deputy mayor and Tarnaka corporator Mothe Srilatha said, “Foundation stone has been laid for work such as underground drains and funds sanctioned for some works in my division. I will inform about civic issues that have been resolved during the meeting.” “We hope our feedback will help the civic body find the best solution in the council meeting,” said N Sitarama Raju, a resident of L B Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rwas-pin-hopes-on-ghmc-meet-to-end-old-woes/articleshow/88327212.cms||Sunil Mungara

These items were recently accorded the geographical indication (GI) tag — a status that protects the produce from being illegally used and ensures benefits to the local growers’ community. The Moira banana — or Myndoli kellim in Konkani — is so named because it is believed to have first been introduced to the village of Moira, Bardez, by Franciscan priests. Harmal chilli is from Pernem, specifically, the coastal village of Arambol. The chillies were introduced to Goa by the Portuguese, and many varieties are now grown locally. The khajem (kaddio boddio) are a staple at church feasts and the village festivals in Goa. The Goa Postal Division also released, digitally, the permanent pictorial cancellation on the Margao head post office at the hands of postmaster general of Goa, S F H Rizvi. A special cover and special cancellation on the Voice of Liberation, a philatelic passport on the temples of Goa and postcards on three Post-Crossing Meetup were also released.

---||Chandigarh||Rath Yatra: 100 volunteers to ensure city roads are kept clean||Nidhi. Bhardwaj@timesgroup.com Ludhiana With a message of cleanliness, organisers of the upcoming Krishan Balram Rath Yatra are going to engage 100 volunteers who will maintain cleanliness before and after Rath Yatra scheduled for December 19. The organisers claimed that usually, Rath Yatra organisers face criticism because of filth that is left behind but this time, they will ensure that the trash is lifted as soon as the chariot passed from that route. Last year, due to Covid 19 restrictions, the Rath Yatra could not take place. The Yatra will begin from Durga Mata Mandir and end in Nav Durga Mandir, Sarabha Nagar, while passing through Fountain Chowk, Ghumar Mandi, Aarti Chowk and Ferozepur Road. At Aarti Chowk, Ganga Aarti will be the main attraction for which priests have been invited from Haridwar. Also, at two three locations, 56 types of bhogs will be offered to the Lord through crane. One of the oganisers of the event, Sanjeev Sood, said, “There is great enthusiasm among the devotees for this rath Yatra, which is being organised after two years. Though Corona scare has come down a bit, we will ensure distribution of masks and sanitizers at the event and those who require the same can get the same free of cost.” Regarding sanitation, he said 100 volunteers would be deputed for this cause and when the chariot will pass a particular stretch, they will clean everything up. The idea is to spread the message of cleanliness through this practice. ” Meanwhile, a devotee named Manisha Sharma said, “It will be a great thing to celebrate as rath yatra is a big event. Every year, we used to take part but due to Covid 19, it could not be held regularly.” She said they will go and pay obeisance to the Lord along with family members. Another devotee, Kamal Kapoor, said that while organising such events, organisers should keep the convenience of the public in mind as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rath-yatra-100-volunteers-to-ensure-city-roads-are-kept-clean/articleshow/88326450.cms||---

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar took on Koshyari over inordinate delay in nominating 12 eminent persons from different walks of life on the legislative council. “In the House of 288, we have a clear majority, with support of 170 legislators. More than a year ago, we submitted a list of 12 eminent persons to the Raj Bhavan, however, the Governorhas not taken any decision. What does this indicate? Is it acceptable in democracy? Governor has powers to take a final decision as per rules, he must give an opportunity to eminent persons to be members of the legislative council,” Pawar said. Pawar had to face a volley of questions on the state cabinet decision on appointment of Vice-Chancellor. “We are not curtailing the powers of the Governor on appointment of Vice-Chancellor but simplifying the procedure for their appointment based on recommendations made by a team of experts,” Pawar said. As per the revised proposal, a committee of experts will recommend five to six names to the state government, of which the state government will submit two names to Raj Bhavan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dy-cm-takes-on-guv-over-nomination-of-mlcs-vc-issue/articleshow/88327931.cms||---

In both cases, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana said the supplementary chargesheet had not been filed till date despite a lapse of about two years. In one of the cases related to culpable homicide, the court noted that the matter was pending at the stage of charge for the past several dates for the want of the FSL (forensic) result/ supplementary chargesheet and the SHO was directed to appear before it to explain what was impeding the filing of the same. “Despite service, neither the SHO has opted to appear before the court nor any explanation has been tendered and even no supplementary challan filed till date despite lapse of about more than two years. In these circumstances, I am once again constrained to adjourn the matter,” the court said in the order. In the second case registered under Section 302 (murder) IPC, the judge noted that the matter was fixed for clarification regarding filing of the supplementary chargesheet and for arguments on the pending bail application of an accused.

---||Delhi||Delhi high court stays ban on cross-gender massage in spas||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday stayed the prohibition on cross-gender massage services in the city, saying there was no “reasonable connection” between the ban and preventing trafficking or prostitution at spas. “I am of the prima facie view that this kind of absolute ban on cross-gender massage can’t be said to have any reasonable connection with the aim of the policy, which is to regulate the functioning of spas and ensure no illegal trafficking or prostitution takes place in the city,” Justice Rekha Palli noted. TimesViewThe spas are a source of employment for many. A blanket ban to address the fact that some are operating illegally is akin to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. The court has taken the right step.The high court said though the authorities ought to regulate spa centres to check illegal activities, the policy to impose a ban was framed without any consultation with professionals involved in spa services. Noting that only 400 out of 5,000 spas have valid licences, the high court directed Delhi Police and municipal corporations to carry out an inspection in their areas within one week and take appropriate steps to close all unlicensed spas. In case any illegality is found during the inspection, the police will register cases and immediately pass the information to the municipal bodies for action, the HC said. The court was hearing a batch of petitions by owners of some spa centres and therapists challenging the Delhi government’s move to ban cross-gender massages and the consequent directions passed by the municipal corporations. Meanwhile, Delhi government and Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) defended the policy, saying such a ban was meant to protect women and children from the menace of prostitution at the spa centres. DCW told the court it conducted extensive inspections, an independent inquiry and also interacted with young girls and women engaged in the trade and found that the provision under which spa centres permitted cross-gender massage was being grossly misused. However, the high court said that a ban can’t be imposed suddenly without any consultation when petitioners have valid licences and added that it is also aware of the fact that the pandemic has affected their livelihoods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-stays-ban-on-cross-gender-massage-in-spas/articleshow/88328460.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: KDMC draws up plan to raze 20,000 illegal bldgs||Kalyan: A slew of measures has been planned to curb illegal constructions in Kalyan-Dombivli. The civic body on Thursday decided to initiate action against about 20,000 such ‘illegal’ structures that have sprung up in the twin city over the past few years. The action is slated to begin in two weeks. The expense of demolishing an illegal structure will be recovered from the property holder or its owner by billing the cost of razing to the property tax or showing it as a pending due to the 7/12 extract of the property. If the property owner fails to pay up, the property could also end up being attached. This decision was made at a meeting of officials of the civic body, police and power distributor. Municipal commissioner Dr Vijay Suryawanshi told TOI, “There are around 20,000 such [illegal] structures, most of them in chawls and a few in buildings. Suryawanshi said, “The action will start in the next 15 days and it will continue over the next three months.” The civic body’s also plans to demolish unauthorised constructions that have come up on reserved plots. During the meeting, the civic chief directed officials of the state power distributor, MSEDCL, to not provide electricity to unauthorised constructions. He also directed the police officials to initiate action against against unauthorised constructions filed earlier by the civic body. The civic chief said that notices will be issued to occupants of such illegal structures. “If the residents fail to produce any document, we will initiated action,” said Suryawanshi. Bharatiya Janata Party’s legislator Ravindra Chavan targeted the Kalyan-Dombivli civic body over its priorities. “Currently, all civic bodies are concentrating on achieving 100% vaccination, especially amid the Omicron threat, by launching door-to-door vaccination drives.

Its commercial arm New Space India Ltd inked the pacts for launching the satellites by India’s mainstay rocket PSLV, Union space minister Jitendra Singh said. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Singh also informed that about 132 million euros will be earned through launches of these foreign satellites on a commercial basis. In another written reply, the minister said that from 1999 to till date, a total of 342 foreign satellites belonging to 34 countries have been successfully launched on board PSLV on a commercial basis. He said that through launches of these foreign satellites, India has earned a foreign exchange revenue of approx $35 million and 10 million euros during the last three years (2019 to 2021). The types of foreign satellites that were launched include satellites primarily for earth observation, scientific and technology demonstration purposes. A total number of 124 indigenous satellites, including 12 student satellites, have also been put into Earth’s orbit. In another written reply to the Upper House, Singh said the development of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV or mini-PSLV) is in the final stages and the first developmental flight of SSLV is targeted during the first quarter of 2022. The SSLV will provide a payload capability of 500kg and can launch satellite(s) up to an orbit of 500 km altitude. He said the government has sanctioned a total cost of Rs 169 crore for the project, including the development and qualification of vehicle systems and flight demonstration through three development flights (SSLV-D1, SSLV-D2 and SSLV-D3). A day earlier, he informed the Lok Sabha that a total number of 27 satellite missions and 25 launch vehicle missions have been successfully accomplished during the last five years.

This is a very expensive hobby. None of the farmers do ill-treat the bullocks,” said Keshav Kangane, the sarpanch of the Gulvanch village in Sinnar taluka. The animals used for racing are treated like children and they are given special food and special care. There is no cruelty towards the animal at any time and they are the pride of the owner, the farmers said. “Not only do they get the regular food, they are also given supplementary diet, including dry fruits, milk, under the watchful eyes of the veterinarians. The ones who term it as cruel should stay with us and see how these animals are treated,” said Dnyanesh Patil, a farmer from Niphad taluka. The bullock cart race is a major attraction during the festivals of the local deities and it also boosts the economy in the region. “Organising the event brings in people even from far off places, not just to see but also to participate in the races,” said Jayram Dherange, farmer from Sangamner. He added that there are several people who are dependent on such festivals. “The race also helps run the local economy. It helps local businesses and those looking for daily work. In fact, there are people who raise animals for this specific purpose and hence their costs runs in to several lakhs,” Dherange added. Walked barefoot for five years: Sangli farmer Vijay Jadhav, farmer from Sakhrale village of Sangli district, was moved when he heard the SC decision to allow the bullock cart races to resume. Jadhav has been consistently fighting for the resumption of bullock cart races. He walked barefoot for the past five years after he pledged to do so when he met Uddhav Thackeray at hi s residence. “When I met him, he had assured me that the races would be started when his party comes to power. He had even said that he would call me to Matoshree and I would wear the chappal. Now, he is the chief minister. I just expect him to allow me to wear the chappal," said Jadhav, who last year pulled is cart and walked till Mumbai to urge the government to start the bullock cart races.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/farmers-say-bullock-cart-racing-a-hobby-cattle-are-well-taken-care-of/articleshow/88325674.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Govt allocates Rs 1,000cr topower sector for infra push||Lucknow: Aiming to land a decisive power punch in the run up to assembly elections, the Yogi Adityanath government on Thursday allocated a budgetary support of Rs 1,000 crore to the power sector, promising round-the-clock power supply across the state, including rural areas. The allocation for the power sector was almost 12% of the total supplementary budget of Rs 8,479 crore tabled on the second day of a short winter session of UP assembly. Announcing the allocation, finance minister Suresh Kumar Khanna said an additional sum of Rs 185 crore has been provided for electrification of households. Official sources said the budgetary allocation will help the financially ailing UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) to reinforce the existing electricity distribution infrastructure. While the official roster of power supply in villages envisages 18-hour power supply, the actual supply has been dwindling due to repeated outages because of poor infrastructure. This, official sources said, needs to be taken into account to wheel round-the-clock power supply. The corporation is, as a matter of fact, facing mammoth financial losses of Rs 90,000 crore which have accumulated over a period following slack revenue recovery and power pilferage. The state government had come up with the One Time Settlement (OTS) scheme, entailing waiver for consumers defaulting on payment of arrears, that has managed to reach out to approximately 30 lakh consumers. The move, experts said, may arm the BJP to project itself as being committed to improving power infrastructure which was a perpetual challenge to the previous governments. Soon after coming to power in 2017, the state government had signed an MoU with the Centre for 24x7 power supply in the state. The state government also embarked on a massive electrification drive under the Centre’s flagship Saubhagya Scheme besides improving the rural and urban power infrastructure under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Rural Electrification Scheme (DDURES) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPS) respectively. Under the present regime, around 1.4 crore households got electrified under Saubhagya Scheme and the number of consumers has grown to nearly four crores. This has raised the demand for power which touched a peak of over 25,000 MW per day. A government spokesperson said that around 7,786 km of 33 KV lines have been laid in the state and the state government also started night patrolling so that technical problems can be rectified at the local level immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-allocates-rs-1000cr-topower-sector-for-infra-push/articleshow/88327938.cms||---

Many states which had focused on strengthening government schools are now following in the footsteps of AP and studying various innovative ideas and reforms brought in by the government. Telangana, Odisha and Haryana are studying the successful practices in Nadu-Nedu scheme and eyeing to implement it in their states. Despite having huge campuses and playgrounds, government schools in the state had failed to attract students. Despite unhealthy competition and high fees, parents preferred admission to corporate schools. Many government high schools were on the verge of closure till 2019. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, as promised in his padayatra, announced ‘Nadu- Nedu’ scheme which mainly aims in giving new shape to the schools. Andhra Pradesh School Education Reforms and Monitoring Commissioner (APSERMC) was appointed to regulate private schools and make suggestions to develop government schools. At the same time the government focused on regulating corporate schools. The chief minister launched ‘Mana Badi Naadu Nedu’ scheme on 14 November 2019. As many as 15,715 schools were renovated under the first phase of Nadu Nedu and dedicated to the nation on 16 August 2021. The government spent around Rs 3,669 crore on modernisation of schools in the first phase. The scheme was a huge success and admissions in government schools increased by around 80 per cent. Many government schools are now conducting interviews for admissions and MLAs and ministers were requested to give recommendation letters. Following the success of the scheme, the Telangana government announced a similar scheme in July 2021. Teams from Odisha and Assam visited Andhra Pradesh and conducted field visits to study the merits and demerits of the scheme. Now Haryana passed an ordinance regulating the fees collected by corporate and private schools and colleges. Education minister Adimulapu Suresh said,” the government is committed to improve the quality of education. Nadu-Nedu, fee regulation, adopting CBSE in government schools and other measures are giving good results. Many states in India are trying to incorporate our reforms and follow our footsteps.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/states-take-a-leaf-out-of-ap-school-reform-book/articleshow/88326470.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Delhi||Mewat man held in ATM fraud, 17 cards recovered by Delhi cops||NEW DELHI: A Mewat-based man has been arrested for allegedly using a ‘loophole’ in ATMs to pull off a scam running into several lakhs. Explaining the modus operandi, police said the accused, 26-year-old Ajaruddin, used multiple cards – 17 have been recovered from him so far -- to withdraw money at ATM booths. However, when the cash was disbursed, Ajaruddin would hold it inside the machine’s slot for about 15 seconds. “Due to this, the ATM showed an error. The suspect would take away the cash. Later, he would complain to the bank that the amount had not been disbursed and claim a refund,” said DCP (north Delhi) Sagar Singh Kalsi. When one of the banks probed the matter, the ATM records flagged the issue as “cover not opened” and the bank had to return the amount. Meanwhile, police started receiving several complaints about such incidents. A nationalised bank’s Chandni Chowk branch reported ‘multiple instances’ where the machine had not disbursed cash due to a ‘technical error’. After the bank’s internal inquiry revealed that the amount had actually been taken by the customers, it approached the Kotwali police. A team comprising inspector Neeraj Kumar, ACP Akshat Kaushal and others was formed. It emerged that on December 6, a person who made a transaction at an ATM withdrew cash but later complained to the bank authorities that the machine hadn’t given out any cash. Subsequently, the police team retrieved CCTV footage from the ATM booth to zoom in on the suspect. Local cops were also briefed and asked to keep watch on visits by customers. With the help of the guards posted outside the booth, police managed to nab Ajaruddin, who withdrew Rs 8,000 this time and again registered a complaint with the bank. He was booked under IPC Section 420 (cheating). Cops suspect Ajaruddin belongs to an organised gang that targets ATMs and may be involved in more than two dozen cases. Police have seized his mobile phone and will send it for forensic analysis to get information about his associates. The cards recovered from him are also being verified with the concerned banks, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-from-mewat-held-in-atm-fraud-17-cards-recovered/articleshow/88327942.cms||---

After collecting the fund supposed to be remitted by the local community, the urban local body would get clearance from the commissionerate of municipal administration to launch the civil work in a month.The corporation said at least one-third of the estimated project cost will have to be borne by the local community while the rest will be provided by the local body. Upgradation of roads, new buildings, water and drainage infrastructure and maintenance of community assets can be taken up under Namakku Naame Thittam. If the local community is willing to fund the entire cost of the project the work will be entrusted to them but the design specification and overall supervision will be decided by the local body. As part of the proposal, four works in the Srirangam zone, three in Ariyamangalam and one each in Ponmalai and K Abishekapuram zones were identified. These include maintenance and development of public parks, beautification of median, traffic islands development, installing stormwater drains, underground drainage line and rainwater harvesting system. Of the total cost of Rs 92.6 lakhs for the nine projects proposed in the scheme, local community will spend about Rs 30.88 lakh, that is, about 33% of the cost.“Projects that have funding difficulties will be considered in the scheme as it involves monetary contribution from the beneficiaries. We will launch the work gradually within a month and tenders will be floated,” P M N Mujibur Rahuman, commissioner, Trichy corporation told TOI. As the residents are directly involved, officials said that an ownership attitude will emerge in the local community to safeguard the public assets. Among the nine proposals identified, residents have pooled money to fund the expense of maintaining the public park and installing UGD lines in their localities. City-based Lion dates and BG Naidu sweets have come forward to improve and maintain public parks in Srirangam and Ariyamangalam zones. The contribution is expected to minimise expenses of the cash-strapped civic body to maintain several green spaces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/residents-entrepreneurs-to-fund-infra-projects-in-trichy/articleshow/88327963.cms||Deepak Karthik

Police on Thursday detained the boy and, during preliminary investigation, found he was angry with his parents for sending him to a nearby de-addiction centre from where he had returned some days ago. Police added he had an argument with his parents when he came to know that he would again be sent to the de-addiction centre. After brutally killing his parents while they were asleep, the boy came out of the house and told the villagers about the incident. According to police, other than parents, the family consisted of this boy and his younger brother and were living in a hamlet situated under the Nohar police station area of Hanumangarh. “It was learnt that the accused boy had an addiction for sedatives, pills and other such drugs. So, his parents had sent him to the de-addiction centre. When he returned, he was taken to the house of his maternal grandparents. On Wednesday, he was brought to his home and he picked a fight with his parents for sending him to the rehabilitation centre. Also, it was found that he came to know that he would be sent again to the rehabilitation centre. Later at night, he attacked the parents with an axe while they were sleeping,” said station house officer (SHO) Ravindra Singh of Nohar police station to TOI on Thursday. Since the boy accused is a minor, the police have not named his deceased parents. “He attacked his parents at 9.30pm on Wednesday evening with an axe. When our team also reached the spot, we found multiple injuries on the bodies of the 42-year-old man and his 38-year-old wife. The bodies were lying in a pool of blood,” Singh said. While the boy was attacking his parents, his younger brother came to their rescue but was also thrashed by the accused and sent away. “We have also seized the blood-stained axe used for the killing. The boy has been questioned and detained,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/boy-kills-parents-with-an-axe-for-sending-him-back-to-rehab/articleshow/88327958.cms||---
---||Goa||HC notice to Goa govt for not uploading ODPs for inputs||PANAJI: With a few days to go before the last date for accepting objections and comments on Outline Development Plans (ODP), the division bench of the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday issued a notice to the state government in a petition filed by Goa Bachao Abhiyan seeking directions to upload high density soft copies of four draft ODPs — Kadamba, Panaji, Margao and Ponda ODP 2031 — on the town and country planning department’s website. The petition is also seeking a two-month extension from the date the plans are uploaded for the public to submit objections and suggestions. Presently the public, including senior citizens, have to make comments and suggestions based on the maps placed on a wall, which have to be perused minutely in order to understand its ramifications. Notice has been issued to the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority (GPPDA), South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA), TCP and the chief secretary. Convener of Goa Bachao Abhiyan, Sabina Martins submitted to the high court that the present draft ODPs of these areas are displayed on the wall of the offices and, despite written requests, soft copies have not been uploaded on the website of the planning authorities. GPPDA also refused to give the petitioner soft copies on a pen drive. “...the authorities in question have available with them the soft copies in high density format and would not require to undertake any special steps to upload these copies on their website. Moreover, planning authorities in the recent past uploaded soft copies of draft ODPs 2030, which are available for the public to view on the website,” the petition stated. The petition stated that without these soft copies, a significant section of Goans are severely restricted from participating in the planning process. “It is very difficult to carry out in-depth study of the plans without having access to soft copies of the same, as copies produced from photographs are not of the same scale and detail as the original. Moreover, Covid-related precautions mandate social distancing and minimal interaction with other members of the community and as such soft copies would enable effective public participation while complying with Covid-safety guidelines,” the PIL stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-notice-to-govt-for-not-uploading-odps-for-inputs/articleshow/88327239.cms||Lisa Monteiro

---||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay to switch to hybrid mode from January||MUMBAI: After over 20 months of delivering lectures online, IIT Bombay will shift to the hybrid mode from January, but with a difference. So far, students on campus too were attending classes online. In the new semester, starting January 3, the institute has asked faculty members to provide at least one hour of contact lecture a week for the students on campus. The recordings of these tutorials or lectures will be made available for students who are off campus. Lectures for smaller classes, where all students are available on campus, will be taken offline. One of the professors said there are difficulties that schools are experiencing in taking classes only in the hybrid mode. “It is also a disadvantage for the students who are attending the classes online. Many are unable to hear or focus when the lectures are happening simultaneously in the online and offline modes. So, the institute has decided to give as much flexibility to the faculty members as possible,” said a professor. Classrooms at the institute will be opened for lectures for the first time in the pandemic in the new semester. The institute has set up a ventilation committee to ensure there is a constant supply of fresh air in enclosed spaces. The administration is also arranging for sufficient exhaust fans and changing the fresh air intake on ducted ACs to improve ventilation, said S Sudarshan, deputy director (academic and infrastructural affairs). Additionally, the ventilation committee is also planning to monitor carbon dioxide levels using IoT (internet of things) based sensors in enclosed spaces to ensure sufficient fresh air supply, he said. So far, some of the classrooms were used for exams that were conducted in the hybrid mode in November. In addition to the students who are already on campus, the ones who took admission to BTech courses at IIT-B last year, will be allowed to join for the first time from December 26. As part of the campus reboot plan, the institute is all set to welcome these students, who are now in their second year. However, the decision to return to campus will remain voluntary, mentioned the institute’s director Subhasis Chaudhuri, during an interaction with students and parents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/iit-bombay-to-switch-to-hybrid-mode-from-jan/articleshow/88327968.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Lucknow||‘Gorkha war cry would instil fear in Pak troops’||LUCKNOW: It is said that if a war cry doesn’t work to stave off the fight, it should be fierce enough to instil fear into the enemy. Fifty years ago, facing stiff resistance from Pakistani troops to secure a strategic bridge for India in Muddafarganj area of Comilla district in Chittagong, then-East Pakistan, Gorkha Rifles ‘johnnys’ (what jawans are affectionately called) resorted to their famous fear instilling war cry ‘Jai Maa Kali, Aayo Gorkhali’ to charge at the enemy. Eventually, they chased them with their razor-sharp khukri to end the resistance. Sharing the tale, war veteran and Vir Chakra recipient Col (retd) Bimal Kishandas Badgel of 1/11 Gorkha Rifles said, “Pakistan troops fled like a bunch of baboons when we charged at them with our regiment war cry.” As the commander of Alpha company with 120 men, Badgel, then a 28-year-old Major, was given the task to withhold Muddafarganj bridge. On the night of December 7, the bridge was attacked twice by 29 Baloch Regiment. Badgel, now 78, said, “Pakistani troops came in two back-to-back waves, shouting the war cry ‘Ya Ali’ to take the bridge vital for the Indian Army. My ‘johnnys’ whipped out their khukris and charged at the Pathans with the war cry ‘Jai Maa Kali, Aayo Gorkhali’. Some enemies were killed while the rest fled. I had sustained a bullet injury in my left arm in the attack.” In another example of the fierceness of Gorkha Regiment, the veteran said, “On December 3, the first day of the war, Lt Col Akbar Baig, commanding officer of Pakistan’s 25 Frontier Force Regiment, five other officers, eight JCOs and 202 men surrendered with large quantity of weapons and ammunition with Chinese markings.” Currently, 1/11 Gorkha Rifles is based in Lucknow. Badgel also recalls that after capturing each post of Pakistani troops, local Bengali population hidden in villages used to rush towards Indian troops with food and water and pro- Bangladesh and Indira Gandhi slogans. “Seeing Pakistani troops fleeing, they would shout ‘Indira ki jai’ and ‘Bengal ki jai’,” added Badgel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/gorkha-war-cry-would-instil-fear-in-pak-troops/articleshow/88327956.cms||Arvind Chauhan

Even some cars got stuck in the road twice.” He claimed that if the problem was not resolved by December 20, they will again stage a protest. Another resident of New Tagore Tagar, Shruti Kalra, said, “It is difficult to pass through this road due to uneven road and often two wheeler riders lose their balance and fell down.” She said there was a need to complete the work as soon as possible so that people could travel easily. “The authorities are not bothered about the public. The foggy season has started and it is even more dangerous now,” she said.

A consultant will be identified to prepare the Rs 1.07 crore DPR within six months and conduct a feasibility study on facilitating two arms connecting Chathiram bus stand with the proposed 2km-long elevated corridor. This will help decongest traffic in Chathiram bus stand and Main guard gate vicinities.The corridor would take off near the intersection of the Cauvery bridge - Odathurai bridge and ends after the Kudamurutti bridge. The link would improve connectivity between the western and central districts. Ramps are planned to connect the Karur bypass road. The proposal would focus on minimising the need for land acquisition and to avoid shifting drinking water pipelines. “The consultant will design three alternative alignments mentioning the merits and demerits,” a source said. The existing Karur road over which the corridor was planned will also get stormwater drains and road dividers. Based on the traffic intensity, the DPR would suggest the lane requirements to bypass Melachinthamani Anna statue roundabout, Chathiram bus stand, Kamarajar statue and Kalaignar Arivalayam. A source hinted that the corridor is most likely to have four lanes as around one lakh vehicles pass by every day. The Kalaignar Arivalayam project is the second elevated corridor proposed for the city. Recently, the state highways department floated a tender and allocated funds for examining the feasibility of a 6.4km long stretch between Trichy junction railway station and Melachinthamani via head post office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/fund-allocated-for-dpr-of-kalaignar-arivalayam-corridor/articleshow/88327990.cms||Deepak Karthik

Agri-tourism, one of the fastest-growing segments of the travel industry, includes visits to working farms, ranches, and agricultural industries. Agri destinations offer a huge variety of entertainment, education, relaxation, outdoor adventures, shopping, and dining experiences. The government is focusing on promoting agri-tourism by involving tribal farmers in tourist sites in tribal areas such as Lammasingi, Araku, and others. Regional Agricultural Research Center (RARC) at Chintapalli in Visakha tribal area has now turned into a research centre for organic floriculture as the scientists at the centre have started farming different flower crops on an experimental basis. The area, with its conducive geographical and climatic conditions, is suitable for their requirements. In-charge associate director of research (ADR) of RARS, Chintapalli, Bharata Lakshmi told TOI that they are now farming around 33 crops, including gladiolus, popularly known as ‘sword lilly’ due to its shape. It is a classic perennial flowering plant that has tall flower spikes. Each spike would cost Rs 15 to Rs 20. These flowers are used in bouquets. Five varieties of gladiolus were tested at Chintapalli research center by the scientists. The crop has three different harvesting periods - 45 days, 50 days and 60 days . “Some traders from Narsipatnam area visited us after learning about the crops and asked us to supply flowers. It seems now they are going to far away places for flowers,” another scientist said. The research centre is following organic farming for all crops. “Eco-tourism could be developed if we can promote agri-tourism on Lambasingi and Araku roadsides where lands were levelled for tents and others,” Bharata Lakshmi said. Farming of gladiolus, niger, a field crop, China aster and hyacinth, besides a few others has already started. Lilium and Tuberosa are in the testing stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/agency-areas-to-turn-agri-tourism-spots-soon/articleshow/88326501.cms||Siva G
---||Ahmedabad||HC wants industrial units moved outside Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: To stop the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluent into the Sabarmati river and rejuvenate it, the Gujarat high court issued a slew of directions including asking the state government to initiate measures so that industrial units situated in the middle of the city are moved to industrial estates. As interim directions in the suo motu PIL to curb pollution in the river, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati on Thursday said, “GIDC (Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation) should disclose availability of vacant land. The state government shall undertake the task of framing offers/incentives for existing units functioning within Ahmedabad city to relocate to such places.” In this process, the court also ordered GIDC to ensure that a common effluent treatment plant (CETP) is set up to treat industrial waste from these units. The issue came up after industrial units such as Arvind Ltd, Ankur Textiles and Ashima Ltd approached the court after the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) severed their drainage connections, alleging that their industrial discharge that was pumped into the sewerage network was too toxic to be treated by sewage treatment plants. A disconnection drive has been undertaken at the instance of the high court. The HC also said that industrial units being shifted outside the city would reduce air pollution within the city and the discharge of trade effluent could also be monitored. The court further said that if required, the state government may set up a CETP and control its management to ensure proper treatment of effluent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-high-court-wants-industrial-units-moved-outside-ahmedabad/articleshow/88327262.cms||---

Rane launched the US Agency for International Development (USAID) sponsored and Jhpiego implementation Reaching Impact, Saturation and Epidemic control(RISE) project. Rise India is providing technical assistance to secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities in 28 states, including Goa. Rane said the Goa government is collaborating with US Aid Rise India in establishing a responsive respiratory emergency critical care and medical management system, creating a learning network of facilities led by a state centre of excellence, operationalising adult and paediatric ICUs, robust oxygeneco-system, bolstered diagnostics infrastructure, including testing for Covid-19, RT-PCR laboratories and whole genome sequencing, skill enhancing, and bio-medical waste management. Director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said Rise India can support the state’s health care system by amplifying the results achieved by the state. Rane and Almeida acknowledged the contribution of the Goa’ healthcare workers, who demonstrated utmost dedication and unparallel feeling of altruism, even during challenging times, like the Covid-19 pandemic. He mentioned that his vision for Goa’s healthcare system is to become a model example for response to critical care emergencies such as Covid -19. Rane requested USAID Rise India to help the state strengthen testing facilities in Goa and set up a laboratory for genome sequencing. “This will help us as we are dealing with a lot of international passengers coming into Goa. This way, our action will be very fast, rather than depending on any agency outside Goa for genome sequencing,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-gets-boost-to-tackle-respiratory-emergencies/articleshow/88327244.cms||---

Shaikh Minajuddin Shaikh Ashfakuddin, a 26-year-old resident of Silk Milk colony, and Adnan Ulla Mujeeb Baig (20), a resident of Shaha Nagar, off Beed bypass road, have been booked by the police in this connection. The accused were found selling bogus vaccination certificates for Rs 200 and Rs 600. “The crime branch sleuths received a tip-off that bogus vaccination certificates were being issued outside RTO in Aurangabad. When the police reached the spot along with the panch witness, they came across two four-wheelers standing close to each other. And the accused were operating from there,” said an official release. According to the police, the two men had a laptop, a printer and other gadgets with them for producing bogus vaccination certificate. “When we checked the laptop of both the accused, we found a downloaded original vaccination certificate each on their devices. It was used by them to produce bogus certificates by removing photo and changing the Aadhaar number,” the police said. Notably, RTO Aurangabad is among the key establishments where vaccination is made mandatory not only for visitors, but also for different applicants. The police have invoked relevant sections of the IPC including 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) while registering the offence against accused youths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-caught-issuing-bogus-vax-cert-outside-aurangabad-rto/articleshow/88325693.cms||---

He said officials of the establishments and offices would face action if they failed to implement the policy. “In order to increase vaccination coverage, we have now decided to have a ‘No Vaccine, No Entry’ campaign from December 23. We will give a week’s time for people to get themselves vaccinated. After that, they will not be allowed entry into shops, business establishments, public spaces, buses, government and private offices, malls etc. without showing proof of vaccination,” said Bhujbal after the Covid-review meeting. As per the latest figures, in Nashik district, 40.61 lakh (78.5%) of the 51.7 lakh beneficiaries have taken at least the first dose, and 20.8 lakh (40%) have taken the second vaccine dose. “The pace of vaccination is low and it is not possible to have the health teams engaged in vaccinating people endlessly. It has to end sometime,” Bhujbal said. He warned the shops, establishment and offices to make sure that they stick to the norm of providing entry only to vaccinated people. Failure to do so would result in action. “The health teams are ready with vaccines and the enforcement agencies are doing their best. Still if there are people who are skipping the vaccine, then the society has to step in,” he said. Bhujbal said the enforcement agencies including the Zilla Parishad (ZP), the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the police will ensure the implementation. About restrictions on New Year programmes at hotels and restaurants, Bhujbal said all restrictions announced by the state government will be applicable in Nashik district. “Generally, in hotels and restaurants — especially during events — social distancing and masks go for a toss. While hosting parties being allowed by the police and respective agencies, the hotels and restaurants need to stick to the norms and check for vaccination,” Bhujbal said. District collector Suraj Mandhare, NMC chief Kailas Jadhav, police commissioner Deepak Pandey, Nashik ZP CEO Leena Bansod and others attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-vaccine-no-entry-campaign-across-nashik-district-from-dec-23/articleshow/88325694.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The foundation stone has been laid down for the second time as earlier on December 2011 too, one foundation stone was laid by the then local bodies minister Tikshan Sood when Shiromani Akali Dal(SAD) was in power, but even after ten years people got only the second foundation stone as flats could not be constructed at the site. The chief minister said that this project is being constructed by Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) under “100 percent self financing scheme” and would have 12-storeyed 336 HIG and 240 MIG flats. The chief minister said that these flats will have earthquake resistant structure, separate green parks for HIG and MIG and club, separate club with indoor swimming pool, multipurpose hall, gymnasium , Table Tennis rooms, separate dedicated tower parking, video door phones in each flat and CCTV cameras at main entrance of site for 24 hour security, 2 lifts with one 13 passenger stretcher lift in each block with 24 hours backup, washed grit finish with combination of red tiles on outer elevations, big balconies in all rooms, centralised fire hydrant system, provision for 24 hours power back up for lifts, besides several other facilities. Reacting to the inauguration, SAD ex MLA Ranjit Dhillon, who is contesting from East constituency, said, "Already inaugurated projects are being inaugurated again just to gain political mileage before assembly elections. Nothing is going to come on ground as the Exhibition Center which is to be constructed at Chandigarh Road has no detail project report. Moreover, it is to be constructed by a private firm but the CM is inaugurating the same." BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal said, "This exercise is being made to show that the Congress did development at large scale but in reality this is an eye wash. The Atal Apartments foundation stone was laid down in 2011 and now the inauguration should have been done after construction of flats." The LIT Chairman claimed that last date for submitting the application was December 18 and draw was fixed for December 24, but people demanded extension so now the last date for submitting the application is December 27 and draw will take place on January 10. The trust has fixed three years’s deadline for completion of this project. Meanwhile, the CM also handed over issued permanent appointment letters to 2480 sweepers and sewermen who were working on contractual basis in the MC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-lays-the-foundation-stone-of-atal-apartments-again/articleshow/88326513.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Two acquitted after 40 years in Rs 12-crore smuggling case||MUMBAI: Almost 40 years after being booked in a Rs 12-crore smuggling case along with absconding suspect in the 1993 Bombay serial blasts, Mohammed Dossa, two city residents including a woman were acquitted for lack of evidence. The trial against Dossa will be kept pending. Acquitting Aboobakar Kapadia and Amrita Shah, the magistrate’s court said, “In absence of proper and cogent evidence against the accused, no charge can be proved….” There was a case against Shah’s brother too, but he died in October this year. The trio were out on bail. According to the prosecution, between May and December 1982, 10 people smuggled into India 65,000 tolas of gold valued at nearly Rs 12.7 crore, 70 packages of textiles and other goods, 55 packages of VCR, and TV, 50,000 wrist watches, perfumes and other goods valued at Rs 1 crore evading customs duty. Besides Dossa, four Pakistani nationals and two other Indian suspects are still absconding. Witnesses including then intelligence officers and assistant directors in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and Superintendent of Customs, Marine and Preventive Wing, Bombay Customs, deposed but remained unavailable when the defence had to cross-examine them. The magistrate cited a Supreme Court ruling which held that right to cross-examine the witness is a precious right of the accused. “It was therefore obligation of complainant to make those witnesses available for cross examination,” the court said. The prosecution had submitted that on December 16, 1982, DRI had a tip-off that smuggled gold and money would exchange hands between Pakistani and Indian operators near Minerva Theatre, Grant Road. At 2 pm the officers noticed a white Fiat followed by an Ambassador car coming from the direction of Opera House. The prosecution said an exchange of packets was noted between occupants of the cars. During a search, Rs 14 lakh in cash was recovered. Officers then raided the Byculla residence of the Pakistani nationals. During the search at Dossa’s Agripada home, documents and “foreign goods” were seized. The prosecution also submitted that a Bhuj-based suspect who is absconding, Mithu Padiyar, had confessed he was involved in the landing and transporting of the smuggled goods. In 1986, sanction was granted to prosecute the accused under the Customs Act. The Pakistanis had fled by then. The court in its judgement noted that while the prosecution did not take necessary steps, in 2012, a magistrate had fixed the matter for framing of charges. In 2019, charges were framed against Kapadia and the Shah siblings under the Customs Act, lmports and Exports (Control) Act and Indian Penal Code. The trio pleaded not guilty. Since the prosecution did not bring witnesses for cross examination, in January 2020 the trial ended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-two-acquitted-after-40-years-in-rs-12-crore-smuggling-case/articleshow/88328026.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: ‘Screen all international passengers irrespective of vax status’||HYDERABAD: With recent cases of Omicron detected at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) among passengers arriving from non-risk countries, there is a growing demand for screening of all international passengers – even those carrying vaccination certificates. At present, along with flyers from at-risk countries, only unvaccinated passengers disembarking from other international flights at the city airport, are being tested for Covid-19. “It is now known that vaccinated people can also contract the virus. It would, therefore, be important to screen such passengers as well if we want to curb the spread of Omicron,” said an official familiar with the testing facility at the airport. Former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Dr Rakesh Mishra, agrees. “Since there is no guarantee that a vaccinated person cannot transmit the virus, it only makes sense to screen them wherever we can,” he said while quickly adding, “But the question here is, can we do this? Already there is overcrowding at the airport, and if such a system is brought in, it might become a logistical challenge. Also, the entry of the virus is not just through the airport, it is already there…in many cases there is no travel history.” Under such a scenario, Dr Mishra suggests that people be more cautious – wear the mask, avoid crowded places and get the vaccine as soon as possible – so that the infection rate can be kept low. “If you ask me, we (India) are at a very strong position at the moment. The Omicron numbers are not very high, the situation at hospitals is under control and vaccination is also going well. If we can expedite the process a little more and be careful, I think we can tackle this. Alongside, let the authorities increase screening wherever they can,” he added.

He said the government was committed to protect current wages despite giving fitment of 14.29 per cent as suggested by the chief secretary’s committee. Sajjala and finance minister Buggana Rajendranath met the chief minister at the camp office on Thursday and explained the details of the talks with the employees’ unions. Buggana Rajendranath and Reddy had held discussions for nearly seven hours with the employees’ unions on Wednesday. With the unions sticking to their demand on high fitment benefit, the issue has now reached the chief minister’s office. Speaking to the media at the chief minister’s camp office, Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said the fitment will be granted keeping in view of the state’s fiscal conditions. He said that the situation was such that they could not compare it either with the past or with the neighbouring states. “We have explained all the issues raised by the employees associations to the chief minister. He is expected to meet them in a day or two to finalise the issue,” said Sajjala. He said that the chief minister was very sympathetic to resolve the PRC issue in such a that it returns reasonable benefit to employees. He said they have requested the employees associations to scale down expectations as the financial status of the state was not helping them to go liberal on granting huge fitment benefit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-likely-to-meet-staff-unions-to-take-a-final-call-on-pay-revision-row/articleshow/88326524.cms||Samdani MN

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Studies that had warned of rising pollution cited||AHMEDABAD: While necessitating an immediate remediation to the pollution in Sabarmati river, the Gujarat high court observed during proceedings that a slew of scientific studies, over the last 25 years, undertaken by national- and state-level institutions have been constantly warning of the rising pollution in the Sabarmati river. The court noted, studies have shown how 43 villages downstream of Ahmedabad city use the toxic wastewater of the city for irrigating their farms, thus, “polluted water contaminate the soil with heavy metals… destroyed aquatic life and have doubled the presence of Escherichia Coli bacteria.” The court cited a January 2021 study, conducted by researchers Upasana Banerjee representing National Centre for Earth Science studies, Thiruvananthapuram, and PRL, and Bibhabasu Mohanty, Anirban Das, Reema Mandal and Sukanya Acharya of PDEU and SAL Institute of Technology, which found soil samples had high levels of metal contamination, which exceeded WHO and Indian standards. Eight soil samples were taken from various villages downstream which revealed zinc level at 421 micrograms per gram of soil, manganese was 336, copper at 201, chromium and nickel was 51, lead was 42 and cobalt was 9 microgram. The court noted that, “a simple web search on the subject of Sabarmati pollution yields 2,810 research works. A research published in 1997 had warned the policy makers of the disaster that the river is becoming.” The HC also pointed towards a IIT-Gn’s, Discipline of Earth Sciences department’s examination of river water, a study led by Professor Manish Kumar, during Covid-19 pandemic to show how increased consumption of antibiotics followed by its excretion into our civic systems had also accelerated formation of drug-resistant bacteria in sewage systems that emptied into the river. “What worries the scientists is the human interaction with the bacteria at the riverfront, slums along lakes, and even wastewater farming downstream. Simply put, between 2018 and 2020, the presence of drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E coli) or gut bacteria on two locations along the Sabarmati increased from 22% to 46%, while in one of the sewage treatment plants, the drug-resistant bacteria increased from 10% to 26%,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/studies-that-had-warned-of-rising-pollution-cited/articleshow/88327283.cms||---

In a letter addressed to environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, board member Yadav Tarte-Patil has demanded official intervention, including pushing for the Ramsar tag for the sanctuary. “The illegal fishing, for which even the fuel-run boats have started to be used, along with the wetland farming is posing a grave threat to not only the birds at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary but the overall biodiversity. It is high time that the state government now swings into action to put a check on the brazen violations in the sanctuary,” Tarte-Patil said.  In his official letter to the minister, Tarte-Patil has mentioned the TOI report, dated December 14, which had highlighted the use of fuel-driven boats at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. Stating that the bird sanctuary spread over 341.05 square km area is highly rich in biodiversity and home to a range of resident and migratory birds, Tarte-Patil said the inclusion of it into the list of Ramsar sites would intensify the conservation efforts. Veteran bird watcher Dilip Bhagat said the place in the list of Ramsar sites would offer a range of benefits for Jayakwadi bird sanctuary including access to the scientific methods of conservation. “The large-scale presence of flamingos at the sanctuary implies that it is an ideal wetland and should get the Ramsar tag. The official apathy is eluding the desired tag for years now,” he said. Thackeray could not be reached for his comments. Principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Sunil Limaye, in his official reply, said he has alerted forest department officials about the fuel-driven boats at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary. The Ramsar site is a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, an intergovernmental environmental treaty established in 1971 by UNESCO. The iconic Lonar crater from Buldhana district and Nandur Madhyameshwar Bird Sanctuary from Nashik district are some of the latest biodiversity hotspots from Maharashtra, which have received the Ramsar tag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/violations-rampant-at-jayakwadi-sanctuary/articleshow/88325699.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Somalian international visited many places before Omicron status was known||HYDERABAD: The detection of Omicron cases from random samples from ‘not at risk’ nations has put health officials in a quandary as they can do little before the genome report for this category of international flyers. The Somalian man was a random pick but tested positive for Omicron variant on Wednesday. By then, he had been to several places in the city after landing here on December 12. He had been to two different corporate hospitals in the central part of the city, travelled in cabs and had lunch at a restaurant in Banjara Hills without knowing that he was positive, sources said. Even after his Omicron status was known, there was delay in informing as officials were unable to contact the man on the phone number provided by him. Cops had to be roped in to find him and it turned out that he had given the number of an agent who brings medical tourists to prominent hospitals. The man is in city for his father’s treatment, officials said. “Police authorities confirmed the patient was unaware of his RT-PCR positive status when he was found. During the two days in Hyderabad, he had gone to one hospital, got his farther transferred to another one, stood in queue for CT Scan and MRI, and travelled by cabs,” a source in the health department said. The second Omicron cases, a 24-year-old woman from Kenya, too was traced by health officials only after her sample was confirmed to be Omicron positive. A huge exercise was launched after that to trace her contacts. “It took an entire day to trace the woman and her close contacts following which they were shifted to TIMS, Gachibowli. Even the woman and her two contacts had been moving in the city until Tuesday night,” added the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/somalian-natl-visited-many-places-before-omicron-status-was-known/articleshow/88327590.cms||Amrita Didyala

Many of those living in the area belong to various countries in Africa and there will be more tests conducted over the next few days, officials said. Authorities are now proposing IAS Colony and Paramount Colony be declared as containment clusters. The two areas are inhabited by nationals from various African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, Sudan among others. A majority of them come to Hyderabad for treatment at the city’s health facilities. Results of those tested from the areas on Thursday are expected to be available by Friday afternoon, according to officials. Interestingly, some of the residents who had initially refused to be tested, agreed to be tested following the discovery of the Omicron cases and came forward voluntarily. “We went to each residence and conducted the Covid-19 tests. For those who were not at their homes, we are also performing tests at other places such as restaurants,” officials from the health department informed. To execute the testing drive, 25 teams have been put on the job, each team having two members with each officer assigned to two or three apartments to complete testing. Authorities are also scaling up the use of mobile testing vans and other facilities as they had done during the first and second waves. Following the emergence of Omicron cases in the city, health department officials have been directed to escalate testing numbers. Primary health centres (PHCs) have been tasked with completing at least 50 RT-PCR tests per day with no restrictions on antigen testing. Hyderabad district has been assigned a daily testing target of 5,000 tests. Officials have also decided to further investigate those who have tested negative at the airport. This, as the two persons who have been detected with the Omicron variant had travelled from countries which were not on the ‘at-risk’ list. According to sources in the government, a high-level meeting on contact tracing will be held soon with the chief minister and the state health minister .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/health-dept-ups-testing-to-contain-omicron/articleshow/88327560.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The news left not only his wife Sameera (28) and five children in despair but also his entire joint family which includes four brothers and his parents. Hussain was a major financial support for his entire family. Crammed in a small two-room house at Hassan Nagar, Hussain’s mother Zora sits in a corner staring at her son’s photo and cries inconsolably. Hussain’s brother Sheikh Maula, concerned that his mother’s condition could worsen, snatches the photo and hides it with him. “We are still here,” Maula seeks to assure her. Hussain used to work as a trolley auto driver and a mechanic for IDPL and his salary of Rs Rs 25,000 per month was instrumental for the family to make ends meet. He is now survived by his wife Sameera and five children — Firoz, Rizwana Banu, Mahira Banu, Zoya and Husna Banu — the oldest of whom is nine while the youngest was born just three months back. Sameera tells TOI that, to Hussain, his five children meant the world to him. He was even planning to take up other jobs in order to ensure a good education at private schools for his children. “We can only hope that we can somehow survive till Firoz grows older to get a job and provide for his sisters. I feel guilty for even putting so much pressure on my nine-year-old son but that’s the situation we are in,” Sameera explains. With a large family to provide for, Hussain could not invest in any insurance scheme and his untimely death has left behind several debts for his wife and brothers to clear. “There was a function on the same day. If only my brother stayed at home to attend that function. We could have avoided this disaster,” rues Hussain’s brother, Maula. The accused, Mohan’s, breath analysis result showed that his blood alcohol level at 159 mg/100 ml of blood which is over four times the permissible limit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/wife-five-kids-joint-family-left-in-despair/articleshow/88327638.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Hyderabad||HCA group gives up the fight, says their tenure is over||HYDERABAD: The Supreme court’s decision to dissolve the apex council and seek names from the counsels in order to constitute a committee that will oversee the administration at Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) has dealt a body blow to the officebearers. A section of them has seen the writing on the wall. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had on Wednesday come down heavily on the HCA and sought names of former players and judges to constitute a committee, saying the team will win if the panel “focuses on players” and does not indulge in politics. “You give names of players and others who have nothing to do with politics... we will appoint the committee,” the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, said. According to sources, the group comprising vice-president K John Manoj, secretary R Vijayanand, treasurer Surender Agarwal, joint secretary Naresh Sharma and councillor Anuradha on Thursday proposed the names of Justice Nisar Ahmed Kakru, Justice Ramkrishna Raju, Justice Naushad Ali, former BCCI president N Shivlal Yadav and former HCA chief Arshad Ayub to the court.  Manoj was candid in saying their time is up. “That’s how we see it,’’ he said on Thursday. “The Supreme court has said that the whole body should go. There is no point in continuing a fight that solves no purpose. We have taken our issues to the Supreme court and the chief justice is very clear in his stand. It’s a clear indication that our tenure is over. It should’ve ended in September 2022 but because of whatever has happened so far, our worst fears came true and it ended prematurely...,” he said. CEO Sunil Kante will run the association as per the bye-laws and with whoever the SC appoints as administrators. “To wage a daily battle has become meaningless,” said secretary Vijayanand. “There have been several differences in the apex council of HCA. Yesterday, the CJI decided to dissolve the apex council. We see no gain in continuing the fight.’’ He said he was always available to sign cheques. “We’re suspended but SC has told us to sign cheques jointly so that the administration doesn’t suffer.” Manoj clarified on the electricity department disconnecting power supply to the Uppal stadium. “We have no access to any correspondence since we’re all suspended. Since the president is handling all affairs, he should’ve pursued this matter and solved the issu,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hca-group-gives-up-the-fight-says-their-tenure-is-over/articleshow/88327655.cms||---

The pump owners said, if the police or NMC squads are deployed, it would be feasible for them to implement the rule. Lalit Gandhi, the state president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), said, “The move is welcome, but we feel that responsibility of its implementation must be given to civic body,” he said. Sudhakar Deshmukh, North Maharashtra unit head of the MACCIA said that the petrol pump owners found it tough to implement the ‘no helmet no petrol’ rule as some motorists used to quarrel with the staff. But the things were streamlined after police teams were deployed. Bhushan Bhosle, the president of Nashik district petrol dealers welfare association, said if we refrain from giving fuel, it may lead to conflict with the consumers. The banking officials said that it will be difficult for them to identify unvaccinated persons if they do not carry their mobiles. Moreover, the poor people withdraw smaller amounts of Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 for their bread and butter. We cannot deny them cash from their bank accounts. Nitin Dashputre, a bookseller said that if we stop selling stationery materials to unvaccinated consumers, they would purchase the same from the other shops. I will lose my business.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/can-apply-rule-if-govt-squads-deployed-pump-owners/articleshow/88325725.cms||Tushar Pawar

Meritorious students who were conferred medals on Thursday have pledged to form a strong alumni association like that of leading institutes of the country, their motto being : “We have done it and now, we will do it for our juniors”. “Like that of IIMs, IITs and LBSNAA, soon AKTU alumni association will also grow stronger as we will not just take our degrees and leave but will come back to support our juniors. All my batch mates have decided that we will keep our juniors posted about job opportunities around the world and in our own organizations,” said gold medal winner Mukul Sharma. Another gold medallist Aatmika Rai said, “We should have a centralized group or page for AKTU too for students to share research, interview experiences, scholarships and job opportunities.” Gold winners Abhishek Kumar and Shrishti Agarwal shared that AKTU alumni association had the potential to be the strongest in the country as no other university has 763 affiliated colleges and lakhs of students graduating every year. “Instead of college associations, we will focus on building university association which will not just be a job information sharing platform but a platform to stand for our university students in any matter,” said Kumar. Silver medal winners Mansi Gupta and Shubham Sahai also mooted the idea of developing an app for the association.

At the Parivarthana Sabhe, organised by the Mangaluru city police, at the T V Ramana Pai Convention Centre on Thursday, city police commissioner N Shashi Kumar said the city had 3,263 rowdy-sheeters and of this, 1,256 people have been struck off the list. Among them, 80 are aged, 663 do not have any pending cases against them in courts, and 513 have not been active. It is probably for the first time in the state, that more than 100 names have been removed from rowdy sheets During prominent festivals and major programmes, rowdy-sheeters are expected to be present at the police stations. Many of them have not been active in any anti-social activities in the past five years, or have no major cases lodged against them, and are leading a responsible life. Quoting an incident, the commissioner said that a rowdy-sheeter who was charged in 1994-95, shared his difficulty in getting his daughter married. A few of them have children who have taken up good jobs. Keeping all these factors in mind, a team of officials including DCP (law and order) Hariram Shankar, DCP (crime and traffic) B P Dinesh Kumar, ACPs and inspectors met nearly eight times during the past three months, and assessed the list carefully. “If we open a rowdy sheet, it is also our responsibility to close it, if a person has reformed,’’ Shashi Kumar said, calling upon those who have been removed from the list to refrain from creating law and order problems in the city, and to help the police by sharing information. Nearly 300 people who have been removed from the rowdy sheet, participated in the programme. AJ Shetty, founder, AJ Hospital & Research Centre, Fr Rudolph Ravi D’Sa, administrator, Father Muller Medical College Hospital and Dr C P Habeeb Rahman, chairman and medical director, Unity Hospital, addressed the gathering.

---||Kochi||Destructive mindset of some hurting state: CM||Thiruvananthapuram: In a veiled attack against political detractors and environmentalists, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that some people with ‘destructive mindset’ were trying to mar the investment-friendly image the state was trying to achieve. He was inaugurating LuLu Mall in the state capital on Thursday. “There are some people who masquerade as public workers but work against the interest of the public in the larger sense. It has become a practice in Kerala that complaints will start pouring in, against developmental projects, as and when they are announced,” said the chief minister. “Such people petition every authority in the chain. They file complaints with authorities as high as the President and even before panchayat authorities,” Vijayan said, adding that people should not fail in identifying those who work against the developmental needs of the state. The chief minister hailed the investments made by businessman MA Yusuffali in the state as commendable and said he did a great work in taking the fame of Kerala far and wide. MP Shashi Tharoor, who addressed the gathering after the chief minister, minced no words in congratulating Pinarayi Vijayan for taking the much-needed steps for the development of the state. “I stand for development. The chief minister has to be congratulated for the efforts he makes to bring development in Kerala. When I say that certain people would find it awkward. But, I don’t think we should refrain from congratulating people for the work they do,” Tharoor said. According to Tharoor, he had to face resistance when he tried to bring in big ticket investment projects to state. “Kerala’s image of being a state replete with labour issues and strikes did work against the efforts made for ensuring big investments. I’m happy that our chief minister openly urges businesspeople to make investments in Kerala,” Tharoor added. Couple of days ago, Tharoor had refused to sign the petition submitted by UDF MPs from Kerala against the proposed K-Rail project. Tharoor said that he abstained from signing the same not because he supported the project, but because he needed more time to study the subject.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/destructive-mindset-of-some-hurting-state-cm/articleshow/88326575.cms||---

She said the students should learn about what challenges the construction team faced, solutions they came up with and how a target set is achieved timely. “If a project is not completed timely, its expenses go up. Students of technical education have a huge responsibility on their shoulders to save money of the country. They should set goals and strive hard to complete a project before deadline,” she said. “When Saryu Nahar Rashtriya Yojana was planned, its estimated cost was Rs 100 crore but due to the delay of 40 years, its cost has gone up to Rs 10,000 crore. Hence, for development of our country, it is essential that all projects should be completed timely,” said the governor. Renowned educationist Prof SG Dhande, the chief guest, said, “You are now entering into a new university: the 3L university. This is the ‘Life-Long Learning University’ where there will be no examinations, marks or practicals but learning through experiences.” He said that to be a ‘digital Eklavya’, who despite challenges comes up with new innovations, one must develop ‘hunger’ for achievements, be a keen observer and have a curious mind.

The agitation was called off late evening after Chandra Pal Singh (Aheriya), president of the community, issued a video statement from Lucknow that they had got an appointment with chief minister Yogi Adityanath for December 18. “We will resume the protests on December 21 at Somna station in Aligarh if the CM does not meet us on the given date,” he said. The tracks were cleared by 8 pm, confirmed Deepak Kumar, DIG (Aligarh range). Talking to TOI, senior public relation officer of North Central Railway (NCR), Amit Malviya, said 14 long distance trains, including Bhuvneshwar Rajdhani, Howrah Rajdhani, Sealdah Rajdhani, Dibrugarh Rajdhani, Arunachal Express and Lucknow-Gomti SF Express, were delayed. No diversion route was available till the evening. The protesters occupied the railway track in Hathras junction at 11 am. They put up a red flag on the track and shouted slogans, “Aheriya zindabad”. A women protester said political leaders promise to fulfill their demands for inclusion in the reserved list while seeking votes but pay no heed after the elections. “We are not getting quota certificates as our caste is not included in the list approved by the government,” she said. Ramesh Ranjan, district magistrate of Hathras, told TOI that talks were on between Aheria community leaders and senior officials in Lucknow. He said as their caste is not included in the reserved category list of the Government of India, they cannot avail of any quota benefit. Additional police force from neighbouring districts was called in the evening and deployed in Hathras to maintain law and order situation in the town. The word Aheria means “hunter” as it was their traditional occupation. They are said to have been soldiers in the army of Maharana Pratap. After his defeat, they scattered and took up farming in the 1920s, when forced to give up hunting. Now, many of them have taken to selling flowers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aheria-protest-for-quota-hits-train-ops-on-delhi-howrah-route-in-hathras/articleshow/88325729.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Minimum temperature likely to drop in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The minimum temperature in Aurangabad and other parts of the state is likely to drop by two to three units during the ongoing week. Citing the latest weather summary released by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), K K Dakhore, agricultural meteorologist with Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, said a low-pressure area is likely to form over the equatorial Indian Ocean and adjoining the southwest Bay of Bengal around Friday. “The drop in mercury level is likely during the next four days due to emerging weather systems. It is likely to increase the chill in the air, which is conducive for the ongoing rabi season crops,” he said. Dakhore said parts of north and west India are likely to witness cold waves, but such extreme weather conditions were not likely in Maharashtra at least in the next week. At 13.8 degrees celsius, the minimum temperature was hovering above the normal by two units in Aurangabad on Thursday. On the other hand, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 27.4 degree celsius, which was below normal by one unit, shows the IMD data. Last year, the lowest minimum temperature in Aurangabad during December was observed on December 22 at 9.2 degrees celsius. The city had the historic low temperature of 1.2 degrees celsius on December 28, 1968, show the official data. Meanwhile, many citizens complained that the winter chill was missing during the current season. “While the winter season usually starts setting in from Diwali, this time, it was raining during the festive season. Later, overcast conditions affected the winter chill. We hope the chill starts building now,” said Vijay Thorat, a fitness enthusiast.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minimum-temperature-likely-to-drop-in-aurangabad/articleshow/88325739.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Division bench confirms general quota intake on empty EWS seats||AHMEDABAD: A division bench of Gujarat high court on Thursday refused to disturb a single judge’s order to the National Institute of Design to grant provisional admission on unfilled economically backward classes (EWS) seats to two students of the general category. The bench requested the single judge to expedite the hearing to finalize the issue so the students know their fate as if the case is decided against them, they will have to leave their studies midway. Two students, Anjal Thottan and Suyash Tiwari, applied in the general category for admission to the master’s degree course in New Media Design, but could not make the list of successful students. They unsuccessfully requested the institute to consider them for admission on the EWS quota, where no student was available, and two seats of EWS quota be converted to general category. They approached the HC, which observed that there is no policy to convert unfilled seats of SC, ST quota into general category, but the provision is available for OBC quota seats. The single judge ordered NID to grant them provisional admission, subject to the outcome of the litigation. The premier institute filed an appeal before the division bench and insisted that the central government has not clarified its position on conversion of unfilled EWS quota seats to general category seats. NID’s counsel also submitted that the government has issued directions to the institute to not convert the seats. To this, the division bench asked, “Whose directions you (NID) intend to follow? The government’s or the court’s? You may conveniently ignore the directions by the government.” The single judge has directed the Centre to put its stand on record on whether general category students can be give a place in the EWS quota, if seats remain vacant. The division bench told NID that no good purpose would be served if the two seats remained vacant. If two good students get a chance, the institute should consider their candidature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-hc-division-bench-confirms-general-quota-intake-on-empty-ews-seats/articleshow/88327290.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: Metro man E Sreedharan to withdraw from active politics||KOZHIKODE: Ten months after his political foray with BJP, Metro Man E Sreedharan (89) said on Thursday that he was withdrawing from active politics. The technocrat, who unsuccessfully contested assembly elections, told the media at Ponnani in Malappuram that he won’t be playing an active role because of his advanced age. He added that he wasn’t quitting politics altogether. “Not many people know that I am near 90 and entering politics at that age is a dangerous situation,” he said. Sreedharan, famous for steering many mega infra projects including Delhi Metro, said that even when he joined politics, he had made it as a bureaucrat. Sreedharan said he was initially disheartened when he lost elections. “An MLA alone cannot do anything, so I am not sad about it now,” he said, adding that he made his political foray as he had high hopes. “BJP was having a good time in state with a vote share of 16% then. If the party would have been able to increase that to 18-19% we could have played a decisive role in controlling those in power. But, it came down to 14% which disheartened me,” he said, adding that the party state unit must make many changes in policies. He said that there are lessons to be learnt from failures and he has already learnt them. Sreedharan said that he was able to serve people in various ways other than politics, especially through the three organizations he was managing apart from the trust in the name of his mother. Meanwhile, Sreedharan reiterated his opposition to the government’s SilverLine project saying that it was unviable and would have huge environmental impact. He said that though there was a need for a second rail line in state, the time was not ripe to undertake the project as Kerala was facing a financial crisis. “Also it would require large scale acquisition of land and 25,000 people will have to be relocated,” he said. He termed the project as badly planned and ill-conceived. Had it been properly conceived, he would have supported the project, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/metro-man-to-withdraw-from-active-politics/articleshow/88326585.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: 43-year-old’s heart keeps Covid slayer’s hopes alive||SURAT: A road accident in Navsari snatched away 43-year-old Astika Patel’s life, but in her death the brain dead woman breathed new life into seven others. The family decided to donate the vital organs after Patel was declared brain dead on Tuesday. With this, the Diamond City donated the 39th heart and 13th pair of lungs. Resident of Bhinar village of Navsari, Patel was riding pillion on the motorcycle with her husband while going to Navsari on Sunday when she fell off and suffered serious head injuries. She was shifted to a Navsari hospital and later to the city where she was declared brain dead. “My family is incompetent to donate anything,” said her husband, Jignesh Patel, a driver in Navsari BAPS temple. He said that with the inspiration of Mahant Swami, chief saint of BAPS, the family could donate his wife’s organs at least as they believe organ donation is also akin to worship. “Heart and a pair of lungs were transported to Ahmedabad and Mumbai, respectively by air. Liver and kidneys were sent to IKDRC in Ahmedabad by road,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, founder of Donate Life that coordinated the organ donation. Lungs transplantation was done at Masina hospital, Mumbai, while the heart was transplanted on a 17-year-old girl at CIMS hospital in Ahmedabad whose heart condition worsened after Covid-19 infection. Patel’s corneas were donated to Lok Drashti Chakshu Bank. Till date, Donate Life has been able to provide 898 vital organs in the country and across the globe as well by donating 414 kidneys, 176 livers, 8 pancreases, 39 hearts, 26 pairs of lungs, 318 corneas besides two hands making it altogether 981 organs and tissue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/43-year-olds-heart-keeps-ncov-slayers-hopes-alive/articleshow/88326612.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Only 2 bids for 2 zoo works; Rs 291 crore quoted for Rs 185 crore job||MUMBAI: With bids for construction of the new set of animal enclosures at Byculla zoo shooting Rs 106 crore above the BMC estimates and only two companies submitting bids, Congress minister Aslam Shaikh has alleged cartelisation and rigging of the bids and demanded an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) probe. While the tenders were estimated to cost Rs 91 crore and Rs 94 crore, or a total of Rs 185 crore, the two companies bid Rs 146 crore and Rs 145 crore, or a total of Rs 291 crore, an overall escalation of Rs 106 crore. TimesViewA Rs 106 crore escalation in the construction of new animal enclosures is shocking. It shows that the estimates were not prepared properly by the BMC in the first place. The allegations made by the Congress minister and BJP are serious and must be probed thoroughly by the administration. If any cartelisation or rigging is found, then tenders must be scrapped and action taken against officials and companies involved.BJP corporator Vinod Mishra and MLA Mihir Kotecha too have demanded that the tenders be scrapped. The BMC had recently invited tenders for two works: one for construction of new animal enclosures for black jaguar, cheetah,white lion, wallaby, chimpanzee, ring tail lemur, mandrill monkey and lesser flamingo and the other for constructing exhibits for the hippo, African savanna, emu and a bird aviary. These new enclosures are to be constructed on land received from the Poddar and Mafatlal Mills adjacent to the Byculla zoo. “It is sad to point out that Byculla Zoo has become a den of corruption and a hub of rigging tenders, cartelisation and a hub of restrictive bidding to prevent global companies and favour tainted companies ……. only two contractor’s Skyway Infra projects and Highway Construction Company. The conditions incorporated in these tenders were to ensure only these companies qualified in this tender and it can be clearly seen that each of these companies have given each other a supporting bid and bagged one tender each,” Shaikh said in his letter to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal. “This amounts to manipulation…whereby the cost estimate of both these tenders were split and deliberately kept under Rs I00 crore so as to ensure that it does not allow a joint venture (JV) nor does it allow global companies. This clearly amounts to restrictive practices and a deliberate attempt to keep out global companies. A detailed forensic investigation should be initiated into the mobile call data records (CDR) of BMC officials and the directors of companies, which will expose the nexus,” Shaikh said in his letter. Shaikh asked Chahal to scrap the tenders . “I recommend an enquiry by the ACB against officials who have allowed rigging to favor the two companies,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-only-2-bids-for-2-zoo-works-rs-291cr-quoted-for-rs-185cr-job/articleshow/88328054.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The conference also decided on the 46-member district committee and the 12-member district secretariat. Meanwhile, senior leader P N Balakrishnan walked out expressing dissatisfaction of excluding three leaders, including him, from the district committee. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, industries minister P Rajeeve, former finance minister T M Thomas Isaac, former women’s panel chairperson M C Josephine were the among the senior leaders who attended the final day of the three-day district conference, which was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday. Mohanan became the district secretary for the first time in 2018 when the then secretary P Rajeeve was elected to the CPM state secretariat. Under his leadership, the party witnessed three major elections, including the Lok Sabha, civic body and state assembly polls. Mohanan became a public figure through his activities, first as a student leader during his degree course at St Peter’s College, Kolencherry, and later in the youth wing of the party. He was the state president of DYFI during 1994-2000 and later became the all India vice-president during 1992-93. He was elected as Kolencherry area secretary in 2000 and continued for five years. He was elected as the state committee member in 2012 and was the Kochi unit manager of the party mouthpiece ‘Deshabhimani’.

After walking out of the conference, Balakrishnan said that he would resign from the party primary membership but would continue as a pro-CPM activist. He alleged that the party leadership did not give a clear explanation regarding his exclusion.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, North Zone, Prachi Singh, said, “Two accused Harsh Singh and Rudra Sharma have been arrested from Aliganj crossing today. Harsh hails from Kanpur Nagar, while Rudra is from Samastipur, Bihar.” They were identified from the CCTV footage near the jewellery store on December 8, the ADCP added. Cops also recovered five gold chains, two gold rings, gold earrings and two country-made pistols along with live cartridges from their possession. “We are yet to recover the remaining looted jewellery which is with the two masterminds Saurabh Patel and Rahul Kumar,” said Singh. “Both Harsh and Rudra are property dealers and claim to be first-time offenders. Harsh said he took to crime since he was unable to pay school fees for his daughter after the pandemic hit his earnings. Rudra was also unable to fulfil the needs at home,” said police officials. “We will take the accused on remand to extract more details,” the ADCP said. Police said the two accused knew the masterminds Saurabh and Rahul for five years and went to them to seek help when their business failed due to Covid, said a police official. The masterminds always targeted shops near multiple lanes and with thin security cover so that they could escape easily, the official said. “On the day of the crime, Harsh and Rudra had entered the shop posing as customers and started the loot after holding the owner at gunpoint. When the jeweller’s employee Shrawan Shukla tried to block their escape, the masterminds waiting outside entered the shop and opened fire, hitting Shrawan twice and fled with the booty,” said an officer. The miscreants had looted 900 gm of gold ornaments from the jewellery store owned by Nikhil Agrawal. Shrawan, who was hit in the chest and stomach, is still battling for life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jewellery-store-loot-cracked-2-held/articleshow/88328066.cms||---

The civic body had suspended water supply on Wednesday over Rs77crore water tax dues by the cantonment board and residents. “We have restored water supply considering the larger public interest and we are following up with the cantonment board authorities to clear the dues,” said Aniruddha Pawaskar, the head of the PMC’s water supply department. A section of cantonment residents, trade and business establishments, however, questioned what the PMC had achieved from Wednesday’s suspension of water supply without any prior notice to them. There are 6,000 water connections, including individual, commercial and public taps in the cantonment area. “Individual tap holders in the cantonment have run up dues worth Rs29 crore, while the Pune cantonment board (PCB) owes Rs48 crore. These payments are due for over four years,” a PMC official said. A senior PMC official, who did not wish to be named, said, “The water closure was a symbolic gesture as the PCB had left us with no option but to resort to such action. Repeated follow ups for recovery of dues barely elicited any response from the cantonment officials.” He said, “The suspension of water supply also helped in checking the feasibility of alternate day water supply project. We are contemplating water cuts for cantonment areas in the days to come. Wednesday’s water cut helped us gauge the likely impact. A third reason behind water closure was to carry out some repair and maintenance works at supply lines as well pumping station that supply water to the PMC.” Another civic official said, “The matter could not be resolved even at an alternative dispute resolution forum like the Lok Adalat. The PCB did not respond to such resolution nor did it make any payment.” Darshan Chawla, a trader and founder secretary of Clover Center shopping complex, said, “We received water supply at very low pressure on Wednesday, but there was no complete cut. Often, it happens in the afternoon hours. So, we did not complain about it to the cantonment authorities. Water supply was normal on Thursday.” Former PCB member Ashok Pawar said, "On Wednesday, water supply was at low pressure in the core areas of Pune cantonment, but the same was back to regular pressure on Thursday.” Amit Kumar, the PCB chief executive officer, told TOI, “We will soon hold a meeting with PMC officials to resolve the pending water dues issue. Water supply to the military, bungalow, and civil areas was smooth on Thursday.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-restores-water-supply-to-pune-cantonment-areas/articleshow/88327298.cms||Sandip Dighe

The first CBSE civic school — brainchild of environment minister Aaditya Thackeray — was started in Poonam Nagar, Jogeshwari, in the academic year 2020-21. This academic year, 10 more CBSE schools were added to offer free education to children from kindergarten to class 6. Each class has 40 students and higher grades will be added each year. A budget of Rs 2 crore was allocated for the schools. On Wednesday, the schools received the CBSE affiliation, said BMC education officer Raju Tadvi.MPS attracted students of parents who had lost their jobs and or faced financial crunch due to the pandemic. In a tweet, Thackeray said the affiliation will further strengthen their dream to provide quality education in BMC schools. The civic body has also been running an ICSE school since last year, and affiliation is awaited. A Cambridge board school, too, will be operational in the academic year 2022-23. Parents have been demanding that the 1,200 civic schools in the city also get the attention they need. The condition of most of these schools is bad and parents said that while efforts are being made to increase the number of MPS, others remain ignored.

Though the department had mounted an unprecedented search operation mobilizing over 100 forest staff apart from using trained kumki elephants, drones, camera traps and setting up five cages, it has all proven futile so far to capture the injured tiger, which has killed as many as 16 domestic animals during the last 18 days. “We are trying out all the resources we have and we are planning to use play back of recorded mating calls of tigers to see if the tiger would respond to it,” conservator of forests, northern region (Kannur), D K Vinod Kumar said. He said that the technique was successfully tried out at Bharatpur in Rajasthan in 2011 to capture an elusive male tiger. Meanwhile, the forest authorities on Thursday repositioned some of the cages after tiger killed a cow at Payyamballi around 3km away from Kurukkanmoola. Also, a goat had gone missing from the area. Following the killing, residents raised protests and blockaded the forest officials who visited the spot and demanded that a special task force should be constituted for the search and capture operations. The staff identified the pug marks and places where it had lied down. Forest officials said that they have requisitioned around 30 police personnel to aid in the search and capture operations on Friday. Meanwhile, forests and wildlife minister A K Saseendran convened a high-level meeting of forest officials to review the situation. The minister said that the government was fully aware of the emotions of the public and all attempts will be made to tranquillize and capture the tiger. After capturing it, the tiger will be given treatment, he said. Chief wildlife warden Bennichan Thomas had been deputed to leave for Wayanad on Thursday, for coordinating the activities to capture the tiger, Saseendran said. He said that the search operation will be extended to the interior forest region as well.

The bullock cart race is a popular and traditional sport in Western Maharashtra and in Pune district. Several bullock cart owners burst firecrackers and organized processions to celebrate the court verdict. “It’s a huge relief to lakhs of farmers and race lovers,” said Ramkrishna Takalkar, a representative of the Akhil Bharatiya Bailgada Sharyat Sanghatna. “We will ensure that all the races are conducted as per the rules and regulations made by the state government in 2017. Apart from a traditional sporting event, the rural economy too is associated with bullock cart races. Thousands of food stall vendors earn their livelihood through the races.” Bhaguji Tengle, owner of six bulls from Khed, said the court verdict would help to save the ‘khilar’ breed from extinction. “Nowadays, very few farmers are using bulls for farming. If the races are stopped, who will buy these bulls?” For some farmers, the race is a lucrative business. They buy young male calves from various animal markets in the state and raise the calf with a lot of care. “If he runs well, the owner may fetch a price in some lakhs,” said Genbhau Pokle, another bullock cart owner. Ever since the races had closed it had become a political issue particularly in the Shirur Lok Sabha constituency, where the races were conducted in large numbers in the past. State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat said on Thursday that the entire issue was close to the farmers and their interests. Former Shirur MP Shivajirao Adhalrao Patil, a vocal supporter of the race, said, “The ban was painful for many in the rural areas. People had started conducting the races in a clandestine manner. They got cases registered against them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/a-win-at-the-end-of-a-long-race-farmers-of-maha-on-sc-verdict/articleshow/88327303.cms||Sandip Dighe

The work of sugar cane cutting has been put on hold in most of the fields in Vadange, Shiye, Peth Vadgaon and Chikhli village as well as in the areas like Kasba Bawda, Bhosalewadi, Nagala park riverside belt. Ravindra Jagtap, a farmer from Vadange village, said, “On Thursday morning, I spotted a bison coming towards our village after crossing Panchganga river. It settled in the Powar panand area. I asked my farm workers to go back to their homes. The death of a youth in Bhuyewadi is still fresh in our minds and I don’t want to put my own or others’ lives at risk.” While fields are usually abuzz with workers at this time of the year, only a few farmers were seen working in the farms in the past two days. Pundlik Mane from Chikhli village said, “Bison is a silent animal and doesn’t attack unless it feels threatened. Although I tried to convince the sugar cane cutters, they have refused to work due to the fear of bison. I am doing the work alone in my farm by taking some risk.” While Mamta Khilare, a sugar cane cutter sitting idle in a farm near Rajaram barrage, said, she had been hearing several rumours of bison sightings in the area. “As the animal prefers to take rest in sugar cane farms and also likes to eat the cane, we can’t be sure that the bison will not suddenly appear in front of us in the farm and or harm us. Hence, we have stopped our work. We have informed our contractor that we won’t work unless the bison is sent back,” she told TOI. Meanwhile, the forest department has advised the farmers to not to go to the farms at night. Even if a bison is spotted suddenly, one should not chase the animal or try to harm it. The animal will continue on its path without harming anyone, the forest officials said. Citizens have been asked to call on 1926 tollfree number of the forest department to inform about the animal sighting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sugar-cane-cutting-comes-to-halt-over-bison-sightings/articleshow/88325762.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In the first session, historian Mehru Jaffer and author Veena Talwar Oldenburg discussed their city Lucknow, with reference to the former's book. Speaking about the city, which is also her hometown, Jaffer said Lucknow has lost its old-world charm and heritage. “There’s nothing iconic left in the city, it’s not that special today. Lucknow enjoyed importance in different eras, but sadly whatever left is now a shadow of the past. People now take the ‘Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb’ as a joke,” said Jaffer. Discussing Lucknow and its residents, the duo also spoke about courtesans of Awadh, mentioning that these women were economically independent in the 18th and 19th century. “Not only were they independent, but they were also the highest earners in the city. The evidence of which you can find in 1862 tax records at the State Archives, where they find the mention as ‘Dancing and Singing girls’,” said Oldenburg. In the second session, bureaucrat and translator Ministhy S and social policy specialist, Unicef, Piush Antony discussed the former’s work as a translator and her JCB award shortlisted English translation of award-winning book ‘Anti Clock’ in Malayalam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-now-a-shadow-of-its-past-says-chronicler/articleshow/88328077.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Baisane had killed the minor by hitting her on the head with a brick as she bit him on the hand and scratched him while resisting the rape on December 7, 2020, in Pandesara area of Surat. “It is an important judgement and sends an important message to the anti-social elements,” said district government pleader Nayan Sukhadwala. “The prosecution had requested capital punishment considering the brutality perpetrated by the accused on the little girl,” said Sukhadwala, adding that the court examined 32 witnesses in just 10 days during the trial. The court also ordered the government to pay Rs 15 lakh as compensation to the victim’s family, said Sukhadwala.

As the state has 4.93 crore adult population eligible for vaccination, eight out of every 10 adult Gujaratis are fully vaccinated. The share is the third highest overall among Indian states behind Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, and the highest among states having more than 1 crore eligible population for vaccination. The target of full vaccination, however, has remained an uphill task for the state health department. On August 19, Gujarat achieved 1 crore fully vaccinated population. Since then, in the nearly four-month period, the state recorded vaccination of 1.4 crore for the first dose and 3 crore for the second – recording double the share of second doses in total. Based on the state health department figures, as of December 16, Gujarat has 28.5 lakh eligible persons who have not yet taken the first shot. The analysis reveals that the urban areas – majority of the municipal corporations – have over 95% compliance, which drops in several districts in central Gujarat and Saurashtra. Ahmedabad city has achieved 99% coverage of the first dose. “Attempts have been made to get social and religious leaders in several areas to make appeals and to get health workers visit remote locations to convince people to get the jab. At 94%, the state’s coverage of first dose is good, but attempts are made to identify pockets with low numbers and find reasons for low compliance,” said a senior health department official, adding that those who are due for the second dose are also called by the health workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-crosses-4-crore-mark-for-second-dose-8-of-every-10-adults-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88327318.cms||Parth Shastri

If the order on night-time post-mortems is implemented in state, each government hospital can perform three to four autopsies in addition to the ones performed in the daytime. According to forensic experts, more than 25,000 autopsies are performed in different government hospitals and Vaidya Vidhana Parishad hospitals every year. The state is already facing a shortage of forensic doctors. “The state already reels from a shortage of forensic medicine doctors. We can perform night post-mortems but we need facilities. We need additional doctors and supporting staff for that,” Andhra Medical College forensic medicine head of the department and retired major V Chandra Sekhar told TOI. Unless arrangements are in place, including additional staff, watchmen, and infrastructure, it would not be possible to conduct night post-mortem, he added. “Presently, there is no fixed number of supporting staff in mortuaries. Hospitals like KGH or GGHs need two mortuary technicians or forensic trained nurses and four to six mortuary attendants (thotties in local parlance), besides two watchmen for receiving bodies round the clock,” a forensic doctor said. Forensic medicine experts say infrastructure should be upgraded in all hospitals including lighting arrangements and other facilities, besides separate generators for uninterrupted power supply. “Security should be enhanced for night post-mortems because a majority of the people come to mortuary in an inebriated condition. So doctors and staff need police protection.,” a PG student, Pradeep, felt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/night-autopsies-call-for-more-staff-infra/articleshow/88326634.cms||Siva G

Handing out appointment letters to 58 sub-divisional magistrates, 34 Basic Shiksha Adhikaris, 173 Samiksha Adhikaris, 43 senior lecturers, 173 review officers, 398 sugarcane supervisors, 10 senior cane development inspectors, 208 assistant engineers and 236 stenos selected through UPPSC on Thursday, the CM said that appointments by the previous dispensation was done after taking ‘dahej’ or dowry. Saying that his government had completely cleaned up the system for appointments, the CM credited his team for having managed to change the opinion about the state both nationally and internationally. “Good governance does not come with just changing the government, but we also need good people as part of the administrative machinery. They require training and a positive environment to work in,” the CM said, adding that after the BJP came to power in 2017, there was no corruption in any recruitment process and where necessary, the government had changed those responsible for the selection process and sent the corrupt officials to jail. “Earlier, when recruitments used to happen, all relatives of the previous government used to be out, doing ‘vasooli’. Every selection was marked by corruption, from the public service commission, UPPSC to police etc. Not a single post was filled without taking money. In the past five years, of which we only had about three years to work due to Covid-19, we have managed to clean the system completely,” he said. Saying that despite having the largest population, UP was the sixth largest economy in the country but his government had managed to bring it to the second spot. Earlier, no investor wanted to come to UP but now people were appreciating the law and order situation and the mafia, which was ruling the state, was now running for their lives. In ease of doing business, the state had moved from the 14th position to the second over the past five years. “When people think of the top three states they would like to invest in, UP always finds mention. Ease of living is being improved and we are working towards achieving this based on the parameters given by the Centre ” he said. Calling officers the ‘backbone’ of the state, the CM said that if the backbone broke, the entire system would collapse. Previous governments had made UP a state without a backbone and his government intended to make the state number one in the country with efficient officers. Encouraging them to work efficiently and honestly, the CM said: “Some officers are topper of their batches. But those who should have been in respectable positions are in jail due to their indulgence in corrupt practices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-corruption-nepotism-in-up-appointments-wiped-out/articleshow/88328098.cms||Neha Lalchandani

KMC’s administrator Kadambari Balkawade signed the administrative order to implement the decision on Wednesday. Kolhapur district guardian minister Satej Patil made the announcement regarding the civic body’s decision on Thursday. According to the order, the individuals will get 2% concession in the property tax if they set up the charging stations for charging of their own electric vehicles and make the facility available to the other electric vehicles owners without causing obstruction to the traffic. For the housing societies, the concession will be up to 3% if the charging station is set up without consuming space for vehicle parking. The housing societies can also operate the charging stations not just for the residents of the societies but for commercial purposes. If the charging station is restricted only for the residents of the housing society and not for commercial purpose, then the property tax for the space utilised will be charged as per domestic rates and not commercial rates of property tax. In any case, the charging station should not obstruct the emergency path of the housing society. “The decision has been taken to promote electric vehicles and clean environment. To further the cause and help Kolhapur citizens benefit from the policy, the decision to grant concession in the property taxes has been taken,” said Patil. The consumers from Kolhapur city are slowly turning to the environment-friendly transportation. A steady rise in the electric scooters has been reported in the city in last few months and the sale is likely to grow further. The city, however, lacks common electric charging stations mainly for the cars. Therefore, the sale of electric cars is low and consumers still prefer petrol or diesel cars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/get-2-off-in-property-tax-for-ev-charging-stations/articleshow/88325791.cms||---

He said that modalities regarding e-bike taxis were being worked out. Singh was speaking at an electric vehicle accelerator workshop for EV start-ups and entities organised by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and think-tank RMI India. State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray and Pune civic commissioner Vikram Kumar also attended the session. The event focused on four working groups on issues in the Electric Vehicle (EV) ecosystem such as battery infrastructure, awareness on EVs and its infrastructure among others. “When I went to London and spoke to Transport for London (TfL, London’s statutory transport authority) officials, one of them told me that the solution for effective last-mile connectivity is on foot. We do not have as good quality footpaths as London, or some other countries, so civic authorities such as the PMC can take more action on that,” Singh said in his address. He added, “As for electric rickshaws, they slow down traffic and cause traffic build-ups on roads due to their low speed. Electric two-wheeler taxis can be a good solution, but a lot of issues, especially liabilities are being worked upon right now on a regulatory framework basis.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/transport-dept-official-govt-not-keen-on-e-rickshaws/articleshow/88327332.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

On December 8, Ahmedabad had recorded 23 cases. The 25 cases recorded on December 7 is the highest number this month. With the discharge of nine patients, active cases increased by 11 to 159, crossing the 150-mark again. With Gujarat having 580 active cases – the highest number in five months – Ahmedabad accounts for 27% or more than a fourth of the state’s active cases. Six patients are on ventilators. At 68, the number of cases recorded in 24 hours rose by of 28% from 53 on Wednesday. The new cases include 20 from Ahmedabad city, 12 from Vadodara city, nine from Surat city, seven from Rajkot city, five each from Gandhinagar and Navsari, three from Jamnagar city, two each from Kutch and Valsad, and one each from Bharuch and Rajkot districts. Cities account for 75% of the cases. “The number of tests conducted to identify cases has also increased, and so has contact tracing of confirmed cases. We are not getting many instances where multiple members of the same family are infected. However, the need of the hour in light of increasing cases is to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said a city-based public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-records-20-new-cases-after-8-days/articleshow/88327334.cms||---

Guided by forest department officials, the bison finally returned to its habitat near Valtai hill in the Panhala region by afternoon. While the animal was traversing from Vadange to Ambewadi village, the officials guided it across the highway road on the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri state highway. It resulted in traffic being stopped on the highway for around half an hour. Karveer range forest officer Ramesh Kamble said, “At 3am on Thursday, the bison was spotted at SP Office chowk from where it travelled through the city streets taking Pitali Ganpati chowk, RTO office, Vivekanand college, Nagala park, collector’s office, CPR hospital chowk and again to the farmlands near the Siddharthnagar entrance.” Kamble said, This is the same bison which was spotted in the Kadamwadi-Bhosalewadi area on Wednesday. There has been no trace of the bison that was involved in the death of a 21-year-old villager at Bhuyewadi.” Santosh Walvekar, veterinary doctor with the forest department, said, “After crossing the Panchaganga river, the bison reached Vadange village area at 7am and stayed in the sugarcane farms. At around 1pm, it came out and crossed the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri state highway.” The forest department, police, a wildlife rescue team, the district disaster management team and fire-fighting officials helped in guiding the bison back to its habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/bison-seen-again-in-kolhapur-city-guided-back-to-habitat/articleshow/88325914.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Lucknow||UP: BJP tries to cement grip on grassroots with sops for rural bodies||LUCKNOW: The Yogi government’s decision to raise the honorarium of rural local bodies chairpersons and members and bestowing more administrative powers marks BJP’s attempt to reinforce its grip at grassroots and mobilize foot soldiers, especially in rural areas, ahead of state elections due early next year. On Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced raising the honorarium of various rural local bodies chairman and members by Rs 500 to Rs 1,500 and raised their financial powers from Rs 2lakh to Rs 5lakh. The move comes around five months after BJP swept rural local bodies’ polls, winning 67 of 75 posts of zila panchayat chairman and 640 of 825 block pramukh chairman posts in a high-stakes election that saw a direct contest between BJP and SP. Though local bodies’ elections are not fought on party symbols, BJP had formally announced names of its candidates, triggering a frenetic electoral battle which was considered a precursor to the big poll contest in 2022. The election largely remained restricted between BJP and SP, despite Mayawati’s BSP and Congress throwing their hat in the ring. Notably, in 2016 when SP was in power it won 60 of 75 seats of zila panchayat chairman. Yet, the party was decimated by the saffron outfit a year later in 2017 assembly poll. Experts point out that the sop announced by CM would arm BJP to mobilize its functionaries at rural local bodies, which hold the key to the assembly elections. Records show that nearly 8.7lakh chairpersons and ward members of zila panchayat, kshetra panchayat (block level) and gram panchayat were elected directly as well indirectly in July. “The decision to raise honorarium and increase administrative powers of rural local bodies is bound to send out a strong message at grassroots. Local bodies representative with neutral leanings may surely get moved by the state government gesture,” said political expert JP Shukla.  “However, one cannot say the same for those who have anti-BJP leaning,” he said. BJP leaders pointed out that local bodies representatives have a big role in implementation of welfare schemes of the Centre and the state government —PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM Awas Yojana and PM Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana — entailing free food grain distribution to poor during pandemic. “This will increase their efficiency and encourage them to work harder. The basic aim of BJP is to provide due benefits to farmers and poor,” said UP BJP spokesperson Alok Awasthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-tries-to-cement-grip-on-grassroots-with-sops-for-rural-bodies/articleshow/88328121.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Hyderabad||‘If party wants, ready to contest against K Chandrasekhar Rao’||HYDERABAD: Former minister and Huzurabad BJP MLA Eatala Rajender said he was ready to contest against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the next assembly elections if the party leadership wants him to enter the fray from Gajwel. Asked whether he would run against the CM during a ‘meet the press’ programme on Thursday, Eatala said: “If the party wants me to, I will contest though my roots are in Huzurabad. I am connected with the constituency.” He, however, denied having any differences with BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay or Union minister G Kishan Reddy. “All these rumours are floated by the TRS camp. We worked together in Huzurabad by-election and we will work together to build the party.” He said the BJP does not go by caste lines and works as a cohesive unit. Responding to a query on his allegiance to left ideology while continuing in the BJP, he said: “In politics, everything is dynamic. Given the circumstances, I had decided to join the BJP. I will be with the BJP and there is no truth in saying that I will eventually join Congress. Again, this is a speculation generated by the TRS camp.” Asked about his stint in the BJP so far, Eatala said: “I was with the TRS for a long time. I did not leave the party. I was forced to quit as they cannot disregard my self-respect. I always go by conviction.” He said though all the TRS leaders fought for statehood, the CM did not allow anyone to have freedom after coming to power. “I had to endure a great deal of humiliation. I was the TRS floor leader for a long time, yet I was not even considered a star campaigner in Karimnagar during the 2018 elections,” he claimed. He alleged that cabinet sub-committee reports have no value. Even the review meetings with high-level officials are held without the involvement of the relevant minister, he charged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/if-party-wantsready-to-contestagainst-kcr/articleshow/88327331.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

He claimed that the state government is misleading farmers in the state over paddy procurement and blaming it on the BJP government at the centre. “According to the agreement, the state government should complete the procurement for this season before accusing the central government,” he said.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-cm-must-address-t-issues-first/articleshow/88327338.cms||---

The second phase will be from Bund Garden to the Mundhwa jackwell. The tenders for the Rs260-crore first phase of the project were issued in October. As many as 12 firms have approached the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and bought the tender applications. The project cost has gone up to to Rs4,200 crore from Rs2,300 crore. The standing committee of the PMC had in October given its nod to the beginning of the project.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan hops on to the devpt buggy, CPI refuses to join bandwagon||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday reiterated his commitment to Kerala's economic development and to turn the state into a favoured investment destination even as he railed against a certain destructive mindset that sought to scuttle growth in the guise of environment and equity. The CM made his pro-development remarks while inaugurating Lulu Mall in the state capital but LDF's second biggest constituent CPI seemed to have different ideas, with its state council meeting on Thursday witnessing heated oppostion to the semi-high speed K-Rail project, the CM and LDF government's pet project. The CM said the state government plans to attract investments worth Rs 10,000 crore in a short period of time and explained the steps taken by his government to promote MSMEs in the state. "There are some people who claim to be public workers but work against the interests of the public. It has become a practice in Kerala that complaints start pouring in against development projects as and when they are announced," he said. "Our state is getting ready for more ventures like this. We are aiming to create a knowledge economy and society. People should realise those who try to hinder our developmental activities." Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, who also spoke at the mall inauguration function, was all praise for the CM's development initiatives but the CPI leaders were not that convinced. The CPI state council meeting in Thiruvananthapuram reportedly saw several members, including former ministers V S Sunilkumar and K Raju, speaking against the K-Rail project. The government has been pushing the controversial project as a green and viable initiative despite opposition. The CPI state council members were reportedly critical of the financial viability and environment impact of the project as opposed to the government claims. Some members also expressed doubts about the timing of the project, asking if the state needed such a mega project while it is facing a severe financial crunch. However, party state secretary Kanam Rajendran is learnt to have said in his reply speech that the CPI was supposed to support the project that figured in the LDF election manifesto and the party cannot take the blame for torpedoing a big-ticket project. Later, while addressing a news conference, Rajendran chose not to support higher education minister R Bindu who is facing criticism for exerting pressure on governor Arif Mohammed Khan on appointment of Kannur University VC. He had criticised the governor the other day for his remarks against the government. "As far as I know, the minister has no right to make such recommendations. I don't know whether my knowledge is complete or not,'' he said. It is believed that Rajendran changed his stand on the controversy also following criticism in the council meeting. He, however, refused to react to specific questions like whether the minister committed abuse of power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-hops-on-to-the-devpt-buggy-cpi-refuses-to-join-bandwagon/articleshow/88327359.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Malabar tree nymph wins the vote to be state butterfly||PANAJI: The Malabar tree nymph, known for its attractive black and white wing pattern and unique flight movement, was declared Goa’s state butterfly on Thursday, at the fifth Goa Bird Festival at Chorao. This has made Goa eighth in the country to have a state emblem species. Malabar tree nymph won the vote overwhelmingly when the state forest department held consultations with scientists, ecologists, conservationists and the public. The species is endemic to the Western Ghats and though it is found in southern Maharashtra, its real distribution starts from Goa. Malabar tree nymph has a wingspan of 120–154mm. “The plant that its caterpillar feeds on is found along riparian forests lands along watercourses and water bodies. This highlights the habitat of the species,” said naturalist Parag Rangnekar. The butterfly has an attractive flight as while gliding over a tree canopy it suddenly stops flying and starts hovering. “Goa is not just about the sun, sand and sea, but is also known for the hinterland tourism, nature tourism and patriotic tourism and the government is endeavouring to promote all types of tourism to boost tourism activities in Goa,” said chief minister Pramod Sawant as he declared the state butterfly of Goa. The two-day bird festival of Goa is being hosted at Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, Chorao. A short film on the state butterfly was also screened on the occasion. In areas in Goa like Bibtyan, Brahma-Karmali, Sattari, Malabar tree nymphs are found throughout the year in the evergreen vegetation. The forest department had formed a committee of ecologists and Commander, Clipper, Common Jezebel and Blue Oakleaf were the four other butterflies shortlisted. Some of the attributes considered while selecting the state butterfly are the species’ uniqueness, endemism, ecological status, encounter rate, aesthetic appeal, conservation status and its associated cultural importance. At Thursday's event, Goa Bird Conservation Network (GBCN) member Mandar Bhagat was also felicitated for his work in the field of conservation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/malabar-tree-nymph-wins-the-vote-to-be-state-butterfly/articleshow/88328125.cms||Nida Sayed

It may be recalled that finance minister Nirmala Seetaraman had announced that the government was planning to privatise two more public sector banks soon. Employees’ unions alleged the move would affect job security and number of employees would come down. Bank staff will strike work on Friday as well.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has taken the decision to provide relief to the residents from the flood-affected localities. In July, unprecedented floods occurred and the Panchganga river water entered most parts of the city. Water supply to these areas was stopped and resumed after two weeks. Prashant Pandat, water tax superintendent of KMC, said, “We carried out the survey through our meter readers. Similar concession was given to those affected by the floods in August 2019. The KMC will face revenue loss of around Rs 8.83 lakh due to the decision.” The water supply department has uploaded the list of connection holders, who will benefit from the decision. The KMC has, however, appealed the citizens that if their name is missing from the list of beneficiaries and they too were affected by the floods as per the survey done by district revenue department, then they can approach the KMC to avail the concession to be given in billing cycle of June-July. Such citizens have to produce documents to receive concession. The water supply department has cleared that the concession will be given in June-July billing cycle only and not in the earlier dues and fines. Out of 3,620 connections, 3,448 connections are household connections, 150 shops and 22 connections provided to the cattle sheds. Most of the domestic connections are from E ward of the city, which was worst affected due to the floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/upto-50-off-in-water-tax-for-flood-hit-in-kolhapur/articleshow/88325801.cms||---

As per the letter sent by the head of the said NCERT division to Dinkar Temkar, director of primary education, Maharashtra, the objectives of the study are to look into the role and functions of teachers and other actors in planning and implementation of various activities of the school; the relation between and amongst various actors in the school; teaching-learning processes in the school; and support conditions received from the community members, parents, alumni, etc. The research study will be carried out in situ for 20-30 days by the team from NCERT. Teachers from the ZP school said that the idea of it being open 365 days a year is to ensure that students from economically and socially disadvantaged situations are always in touch with formal, structured education and other activities. Dattatray Sakat, the headmaster who started it all, said the school has been functioning 365 days for the past 21 years, since 2001. “When the first lockdown was announced in March 2020, we closed the school down physically, but online education continued. We also arranged for 15 smartphones, so that students who did not have access to online education could join the classes. In October last year, we started offering physical classes again. There were learning gaps among students that we needed to fill, and since then, we have not closed the school down again even for a day,” he told TOI. Sakat is accompanied by two more teachers in his effort — his wife Baby Nanda and another teacher who joined two years ago, Kailas Dasgude. “It is hard to get teachers for the school as nobody wants to work 365 days a year. In the last 21 years, by the grace of God, I have never fallen severely ill. I could always come and teach for an hour or two at least. We divide our work and also train senior students to teach juniors. The response has been so good that we have around 50 students in our balwadi (pre-primary) and 70 studying in standards I to IV,” said Sakat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ncert-team-to-study-pune-zp-school-that-runs-365-days-a-year/articleshow/88327352.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Airline to be issued notice for loader’s Abu Dhabi trip||MUMBAI: The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) will be issuing show-cause notices to IndiGo and its ground handling subsidiary over the security lapse incident involving a loader who travelled from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi in the cargo hold of the airline’s aircraft this past Sunday. “An inquiry by a joint director rank officer of Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has been ordered to probe the incident,” said M Nowshad, joint director (tech), BCAS. “Show-cause notices are being issued to both the entities and suitable action will be taken against them upon receipt of their replies for failing to follow the relevant aviation security directives,” he said. “This lapse on the part of Indigo Airlines security team and Agile ground handling agency supervisory staff has been viewed seriously,” he added. On December 12, IndiGo flight 6E-1835 departed from Mumbai around 3 am. In the cargo compartment was one of the loaders who serviced the flight. According to a Directorate General of Civil Aviation official, the loader said he had fallen asleep in the cargo hold and woke up only during the take-off roll. In a similar incident that occurred in the US in April 2015, a ramp worker fell asleep in the cargo hold of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 aircraft at Seattle airport. He too woke up when the aircraft was taking off. According to media reports, he kept on banging the cargo hold ceiling, which alerted the passengers and the crew. The aircraft had barely climbed to 5,000 feet when the Los Angeles-bound flight was diverted to land back to Seattle, where he was disembarked safely. In the IndiGo incident though, the loader travelled all the way to Abu Dhabi. Since the cargo compartment was pressurised and temperature-controlled, the man survived the journey. He underwent a medical examination at the destination and was sent back on the return flight. A senior security official, who requested anonymity, said: “Such an incident can occur only with a number of lapses. Did the supervisor carry out a head count after the loading was done?” The Directorate General of Civil Aviation too is probing the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/airline-to-be-issued-notice-for-loaders-abu-dhabi-trip/articleshow/88328128.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Shah held from Mumbai, in custody till Dec 24||Crime investigation department sleuths arrested Shirish Chandrakant Shah (50) in Mumbai on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in setting up shell companies in the AP skill development corporation (APSSDC) scam.  Shah, a market operator, was previously arrested by the directorate general of goods and services tax intelligence (DGGI) for laundering hundreds of crores by floating 212 shell companies. CID officials produced Shah before the ACB court in Vijayawada on Wednesday night which remanded him in judicial custody at Machilipatnam jail till December 24. In its remand report, CID said Shah played a key role in transferring government shares worth Rs 371 crore to shell company Skiller Enterprises via Pune-based DesignTech Systems Pvt Ltd in 2015. Shah also set up Allied Computers International (ACI), another shell company, which was awarded the contract to supply hardware and software. About Rs 242 crore was transferred from Skiller Enterprises to ACI, which was flagged as a shell company by DGGI in 2017 after they arrested Shah. The scam came to light when APSSDC chairman Ajay Reddy lodged a complaint with the CID alleging that Rs 241 crore worth public funds were swindled by shell companies by raising fake invoices. The CID has so far arrested five persons for being involved in the irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/shah-held-from-mumbai-in-custody-till-dec-24/articleshow/88326679.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Nagpur||Nagpur: No mention of Omicron in Arvind Patre’s report. Official confirms, says it’s technical||NAGPUR: On Thursday, Arvind Patre (40) received his genome sequencing report prepared by the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV). But, he refused to accept it as a confirmed Omicron positive report though surveillance officials and the research body insist that there’s no room for any doubt. On Thursday, as reported by TOI, Patre (he has permitted the paper to use his name) asked the authorities for his Omicron positive report. A civic official sent him the NIV report on Whatsapp which he shared with TOI wanting a confirmation. Patre, who was discharged from AIIMS on Wednesday, had his doubts as the report doesn't mention the new variant’s technical term B1.1.529 or ‘confirmed Omicron’, but only mentions positive for variant of concern. He questioned the move to declare him an Omicron patient when his report states that he is “probable Omicron” as per the NIV report. “Am I an Omicron patient? There is no confirmation in the report. It only says ‘probable Omicron (BA.1 like)’. They have put me on high surveillance though on paper I am not a confirmed patient,” said Patre. NIV officials TOI spoke with confirmed it was prepared by them but refused to comment on its findings. Dr Pradeep Awate, state public health surveillance office, told TOI, “It is a confirmed Omicron case without any doubt. How to read the genome test report and its interpretation is better explained by the research community. For us, it is a new variant and we have to be very careful. This person (Patre) came from West Africa and didn’t have any symptoms. He could be detected only because of aggressive surveillance by Nagpur civic officials. Out of 32, he is the only case of reinfection,” he said. Asked if results of other Omicron patients are similar, Dr Awate said, “These are technical scientific terms and can’t be easily explained to public in short time. ‘Omicron’, ‘Omicron likely’ and ‘Omicron probable’ have been mentioned on case to case basis.” He explained that entire genome has multiple layers. “It is studied using many analytical softwares by experts. When it matches 100%, then we call it a confirmed case. But if it is 99.99%, it is classified as likely or probable. Yet, it means genome is matching 99%,” said Dr Awate said. “We need to see the public health benefit and to contain the transmission. Whatever we have done, it is for containment of new variant and larger benefit of public health,” said Dr Awate. Patre left Burkina Faso with a RT-PCR negative report and landed in Delhi and thereafter Nagpur on December 5. He was tested at Nagpur airport and asked to go home and isolate himself as Patre had not returned from an ‘at risk’ nation. When his test report came positive on December 7, civic officials moved him to AIIMS special ward for Omicron patients. He was discharged on the 10th day after a negative report. On Wednesday, Patre told TOI that his company had refused to sanction leave unless he submitted an Omicron positive report. He is the only air passenger to Nagpur whose sample has shown the Omicron strain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-mention-of-omicron-in-patres-report-official-confirms-says-its-technical/articleshow/88326678.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Appointing vice-chancellors: Maharashtra puts foot in the door, governor may not agree||MUMBAI: The state is setting itself up for another clash with the governor. Its plans to exercise more control over a shortlist for vice-chancellors (VCs) in public universities is being regarded as the thin end of the wedge and intended to circumscribe the governor’s powers. On Wednesday, the Maharashtra cabinet cleared amendments to the Maharashtra Public University Act (2016) which will impact the process of shortlisting VCs. Altering the selection method, the state will now receive a list of five nominees picked by a selection panel, choose three and dispatch the names to Raj Bhavan for the governor, the chancellor of universities, to finally declare the candidate.  “These amendments will never pass muster at Raj Bhavan,” said Deepak Mukadam, chancellor’s nominee to Mumbai University’s management council. “Universities are autonomous bodies and all decision must be apolitical in nature. The state’s ruling party has its own political interests and universities must be kept out of that to allow them to flourish.”  Sources in Mantralaya said the state has decided to not just shortlist names for the VC, but is also mulling over bringing in similar control for other senior appointments. The state may want a say in the appointment of Senate members, registrar and the finance officer. Moreover, a pro-chancellor, a post that will be assumed by the sitting higher education minister, is also being proposed.  According to sources, the higher education department, which will define the role of a pro-chancellor, plans to make him or her the head of several university committees. Political control over academia has become the norm in matters of appointments and development of various branches of studies, but the minister’s presence on panels is expected to impact even day-to-day functioning on campuses.  Former governor PC Alexander in whose term the Maharashtra Universities Act 1994 was enacted, had recalled that “after making up my mind as to who was the best among the persons interviewed (by the selection panel), I would hold discussions with the chief minister before announcing the choice of vice-chancellor.”  The National Education Policy also emphasises the need for an independent board, much like centrally funded technical institutes. “NEP states that the board must be free of any kind of political interference, should be unbiased and public-spirited. But the decision of the Cabinet contravenes everything that the NEP has laid down,” said educationist Anand Mapuskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/appointing-vcs-state-puts-foot-in-the-door-guv-may-not-agree/articleshow/88328130.cms||Hemali Chhapia
---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s non-Congress posturing stopping federal front?||HYDERABAD: Has TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao’s non-Congress axis become a major hindrance for his ambitious plans to play a key role in national politics? KCR appears to be in a piquant situation on the issue ever since he floated the idea of forming a federal front with non-Congress and non-BJP parties two-and-a-half years ago. For that matter, KCR has never tried to hide his interest in national politics and made his wish whenever he got an opportunity. Whether it was paddy procurement issue, farm laws or Dalit Bandhu scheme, KCR was often heard saying he would take the issue to the national stage. He even caught the national attention by announcing Rs 3 lakh ex gratia to each family of over 750 farmers who lost their lives during the protests against farm laws in the last one year. On Tuesday, KCR discussed about fighting unitedly against the BJP government at the Centre with his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin, especially on its attitude towards states. This is not the first time that the TRS president is meeting the DMK leaders. He had met former CM and DMK chief M Karunanidhi and Stalin two years ago and discussed about forming a front with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. But, the DMK had preferred to sail with the Congress. The regional party from Tamil Nadu enjoys a good equation with Congress and was even part of the UPA government at the Centre between 2004 and 2014. In 2019, KCR had met West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik by visiting the respective states. He also had discussions with Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav and JMM’s Hemant Soren by inviting them to Hyderabad. “Except Naveen Patnaik, other parties like DMK, TMC and SP have always maintained good relations with the Congress. Major parties take decisions on alliances only during the elections depending upon the emerging situation. Parties like DMK have clear idea about their support to the Congress,” political analyst SK Zakeer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcrs-non-cong-posturing-stopping-federal-front/articleshow/88327354.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Mumbai||Omicron-hit had sore throat, body ache, didn’t lose smell||MUMBAI: Slightly itchy throat, fatigue, body ache and mild fever were some of the main symptoms experienced by the patients treated at the SevenHills Hospital for the Omicron variant.  The Andheri hospital, dedicated to cases of the new variant, has handled 14 patients till now. Thirteen have been discharged. Of the 14 cases, eight were asymptomatic. “Among those with symptoms, most complained of sore throat, tiredness and body ache,” said one of the treating doctors, adding there was no disease progression in any. The HRCT scans of all the patients remained practically unchanged, meaning there was no lung involvement. Most could be treated with basic fever and pain medication such as paracetamol, while asymptomatic patients were given multivitamins. Across Maharashtra, 32 Omicron cases have been reported. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said 50% didn’t have a single symptom. The rest had mild fever on Day 1, runny nose, and fever with cough. Interestingly, anosmia or loss of smell that has been considered a marker of Covid-19 was not seen in any of the Omicron patients, said Awate. Of the 32 infected, 25 (78%) were vaccinated and five were minors. The two unvaccinated individuals didn’t see any major symptoms either. One of them, a Nagpur resident, was a case of reinfection. The man suffered mild illness even during the last bout. The SevenHills physician said it would be premature to comment on the severity of Omicron as the cases they have encountered are few and among fully vaccinated young people without any comorbidities. A small detail that was different in Omicron patients from those with the Delta variant is fever spikes. “In Delta patients, we would often see high grade fever, surging multiple times a day. We didn’t see this in Omicron patients. They had mild fever with hardly any spikes,” the doctor added. Since nobody had a major progression of the disease, they didn’t administer monoclonal antibodies. Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner, said from the initial cohort of patients, nobody needed oxygen support or any escalation in treatment. Mumbai has seen the highest cases (13), followed by 10 in Pimpri Chinchwad. That cluster includes four children. Local doctors said the children were asymptomatic despite being unvaccinated. Doctors attending to the sole infected patient in Latur, a 33-year-old man, said he had only mild fever and cough. “On returning to Mumbai from Dubai, he experienced these symptoms and was quarantined at home,” said Dr Hanmant Wadgave, district health officer. He has fully recovered but his latest RT-PCR test report has come inconclusive, so he is still in hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-omicron-hit-had-sore-throat-body-ache-didnt-lose-smell/articleshow/88327372.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Thiruvananthapuram||City shuttle & radial services to follow a circular route||Thiruvananthapuram: A month after city circular service was launched in the city; KSRTC will follow it up with colour-themed city shuttle and city radial services. City shuttle service which is set to be launched in January 2022 aims at establishing connectivity with the rural periphery covering major areas which account for high traffic to different places in the city. “City shuttle and city radial services are part of the larger plan to revamp the transport network in the city. City circular service was a beginning. “Peripheral services under city shuttle will cover areas where a good number of persons disembark and board the bus in rural areas. We are slowly bringing in a behavioural change among the passengers as part of ensuring a convenient and hassle free connectivity,” said Biju Prabhakar, chairman and managing director, of the KSRTC. Pallichal - East Fort, Malayinkeezhu - Vikas Bhavan, Karakulam - Peroorkada, Mannanthala - Medical College, Thiruvallam - Manacaud, Kazhakootam - Medical College are some of the routes which will be covered under the city shuttle. KSRTC is hoping to establish a sufficient number of interchange points wherein a passenger from the nearest rural suburb can head to the desired destination in the city without having to look for other modes of transport. Once the services become fully operational, the long distance services currently running from the city to rural areas will be gradually discontinued. The authorities are hopeful that the newly launched services will break even in due course of time and expenses going into daily operation of present services connecting the city to rural destinations in the Thiruvananthapuram district could be redirected into city circular and city shuttle services. A city radial service that will circle the city connecting places like Neyyattinkara and East Fort, Thampanoor to Kaniyapuram or Vizhinjam to East Fort is also being planned. This is mainly meant for passengers who do not require interchange buses. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan flagged off the first service of KSRTC’s new venture `City Circular Services` in November. In order to identify the routes quickly, different colours, including red, blue, magenta, yellow, violet, brown and green are allocated for each route. KSRTC will implement the interchange method to ease the transportation by which a passenger can travel from one place to another without having to reach the heart of the city. The interchange method helps the transportation easier by allowing the passengers to interchange the bus at certain places. The interchange points are the stops where more than one route bus meets. About 24 such interchange points have been implemented in seven routes of the KSRTC service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/city-shuttle-radial-services-to-follow-a-circular-route/articleshow/88306110.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole must take moral responsibility for MLC poll defeat: NCP||NAGPUR: Days after a crushing defeat in MLC polls, fissures have started to appear in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) constituents. NCP blamed Congress state president Nana Patole for lack of planning and asked him to owe moral responsibility for the debacle. The former ally of Congress in Democratic Front (DF) government targeted Patole after he questioned NCP’s presence in Vidarbha and made a statement that it would be wiped out from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). NCP’s Maharashtra spokesperson Pravin Kunte Patil told TOI that there was an absolute lack of political maturity shown by Congress state leadership led by Patole. “There was no coordination with the alliance partners right from the day they imported former BJP corporator Ravindra Bhoyar. Patole must shoulder the responsibility of such an embarrassing defeat, where 44 members from the MVA had cross-voted,” he said. Patole has already refused to take responsibility for the defeat stating that it was a part of their strategy to confuse the saffron party. He was not available for comment as his phone was switched off. Patil pointed out that when the MPCC chief was planning to close NCP’s shop in Vidarbha, his own party suffered a massive setback and embarrassment due to the fiasco before December 10 polls. “When we are collectively fighting the opposition, Congress leadership should have kept the coalition partners in the loop while selecting or changing the contestant. Instead, you are targeting us, which sends wrong message among the workers from all three parties. Entire episode exposed the Congress badly and brought to fore its shortage of finding a suitable candidate,” said Patil. Exhorting the Sonia Gandhi-led party to do introspection after the debacle, NCP city president Dunesh Pethe said Patole must admit that his planning went haywire, and its voters defected to the BJP. “Their decision to import a lesser-known candidate from the opposition was a mistake. Then changing him, just before 12 hours of the elections, was a big blunder. It never happened in the history of MLC polls that the candidate was changed at such a crucial time. They should have persisted with Bhoyar to save from embarrassment rather than supporting an independent.” Accusing Patole of underestimating the MVA constituents, Pethe said it is high time he does self-introspection and keep his house in order before pointing fingers at others. “If he is saying that NCP and Shiv Sena votes were defected, he should check the ballot papers. The Congress confused the voters and that led to fiasco and defeat. The party has many good and competitive candidates like former minister Rajendra Mulak, senior corporator Praful Gudadhe and Ashok Singh, but they surprisingly preferred a former RSS activist.” Agreeing with them, NCP’s Nagpur district chief Baba Gujar said Congress never took partners in confidence before allotting a ticket to Bhoyar and then withdrawing support to him and voting for independent candidate Mangesh Deshmukh. “It is the basic responsibility of Patole to consult our senior leaders like MP Praful Patel and state president Jayant Patil. With his questionable moves, he confused the voters and also kept the partners in the dark. Their planning was extremely poor, even the Band Baja players have better planning than Congress. They need to do a lot of self-introspection, if they want to excel in civic polls,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/patole-must-take-moral-responsibility-for-mlc-poll-defeat-ncp/articleshow/88327365.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Goa||Bambolim citizens move nat’l human rights panel over road||Panaji: Unhappy with the inaction of the state authorities over their complaints, the senior citizens of Palmar Colony, Bambolim, have now approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). The have alleged that the highway works contractor at Bambolim has changed the alignment of the road to save the commercial interest of a single building owner. The traffic and dust pollution caused as a result of the alleged illegalities has violated the human rights of the senior citizens living in the Palmar Colony nearby, the petitioners told the NHRC. They have asked the NHRC to order payment of Rs five lakh compensation to the senior citizens for the physical and the mental suffering. They have also demanded with the NHRC that the contractor should be ordered to restore the original highway alignment and to restore the excavated hill. “The contractor has diverted public transport through the private residential colony of the complainants creating nuisance to the complainants and damages to the internal road of the colony, which continues till now in spite of the direction by Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, issued on September 17, 2021, to the national highway authorities to resolve the issue immediately,” the senior citizens have told the NHRC. The National Highway Authority, in July 2017, signed the contract agreement with the Goa PWD to develop Karaswada-Porvorim-Panaji-Bambolim stretch of NH 66. However, the senior citizens said the work was stopped abruptly in the stretch at Bambolim near a commercial building in 2019 after carrying out “a lot of unnecessary hill cutting in the abutted private property of a real estate owner in the name of highway widening”. “On January 4, 2021, work was restarted by the contractor, encroaching the opposite road, used by the complainants and others, making the two-way road into a one way, without approval from traffic department or the collector,” the senior citizens have alleged submitting RTI documents to support their claims. The senior citizens have been petitioning all state authorities concerned, including the chief minister, ever since the work on the highway resumed in January this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bambolim-citizens-move-natl-human-rights-panel-over-road/articleshow/88348480.cms||---

Emporium to come up in the area created on upper floors of Mandir Chowk is likely to become operational first, said the divisional commissioner and chairman of board Deepak Agrawal mentioning that its tender had already been floated to complete the process by Friday. These emporiums will be for the tribal arts, handicrafts and handlooms prepared under the one district one product scheme, he said. Apart from it the financial feasibility report for spiritual book shop, house keeping, cleaning work and security, which will be outsourced, has also been submitted by the Ernst and Young- the consultant company appointed to prepare a model for operations and maintenance of KVD, said Agrawal mentioning that allotment of these work through tender process would also be completed soon. The consultant company will also submit the financial feasibility report for Varanasi gallery, city museum, tourist facility centre, guest house, jalpan kendras (refreshment centres) and multi-purpose hall very soon after which similar process will be adopted to operationalise them, he said. The allotment of 65 shops inside the KVD will be done through internal auction process by giving the shop owners, who were removed after purchasing buildings for the expansion of the shrine area, priority. Following the opening of the KVD by PM Narendra Modi on December 13, the SKVSADB has not only ensured the restarting of second phase work of this project to complete it by February end but the process for operationalising all facilities insides the shrine area has also been started with an accelerated pace. All these facilities are coming up in 23 buildings constructed in the first phase of the project and also new blocks being created at the entrance gate on the banks of river Ganga near Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats. Officials said these facilities at KVD will enable visitors to spend quality time and buy souvenir items and artifacts from these shops and emporiums before or after offering prayers at KVT. As per initial estimation the board will require Rs 27 crores per annum to meet the revenue requirements especially for operations and maintenance of KVD, which houses also house toilets (with 196 seats) apart from 23 major buildings including Mandir Chowk, guest houses, multipurpose hall, clinic and hospice, pilgrim facility centres, shops, Varanasi gallery and museum, food zones in 5 lakh square feet area. To find the ways for generating revenue to meet the same cost for operation and maintenance of KVD the consultancy of Ernst and Young was sought, said the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/emporium-on-upper-floor-of-mandir-chowk-to-become-operational-soon/articleshow/88348435.cms||---

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan observed that once presence of slender loris is enumerated, then steps can be taken to declare the habitat in these areas as a ‘sanctuary’ under Section 18 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Referring to a status report submitted by the forest department authorities, the judges said that it has been stated that slender loris have not been sighted in the reserved forest area of Trichy, Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Perambalur divisions. It was stated that they may be present in very small numbers in Pullivalam, Narthamalai and Sevilimalai reserve forests, however, no authentic data is available. The judges observed that the forest department along with various NGOs, was involved in creating awareness among the public for conservation of the said species. It was also stated that the principal chief conservator of forests has granted permission to Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History at Anaikatti in Coimbatore district to carry out a study on ‘Comparative Ecology and Behaviour of Slender Loris in Dindigul / Madurai Landscape’ for a period of two years. It is further stated that the School of Natural Sciences and Engineering at National Institute of Advanced Studies at Bengaluru, proposed to take up a research study from October 2022 to July 2024, said the judges. Though the outcome would be helpful for the conservation of slender loris in long-term management, the report is silent about the number of species available as on date and the details about the census already taken have not been stated. Nothing is also stated in the status report about the efforts taken by the state government to protect the slender loris species which may shortly become extinct as they are hunted for certain medicinal purposes, the judges said. The judges observed that the state government cannot have a difficulty in taking census of slender loris in these areas and gave the directive. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by K Pushpavanam, of Madurai district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/enumerate-slender-loriss-presence-in-3-dists-hc/articleshow/88327385.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Following this, the court directed the Madurai district collector to disburse the compensation to the mother of the deceased boy within four weeks. Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order on a petition filed by M Jeya, a resident of Kochadai in Madurai district. The petitioner stated that her son, a class 10 drop out, was taken into police custody on January 13, 2019, in connection with a jewel theft case and kept under illegal custody. Four days later, she received a call from her son asking her to come to the police station. She stated that he complained of severe pain as he was physically tortured by the police personnel into accepting to have stolen the jewellery. She stated that after she complained to the magistrate on January 18, 2019, regarding the custodial torture, an official from the Juvenile Justice Board visited them and took statements, two days later. However, her son who was undergoing treatment at Government Rajaji Hospital died on January 24, 2019. She stated that there is a gross violation of human rights and the fundamental rights in her son’s case. The state government has a vicarious liability to pay a reasonable compensation for the misconduct of its servants who had beaten up her son mercilessly. Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking compensation and to provide government employment to a member of her family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/disburse-relief-to-mother-of-boy-who-died-of-custodial-torture-hc/articleshow/88327375.cms||---

With ample vaccine doses with us — 1.2 crore for December, we should manage to achieve the 100% first dose target by the month-end.” Dr Ramaswami N, Maharashtra’s National Health Mission commissioner, on Thursday told TOI, “We have increased the number of sessions to 10,000 per day. The focus has been on completing the second dose of those due, while the first dose completion is also being pushed. Regular meetings are being organised with the district collectors concerned, CEOs and health officials. Intra-district strategies are being prepared to increase the coverage.” Dr Ramaswami said reports of Omicron had pushed up the daily jabs. “The daily average jabs touched 8.79 lakh in December, which was our target in the past, too. We are now consistently meeting it as more beneficiaries are becoming due for their second shot,” he added. Dr Prashant Uike, district health officer, Bhandara said, “We have been taking out copies of due lists of each vaccination site and distributing them to various department. Each department is being given a target of a set number of beneficiaries that they have to call for the pending doses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maha-daily-jabs-at-6-month-high-in-first-2-weeks-of-dec/articleshow/88327388.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Hyderabad||CBI opposes relief to India Cements in quid pro quo case||HYDERABAD: The CBI on Thursday argued before the Telangana high court that there was a nexus between the investments made by India Cements in the firms floated by AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and YSRC MP V Vijaya Sai Reddy and the benefits the cement company had derived from Andhra Pradesh. CBI counsel K Surender said this while putting forward the case of the CBI that made the company, Jagan and Vijaya Sai as accused in the India Cements chargesheet in the quid pro quo case. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing a quash plea filed by India Cements which wants the court to quash the case against it. No head of the government should allot public assets to companies for private gain. But that was done in this case and that is the reason why India Cements bought shares of certain Jagan’s firms that were yet to be floated at a high premium, the CBI counsel said. “If one looks at the investments and benefits separately, the conspiracy will not be visible. A holistic look will show us the selfish design,” Surender said while opposing any relief to India Cements. He did not agree with the argument of the company counsel that since the high court earlier quashed the case against the company MD, the case against the company too should go. “We challenged the HC order in Supreme Court and that is yet to be adjudicated by the high court,” the CBI counsel said making it clear that the relief secured by India Cements MD N Srinivasan has not yet attained finality. Justice Bhuyan reserved his orders in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cbi-opposes-relief-to-india-cements-in-quid-pro-quo-case/articleshow/88327382.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

A division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan passed the order after taking cognizance of the earlier status report filed by the experts stating that the building was stable but it would require periodical maintenance. The experts’ team had conducted a study on the stability of the building by visiting the school recently, pursuant to the earlier order of this court. The court had initiated suo motu proceedings in 2018, after taking cognizance of media reports stating that the building was unsafe for the students. The suo motu public interest litigation sought for a direction to the authorities to take action against the erring people including government officials and contractors who are involved in the construction of the building and further sought for a direction to carry out maintenance works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-report-from-nit-team-on-school-bldg/articleshow/88327397.cms||---

Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope had last week told TOI that the state had good facilities, but would increase the number of genome sequencing laboratories to ensure testing of more Covid samples. With the two new facilities, the state would have eight genome sequencing laboratories. A senior health department official on Thursday said the two laboratories would be set up at a cost of over Rs15 crore. Dr Rajesh Karyakate, state coordinator for genome sequencing told TOI, “ As of now, the six genome sequencing laboratories —B J Medical College, National Institute of Virology, National Centre for Cell Sciences, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune and Kasturba hospital in Mumbai — are conducting genome sequencing. Besides, there’s the added facility of MoU between the government and Delhi-based Council of Industrial and Scientific research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology,” he said. Currently, 3,600 samples are sent every month — 100 from each district of Maharashtra — for genome sequencing. Data revealed that over 21,000 samples from Maharashtra have been sent for genome sequencing since the start of the Covid pandemic to various laboratories for a range of studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/plans-afoot-to-set-up-2-new-facilities-for-genome-study/articleshow/88327401.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: HSC & SSC exams offline, theory papers in March-April||MUMBAI: The Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) and Secondary School Certificate (SSC) theory exams will be held in the offline mode in March-April next year over 35 days. The question paper pattern will remain the same as the previous years. Teachers had requested the state to change the evaluation pattern and bring in more multiple choice questions (MCQs). Last year, board exams were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and students were assessed internally. State school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Thursday announced the dates of the HSC and SSC written and oral exams. The HSC exams theory papers will be held from March 4 to April 7. Practicals, orals and internal assessments will be conducted from February 14 to March 3. The SSC theory papers will be held from March 15 to April 18. Practicals, orals and internal assessments will be conducted by schools between February 25 and March 14. Gaikwad said that exams will be based on the reduced 25% syllabus. The exams will be based on 80 marks theory and 20 marks internal assessment, projects, orals and practicals. Of the 80 marks theory paper, around 10 marks will be for objective questions. Teachers were hoping for more MCQs as physical schools reopened only in October and students suffered learning loss during online classes. Both the Central Board of Secondary Education and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations introduced two board exams this academic year. The first board exam that covered 50% of the reduced syllabus was MCQ based. The second slated for next March-April is likely to be subjective and will cover the remaining 50% curriculum. “In language papers, 30 marks are for comprehension. Students have no practice in writing long answers,” said a Class 10 teacher. Schools said though meetings were held to discuss the question pattern, none of the suggestions have been incorporated. Schools and junior colleges, though, welcomed the state decision to announce the dates. “Students were under the impression they will get results based on internal assessment. Now they will get serious about exams. We too can get down to preliminary exams,” said the principal of a Wadala college. Extending exam dates by two weeks has given schools and colleges sufficient time to prepare students. “HSC exams usually end by March first week and that is when SSC begins. This year, both the exams will be held two weeks late and that will give us time to plan,” said a school principal. Gaikwad said they hope to declare HSC results by mid-June and SSC by the second week of July. A detailed timetable of the exams will be released soon, she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsc-ssc-exams-offline-theory-papers-in-mar-apr/articleshow/88327411.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Pune||Maharashtra ready to ensure supply of 2,000 tonnes of medical oxygen||PUNE: Maharashtra was ready to ensure supply of 1,900-2,000 tonnes of medical oxygen a day as part of its preparedness to respond to any surge in Covid cases following the emergence of the Omicron variant of the virus, a senior health department official said on Thursday. The Centre on Wednesday reviewed the status of oxygen supply, equipment, ventilators and concentrators, among other medical paraphernalia, with the states and Union Territories and urged them to monitor availability of those crucial aspects of healthcare on a daily basis to ensure absolute preparedness for tackling any increase in the number of Covid infections. The official said the state had 366 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and 10 major liquid medical oxygen plans ready. Maharashtra needed nearly 1,800 tonnes of oxygen during the second wave of the Covid pandemic. The official said the state has since then readied supply of 1,350 tonnes of oxygen through the LMO plants and 225 tonnes from the air separation plant (ASP). The PSA plants can generate 379 tonnes of oxygen. “These types of plants can supply around 1,900-2,000 tonnes of oxygen. More PSA plants are coming up and will ensure increased supply,” the official said, adding that Maharashtra appeared to be in a position to ensure maximum supply of oxygen among all the states. “Maharashtra needed 1,800 tonnes of oxygen during the peak of the second wave. Currently, nearly 300 tonnes of oxygen are being supplied to hospitals per day,” the official said. The Centre has directed the states to conduct drills for checking the newly installed plants by the end of December. Another state government official said all local authorities had been told to conduct a detailed review of all their oxygen generating plants. During Wednesday’s meeting, the Centre advised the states and UTs states to ensure that the gap between equipment and systems delivered to the districts and installed at the healthcare facilities was reduced to zero. As many as 3,236 PSA plants have been installed across the country with a total oxygen generation capacity of 3,783 tonnes. State public health experts are of the view that an uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen in sufficient quantity is of critical importance to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-ready-to-ensure-supply-of-2k-tonnes-of-o2/articleshow/88327412.cms||Nisha Nambiar

During a public hearing held at dharna chowk on Thursday by Rythu Swarajya Vedika with 250 women from the families of farmers who ended their lives, they demanded that farm suicide cases be identified fairly based on the final reports of police without requiring the families to produce documentation which, they said, was difficult to obtain from private money lenders or during cultivation. They also said Rs 6 lakh ex-gratia should be paid to the 400 families who have already received proceeding notices. Other demands included that Rythu Bima should be enlarged to cover all actual cultivators, including those without land titles, and specific steps must be implemented to assure a part of the deceased farmer’s land. In the presence of the jury, which included activists V Sandhya, K Kavita and professor G Haragopal, they said Rs 20,000 should be granted to all rural households who had lost the breadwinner under the national family beneficiary system. Other demands included the establishment of a debt relief commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmer-suicides-kinseek-aid-in-3-months/articleshow/88327399.cms||---

Family of Shekhar Anjankar (60), who died of brain stroke, had given consent to donate all his eligible organs. His two kidneys and liver saved lives of three persons in the city. Heart and lungs were also allotted to needy patients in Chennai. As it was not logistically possible to transfer the organs to Chennai, both offers were declined. In two similar cases reported on November 17 and December 3, both heart and lungs were allotted to patient at the same Chennai-based MGM Hospital. But the organs went waste due to connectivity issues between Nagpur and Chennai. “Anjankar was admitted to Meditrina Hospital on December 13 in unconscious state. Doctors detected acute bleeding in his brain and started treatment. Despite all efforts, he could not be saved. A team of doctors declared him brain dead on Wednesday evening,” said Dr Sanjay Kolte, secretary of the Zonal Transplant coordination Centre (ZTCC) Nagpur. Anjankar’s wife Maya, sons Shubham and Abhishek and daughter Pragati, all were ready to donate their father’s vital organs to save lives of needy patients. Kidneys and liver were allotted locally to patients on waiting list. As local centres don’t have any registrations for heart and lungs, the ZTCC had no option but to send a national alert. The national coordination body allotted heart to a 58-year-old man in MGM Hospital in Chennai and pair of lungs to a 67-year-old man in the same hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3rd-time-in-a-month-donated-heart-lungs-go-waste-due-to-logistic-issues/articleshow/88327429.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||70% of eligible people in dist covered with two shots||Pune: The district on Thursday achieved the target of 70% double vaccination against Covid-19 with the inoculation of over 54,038 beneficiaries. According to the public health department authorities, the deadline for 70% complete vaccination was December 15. The timely achievement has given them ample time to achieve the next goal of 75% double vaccination. The target population in the Pune district is 83.42 lakh. Of them, a total of 58.65 lakh are now fully vaccinated. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “Our next target remains to achieve 75% double vaccination by December 31. The 5% target population roughly estimates to around 4 lakh, which can be achieved comfortably.” He said the district had received around 8 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin from the state government this month and more were in the pipeline according to the need. Sachin Desai, the state immunisation officer, said the target now was speedy complete vaccination across the district. “With ample vaccine in stock, we appeal citizens to get their shots at the earliest,” he said. An official from the public health department said the district was receiving a good response from the vaccine beneficiaries now. With Har Ghar Dastak drive, the unvaccinated people, too, are getting the counselling regarding the importance of the immunisation amid pandemic. Experts attributed the recent surge in vaccination in the district to concerns over the Omicron variant, among other reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/70-of-eligible-people-in-dist-covered-with-two-shots/articleshow/88327432.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The added areas were among the worst affected with residents facing difficulty every day for weeks as rainwater stagnated on the roads that were dug up for underground drainage and drinking water supply schemes. Crossing the road on foot or on vehicles was an uphill task with accidents and arguments among commuters also becoming frequent. “Roads in 14 wards comprising Koodal Nagar, Anaiyur, Sambandar Alangulam, Thiruppalai, Kannanenthal, Parasuramanpatti, Athikulam, Uthangudi and Naganakulam were dug out for drinking water supply and UGD works. While these dug out roads were to be laid, other roads too were damaged by the recent rains,” the minister told reporters and added that a detailed project report for mending the roads was prepared and sent to the government.  Funds were allotted for road relaying from the capital grant fund 2021-22 and Tamil Nadu urban road infrastructure project fund 2021-22.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur’s hero among ‘forgotten 54’: No mention in 50 year celebrations of ’71 war||Nagpur: “It was December 5 when his plane was shot down and he went missing. I had called up his wife Damyanti in Delhi last week, to say that it’s exactly 50 years since Vijay has gone. ‘It’s been so many years now,’ she replied, sounding dejected,” says 95-year-old Sunad Tambay, a retired central government officer who lives at Nagpur. His nephew, Flt Lt Vijay Tambay is among the 54 personnel of the Indian armed forces missing in action and believed to be still in Pakistani jails. Amid the celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Bangladesh war, their stories have been frozen in time. For Damyanti, now in her 70s, it has been a struggle for five decades, all in vain. The family had enough reason to believe that he was alive and jailed in Pakistan. But the government probably did not do enough to bring him and others back, they believe. In the late 1980s, Jayant Jathar, a veteran cricketer from Vidarbha, had gone to Pakistan with the Indian team. After a match, General Tikka Khan was giving away prizes when Jathar requested if he could see his nephew — Vijay. Khan agreed, and Jathar was allowed to have a look from a distance. “I even waved at him,” said Jathar after his return. Efforts with the government to get him back did not yield results, even after Jathar’s visit. Jathar passed away in April this year due to Covid. Flying a Su-7 aircraft on the western front, Tambay had taken part in repeated missions deep inside Pakistani territory when his plane was shot on December 5. He is reported to have ejected. “We have ample reason to believe that he is alive. The capture was reported in Pakistan Observer, a newspaper published from Dhaka. The news was heard on Pakistani radio and the footage of his arrest was also released,” says Col (retd) Pradeep Tambay, Vijay’s younger brother. “There was a Naval officer from erstwhile East Pakistan, who was jailed during the war. Later, he came to India for a training, and came across my cousin. Seeing the name, he asked if he was related to Vijay. The officer said Vijay was kept in a Pakistani jail along with him,” he adds. Perhaps much could have been done when 93,000 Pakistani prisoners of war were being released. At that time India had an upper hand, and could have asked for the release of those left behind. However, somehow bringing back those like Vijay did not appear to be the priority then, says Pradeep. Both the Tambay brothers went to Bishop Cotton School. Vijay later joined the National Defence Academy (NDA), while Pradeep went to the then VRCE and joined the Army through technical entry. The kin have done everything that they can but ultimately the issue needs to be taken up with a foreign country, which can only happen through the Indian government. “Me and kin of the other missing persons have gone to Pakistan twice and were allowed to visit the jails and look for them. The last visit was in 2007, and we returned empty handed,” she says. “The last political leader I met was former defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Now, amid so many celebrations, there is hardly any mention of the 54 missing personnel,” she says. “At least now he should be allowed to return, purely on humanitarian basis so that he can spend his last days in his mother land,” says Pradeep. “I remember getting the telegram about Vijay being missing action from the air headquarters. At that time we lived in Dharampeth,” recalls Sunad. “Vijay’s father Vasant Tambay was an officer of the first batch of IAS. He had served in Royal Air Force also. Letters were written to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto through Piloo Mody, a politician, as Bhutto was his classmate during pre-independence days,” he adds. “I am proud of the country’s victory in 1971, yet on a personal front there remains a certain dissatisfaction that the government did not do enough for its soldiers,” says Damyanti. “Even I have crossed 70, and don’t have many years left. Instead of the missing 54, I would rather call my husband and others the forgotten 54,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpurs-hero-among-forgotten-54-no-mention-in-50-year-celebrations-of-71-war/articleshow/88327421.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Lucknow||Cultivation of oilseed rises by 35% in UP||Lucknow: In a sign of increase in oilseed production, the area under mustard cultivation in Uttar Pradesh has increased by 35% this year as compared to last year, as per the latest figures of the state agriculture department. The development brings some respite as edible oil prices witnessed a sharp surge globally. Farmers have grown mustard in an area of 9.46 lakh hectares this year, in comparison to 7 lakh hectares last year, said a state government spokesperson. In fact, the mustard cultivation area has exceeded the target of 7.80 lakh hectares set by the state government for this year. In Lucknow alone, mustard has been grown on 15,000 hectares this year registering a sharp increase over around 9,000 hectares last year. The reasons for farmers switching to oilseed cultivation include the steep rise in edible oil prices and the campaign run by the agriculture department. The government spokesman said agriculture department officials went from village to village and encouraged farmers to cultivate mustard to achieve the target of 7.80 lakh hectares. The officials also informed farmers about the importance of taking timely care of crops and shared tips for getting higher yield. As a result of these initiatives, more than 20 lakh farmers in the state have taken to mustard cultivation in the recent past. Officials claim there will be a bumper mustard production this year in UP after several years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cultivation-of-oilseed-rises-by-35-in-up/articleshow/88328163.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police claimed the accused fled from the venue with the CCTV's DVR. The SSP on Thursday suspended the constable for "indiscipline" after he was booked for "attempt to murder" by Meerut police. The incident occurred inside a banquet hall in Gangasagar colony. The victim, identified as Vijay Kumar, was operated upon at a private hospital where doctors said the bullet had damaged his stomach and intestine. Police had initially booked two unidentified persons for the crime on a complaint by the lensman’s colleague who was present at the function. Later, police learnt that the function was of the grandson of Mahendra Singh, a head constable posted in Hapur district. Police also found that Singh had fired the bullet from his gun. “The head constable has been booked under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder). We are looking for him as he had left with the CCTV's DVR,” said inspector Neeraj Malik, Bhawanpur SHO, adding the weapon used was a licenced firearm. “The head constable was absent from duty without giving any prior notice.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai's Omicron cluster index patient recovers, back in UK||MUMBAI: The index case of Mumbai’s Omicron cluster had recovered and flown back to the UK much before his genome sequencing reports were out on Tuesday, said civic authorities. The person had completed his Covid-19 treatment and took a flight back home only after testing negative. The count of Omicron cases in the state has remained at 32 with no new cases detected on Thursday. Eight Omicron cases had been found in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on Tuesday. All were staffers of an advertising agency, said state officials, adding that members of the agency are routinely tested before every shoot. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said they were all tested around December 2nd or 3rd before a shoot scheduled for December 4. “On testing positive, their samples were sent for genome sequencing since one had an international travel history from the UK,” said Awate. According to the records, the man recovered and left for the UK around December 10. Their samples, which were sent for genome sequencing at Kasturba Hospital, were found positive for Omicron only this week. Following this, the BMC started a massive contact tracing operation for all the contacts of the seven individuals from Mumbai. One person is a resident of Vasai-Virar. In the alleged ‘superspreader party’ incident, no new positive Covid cases were reported on Thursday as part of the contact tracing operation undertaken by the BMC after several actors, including Kareena Kapoor Khan, tested positive over the last few days. Officials said around 30 samples, which were collected as part of a contact tracing drive that began after actor Sohail Khan’s wife Seema Khan tested positive, came out negative. Actor Sanjay Kapoor’s wife Maheep Kapoor and her daughter Shanaya Kapoor had also tested positive after Seema Khan. The BMC had on Tuesday collected 108 swab samples from the four buildings of Bollywood personalities Karan Johar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Amrita Arora and Seema Khan. All these samples too had tested negative. The BMC also denied reports that it has ordered an inquiry into violation of quarantine protocols by actress Alia Bhatt. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said no such steps have been ordered. Bhatt was present at the gathering on December 8 but had tested negative for Covid on Wednesday. However, BMC health committee chairperson Shiv Sena’s Rajul Patel said that in her opinion, civic officials should take action against Bhatt. “She was a high risk contact of persons who tested positive at a gathering in Bandra. Despite that she travelled back from another city to Mumbai and is posting pictures on social media. It will encourage more positive patients or high risk contacts to break quarantine norms,” Patel told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-omicron-cluster-index-patient-recovers-back-in-uk/articleshow/88327427.cms||Richa Pinto
---||India||Gurgaon Muslim group moves SC over namaz||GURGAON: A Muslim outfit formed recently in the wake of repeated protests in the city against namaz in public spaces has moved the Supreme Court, seeking contempt proceedings against officers of the state for failing to stop disruption of Friday prayers. The outfit - Gurgaon Muslim Council, which is led by former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb - has in its petition cited the court's orders on measures to be taken to "curb the communal and violent tendencies that result in perpetration of hate crimes" in the Tehseen S Poonawalla vs Union of India case in 2018 to seek action against the Haryana chief secretary and director general of police. The outfit said it will initiate wider legal moves that would include approaching the high court on different aspects that they have brought up, like inadequate space to offer namaz and land not being available to build mosques. The petition argues that the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court's directions, and the state machinery has been in a state of inaction instead of in taking effective measures to prevent disruptions of namaz. "While presently only certain elements are carrying out a hateful campaign, the inaction of the police in preventing the said persons despite prior information repeatedly given by the present petitioner and others is contempt," reads the petition filed by Adeeb, who lives in Gurgaon. In the 2018 hearings on mob violence, the Supreme Court had directed governments to adopt a three-pronged approach - preventive measures, remedial measures and punitive measures - to ensure no group of persons or organisations takes the law in their hands and to identify such tendencies to make sure no untoward incident takes place. Adeeb said Muslims in the city have been performing Friday prayers peacefully and without causing any disturbance. Namaz has been taking place in open areas, he added, because no space has been allotted for it by the municipal authorities. "It is also pertinent to note that the open locations used for the limited purpose of performing namaz are not in any manner of encroachment but rather conducted after approval from the relevant government authorities. As many as 37 locations had been designated for this purpose ," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gurgaon-muslim-group-moves-sc-over-namaz/articleshow/88329110.cms||---

Foresters have recovered 11 whiskers of the poached tiger. The buried carcass will be exhumed on Friday in presence of veterinary doctors and higher officials. Based on intelligence inputs, a team of foresters led by RFO, Saoli, VB Kambli raided the house of one Pandurang Gedam in Pendhri village in Saoli tehsil. “Gedam was detained and during interrogation he admitted that the tiger was killed by an electrified wire laid in the farm of Hirchand Bhoyar. The carcass was buried on the bank of nearby river with the help other accused,” said RFO Kambli. Three more accused, Ramdas Sherki, Pochu Gedam and Hirchand were arrested. During investigations it came to fore that Bhoyar had fenced his farm with electrified wire to prevent herbivores from intruding, but a full-grown tiger got electrocuted while crossing the farm three months back. “With help of Pandurang, Ramdas and Pochu, Hirchand dragged the carcass to the bank of the nearby river,” said the RFO. The RFO further said that the accused dug a pit at the bank and buried the carcass. “But out of greed they removed the whiskers which exposed their crime,” he said and added that they have identified the place of poaching and burial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/4-arrested-for-poaching-tiger/articleshow/88326729.cms||Mazhar Ali

However, staffers of two private agencies — AG Enviro Infra and BVG India — collected non-segregated garbage from households in most localities after giving warning and ultimatum of one day.The civic body claimed 475 metric tonne (MT) or 40% of total 1,200 MT garbage reached Bhandewadi dumping yard in segregated manner. Earlier, the ratio was below 10%.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and nodal officer of solid waste management Dr Gajendra Mahalle have warned NMC will levy fine on vehicles of two agencies transporting non-segregated garbage.In some areas, staffers of AG Enviro were seen accepting non-segregated garbage but dumping it in their vehicles after segregation. They were seen segregating to avoid strictures from their supervisors.BJP corporator Virendra Kukreja said, “It is a nice initiative and a challenging task for the civic body. As corporator, I am creating awareness among people for last 15 days. Some people started to segregate waste and some have assured to do it in a day or two. We are also encouraging people to reuse wet waste at homes itself. It will not only help reuse wet and dry waste but also conserve environment.”Congress corporator Manoj Sangole said there is no response from people in slums. “It is very difficult to implement this in slums. People there wake up leave to earn bread and butter daily, so they have no time and interest in segregating garbage. They will dump in open plots, public places and playgrounds if garbage is not lifted,” he said.A resident of Mani Layout, Pratap Nagar, Subhash Pachbudhe said the staffer did not ask them for segregated garbage and took non-segregated one.Secretary of Rachana Angan Apartment Sandeep Shirkhedkar said, “Owners of all 44 flats gave segregated garbage today. Staffers who come to collect garbage had alerted us 10 days ago. We all are following it for the cause of the city. Each and every citizen should take it as his responsibility and give segregated garbage,” he said.A resident of Chandramani Nagar, Indu Doye, said garbage vehicle did not came in her locality on Thursday. “We are fed up as vehicle comes on alternate days, or even once in two-three days sometimes. We have not been told by anyone to keep two dustbins and give segregated waste,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-1-staffers-warn-but-collect-non-segregated-waste-in-many-areas/articleshow/88326734.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Anand Lohe, owner of city-based Ashray Travels which has six buses plying to and from Goa, told TOI that the daily passenger traffic has dropped by 25%. “The passenger traffic has dropped and we think it would drop even further. December is the peak travel time to Goa and we expect an overall drop of 45% in passenger traffic,” Lohe said. While public transportation business has picked up pace since June this year, but many bus operators are still out of business due to lack of staff and maintenance issue. Baba Shinde, president of Maharashtra State Goods and Passenger Transport Association, said travel regulations were forcing passengers to cancel their trips. “Karnataka and Goa have started stringent checks of vehicles entering from Maharashtra. Hence, there has been a dip in passenger traffic,” Shinde said. Balasaheb Khedekar, president of the Pune District Luxury Bus Association, said, “The passenger traffic in both inter-state and intra-state buses has dropped by almost 50% in the last 10 days. The reason for the drop of intra-state transportation is confusing as cases have relatively dropped in the state. We believe that passengers are scared to travel again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/private-bus-operators-again-stare-at-low-business-amid-fresh-concerns/articleshow/88327444.cms||Joy Sengupta

The community finds a mention in the Constitution and exhorts members to help India develop in terms of infrastructure, defence, post/telegraph, railways and education,” said Adrian Michael, president, All India Anglo-Indian Association. Recalling the contribution of its prominent members, Michael said, “Over 25 Anglo-Indians have been conferred with the highest gallantry awards such as Veer Chakra and Mahaveer Chakra. In fact, Veer Chakra has been awarded to five defence personnel of Lucknow Origin. They are Wing Commander Desmond Eric Pushong (Indo-Pak war 1947); flying officer Dennis Oman Barty (Indo-Pak war 1948); Wing Commander Trevor Keelor (Indo-Pak War 1965); Flight Lieutenant Alfred Tyrone Cooke (Indo-Pak war 1965) and Air Marshal Denzil Keelor (Indo-Pak war 1965 and 1971).” “My fore-fathers came to India in the early 1800s for trade and then settled here. I joined the Army in 1973 but had to retire after meeting with an accident,” recalled Captain Robert Cooke. Penny Doutra, the first girl student of La Martiniere College, recalled her school time in Lucknow. Daughter of Meredith Doutra, who was the first Anglo-Indian principal of La Martiniere College, said, “It was a lot of fun with a lot of trouble as I was the only girl in the college.” Sofia Ann Innis, a student of IT College, said her fore-fathers came to India as an officer of the East India Company but her grandfather Claude Michael Innis served the Indian railways and Jal Sansthan. While her father worked in the postal services, her brother Neil is now pursuing PhD from Lyon, France.

Venkatesan submitted a representation to minister of state for personnel and public grievances Jitendra Singh in Delhi in this regard. The MP said UPSC conducts examinations for 25 posts, including Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service, to cater to the needs of the governance in the country. “But there is a systemic bias in the process of selection to the above posts since question papers for both the preliminary and main examinations are only in Hindi and English. It naturally affects striking rates of candidates belonging to non-Hindi speaking states as the candidates have to assimilate and comprehend questions in English before answering them,” he said adding that it does not ensure a level-playing field for candidates in non-Hindi speaking states. Venkatesan said that compared to Hindi-speaking states, there was a striking decline every year in the rate of candidates of non-Hindi speaking states making it through the exams. Since some all India exams are held with question papers in regional languages, he told Singh that there is every scope of conducting civil services exams also likewise. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-calls-for-upsc-exams-in-regional-languages/articleshow/88327441.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bengal’s first Omicron case tests positive, negative, negative in 7 days||MALDA/KOLKATA: The seven-year old Murshidabad boy who had been diagnosed with Omicron was released from Malda Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) on Thursday after he tested negative in an RT-PCR test. He was admitted to hospital on Wednesday after a report from Hyderabad, where his sample was taken on December 10, had confirmed Omicron, making him the first in Bengal to be infected by the variant. Malda chief medical officer of health (CMOH) Pari Nayek said: “The boy is stable and all his family members were found negative. We will release them as per health department guidelines.” MMCH principal Parth Mukhopadhyay, however, said the family had been advised home isolation for 15 days. Meanwhile, contact tracing will continue and samples of those who came in touch with the family will be collected for tests, said Mukhopadhyay. The child’s father, an engineer from Murshidabad, who has been in Abu Dhabi for the last 21 years, had landed in Hyderabad with his family on December 10. Their samples were collected at the airport and the youngest member of the family, the seven-year-old boy, was found Omicron positive. The family had travelled to Baliadanga in Malda by then, instead of returning to their home at Farakka in Murshidabad. Finally, the health department traced them at Beliadanga and their samples were collected on Wednesday. The boy, along with his father and sister, were taken to MMCH last evening. Nayek said, “We have been collecting samples of those who came in contact with the family. So far, none has been found positive. The tracing will continue.” TimesViewWe need to take cognisance of the Omicron strain's entry into Bengal and adopt appropriate counter-measures. Total vaccination, along with heeding expert advice on booster doses, compulsory wearing of masks in public and other Covid-appropriate behaviour have become even more important.Only two days after he had tested positive in Hyderabad, another test at a private laboratory in Malda on December 12 found him negative. The health department then collected his samples on Wednesday and the report on Thursday confirmed the negative status. Since the boy is not vaccinated, he needed an RT-PCR negative certificate before boarding the flight in Abu Dhabi. The test had to be conducted 72 hours prior to boarding the flight. Presumably, he had tested negative, which allowed him to take the flight. But within four days, he tested positive at the Hyderabad airport, which, health experts believe, could have happened due to various reasons. They said that presumably the boy was already harbouring the virus when he was in Abu Dhabi. “It is possible that the first test before boarding the flight to India showed a false negative due to a very low viral load at that time point of time,” said Prabhas Prasun Giri, associate professor of paediatrics at Institute of Child Health Kolkata. “There could be various factors — low viral load and intermittent shedding of the virus at the time of collecting the sample, wrong way of collecting the sample. Method of testing could affect the test result of a Covid-19 sample,” Peerless microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury said. Some said it was possible that the boy was negative all along but wrong handling of samples in Hyderabad or wrong identification of the sample had led to an erroneous report. Bangla man tests 'O' negative:The 76-year-old patient from Duttapukur, who had returned from Bangladesh has tested negative to Omicron. The man currently is admitted at Beliaghat ID hospital. "Genome sequencing report of the traveller from Bangladesh has come. Omicron variant is not detected in this sample. The variant detected is AY.4, which is a sublineage of the Delta variant," said director of health services Ajay Chakraborty. "We are planning to discharge him on Friday with an advice for seven-day home quarantine," said ID hospital principal Anima Haldar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengals-first-omicron-case-tests-ve-ve-ve-in-7-days/articleshow/88326730.cms||Subhro Maitra

Some of them would also hire additional manpower to maintain Covid protocol as they are expecting long queues till late into the night. Bars and restaurants generally experience a 50% jump — and even more — in sales on these days. The bars and restaurants would open as per normal business hours and closing will be allowed as per excise rules. The excise department charges Rs 10,000 per hour beyond midnight and generally the licence is granted till 2am. Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar pointed out that Bengal — and particularly — Kolkata has a huge Anglo-Indian population. “Allowing restaurants and bars to operate normally is a great relief for the tourists as well as for the hospitality industry. It will help in the revival of the industry. HRAEI thanks the government for its support,” he added. Speciality Restaurants chairman of Anjan Chatterjee told TOI that he would apply for time extension for the year-end days. He would also hire additional people to manage crowd. “The footfall would be at least 20%-25% more. The state government has taken the right step in relaxing the curbs,” he said. Chapter 2 MD Debaditya Chowdhury added: “The festive season sees people tending to dine out and party late night. And for Chapter 2, where we have a bar as well as live music, we are expecting a huge footfall this time. We shall apply for late closure.” Peter Cat, Mocambo and Peter Hu! owner Nitin Kosthari will also apply. “We are looking ahead after this order. For many restaurants, these days mean a lot. In some cases, it is more than 100% of normal sales,” he said. Charles Mantosh, owner of Waldorf, Magnolia, will also apply for a time extension. “The sales during this period is 25%-30% more than the normal time. We welcome this move,” he said. Pradip Rozario, owner of KK’s Fusion and Mio Amore, pointed out that it was planning special dishes. There are 4,000-5,000 bars and restaurants in the city with a combined revenue of Rs 6,000 crore-Rs 7,000 crore annually. The bar and restaurant industry in Kolkata had suffered a loss of Rs 4,000 crore-Rs 4,500 crore since the beginning of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/restos-seek-late-closure-after-night-curbs-breather/articleshow/88326742.cms||Udit Prasanna Mukherji

The Centre had directed all states to start disbursement of the amount through the state disaster management fund. Nearly 1.41 lakh deaths have been registered in the state. The state government will spend around Rs700crore in providing ex-gratia to the kin of the covid deceased. With the state government having initiated a website for applications this month, these applications will undergo a thorough verification through phone calls and home visits, stated officials from the state disaster management department. With applications being uploaded online and there being cases of duplicate applications by the kin from two districts, the state has said that unless the inheritor is verified and the application is thoroughly checked, the amount will not be disbursed. Pune district has received 9,000 applications through the website till the start of the week, and the numbers are slowly and steadily increasing, stated government officials. Across the state, 90,000 applications have been received. With it just being over a week since the website has been launched, there are some teething issues regarding incomplete documents being filled or even kin applying from different districts. A case has emerged where the kin of the covid deceased staying in two districts has applied for ex-gratia. “In order to avoid any duplication, the data of the deceased will be verified through the ICMR covid portal and the respective district authorities will make necessary inquiries,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/home-visits-phone-calls-to-check-beneficiaries/articleshow/88327440.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The social media influencer had then made a video blaming a Tablighi Jamaat meet in March for spreading Covid-19 in the country and called it a new form of terrorism. A functionary of Tamilnadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, Mohammed Kadhar Meeran, had lodged a complaint with Melapalayam police on April 4, 2020, against him. Maridhas was booked under sections 292(A) (publishing grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail), 295(A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 505(ii) (statement creating or promoting enmity or ill-will between classes) of the IPC and 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act. The YouTuber was arrested by Madurai city police on December 9 for his controversial tweet saying, “Is TN turning into another Kashmir under the DMK regime?” referring to the IAF chopper crash that claimed the lives of CDS General Bipin Rawat and 13 others. Madras high court had quashed the FIR two days ago. However, he was lodged in the Theni jail as a Chennai court on Monday remanded him in judicial custody till December 27 for forging the email of a private news channel. It was in these circumstances that he was re-arrested by Tirunelveli city police in the old case and produced before judicial magistrate V Vijayalakshmi in Tirunelveli.

A group of 6-7 farmers had gone to Betul, where races are not banned, to keep alive the tradition of Shankarpat — as bullock races are called in Vidarbha. A PIL had led to a stay on the traditional bullock cart races since 2012. So, farmers from Vidarbha had taken to loading their bullocks in mini-trucks, and taking them to places in bordering Madhya Pradesh for the races, says Metangale. He was in Betul with two bullocks and his crew, including the driver. He is now happy that the races can happen in his village too. Not as widespread as in Marathwada, yet racing has been popular in Vidarbha, farmers told TOI. A means of popular entertainment in rural areas, the races also have political implications. The racing season begins typically after Sankranti festival, which falls on January 14. The average Vidarbha farmer is rather indifferent but for the rich peasantry it is indeed a passion to chase, said sources in the hinterland. “Celebrations broke out after the SC order in pockets like Babulgan, 20km from our village, which has rich farmers,” said Anup Chavan, a farmer from Bodbodhan village in Yavatmal. Not everyone can rear the high quality bullocks used in the races, as they cost anywhere between Rs1 to 2 lakh, he said. Yet, it is undeniable that the races spur the local economy. The races are organized by local leaders, who pool money from villagers for the expenses. An entry fee is taken from participants too, said farmers. The events have a political dimension also apart from being status symbols, said sources. Manish Jadhav, also in Yavatmal, was rejoicing with others. He was among those who had been pressing hard in favour of the races. “We met all leaders, including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari, to lobby against the ban,” he said. “The nine-year stay has, however, has led to many changes. Both, the high quality bullocks and those rearing it, are a dying breed now. The breeders used to earn well, sometimes enough to fund a lavish marriage function. The stay had put the activities on hold. Not many breed the animals these days. Unable to bear the expenses, many have sold off the racing bullocks,” he said. State animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar said it’s a matter of rejoicing for farmers but it would take at least 4 to 5 years to revive the tradition now. The ban had pushed it to the verge of extinction. The government will help come up with measures to aid farmer breeding race bullocks. It could be in the form of artificial insemination and other help, he said. “The ban on races was a loss to the local economy too, as farmers from my constituency in Saoner used to rush to Madhya Pradesh for the races,” said Kedar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bullock-cart-racing-will-have-to-regain-lost-pace-after-nine-year-stay/articleshow/88327447.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kolkata||First day, no show: Customers in Kolkata see red after unions down ATM, bank shutters||KOLKATA: A bank strike ahead of Christmas has turned several faces red in anger. On Thursday, the first day of the 48-hour bank strike, most branches, as well as ATMs, were closed, including ATMs of many private-sector banks. For Souvvik Ghosh, who has a toy shop in Hatibagan, it has become a major obstacle when business is at its peak. “This is unacceptable. It was not known to me that even ATMs will be closed for two days. We need cash to run our business because, for a lot of toys, we have to pay in cash. We have lost two vital days,” he said. There are 8,500 off bank branches and 11,000 ATMs in the state. Malini Bose went to an ATM of a private bank on Ganesh Chandra Avenue, but was surprised to find it locked. “I wanted to purchase some home furnishing accessories from Chandni market and needed cash. But when I came to this ATM after getting off the Metro, I found it was shut due to a strike. Most shops do not accept cards here, so I will have to come some other day,” the Beadon Street resident said. Several traders in central Kolkata, too, faced a cash crunch because ATMs were shut on Thursday. “We need close to Rs 5,000-Rs 10,000 in cash every day to pay the porters, commercial vehicle owners and for other sundry expenses. We forgot to withdraw the money on Wednesday and all ATMs are shut on Thursday and Friday. We will have to pay them on Saturday, when banks and ATMs reopen,” said Rajesh Sinha, owner of an electronic goods store in Chandni. The president of AIBEA and GS of BPBEA, Rajen Nagar, said that bank branches and ATMs in the state remained non-functional. “There was a massive rally in support of the strike at BBD Bag on Thursday,” he said. The former deputy chief secretary of SBI Staff Association, Ashok Mukherkjee, said that it opposes privatization of banks and retrograde banking reforms along with the new bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/first-day-no-show-customers-see-red-after-unions-down-atm-bank-shutters/articleshow/88326748.cms||---

The board sent a circular to schools on Wednesday, asking them to stop evaluating answer scripts from Thursday onwards and asked school principals to ensure that the OMR sheets be packed within 15 minutes of completion of the exam and sent to the board. No reason has been cited in the circular but many within the system said that the tone of the circular was stern and this indicated that unfair means might have been adopted during the exams and evaluation, forcing the board to take this step. Specifications regarding when the printing of question papers will happen and by what time distribution should be completed among candidates has also been specified in the circular. Principals of city schools said they were relieved that the board was taking the responsibility of evaluation since the teachers were under tremendous stress. While CBSE Class X exams are over, the Term I exams for Class XII are on and the exam will be over on December 28. “The tone of the circular is stern probably because the Board was studying the past achievement records of schools and might have found that scores were suddenly high in case of some schools. The system of evaluation by external examiners should have been followed from the very beginning. The damage has been done already,” said a city school principal. “The Hindi exams were held on Thursday and as per instructions, we did not evaluate the OMR sheets. Our teachers were relieved that they did not have to stay back for evaluation,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School. “The board has tightened its belt and this is clearly an indication of an attempt to prevent malpractice. I only wish this had happened sooner,” said Koeli Dey, principal of Sushila Birla Girls School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cbse-scraps-same-day-omr-sheet-evaluation-rule/articleshow/88326750.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Ahmedabad||Maninagar residential complex sealed||AHMEDABAD: In its latest campaign against buildings without building use (BU) permission, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation sealed another residential complex, Takshashila Colony, in Maninagar on Thursday. This was the fourth residential apartment building that the civic body had sealed for lack of BU permission. The AMC also demolished three illegally constructions at Bibi Talav in Vatva. One of the demolished properties was spread over an area of 12,899 square feet. Apart from these, two commercial buildings were sealed by the AMC West Zone office in Paldi. Since May this year, more than 2,500 property units have been sealed in the city. On Monday, the AMC demolished three houses and sealed nine others that did not have clearance from the BU. In May, the AMC initiated a sealing drive in response to the high court’s judgment, sealing 2,516 structures, mostly commercial complexes, that did not have legal BU approval. Last year, the AMC’s town planning department had told the High Court that it was fine-tuning a software to upload building plans, registrations and BU permission-related information online. The proposal was approved during the town planning committee meeting on July 24, 2020. The resolution passed by the committee had claimed permission has been granted for development of new construction under the comprehensive general development control regulations for sale of residential and non-residential projects in the city. The software was to ensure that citizens could, prior to buying a property, find from the website whether property registration and other formalities like BU permission are mentioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-lack-of-bu-permission-fourth-residential-complex-sealed-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88326762.cms||---

Poor awareness on electrical fences is leading to the deaths, say police and farmers. On Wednesday, T Krishnan, a 37-year-old farmer from T Valayankulam, died after he touched an electrical fence put up illegally by another farmer to protect his field from wild boars. His wife, who tried to help him, also got electrocuted and is under treatment in hospital. Kalligudi police registered a case under section 304 (II) of IPC and subsequently arrested the land owner K Kathirvel and his wife who put up the fence illegally. On November 29, M Karuppasamy, a 19-year-old youth, died after coming in contact with an electric fence erected on an agricultural land in Sathagudi. SP V Baskaran on Thursday warned farmers against erecting electrical fences. “Wednesday’s death is the second that has happened recently due to electrocution through an electrical fence in Madurai district. One of the major reasons why such incidents are happening is lack of awareness among farmers about electrical fences. Putting up electrical fence of any kind is illegal. Public must come forward to report to the police if they come to know if anyone is putting up an electrical fence,” he said. Though electrical fences are only being put up by farmers to keep away animals from entering their fields, connecting the fence to high voltage electricity can turn deadly. “The government should take more efforts to educate farmers who only want to protect their fields and crops. With the government already providing little support, what can farmers do?” said V Uma Maheswaran, a farmer. Police said it will be difficult for them or village level officials to continuously monitor fields for electrical fences. “Only creating awareness can help prevent any future deaths,” said a police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-warn-farmers-against-putting-up-electric-fences/articleshow/88327453.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Hyderabad||Clear anomaly in nursing college lists: Telangana HC||HYDERABAD: Wondering why a single nursing college is sending two conflicting sets of lists of students to the state government for approval for enabling them to write their first year general midwifery nursing (GNM) degree course exams, Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana high court on Thursday directed the Nalgonda district medical and health officer to explain why this discrepancy arose within one week. The judge gave this interim direction while hearing a petition filed by Varkala Sowmya and 59 other students of Srinivasa School of Nursing in Nalgonda who were blaming the DMHO of Nalgonda saying that he was not accepting their first year exam fee paid through their nursing college. The students sought directions to the authorities for issuing them hall tickets so that they could appear for their first year examinations. The judge, while refusing to grant any interim relief, sought to know the facts from Nagesh Bhimapaka, counsel for the medical and health department. The state counsel informed the court that as per the official records, the correspondent of the college is Kondeti Mallaiah. He had sent a list of 60 students with exam fees and sought approval. “We accorded approval to that list in April itself,” he said. The controversy arose when a person, Saidulu, claimed to be running the same school started sending a separate list to the state seeking approval for his list of students. The judge on Thursday verified both lists. It was found that 15 students are there in both lists. Saidulu’s list has three names from a neighbouring nursing college. The counter filed by the DMHO says that there are serious discrepancies in the list sent by Saidulu. The judge has made it clear that there should be only one list of 60 approved candidates and sought to know from DMHO the reasons for the discrepancies. The DMHO in his counter said if Mallaiah, by an arrangement, allows Saidulu to run the college, that’s their internal matter. As far as official records are concerned, Mallaiah is the one who was authorised to run the college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-clear-anomaly-in-nursing-college-lists/articleshow/88327452.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Alleging that the Pramod Sawant government has “artificially created vacancies”, GFP has filed a letter petition asking the judiciary to launch an inquiry through an independent court-monitored committee into the ongoing recruitments. “It is humbly urged before your lordship, to take suo moto cognisance... the blatant acts of corruptions in public recruitment keeping in mind the interest of the public at large and thus, take action and conduct an inquiry into these allegations either by appointment of an investigation committee or through an independent court monitored committee to ensure that the corruption is nipped in the bud,” said GFP in the petition. GFP said that most of the 10,000 vacancies in the government are being filled without any consideration of merit or qualifications of the individuals and by seeking bribes as high as Rs 35 lakh. GFP has also pointed out that BJP MLA Atanasio Monserrate has himself levelled allegations against his party colleagues. “The examination conducted for the recruitment of around 300 posts is nothing but a mere farcical exercise and the entire merit list had been rigged at the instance of the said minister,” said GFP general secretary Durgadas Kamat. In the letter petition, GFP said that the ongoing recruitment has a corrupt and malicious intent and has accused the government of manipulating results to favour certain candidates and deprive job opportunities to qualified youth. “It is clearly the intention of the government to have willfully imposed a moratorium till the eve of elections and then at once, lift it and undertake recruitment for 10,000 government posts only a month prior to elections being declared,” Kamat said. GFP said that nepotism and corruption in the recruitment process completely compromises the efficiency of government administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-petitions-hc-over-job-recruitments/articleshow/88348527.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Last year, the crib was set up outside and drew a crowd. The tourism department, which is the organiser of the annual event, has decided to get cops to man the crowd around the crib. Though selfies will be permitted, cops will ensure not too many crowd the place. Not more than 300 seats will be provided inside the park for the programmes lined up from December 20. Cops will also man the entrances and exits. The announcement for the festival was made by Indranil Sen, minister of state for tourism, on Thursday. Sen said the event in its 11th year will be held safely, with Covid rules in place. “Though Allen Park remains the heart of the festival, we will arrange for signature lighting of Park Street to St Paul’s Cathedral from December 20,” Sen said. “The crib will be placed inside the park and will be blessed by Bishop Paritosh Canning, the head of the Kolkata diocese of the CNI, immediately after chief minister Mamata Banerjee lights the Christmas tree. Though we are not allowing food stalls on Park Street, we are arranging for three food stalls inside the park,” said Shane Calvert, former Anglo Indian MLA and vice-chairman of the minorities commission. Christmas messages will be given both by the CM and by archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of the Roman Catholics in the archdiocese of Kolkata. The event’s focus will be on carols sung by churches, congregations and church-run schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rules-tweaked-to-check-crowds-at-park-st-fest/articleshow/88326763.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Pune||Officials cite fewer cases for drop in testing||Pune: Districts are struggling to increase the number of daily Covid tests despite a slight increase in new case detections in Maharashtra in the last two weeks because of comparatively fewer positive patients and the subsequent drop in contacts’ count. The state public health department officials stated that the overall number of positive cases detected daily were on the lower side and this was one of the reasons behind districts struggling to increase the testing. “The total number of contacts traced has also dropped in the recent period because the daily Covid cases in Maharashtra have fallen to 600-700 on an average,” a state official said. “If 600-700 people are detected with Covid in a day in the state, their contacts to be traced and tested would be around 7,000-8,000. The number of contacts per patient also varies, as the elderly generally tend to have less number of people coming in their contact than a politician or a vegetable vendor,” the official said, adding that the standard norm was to trace and test 20 contacts per patient. He said there had been discussions to conduct tests even of those having mild symptoms such as a runny nose or minor respiratory issues to increase the testing in Maharashtra. “We are trying to test over 1 lakh people each day in the state despite these issues. On some days, the number of tests is going up to 1.1-1.2 lakh per day,” the official added. Another state health official said the testing had remained consistent in the state even when cases were less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/officials-cite-fewer-cases-for-drop-in-testing/articleshow/88327456.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Madurai||More needs to be done to make women financially secure: Guv||Madurai: Women’s participation in higher education has significantly increased, particularly in Tamil Nadu, but more needs to be done to make them financially secure, governor R N Ravi said while addressing new graduates at the 29th convocation of Mother Teresa Women’s University, Kodaikanal. In his address, he observed that Tamil Nadu is ahead of other states in India in higher education, especially in case of women’s education. “Tamil Nadu has done better in terms of women empowerment and ensuring opportunities for education of women. In the past few days, wherever I attended convocation ceremonies, I found that there were more women graduates than men at a ratio of 3:1, which is something to be proud of. However, despite producing so many graduates, we are yet to see it translated into workforce,” he said. The governor said that the number of women in workforce is commensurate with the number of women graduates and that more needs to be done by universities, especially women’s universities, to help make them financially secure. Higher education minister K Ponmudi, who delivered the felicitation address, highlighted how in Tamil Nadu, more women are going for higher education, equalling men. “The gross enrollment ratio for higher education in India is 27.1% whereas it is 51.4% in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, in case of women, the gross enrolment ratio for higher education is 27.3% in India whereas in Tamil Nadu, it is 51%,” he said. The minister also pointed out that the state government has expanded the admission strength of students by 25 % in government arts and sciences colleges so that more opportunities can be given. He noted that the government cleared opening of 21 new arts and sciences colleges, including 10 through the higher education department, 10 through the HR&CE department and one under the co-operatives department. Meanwhile, the governor visited the Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai and also interacted with ex-servicemen.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-needs-to-be-done-to-make-women-financially-secure-guv/articleshow/88327455.cms||---

With this, the woman will now get a real-time update about her heart condition on her mobile phone in a personalized application. Her doctors will also get alert about every change in her heart’s condition. The real-time information will also be documented on the digital platform by the makers of the device. Kingsway Hospital became the first to implant this modern device which is now popular in foreign countries as well as in some big hospitals in India. Cardiologist Dr Shailendra Ganjewar and his team from Kingsway performed this operation along with Dr Ashish Nabar, interventional cardiologist and expert of electrophysiology from Mumbai. CRT-D technology allows remote monitoring of the patient, which has proven to be resulting in higher survival rates all over the world. Dr Shailendra Ganjewar told TOI that the device is a blessing, especially for Nagpur which has emerged to become Central India’s health hub. “In Nagpur, we cater to patients from 600-800km circle spreading in over four states. After placing this advanced device, the patients need not come over to Nagpur and visit hospital as doctors will get a real-time report of their heart functioning,” he said. Doctors used the device manufactured by USA’s medical device company Abbott Laboratories. “After this surgery, we locally implanted another version of the similar device in a 52-year-old man from Bhandara. Our team is now capable to perform similar surgeries in Nagpur which is a great addition to the city’s health scene,” added Dr Ganjewar. As per the available documentation, India’s first Bluetooth-enabled pacemaker was implanted in September last year. The technology has reached Nagpur and patients are being benefited within 15 months. “The patients from Vidarbha had to travel to Mumbai, Hyderabad, or Chennai for advanced treatment. But the last ten years have changed the scenario. Doctors are conducting many complicated surgeries in Nagpur only,” said cardiologist Dr Amey Bidkar. Both patients having the Bluetooth pacemakers implanted are doing very well, confirmed the doctors from Kingsway Hospital. All About Bluetooth pacemakerAllows access to information anytime, anywhere Allows for tablet-based programming and app-based remote monitoring Reduces hospital visits of patients significantly for follow-up check-ups Automatic notifications keep patients informed of pulse transmission status Battery of the device lasts for approximately 14 years A good option for techno-savvy patients, who live away from Nagpur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bluetooth-enabled-pacemaker-implanted-in-67-yr-old-woman/articleshow/88326753.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Nagpur||SC paves way for Rantalodhi relocation, tigers get more space in Tadoba||Nagpur: In a major victory for tigers and people, the Supreme Court has paved the way for relocation of Rantalodhi village from inside the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR).After this relocation, Tadoba will get another 175.26 hectares, equivalent to 433 football fields, of inviolate forests. Relocation of Rantalodhi out of the Kolsa range, on the eastern end of the tiger reserve, had been hanging fire for two years.Of the 244 families, 145 families have opted for Option-II package of Rs10 lakh per family, where resettlement has to be done by government agencies. However, 99 families have chosen Option-I, where people will move out with a one-time cash payment.The process was delayed as the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) had deferred the forest diversion proposal for 375 hectares in compartment number 14-B at Salori village in Chandrapur district, where the villagers wanted to voluntarily resettle. The FAC had cited Supreme Court order of January 28, 2019, which states: “The extent of land de-reserved for resettlement shall not be more than the extent vacated by settlers in the core area.”In Rantalodhi, the area to be given to the villagers is 375 hectares, in return Tadoba is getting 175 hectares. However, the state’s chief wildlife warden on May 7, 2021, moved the Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) strongly putting up Maharashtra’s case.TATR field director Jitendra Ramgaonkar welcomed the SC order, saying, “Though the area Tadoba is getting is less, Rantalodhi’s biotic pressure is spread in five compartments. If one considers cattle grazing, fuelwood, and minor forest produce (MFP) collection, the impact is in a 2.5km radius from the village. Relocation will create inviolate space increasing prey population and subsequently tigers.”Deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale said, “As directed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, we are resettling adjoining Karwa village too. Resettlement of both Rantalodhi and Karwa would mean no human presence in at least 15km area. The NTCA too has supported arguments put forward by Maharashtra and supported the relocation of Rantalodhi.”“Creating inviolate spaces is a solution to tackling man-animal conflict in Chandrapur. SC order will enable MoEFCC to grant required permission under FCA 1980. The decision will go a long way in tiger conservation,” said Kishor Rithe, member of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL).Out of the total 312 tigers in Maharashtra, 160 animals (excluding cubs and sub-adults) are in Chandrapur district. As many as 81 tigers are within TATR and 79 are outside Tadoba in territorial forests, which is a honeycombed landscape.Justice L Nageswara Rao, Justice BR Gavai and Justice BV Nagarathna agreed with the recommendations made by the CEC, and said, “Permission is granted for relocating 145 families from Rantalodhi in compartment number 14-B of Salori, subject to grant of necessary permissions by MoEFCC for diversion of 375 hectares of forest land for non-forest use.” BOXSHOT IN ARM FOR TADOBA* Under WPA 1972, core areas of national parks and sanctuaries are to be made inviolate. A proposal to relocate Rantalodhi from TATR was taken up* Proposal submitted for diversion of 374.75 ha forest land, which is degraded forest land surrounded by human habitation* Of 244 families, 145 families chose Option-II to be settled by government agencies, while 99 will go by taking one-time payment* Proposal stuck as land given up by villagers was less than that required to resettle them * State data shows overall land vacated by villagers is 8,614 ha for 66 villages rehabilitated from core of tiger reserves, which is much more than land diverted 2,651 ha for rehabilitation* Most relocation on revenue land but in Chandrapur district no such land available* CEC said giving away 375 ha forest is better than putting biotic pressure on over 2,044 ha prime forest by villagers||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sc-paves-way-for-rantalodhi-relocation-tigers-get-more-space-in-tadoba/articleshow/88326821.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Kolkata||Two years on, Covid-proof air travel remains a challenge at Kolkata airport||KOLKATA: In spite of stringent norms in place — a person needs to be double vaccinated or test Covid negative — for flyers, the fact that a Covid-positive boy managed to take a flight has fuelled the concerns that doctors, health experts and travel and trade community have been grappling with over a year — a foolproof checking process of RT-PCR results/vaccination certificates of domestic flyers. As per the norm, international passengers travelling from at-risk countries or with a travel history of visiting an at-risk nation within a fortnight need to mandatorily appear for an RT-PCR test on arrival and also wait for the report at the airport before being allowed to proceed home or take a transit flight. Those coming from non-risk countries and undergoing RT-PCR test need not wait for the report. They can move out of the airport immediately after submitting the swab sample and the authorities inform them later about the test result, which had precisely happened in this case. Since November this year, Bengal had made it mandatory for any domestic traveller above the age of two, to either have a double dose vaccination certificate or an RT-PCR negative report conducted within 72 hours to be allowed to fly into Bengal. While many parents have reservations on letting their children go through the stringent RT-PCR swab collection process, as per the rules, none can board a flight to Kolkata without an RTPCR negative report. However, flyers at Kolkata airport complain of their certificates not being checked at any point. “At Kolkata airport, none ask for the RT-PCR report. Last month, I had a tough time getting an RT-PCR report for my sixyear-old son. But when we reached the airport, none asked for the same in Delhi and neither anyone asked for it when we landed in Kolkata. I asked multiple officials who would check it but all of them said it was not their duty. If you are not going to check it, why are you forcing us to go through all this trouble?” asked a young businessman from Ballygunge. While airline authorities said its not their duty to check the RT-PCR certificate, Kolkata airport officials said the onus lies on the health department officials to check them. The health department personnel at the airport claimed they were too shortstaffed to check every passenger. “Its not possible for us to check every domestic passenger. However, we do carry out random checks on passengers as and when required,” said a health department staff at the airport. Health experts, meanwhile, suggested that the state government and the airport authorities should fix the responsibility and begin checking vaccination and RT-PCR certificates more carefully, especially since the airport is set to have more rush of international passengers coming directly to Kolkata or via transit from other cities over the next few weeks due to the winter festivities in the west. “There has to be proper coordination between all the departments.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Covid curbs to usher in New Year||NEW DELHI: The Delhi Disaster Management Authority has extended restrictions on all social, cultural, entertainment and other gatherings till January 1. This means Christmas and New Year celebrations in the capital will be a muted affair. No new restrictions have, however, been imposed in the wake of the Omicron threat. The DDMA has also continued with the 50% seating cap on restaurants and bars. All district authorities concerned have been asked to ensure enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour, such as wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing and use of sanitisers. District magistrates and senior police officers have been asked to deploy sufficient number of teams for keeping vigil at public places. “The status of Covid in Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that though the overall number of patients and positivity rate have declined considerably, due caution has to be continued...” the DDMA stated in its order. Amid expectations that the New Year celebrations could lead to a crowd surge in markets, DDMA has reiterated that the market trade associations and the associations of banquet halls, marriage halls, restaurants, bars, cinemas and other crowd-pulling places will be responsible for ensuring compliance with Covid-appropriate behaviour within their respective areas. All gatherings, barring weddings with a guest ceiling of 200 guests, are banned. Restaurants and bars have been allowed 50% of the seating capacity. “Cinemas and multiplexes are allowed with 100% of the seating capacity, subject to strict adherence with conditions. The owners of the restaurants, bars, cinemas and multiplexes will be responsible for strict adherence to the standard operating procedure and Covid-appropriate behaviour to contain the spread of Covid,” the order added. Auditoriums and assembly halls are allowed up to 50% of the seating capacity. Restaurateurs and bar owners have expressed disappointment with the move, as they were hoping for the festive period to breathe some life into the pandemic-hit industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-curbs-to-usher-in-new-year/articleshow/88327495.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Goa||New section of highway from Patradevi to Verna to open for public on Dec 29: PWD minister||PANAJI: PWD minister Deepak Pauskar on Thursday said that the entire national highway stretch from Patradevi to Verna, excluding the Zuari and Colvale bridges, will be thrown open on December 29 in the presence of Union road and transport minister Nitin Gadkari. The foundation stone for the two towers on the Zuari bridge and the Mopa express highway will also be laid on the same day, he said. Gadkari held a review meeting with Pauskar in Delhi over the ongoing projects in the state. On the inauguration of the Zuari bridge, he said that he will be able to share the exact date within four days. The inauguration of the first phase of the Zuari bridge, which was supposed to be ready for use by mid-December, was delayed following difficulties faced by the Chinese consultants in getting visas to travel to India. “Gadkari has told Dilip Buildcon to coordinate with the Chinese consultants via video conference and solve the issue. Within eight days the contractor will be able to get the design approved by the consultant,” Pauskar said. The Chinese consultants are required to oversee the assembly of the cable-stay section of the superstructure of the bridge. Pauskar also said that the material, including cable fabrication among others, required to complete the Zuari bridge have already been made available at the site. He said that once they get approval, it will take around four-and-a-half months to complete the bridge. “One bridge will take one-and-a-half months to complete and the second bridge will take four-and-a-half months,” he said. The Mopa express highway will be constructed at the cost of Rs 1,185 crore while “the total cost of the two towers is Rs 320 crore”, he said. One tower will have a restaurant while the other will have a museum showcasing Goa’s history. The PWD minister said that the tender process for both towers is in the completion stage. He also said that the elevated bridge from Varunapuri to Sada and a 2.7km stretch of the western bypass will be inaugurated on December 29. Pauskar said that the Zuari bridge will be thrown open during the next tenure of the BJP government. He also said that all internal roads in all 49 constituencies, including state highways and major district roads among others, will be ready by January 1, 2022. He said that the state government will take up new projects, including four-laning of Chorla Ghat, Anmod Ghat and Borim bridge among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/new-section-of-highway-from-patradevi-to-verna-to-open-for-public-on-dec-29-pwd-min/articleshow/88327500.cms||---

Hasmukh Rawat, a resident of the Chainpur locality in Sabarmati, in the FIR with Sabarmati police said that his son, Chetan Rawat, had dropped out of Class 9 and had started doing casual labour to help the family make ends meet. On December 10, when Hasmukh, who is also a casual labourer, had gone out for some work, his wife called him up and said that Chetan had gone out that morning and had not return till the afternoon. Hasmukh said Chetan, who does not have cellphone, had gone out for a couple of days without telling anyone earlier as well and had then returned home, so he did not look for him that day. The next day, as Chetan did not return, he began inquiring with relatives and friends but found no clue to his whereabouts. On Thursday, he approached police and filed a complaint against unknown person suspecting that Chetan could have been abducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/16-year-old-sabarmati-boy-missing/articleshow/88326833.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Illegal hoardings cover city as election season approaches||Ludhiana: As the election season has kicked off, illegal hoardings have covered the city roads, flyovers and some of construction sites as well. Residents have claimed that this nuisance will increase all the more as all political parties are putting up their hoardings, which would give ugly look to the entire city. Moreover, this defacement is not being curbed by the civic officials despite the fact that law does not allow the same. Adding to the political hoardings, some illegal religious hoardings have also been spotted across the city. Requesting anonymity, one of the civic officials claimed that the organization that takes permission from the civic body for hoardings at designated place should remove them immediately after the function. “But so far, the urgency to install the hoarding is never shown while removing them. Even Congress councilor Mamta Ashu had requested the religious and social organisations not to put picture of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu at illegal hoardings, but in every poster his picture can be seen,” he said. “The religious or political hoardings installed on bamboos, hanging banners, posters on the walls and even on the roundabouts look so bad. The authorities do not remove them despite the fact that these would not add to their kitty,” said Samar Jain a resident of Hargobind Nagar. Akriti Malhotra, resident of Guru Nanak Pura, said when heavy winds blow, illegal hoardings will fall apart and trouble commuters. She said it could even prove fatal for people who pass through road so such practices should be avoided. “What is even more unfortunate is that posters are pasted on direction boards as well,” she added. Anshu Sethi, a resident of Dholewal, said that it is with the support of the political parties that such hoardings are being installed everywhere and in the election season the posters will be pasted outside households without consent from residents as well, which must be stopped. However, MC superintendent Harvinder Dhalla said, “We remove illegal hoardings wherever we see them. The team is already deputed on the task and we will not leave any illegal hoarding at road.” He said the challans are also issued to the violators which go to the court. Last year, the MC house had given nod to impose heavy penalty on illegal hoardings, but for religious hoardings, the councilors had demanded there should be no fee. Mayor Balkar Sandhu had said they would not take any fee if the hoardings were purely religious without any other picture on it. On signboards, no religious or political hoardings will be allowed but there is contract picture in reality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/illegal-hoardings-cover-city-as-election-season-approaches/articleshow/88326837.cms||---

Appearing for NHAI, senior counsel Sunil Manohar stated that the work was going ahead with reasonably good speed and is expected to be substantially completed in the next two months. “The NHAI’s submissions are encouraging from the viewpoint of road development in this region. However, since this is a national highway and forms a vital link between Mumbai and Nagpur and further to eastern cities of the country, it is necessary that the entire stretch which lies within the state is brought in order and also expanded as per the plans already approved,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare said. While hearing a PIL (No 22/2019), the bench said it found that the work of the stretch, especially between Bhusawal and Dhule, has been neglected. “It is necessary that even this part of the road is taken up for its improvement by NHAI, without any further delay. We, accordingly, urge Manohar to seek instructions in this regard and check whether even the work relating to upgrade of this road can be done as early as possible,” the judges said before adjourning the hearing till January 27. The PIL was filed by lawyer Arun Patil through counsel Firdos Mirza highlighting the pathetic condition of Amravati-Akola-Jalgaon road and Wardha-Sindhkhed Raja road which has led to many fatal accidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-malkapur-road-repair-works-started-nhai-to-hc/articleshow/88327493.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Covid-19: Omicron tally in Delhi 10 now, but 5 discharged||NEW DELHI: The number of Omicron cases in Delhi has touched 10 after four more patients were confirmed to be infected with the new variant of the novel coronavirus on Thursday. However, five of these 10 patients have recovered and have been discharged, Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, told TOI. “All patients suffering from Covid-19 due to the Omicron variant have so far reported only mild or no symptoms. We haven’t had to administer oxygen therapy to anyone,” Dr Kumar said. After the new variant was first detected in South Africa, the hospital has been designated to isolate and treat suspected as well as confirmed cases of Omicron patients in the national capital. In the past two weeks, more than 75 people with a history of travel have been admitted to the hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 diagnosis. Of them, 40 people are still admitted, officials said. “Of these 40 people, 38 are Covid-19 positive. We have sent their samples for genome sequencing to confirm whether they have been infected by the Omicron variant,” said an official. Delhi’s first Omicron patient, a 37-year-old man from Ranchi, was discharged on Monday after he tested negative for Covid-19 twice. He had travelled from Tanzania to Doha and then to Delhi on a Qatar Airways flight on December 2. He stayed in Johannesburg in South Africa for a week and had mild symptoms. Under new preventive norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for the flyers arriving from the “at-risk” countries and they are allowed to leave airport only after the results are declared. Also, 2% of the passengers arriving on flights from the rest of the countries are being tested randomly. World Health Organization has warned that the new coronavirus variant is spreading at an unprecedented rate and may already be present in most countries around the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omicron-tally-in-city-10-now-but-5-discharged/articleshow/88327515.cms||---
---||Goa||Khaunte, who critiqued BJP and CM, joins party to ‘move ahead’||Panaji: One of the most vocal critics of BJP and chief minister Pramod Sawant, former Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte joined the party on Friday saying his tirade against the party and Sawant were due to “minor differences”. Khaunte, who had launched a vitriolic diatribe against Sawant calling him ‘Pappu’ and even comparing him with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro for Covid mismanagement that led to thousands of deaths in the tiniest state, was at pains to justify his move to join BJP. “Forget what I have said earlier. We should move ahead. We have to forget these minor differences and look at the future of Goa,” he said. Khaunte, who had even said BJP was filled with “tainted members” and should get a “washing machine to clean them” after he was unceremoniously dropped by Sawant from his cabinet, said: “Today, we have to work together.” He said by joining BJP, his “ideas and ideology” has not changed, but he joined to “take my ideas forward”. “Political and ideological differences make for vibrant legislation. When we do legislation, there is no personal enmity. It is only about the issue. When we are in opposition and criticise the government, we try to put forth the issues before the government,” Khaunte said. The former Porvorim MLA, who has been critical about the three linear projects that cut across the green lung of Goa—Mollem biodiversity hotspot—said his stand has not changed and he would continue to oppose them. “Earlier, we were in the opposition and were trying to put across our point. Today, we have a chance to sit together and resolve the issues in the interest of the state,” he said. Khaunte joined BJP in the presence of Sawant, BJP’s Goa election in charge Devendra Fadnavis, state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade and other functionaries. Sawant, while welcoming Khaunte into their fold, tried to downplay the personal attacks against him. “Constructive opposition is required in the assembly and in democracy. Till it is not there, the state cannot function properly. Whenever he has played the opposition’s role, we have taken it positively and when required, he has supported the government,” Sawant said. “Khaunte has not joined BJP for his gain, but to help the people of the state for the next 20 years. I assure you (Khaunte) that BJP is a parivar and you will get a lot of love. We will work together to expand the parivar,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/khaunte-who-critiqued-bjp-and-cm-joins-party-to-move-ahead/articleshow/88348642.cms||Murari Shetye

The 1.5-km long internal bundh maintained by St Mateus Tenants Association (SMTA), Azossim has weakened during the last few months due to heavy rain and massive inflow from a huge breach to Ofla-Domzobund over Cumbharjua canal. The meeting presided over by SMTA chairman, Menino Pereira witnessed noisy scenes over the breaches, one of which is several metres. Pereira said that the authorities had been informed about the breaches, but it takes time to initiate the process for repairs.“There is no access to carry materials and pipes have to be laid in the water body to build a bridge to the bund,” he said. The influx of saline water even poses a danger to the Konkan railway track and an inspection had been held to plan repairs to the bund. The flood level has risen to the compound walls and thresholds of houses on the village periphery. A few members, whose wells have been hit by saline water influx and houses are facing inundation, urged the office bearers to expedite the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/azossim-locals-keep-sluice-gates-auction-on-hold/articleshow/88348645.cms||---

According to an FIR filed with Satellite police, Naveen Rathod, a resident of Rajivnagar, was seen on his motorcycle with an unusually shaped belly. Rathod was wearing jeans and a white shirt, in which he tried to hide the liquor bottle he was delivering to a client in the Satellite. A Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) jawan, Faizan Shakeel, spotted this, stopped Rathod and checked him. The liquor bottle was inserted in his pants with the upper part poking out of his shirt due to a broken button. The cops asked him if he had a liquor permit, and when he could not produce one, he was booked for violation of the Prohibition Act. Police said they seized Rathod’s motorcycle and the liquor bottle, which was part of a consignment that had come from Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bootlegger-undone-by-broken-button/articleshow/88326850.cms||---

Executive engineer, works division II, WRD, Ankush Gaonker, in its letter to RVNL general manager, pointed out that as per the provisions contained in the Railways Act 1989, the Railways is required to issue a notice in advance to the department concerned before carrying out any alterations to or shifting of the sluice gates of the lake, which hasn’t been done so far. Gaonker said that details of the proposed construction work by RVNL are required to be submitted to WRD in order for it to consider its probable impact “from the point of flooding that may occur in the surrounding area due to alteration of drains and the water body.” Villagers of Guirdolim, Chandor and Cavorim, had earlier written to WRD objecting to the filling of the lake by RVNL which, they feared, would block the natural flow of water into Kushavati rivulet leading to submergence of Folli ward during rains, thus posing a threat to the mud-walled houses of the ward. They had also pointed out that the proposed works of RVNL of shifting the sluice gates of the lake would further “destroy the existing mud lands surrounding the lake and the paddy fields.” They had urged WRD to conduct a site inspection and direct RVNL to remove the mud dumped into the lake, which they said was blocking the outlet of the lake. The Guirdolim Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) has also written to the Goa State Biodiversity Board confirming the filling of the Nagozana lake with mud, and asking it to take necessary action in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wrd-directs-railways-to-halt-filling-work-of-nagozana-lake/articleshow/88348637.cms||---

---||Delhi||Riots: Delhi HC denies bail to man held for 3 murders||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has refused to grant bail to a man arrested in three murder cases after he was allegedly seen carrying a sword during the riots last year in northeast Delhi. Justice Subramonium Prasad stated that the sole eyewitness resided in the same locality as the petitioner-accused and the possibility of him being threatened could not be discounted. The court noted that the bail jurisprudence attempted to “bridge the gap” between an accused’s personal liberty and social security, and it was the duty of the court to see if granting bail could adversely impact public order. Considering that the eyewitness’s statement is set to be examined on January 20, the court opined that the present cases were not “fit for grant of bail at this juncture” and requested the trial court conclude the examination within one month preferably on a day-to-day basis. “It is the intricate balance between securing the personal liberty of an individual and ensuring that this liberty does not lead to an eventual disturbance of public order. Therefore, a duty resides in this court to be conscious of whether granting of bail can lead to a possible impediment in the conducting of investigation that can cause inevitable rupture in public order,” the court noted. The court also took into account that witness statements are to be recorded shortly and “the possible apprehension of influencing/threatening the sole public witness whose evidence is crucial to this matter” while rejecting bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-hc-denies-bail-to-man-held-for-3-murders/articleshow/88327519.cms||---

According to the corporation, the 481-square-metre Naniwala Bagh commercial complex in Azadpur, with different sizes of plots, has been lying vacant for years. The civic body hopes to lease it out to a bidder for approximately Rs 12.2 crore. The plot in Moti Nagar’s Karampura complex is likely to be leased out to a pharma company for close to Rs 6.4 crore. The corporation has been trying to auction off this plot since 2017, but received two bids only this July. Recently, the corporation auctioned off another commercial plot in the same complex. Keeping in mind the financial condition of the corporation, the proposals have been sent to the standing committee for approval. “The proposals will be under consideration at the next meeting of the committee,” said Jogi Ram Jain, its chairman. The corporation also wants to lease out 18 shops on Asaf Ali Road opposite Delite Cinema at 20% lower than the minimum reserve price. On the table for the past four years, the standing committee has sent the proposal back for further deliberation. The north corporation, which is cash-starved to even pay its staff on time, has been making bids to lease out public properties to boost its revenues. Aam Aadmi Party has accused the corporation several times of “selling” public properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-civic-body-plans-to-lease-out-commercial-plots-for-revenue/articleshow/88327521.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Sikh body demands ban on the booklet released by PM||Amritsar: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has demanded a ban on a booklet titled, “Sri Kashi Vishwanath Dham Ka Gauravshali Itihas,” released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the inauguration of the Vishwanath Dham Corridor on December 13. In a release issued here on Thursday, SGPC media secretary Kulwinder Singh Ramdas claimed, “The booklet states that the Panj Piaras (five beloved ones) through whom the Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh (tenth Sikh master), were first sent to Kashi so that they may attain full knowledge of Sanatan Dharam and be ready for its protection. The booklet also states that the Sikh faith was established to protect the Sanatan Dharam from the Mughals. Both these statements are devoid of facts, with illusory intentions and lack of knowledge about the mission of the Sikh faith.” Ramdas further claimed, “In fact, Khalsa Panth was formed to protect religious values and human rights against oppression, tyranny and injustice and not to protect the Sanatan Dharam. Secondly, the five Sikhs sent to Kashi are totally different from the Panj Piaras who offered heads at the time of the formation of the Khalsa at Anandpur Sahib.” However, the claims made by SGPC with regards to the content of the booklet couldn’t be independently verified. Saying that the booklet was released and distributed as ‘parsad’ in large numbers by the information and public relations department of the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government, the SGPC’s release alleged that the history of the Sikh faith was distorted and misrepresented by relating it to Kashi. The SGPC release also claimed that factual information about Sikh history related to Kashi was that, at Paonta Sahib, when Pandit Raghunath refused to teach “Dev Bhasha” Sanskrit to some “Sikh students” belonging to the so-called “Shudra” class, Guru Gobind Singh sent five Sikhs belonging to different castes to Kashi to learn Sanskrit language and not to take knowledge of Sanatan Dharam. “The five Sikhs sent to Kashi have no connection with the Panj Piaras (Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh, Bhai Himmat Singh, Bhai Mohkam Singh and Bhai Sahib Singh) who offered their heads at the time of Khalsa formation,” said the SGPC media secretary. He added that it was Bhai Ram Singh, Bhai Karam Singh, Bhai Ganda Singh, Bhai Vir Singh and Bhai Saina Singh who were sent to Kashi by the Guru and were different personalities. When asked whether SGPC had asked UP government's information and public relations department to withdraw the booklet, Ramdas replied that for now, they had raised their objections and brought up the issue through media. “But we are not taking the issue lightly and when the time will come, we will proceed accordingly.” Incidentally, the media wing of SGPC, which often issues statements in the name of its president, didn’t even mention the name of SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami in the release and instead issued a statement from its media secretary. When contacted, SGPC president Harjinder Singh Dhami said he was in Karnal so the statement was issued by the SGPC media secretary. He said they would also send a representation to the UP government department concerned to make the necessary amendments in the book.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sikh-body-demands-ban-on-the-booklet-released-by-pm/articleshow/88327550.cms||---
---||Nagpur||90 more bogus contracts of Rs 1.4 crore unearthed in Nagpur Municipal Corporation health department||NAGPUR: The list of bogus contracts in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is getting longer with every passing day. On Thursday, 90 more bogus contracts worth Rs 1.4 crore related to the private contractor of the health department, who was earlier found to have prepared 41 bogus contracts, were unearthed. Suspicious transactions worth around Rs 90 lakh were also detected in solid waste management department. Now, the scam has swelled to Rs3.47 crore and the amount may increase further. TOI on Thursday had reported suspicious contracts of Rs1.5 crore had come to fore from health department and two more departments — library and birth & death registration departments. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi and assistant commissioner (general administration department) Mahesh Dhamecha investigated and identified that contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode (55) prepared bogus contracts and drew another Rs1.4 crore from library and birth & death registration departments. Already, the civic body has registered complaint with Sadar police station against five firms registered in the name of Sakode and his family members. Joshi and Dhamecha reportedly asked Sakode to repay the amount. “Sakode gave two cheques of Rs52 lakh and Rs50 lakh on Thursday and expressed inability to pay more,” an official told TOI. Sakode has reportedly prepared bogus contracts from library and birth & death registration departments in the name of sixth firm — Shree Ganesh Sai Services. Owner is a separate person but Sakode is reportedly operating the agency. Initially, Sakode had repaid Rs67,08,630 41 pertaining to 41 bogus contracts. These contracts were awarded and payments disbursed between October 7, 2020, and July 31 this year. In the 90 more bogus contracts in the health department, some files are from April 2020 onwards. The NMC has started investigation into contracts below Rs3 lakh awarded from April 1, 2020, to till date. Chances of similar irregularities happening before April 1, 2020, cannot be ruled out. NMC officials also said suspicious payments of Rs90 lakh came to fore from solid waste management department. Scrutiny is going on. Two days after receiving complaint from the NMC, Sadar police registered an offence against Sakode, his wife Sushma (50), elder brother Manohar (70) and nephew Atul (40) under section 420 of IPC. Verification of provision of fund and payment disbursed is pending for some major departments like public works department (PWD), education etc. A six-member committee headed by additional municipal commissioner Deepak Kumar Meena has started investigation into all contracts awarded from April 1, 2020, to till date. Contracts below Rs 3 lakh are given through quotation or fixed rate contract. The committee is also likely to investigate into contracts above Rs3 lakh which requires tendering. BJP corporator Vijay Zalke in a press conference alleged involvement of higher officials in the scam. “Detailed inquiry should be done in all expenditures done in the name of Covid-19 pandemic. The NMC isn’t aware of the whereabouts of materials purchased for Covid care centre which never started operation on Katol road,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/90-more-bogus-contracts-of-rs1-4cr-unearthed-in-nmc-health-dept/articleshow/88327535.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

However, they will continue to boycott non-emergency duties. The functioning of medical college hospitals has come back to normalcy after PG students started attending duties from Thursday morning. Meanwhile, talks the health department had scheduled with the agitating students on Thursday did not happen. “The minister has responded positively to our grievances. She also expressed difficulties in increasing the number of non-resident junior doctors due to lack of funds.

George has also assured us that a committee would be formed to ensure whether the residents’ manual is strictly followed. This was being done as we had complained about the exhaustive duty hours of junior resident doctors, she added. The association has given a memorandum to the chief minister urging to sanction funds to appoint more non-resident junior doctors to reduce the manpower shortage. Meanwhile, Dr Ajithra has alleged that the secretariat staff misbehaved with her when she had come to meet the health officials for talks on Thursday morning.

Not only this, the project of the National Dairy Development Board, which had taken over the failed unit of Parag dairy in Ramnagar, to restart the plant using bio-energy with an investment of Rs 19-crore will also be launched by Modi, who will also unveil the logo for milk and allied products being introduced by the animal husbandry department of the Central government. Talking to TOI on Thursday, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “Amul is investing Rs 475-crore to establish a plant for milk processing and other dairy products. Foundation of this project will be laid by the PM remotely at a public meeting from a ground at Karkhiyao near the site of the proposed plant.” He added, “Amul’s plant in the name of Banas Kashi Sankul is going to be established in 30-acre land and will have a capacity of processing 5 lakh litres of milk per day. Apart from it 50,000 litres of ice cream, 20 metric ton paneer (cottage cheese), 75,000 litres of butter milk, 50 metric ton of curd, 15,000 litres of lassi and 10,000 kg Amul sweets will also be produced at this plant, which will have capacity to expand the production up to 10 lakh litres per day.” This plant will also include Amul bakery and take home ration plant for producing supplement for women and children. “The PM will also click the button of the remote for direct bank transfer of Rs 35-crore, which is being paid by Amul to its 1.70 lakh milk suppliers as bonus,” he said, adding, “Amul will also release a book on growth of its products and markets in this region in past seven years.” “Another major project to boost the dairy sector will be of NDDB,” said the DM, adding, “NDDB is investing Rs 19-crore to operationalise the plant it had taken over from Parag at Ramnagar by forming new committees of farmers and milk producers.” “This milk processing plant of 2 lakh litres per day capacity will run by generating power from bio-gas plant to be established by NDDB. To run this plant, NDDB will purchase cow dung from farmers. With this, the number of bio-energy generation units will increase to two in the district,” he added. The PM will also introduce the logo for milk products going to be introduced by the animal husbandry department of the Central government. The portal of the department for certification of milk and allied products will also be operationalised by the PM on this occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-to-lay-foundation-of-rs-473-cr-mega-amul-dairy-plant-in-kashi-on-dec-23/articleshow/88327556.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Gurgaon||Gurugram Muslim group moves SC over namaz||GURUGRAM: A Muslim outfit formed recently in the wake of repeated protests in the city against namaz in public spaces has moved the Supreme Court, seeking contempt proceedings against officers of the state for failing to stop disruption of Friday prayers. The outfit – Gurgaon Muslim Council, which is led by former Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Adeeb – has in its petition cited the court’s orders on measures to be taken to “curb the communal and violent tendencies that result in perpetration of hate crimes” in the Tehseen S Poonawalla vs Union of India case in 2018 to seek action against the Haryana chief secretary and director general of police. The outfit said it will initiate wider legal moves that would include approaching the high court on different aspects that they have brought up, like inadequate space to offer namaz and land not being available to build mosques. The petition argues that the government has failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s directions, and the state machinery has been in a state of inaction instead of in taking effective measures to prevent disruptions of namaz. “While presently only certain elements are carrying out a hateful campaign, the inaction of the police in preventing the said persons despite prior information repeatedly given by the present petitioner and others is contempt,” reads the petition filed by Adeeb, who lives in Gurugram. In the 2018 hearings on mob violence, the Supreme Court had directed governments to adopt a three-pronged approach – preventive measures, remedial measures and punitive measures – to ensure no group of persons or organisations takes the law in their hands and to identify such tendencies to make sure no untoward incident takes place. Adeeb said Muslims in the city have been performing Friday prayers peacefully and without causing any disturbance. Namaz has been taking place in open areas, he added, because no space has been allotted for it by the municipal authorities. “It is also pertinent to note that the open locations used for the limited purpose of performing namaz are not in any manner of encroachment but rather conducted after approval from the relevant government authorities. As many as 37 locations had been designated for this purpose ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-muslim-group-moves-sc-over-namaz/articleshow/88328293.cms||Bagish Jha

In a letter to the two councils, the students have said that eligible candidates be immediately registered as pharmacists. The institute had been denied licence by the Pharmacy Council of India in 2016 after it admitted 180 students against the maximum allotted capacity of 100 candidates. “Students have been protesting from the last few days but there is no response from the college authority. We have now approached the councils for their intervention,” said a member of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) who have been leading the protest. In the absence of registration of the institute with the council, candidates who graduated from here are unable to get a licence to run a pharmacy store, he further said. The organization has also threatened to start a protest if a solution is not found in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/l-j-pharmacy-students-write-to-pharma-councils-in-gujarat/articleshow/88326906.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Accept Aadhar in place of passport for pilgrims: Pak Sikh body to Imran||Amritsar: The Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC) has requested Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan for allowing Indian pilgrims to cross the Kartarpur Corridor without a passport. The PSGPC wrote to Imran on December 13 that the pilgrims without passport shouldn’t be denied a darshan of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and, besides, they could travel to Pakistan on their national identity card, the Aadhar, instead of a passport. A copy of PSGPC president Ameer Singh’s letter to Imran is with TOI. He further writes that by doing away with the clause of possessing a passport, Pakistan will not only reduce cumbersome formalities but also multiply the number of visitors to Kartarpur Sahib, since almost everyone had an Aadhar Card in India. Former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee president Paramjit Singh Sarna had also requested the government for allowing Indian devotees to travel to Kartarpur Sahib via the Integrated Check Post at Dera Baba Nanak without a passport. He had argued that the motive behind requiring a passport was to determine the identity of the traveller and, if so, an Aadhar Card could serve the same purpose as a passport. Sources here said with the demand of doing away the passport rule for Indian pilgrims travelling to Kartparur Sahib emerging from both India and Pakistan, both countries could take up he issue at the diplomatic level. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee had announced to send a daily jatha’s of ragis to Kartarpur Sahib but couldn’t because of the passport requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/accept-aadhar-in-place-of-passport-for-pilgrims-pak-sikh-body-to-imran/articleshow/88327561.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Mumbai||Inmate said Sheena Bora alive, in Srinagar: Indrani Mukerjea to CBI||MUMBAI: After spending more than six years in jail as an undertrial for the alleged murder of her daughter Sheena Bora, accused Indrani Mukerjea has now claimed that an inmate, who is a woman government official, told her she is, in fact, alive. In a letter to the CBI, Indrani said the inmate has claimed to have met Sheena in Srinagar. Indrani urged the CBI to probe the claim. Indrani sent the letter to the CBI director on November 27 after receiving the information from the inmate on November 25. Indrani has disclosed the name and details of that inmate in the letter stating while on vacation in Srinagar, the inmate met Sheena. Indrani’s lawyer Sana Raees Khan is likely to move an application before the special CBI court on December 28. Khan’s plea will urge the court to direct the CBI to record the officer’s statement. Indrani was arrested in August 2015 in connection with the 2012 murder. Trial in the case is currently underway before the special CBI court. On April 24, 2012, Bora (24) was allegedly abducted and murdered by her mother Indrani, Indrani’s ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai in conspiracy with Indrani’s then husband, media mogul Peter Mukerjea. It was alleged Bora’s body was disposed in a deserted spot off Pen-Khopoli Road, Raigad. On August 21, 2015, Rai was arrested by Khar police in an illegal arms case. During interrogation, he told them about Sheena’s murder. Indrani and Sanjeev were arrested a few days later by city police. On September 29, 2015, the case was transferred to the CBI. In November 2015, the first chargesheet was filed and Peter was arrested. He was granted bail in 2020. The CBI had claimed the remains found belonged to Sheena and that DNA evidence proved this. In 2016, the special CBI court allowed Rai’s plea to turn approver in the case. A year later he deposed for the first time as the trial commenced. So far, around 67 witnesses have deposed. Mikhail Bora, Indrani’s son (from an earlier relationship with Siddhartha Das) and Sheena’s brother, has deposed as a prosecution witness. Das too deposed. Other family members listed as witnesses in the chargesheets include Peter’s son (from an earlier marriage) and Sheena’s fiance Rahul Mukerjea, Peter’s brother Gautam Mukerjea and Indrani’s daughter with Sanjeev, Vidhie Mukerjea. In November 2019, the 59th witness had told the special CBI court that Indrani was the “biological mother of the DNA of the left femur bone” examined from the remains the CBI claimed belonged to Sheena. In December that year, the DNA expert who had linked Indrani to the purported remains of Sheena admitted that he has been under suspension since October after being accused of giving the wrong report in a Kalyan case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/indrani-to-cbi-inmate-said-sheena-alive-in-srinagar/articleshow/88327568.cms||Rebecca Samervel

VACB sleuths seized cash to the tune of over Rs 17 lakh stashed at the engineer’s Aluva flat. This money is suspected to be amassed illegally. Kottayam district environmental engineer Harees A M was arrested on Wednesday after he had demanded Rs 25,000 from the owner of a tyre retreading unit in Pravithanam near Pala for renewing the firm’s non-pollution certificate. According to sources, over Rs 17 lakh, stashed in several places, including a pressure cooker and rice-pot, was seized from the house. Sleuths who raided the house had to later bring a currency counting machine to assess the seized amount. The raid lasted till Thursday early morning. Harees had reportedly demanded a bribe in return for issuing the certificate. The company owner informed the police about the engineer’s demand, and the vigilance laid a trap to nab Harees. Currency notes were laced with phenolphthalein powder, and as the company owner handed over the money to Harees, vigilance sleuths nabbed him and recorded his arrest. Subsequently, the raid at Aluva was held. Sleuths have also seized documents of his bank deposits of Rs 18 lakh. Details of immovable assets such as 33 cents of land and a 2,000 square feet house in Thiruvananthapuram, was also recovered. Harees’ residence in Aluva was worth Rs 80 lakh, sources said. Officials have also reportedly received documents relating to his foreign trips to more than 10 countries. Harees was transferred to the Kottayam PCB office after being promoted to the post of environmental engineer six months ago. Harees has earlier worked in Ernakulam and other districts as well. According to sources, a former environmental engineer of the same office had also demanded Rs 1 lakh from the company owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/vacb-sleuths-find-over-rs-17-lakh-from-arrested-pcb-officials-flat/articleshow/88326933.cms||---

The association of self-financed diploma colleges of Gujarat raised objection against a GTU notification asking students to pay affiliation fees of Rs 900 for three years at one go. As per the rules, GTU collects annual fees of Rs 300 for students getting admitted to affiliated colleges. Members of National Students’ Union of India have accused the university of indulging in financial irregularities with this move. “Given that there are an estimated 1 lakh students in affiliated colleges, GTU can end up collecting a huge amount of Rs 9 crore in advance in the name of affiliation fees,” according to an NSUI member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diploma-colleges-object-to-gtu-collecting-advance-affiliation-fees/articleshow/88326927.cms||---
