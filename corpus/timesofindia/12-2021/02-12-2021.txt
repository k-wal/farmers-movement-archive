The forecast said that the low pressure area in south Andaman Sea will intensify into a depression and move towards the coast as a cyclonic storm on December 4 and the Coast Guard has initiated extensive pre-emptive measures in the eastern coast keeping it in view. The Coast Guard Disaster Relief Teams (DRTs) with inflatable boats, life buoys and life jackets are on the standby for disaster response operation, a twitter post by the Defence public relations officer in Chennai said. Medical teams and ambulance have been kept ready for swift mobilization, it said. The district authorities in some places are asking farmers over the public address system to harvest their ripe paddy crops, the state chief secretary said. Fishermen have been advised to not venture into the southeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal on December 2 and 3, into west central and adjoining northwest Bay of Bengal and along and off North Andhra Pradesh – Odisha – West Bengal coasts from December 3 to 5, state relief commissioner P K Jena said. The sea condition is likely to be very rough with the squally wind speed reaching 45 to 55 kmph, gusting to 65 kmph on December 3. The wind speed is likely to reach 80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph on December 4 morning, an advisory issued by him said. No immediate warning has been issued to the ports so far. The IMD said that the low pressure area brewing over the south Andaman Sea and adjoining area will intensify into a depression and take the shape of a cyclonic storm around December 3. The system will move northwestwards and reach north Andhra Pradesh-Odisha coast around December 4 morning. “Though it is clear that the cyclonic storm will approach the Odisha coast, it is too immature to say where it will make land fall and other details. However, under its impact several coastal districts of Odisha will experience light to moderate rainfall from December 3. South Odisha districts may also experience heavy rainfall on December 3,” India Meteorological Department director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said. He said that there is also a possibility that the cyclonic storm may change its path after reaching near the coast. It is likely to move in north-north east direction and may not cross the coast. "Or, it may cross the Odisha coast and later move towards West Bengal." However, in both cases Odisha will experience rainfall activities, he said. “Only after the depression is formed will we be in a position to predict the path and location of the cyclone crossing the coast and its intensity.” Mohapatra said. The weather office said that the intensity of rainfall in Odisha will increase from December 4, especially in the coastal districts and interior districts will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall. Some parts of coastal Odisha will experience extremely heavy rainfall (20 cms or above) during the period, said H R Biswas, the diretor of Regional Meteorological Centre here. The IMD has issued red warning (heavy to very heavy rainfall) in Gajapati, Ganjam, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts. Orange warning, which indicates less intensity than the red warning, has been issued in Kendrapara, Cuttack, Khurda, Nayagarh, Kandhamal, Rayagada and Koraput districts for December 4 after the cyclonic storm reaches near the coast. It also issued yellow warning indicating heavy rainfall in Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur and Malkangiri districts on the same day. The weather office also issued rainfall warning on December 5 and said several parts of Odisha will experience maximum wind speed of 90 kmph from December 4 morning for 12 hours and rainfall. Odisha chief secretary S C Mohapatra reviewed the preparedness for the possible cyclone and asked the district collectors to be ready to evacuate the people living in low laying areas and kuchha houses in the coastal region. During evacuation, priority will be given to pregnent women, children and elderly persons, he said. The district collectors were also asked to keep the multi-purpose shelters ready for housing the evacuated people. They have been asked told to involve members of the panchayati raj institutions (PRI), ASHA and Anganwadi workers in mobilsing people to get prepared for the calamity. The NDRF and ODRAF as well as fire fighting teams have been asked to remain on alert. Apart from coastal districts, the collectors of Mayurbhanj and Nayagarh have also been asked to stay alert and nearly 200 fire fighting teams and 108 ODRAF and NDRF teams have been kept ready, Jena said. The SRC has also asked district authorities to continuously monitor the situation inlow-lying areas and carry out dewatering activities wherever necessary on an urgent basis. The control room should function round-the-clock, he said in an advisory. “The fishermen advisory needs to be strictly implemented in coastal districts and the situation and rainfall reports should be updated with the State Emergency Operations Centre regularly,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/government-prepares-for-evacuation-as-cyclone-is-likely-to-reach-odisha-coast-on-december-4/articleshow/88037608.cms||---

Speaking at a press briefing here, Tedros said the emergence of the Omicron variant has understandably captured global attention. "At least 23 countries from five of six WHO regions have now reported cases of Omicron and we expect that number to grow. WHO takes this development extremely seriously," Tedros during a press conference. "WHO takes this development extremely seriously, and so should every country. But it should not surprise us. This is what viruses do. And it's what this virus will continue to do, as we long as we allow it to continue spreading," he added. Tedros said that WHO is learning more all the time about Omicron, but there's still more to learn about its effect on transmission, the severity of disease, and the effectiveness of tests, therapeutics and vaccines. "Several WHO advisory groups have met over the last couple of days to evaluate the emerging evidence, and prioritise the studies needed to answer these questions," he added. Earlier, the head of the UN health agency has criticized "blunt" and "blanket" measures taken by countries in the past few days to stop the spread of the Omicron variant. In a statement on Tuesday, the WHO Director-General said that it was "deeply concerning" that Botswana and South Africa, where the new variant was first identified, were "being penalized by others for doing the right thing". Dozens of countries have imposed travel bans on the southern African nations since the mutation was discovered at the end of last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/omicron-coronavirus-variant-confirmed-in-23-countries-who-chief/articleshow/88037563.cms||---

The security forces, meanwhile, killed Jaish-e-Mohammed commander Yasir Parray and his foreign associate in an encounter in Qasbayar area of Rajpora hamlet, in south Kashmir's Pulwama district, officials said on Wednesday. The traffic policeman in Srinagar, Mohammad Abdullah, had been shot thrice — through the cheek, the ear and in the neck, doctors at SMHS hospital said, adding that they were trying to save his life. With the killing of Mehran Shala (19) of Jamalatta, in Nawa Kadal, last week , the police had thought that targeted killings would stop. But Wednesday’s attack on the traffic policeman dispelled the police notion that pistol-bearing terrorists had ceased to exist in the city. IGP (Kashmir) Vijay Kumar said the slain JeM commander,Yasir Parray, was an IED expert. He identified the foreign militant as one Furqan and said both had been involved in several terrorist attacks. "A big #success: IGP Kashmir @JmuKmrPolice (sic)," the Kashmir police tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/terrorists-shoot-critically-injure-traffic-cop-in-srinagar/articleshow/88037710.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||HC takes cognisance of state's halted project to publish Ambedkar's speeches||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of the halting of the state government’s project to publish the speeches and writings of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. “It reflects a sorry state of affairs,’’ said a bench of Justices Prasanna Varale and S M Modak referring to a report in a Marathi daily. The report said 1 to 21 volumes of “The writings and speeches of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’’ have been published till date and are to be printed due to heavy demand. The government had issued directions to print 9 lakh copies of the volumes and paper was purchased for Rs 5.45 crore. Unfortunately in the last 4 years only 33,000 copies were printed and the rest of the paper purchased for the project is lying in godowns. Of the 33,000 copies only 3675 were distributed. The report also said the government press is not equipped with modern machinery and is short staffed. “The publication is absolutely necessary and desirable for present and future generations. It is useful to members of the legal fraternity as well as general members. So we feel there is a need for this court to look into the issue of halting of project and reason therefor. Considering the nature of the grievance raised in the news item, we are treating the news item as a matter for public interest litigation,’’ the judges said in their order. They directed the HC Registry to register it as suo motu PIL and place the papers before the bench presided by the chief justice that hears PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-takes-cognisance-of-states-halted-project-to-publish-ambedkars-speeches/articleshow/88037736.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The route of transmission in 82.20% detected HIV positive cases is heterosexual, whereas in 4.11% cases the transmission is by homosexuals or bisexuals. Parent to child infection rate is 4.64%, and in 2.82% cases the reason behind the transmission has not been specified or remains unknown. The obvious concern has been the areas in and around Guwahati. District wise detection shows that, the maximum number of cases (33%) has been diagnosed in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district as on October 31. Also in the scanner is Cachar district in South Assam where 23% of the state's total cases have been diagnosed. The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) data shows that Assam has been able to test 67,15,121 persons (22,22,527 general clients and 44,92,594 pregnant women) till October 31, 2021 and 20,841 cases have been diagnosed as HIV positive, out of which 19,030 are general clients and 1,811 are pregnant women. In the last 20 years though, the HIV case detection graph has been unevenly on the rise and reached climax in 2019-20 when the highest 1,955 number of cases. In the last two years, however, it has noticeably gone down to 1,288 in 2020-21 and 1,287 in 2021-22 (April to October). Expert analysis done by ASACS stated that Assam remains a highly vulnerable state as far as HIV transmission possibility is concerned because a large number of young population from the state is also going to large cities for employment and get involved in high-risk behaviour. A large number of female migrants from other northeastern states, West Bengal and Nepal, who have come to Assam for employment and education, got involved in risk behavior favorable for HIV transmission, they observed. According to India HIV estimations 2019, adult (15 to 49 years) prevalence percentage in northeast was highest in Mizoram (2.32%), followed by Nagaland (1.45%), Manipur (1.18%), Meghalaya (0.54%), Tripura (0.10%), Assam (0.09%), Sikkim (0.07%) and Arunachal Pradesh (0.06%). Sstate health minister Keshab Mahanta said, “The World AIDS Day is not a one day programme, it is a year long programme and we are all warriors in the fight against HIV. When Covid-19 hit the state, there was discrimination among people but now there is no discrimination and the same is the case with HIV. Today the level of discrimination has come down,” he said, adding that HIV-related deaths have come down because of treatment. During the occasion, four people, who have been working relentlessly in the field of HIV were felicitated------Nirada Devi, director of SCERT, Assam; Bhuban Ch Chutia, assistant professor and Red Ribbon Club coordinator, Nowgong College; Bhaktimmay Bhattacharyya, district AIDS Control Officer, Nowgong; and Drona Bhuyan, folk artiste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/over-86-hiv-cases-in-assam-caused-sexually/articleshow/88037751.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes proclamation against Vinay Singh; says period to appear not as per law||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday quashed and set aside a proclamation issued against Vinay Singh in an alleged case of extortion. In the same case of August 2021, his co-accused is former Mumbai police chief Parambir Singh. Section 82 of CrPC says the period requiring a person to appear “shall not be less than 30 days”, whereas in this case, the proclamation was published on November 18 requiring Singh to appear “within 30 days”, hence it was not in accordance with law. Vinay Singh had approached the high court to quash the proclamation—an act of a public announcement requiring his presence-- issued against him on 17/11/2021. His lawyer Aniket Nikam argued before the bench of Justice S K Shinde that the proclamation was not issued as per the mandate of section 82 Code of Criminal Procedure and form 4 of the code. “The law requires that the accused needs to be given a clear 30 days’ notice and this has not been done in the present case,’’ he argued. Section 82 has penal consequences as on failure to appear the accused has to face prosecution under section 174 IPC for disobeying an order to appear which attracts up to one month of simple imprisonment or fine of Rs 500 or both. The provision has to be construed strictly and the procedure has to be followed completely, said Nikam. But special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap opposing any relief said it was validly issued and that there was no irregularity. Justice Shinde held, “process (order) under Section 82 cannot be issued, unless it is shown that, a warrant had already been issued against the person wanted and that person was evading arrest.’’ “Since Section 82 is a penal clause making the accused susceptible to punishment under Section 174A IPC, procedure… is to be strictly followed and it cannot be Relaxed,’’ held the HC. “Prior to issuance of proclamation, issuance of warrant of arrest by the Magistrate is sine-qua-non,’’ said the HC adding that on this aspect the Magistrate however “cannot be faulted’’ as he had noted that the warrant was issued. The HC said its order was based only on the facts of Vinay Singh’s case. Jagtap sought a stay of the HC order but the court rejected his plea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-quashes-proclamation-against-vinay-singh-says-period-to-appear-not-as-per-law/articleshow/88036224.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||World||Vaccinated California man first in US to test positive for Omicron||WASHINGTON: A person in California who had been vaccinated against Covid-19 became the first in the United States to have an identified case of the Omicron variant, the White House announced Wednesday as scientists continue to study the risks posed by the new virus strain. Dr Anthony Fauci told reporters that the person was a traveller who returned from South Africa on November 22 and tested positive on November 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing ``mild symptoms". The Biden administration moved late last month to restrict travel from Southern Africa where the variant was first identified and had been widespread. Clusters of cases have also been identified in about two dozen other nations. ``We knew that it was just a matter of time before the first case of omicron would be detected in the United States,'' Fauci said. Officials said they had contacted everyone who had close contact with the person and they had all tested negative. Genomic sequencing was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco and the sequence was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is taking steps to tighten U.S. testing rules for travelers from overseas, including requiring a test for all travelers within a day of boarding a flight to the U.S. regardless of vaccination status. It was also considering mandating post-arrival testing. Officials said those measures would only ``buy time'' for the country to learn more about the new variant and to take appropriate precautions, but that given its transmissibility its arrival in the US was inevitable. Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious than previous strains, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine. Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said more would be known about the Omicron strain in two to four weeks as scientists grow and test lab samples of the virus. The announcement of the first US case comes before President Joe Biden plans to outline his strategy on Thursday to combat the virus over the winter. Biden has tried to quell alarm over the omicron variant, saying it was a cause for concern but ``not a cause for panic.'' Biden and public health officials have grown more urgent in their pleas for more Americans to get vaccinated and for those who have been vaccinated to get booster shots to maximise their protection against the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/first-us-omicron-case-identified-in-california-health-agency/articleshow/88037972.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Stop construction on Khar playground: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Taking note that construction has commenced on a 6,000-square-metre plot reserved for a playground next to St Elias High School in Khar (West), flouting a Supreme Court order passed over 26 years ago, the Bombay HC has directed there will be no further construction on it. The interim order by chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Makarand Karnik on Monday came on a public interest litigation by three local residents, Dileep Saptarshi, Robert Wiesinger and Sunil Bhatia, saying despite SC’s April 3, 1995, order restraining construction on the plot reserved in the 1992 Development Plan (DP) as a playground, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) permitted Integrated Realty Projects to construct on it. “Since no construction activity can be carried out on such plot bearing survey number 1143 in terms of the said (SC) order, we restrain any further construction on such land without the leave of the court,” said the judges in their order. In 1988, Saptarshi and Wiesinger had moved HC to direct the BMC to implement the 1966 DP where the plot was reserved as a recreation ground. In November 1988, the HC directed the BMC to prevent additional encroachments on it. On the BMC’s appeal, the SC on April 3, 1995, directed it to demarcate the 6,000-sq-m area and not permit encroachments on it. The plot was never fenced though. In 2019, construction for an SRA project began in a neighbouring plot. In August 2021, excavation began on the PG reserved plot. On October 1, the petitioners wrote to the authorities to urgently demarcate and develop the playground. There was no PG developed and “instead, the groundwork for massive constructions has commenced”. The PIL mentioned that the school has nearly 2,000 students and there is “absolutely no open space either for private use or for public use, for young children in the locality to use as a playground”. Senior advocate Gayatri Singh, with advocate Ronita Bhattacharya Bector, showed the SC’s order as well as the current DP 2034 that shows reservation for a playground. They also submitted the photographs of the status of the construction. After perusing them, the judges remarked that in the light of SC’s order, the BMC should not have allowed SRA to construct on the reserved PG plot. Also, having realised that SRA had encroached upon it, the BMC should have stopped the construction. Allowing the petitioners to implead the developer as well as Om Shree Sai Shraddha SRA CHS as respondents, the judges posted the next hearing on January 10, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/stop-construction-on-khar-playground-bombay-hc/articleshow/88036102.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Mumbai||Pune sessions court order to extend remand lacked jurisdiction, says HC while granting default bail to Bharadwaj||MUMBAI: Holding that an additional sessions judge in Pune had no jurisdiction to extend the remand of Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused under a special anti-terror law, in the Elgar Parishad case, Bombay high court on Tuesday granted her default bail as the chargesheet was filed during such unlawfully extended custody. Bharadwaj, 59, a civil rights activist was arrested on August 28, 2018. She was initially kept under house arrest on court orders and that period, the HC said, stood excluded from 90 days granted by law for the prosecuting agency--The National Investigation Agency (NIA)—to file its chargesheet. Bharadwaj is currently in Byculla women’s prison in Mumbai. The HC directed that the bail amount and conditions will be set by the Special NIA court for Bharadwaj. The HC directed her to be produced before the NIA court on December 6 when the special Judge would then pass orders to release her on suitable conditions. A ‘default bail’ is a right of an accused to seek his or her liberty when police or any special agency which is probing the crime fails to file its charge sheet within a legally mandated deadline. This bail is not on the merits of the case. However, rejected a similar plea for default bail made by eight other co-accused in the case. The eight accused who will remain in jail are—Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Dr. Shoma Sen and Mahesh Raut were arrested on June 6, 2018 and P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira who were arrested on August 28, 2018. The NIA accused them of alleged Maoist links and under the stringent anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar who granted Bharadwaj the relief also said, “where the accused fails to apply for default bail when the right accrues to him and subsequently a chargesheet is filed before the magistrate, the right to default bail would get extinguished’’ as the accused has not “availed’’ such right. The HC also held that “failure to take cognizance (to take judicial notice of matter) or defect in jurisdiction in taking cognizance, once the chargesheet was laid (filed), does not entail the consequence of default bail.’’ The eight other accused had sought default bail on the ground that they were in custody for over 180 days with no proper cognizance being taken of the chargesheet against them. They argued that the Pune Sessions Judge had no power or jurisdiction to take cognizance of the chargesheet and only a competent or special NIA court could have. The HC noted that while Bharadwaj had exercised her right under the law and applied for default bail on November 25, 2018 on the grounds that 90 days after her arrest had expired and no chargesheet was filed by the NIA. The agency said her application then was premature. The sessions court judge in Pune on November 26 extended her remand another 90 days—under the NIA Act, the agency get a total of 180 days to complete investigation and file chargesheet. But the HC had earlier held that the days spent in house custody are to be excluded from the judicial remand, hence the initial 90 day custody expired on January 25, 2019. But till then NIA had not filed its chargesheet against her or even Rao, Gonsalves and Ferriera. The additional chargesheet against them was filed on February 21, 2019. The custody of Rao, Gonsalves and Ferreira was also extended by 90 days on November 26, 2018 by the Pune additional sessions jugde K D Vadane, “without jurisdiction’’, noted the HC. But it held that its declaration that the extension was not lawful, “is of no assistance’’ to the trio as they “did not avail of the right to be released on default bail by fling an application, after the expiry of the initial period of 90 days and before the lodging of the charge-sheet on 21st February 2019.’’ The bench said, “Resultantly, a crucial condition of ‘availing of’ the right so as to cement it as an indefeasible right, has not been fulfilled and the right stood extinguished by the fling of the charge-sheet on 21st February 2019.’’ The HC held, after citing a ruling by the SC, that “for all offences under the UAPA, the Special Court alone has exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences.’’ The Special Court may take cognizance of an offence on receiving a complaint copy or police report on the complaint, even when an accused has not yet been sent to it for trial. The HC held that for the five accused arrested on June 6, “the aspect of legality of the extension of the detention period is of no relevance as they did not avail the right to be released on default bail before the chargesheet was filed against them on November 15, 2018. Counsel Yug Chaudhry with advocate Payoshi Roy for Bharadwaj had, among other legal points argued that the Pune Sessions Judge lacked the jurisdiction to extend her remand. Counsel Sudeep Pasbola for the eight co-accused had argued for their default bail while ASG Anil Singh for NIA opposed their plea as did Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni for the State. The state and NIA argued that the special courts are for ‘trial’ of UAPA offences and not meant for ‘pre-trial proceedings’ such as extending of remand. Pending completion of investigation, power to extend custody is “squarly in realm of investigation’’ and ordinary criminal courts—like sessions court—are not divested of jurisdiction to extend remand, they argued. The HC disagreed, with the respondents. The HC cited UAPA saying its provisions expressly confers the power to extend the period of detention of the accused upto 180 days on the ‘Court’—which is the court having jurisdiction to try such offences—meaning the special NIA court. The HC said only in the absence of such special courts being designated, the Sessions court would have the jurisdiction. But as pointed out by Chaudhry, special courts were constituted at Pune and hence the Pune Sessions court order of extension of custody was “non-est’’ in law meaning it does not exist. The HC also observing that there exist a catena of judgments on the indefeasible right of an accused to default bail said such right takes on the character of fundamental right flowing from...Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution of India.’’ The judgment said, “The aspect of competence (of a court) to take cognizance, on the other hand, is a matter which does not necessarily entail the consequence on personal liberty.’’ The HC also said, the power to extend the detention period is not expected to be a “matter of routine’’. “ The Court is expected to apply its mind to the necessity of further detention and extension of period of investigation.’’ The special NIA court has to exercise such power, it added. "Mere irregularity without resultant prejudice which has the propensity to lead to failure of justice is of no consequence,'' said the bench of Justices Shinde and Jamadar in the 120 page judgment. It added Anil Singh, the additional solicitor general appearing for NIA "was justified in advancing the submission as regards lack of prejudice in the context of the cognizance having been taken by the learned additional sessions judge.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pune-sessions-court-order-to-extend-remand-lacked-jurisdiction-says-hc-while-granting-default-bail-to-bharadwaj/articleshow/88036428.cms||Swati Deshpande

Raising the issue in the Lok Sabha, the Tirupati MP recalled that the ministry of civil aviation assured several times that Tirupati international airport is one of the eight airports selected for establishing the MRO Centre, while Invest India also highlighted Tirupati's potential to become an MRO centre. To make the country a hub for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft, the ministry has earlier geared up to identify sites and invite bids for implementation of MRO at eight airports, including the Tirupati international airport. The Airports Authority of India was asked to identify the site for establishing the MRO centre at Tirupati. Tirupati MP Gurumurthy urged the civil aviation ministry to appoint a special officer for speedy implementation of the MRO centre. He also asked the ministry for the launch of an international logistics project and increase of connectivity to Tirupati Airport under UDAN scheme. Meanwhile, to a question if the ministry of textiles has any proposals to promote handicrafts in and around Srikalahasti and also weavers who are weaving sarees from Venkatagiri, the union minister of state for textiles informed the house that the respective offices of development commissioner implemented various schemes for promotion and development of handicrafts and handlooms in Andhra Pradesh including Srikalahasti and Venkatagiri constituencies. “For development of the handicraft sector, the office of development commissioner (Handicrafts) has implemented 182 interventions and released Rs. 2,747.84 lakhs from 2016-17 to 2020-21.

---||India||Undertrial can’t be detained indefinitely, says Supreme Court||NEW DELHI: Taking up the case of a Maoist leader charged under the tough UAPA law, the Supreme Court on Wednesday held that an undertrial cannot be indefinitely detained in prison if there is a delay in concluding the trial. The courts “would ordinarily be obligated” to grant bail if timely trial is not possible and the accused has been in jail for long, it added. Underlining that the rights of an accused must also be protected, a bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka said deprivation of personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial is not consistent with Article 21 of the Constitution on the right to life and liberty. The court granted bail to 74-year alleged senior Maoist leader Asim Kumar Bhattacharya being tried by the National Investigation Agency under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Bhattacharya approached the apex court through advocate Satya Mitra after his bail plea was rejected by the trial court and the Calcutta high court. He was arrested on July 6, 2012 and has been in jail since. The chargesheet was filed in 2012 but charges were framed in 2019. Times ViewThe case highlights the cost of the inordinate delays that plagues our justice system. The apex court is right in saying that “denial of speedy justice is a threat to public confidence in the administration of justice.” The executive and judiciary should set aside their differences in dealing with the urgent issue of how to reduce pendency of cases.“This court has consistently observed in its numerous judgments that the liberty guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution would cover within its protective ambit not only due procedure and fairness but also access to justice and a speedy trial is imperative and undertrials cannot indefinitely be detained pending trial. Once it is obvious that a timely trial would not be possible and the accused has suffered incarceration for a significant period of time, the courts would ordinarily be obligated to enlarge him on bail,” the court said. The court said charges against Bhattacharya were very serious but need to be balanced with certain other factors like the period of incarceration undergone and the likely period within which the trial can be expected to be finally concluded. The court noted there is no likelihood of wrapping up the trial as the statement of only one out more than 100 witnesses has so far been recorded in the case. “Deprivation of personal liberty without ensuring speedy trial is not consistent with Article 21 of the Constitution of India. While deprivation of personal liberty for some period may not be avoidable, period of deprivation pending trial/appeal cannot be unduly long. At the same time, timely delivery of justice is part of human rights and denial of speedy justice is a threat to public confidence in the administration of justice,” it said. The court noted that the trial in the case should have been conducted on a day-to-day basis as per the NIA Act but it was not being followed in this case, causing delay in proceedings. “In the given circumstances, we consider it appropriate to direct that the state of West Bengal shall take up the issue and designate more dedicated courts of sessions as special courts for the trial of offences specified in the schedule appended to the NIA Act. At the same time, the central government may also, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, Calcutta may exercise its power and take up the issue at the earliest so that such trials which are pending under the Act may go ahead speedily and the mandate, as intended by the legislature in its wisdom, reflected from Section 19 of the Act, is being complied with in its letter and spirit,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/undertrial-cant-be-detained-indefinitely-says-supreme-court/articleshow/88038239.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The kitty in November (for transactions in October) was a shade higher than the Rs 1.3 lakh crore deposited in the treasury last month and 25% higher than a year ago. “This (collection) is very much in line with the trend in economic recovery. This is also evident from the trend in the e-way bills generated every month since the second wave. The revenues would have still been higher if the sales of cars and other products had not been affected on account of disruption in supply of semi-conductors,” the finance ministry said in a statement. The previous record monthly collection was witnessed in April, for which the numbers have been revised downwards from Rs 1,41,384 crore announced earlier to Rs 1,39,708 crore. The collection figures for May and June too have been revised. The government said that the earlier numbers that were released for the up to the 5th of the three months (instead of the full month’s data), which was the extended deadline for filing returns in the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19. Apart from the recovery, collections have also been aided by better compliance due to efforts taken by the Centre and the states, the finance ministry said. It pointed to over 80% of the taxpayers filing their returns every month between June and September. "Overall, the impact of these efforts has ensured increased compliance and higher revenues. As a part of overall efforts to plug evasion, more steps to restrict fake ITC are under consideration of the GST Council," the government said in a statement. Tax experts seemed to agree. "For this trend of high GST revenues, credits (go to) various policy and administrative measures as well as other initiatives undertaken in last one year like compliance improvement, enhancement of system capacity, nudging non-filers after last date of filing of returns, auto-population of returns, blocking of e-way bills and passing of input tax credit for non-filers which has led to consistent improvement in the filing of returns over the last few months," said Harpreet Singh, a partner at consulting firm KPMG. Although the government expects collections to stay robust there may be some bumps ahead. "Looking ahead, collections may dip in December 2021, as suggested by the deceleration in the daily average e-way bill generation in the first three weeks of November 2021. Nevertheless, we expect CGST collections to rise to around Rs. 5.8 trillion (Rs 5.8 lakh crore) in FY2022, exceeding the FY2022 BE by around Rs. 500 billion (Rs 50,000 crore)," said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-rs-1-32-lakh-crore-gst-mop-up-in-november-second-highest-ever/articleshow/88038290.cms||---

We will obtain an opinion from the Union government.” Besides Mandaviya, Bommai is scheduled to meet other Union ministers as well as central BJP leaders during his Delhi visit. The demand for a booster shot, particularly for healthcare and frontline workers, has gained momentum amid mounting fear over the new Covid variant Omicron. According to an official source in the central government, an expert committee on immunisation is considering to recommend an “additional dose” to those who are at high risk of contracting the virus. A final decision on this issue will be taken by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) next week, which will then be considered by the health ministry for approval. The demand for booster shot comes amid reports that several states and private hospitals have stocks of soon-to-be-expired vaccine stocks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-karnataka-to-seek-booster-shots-for-frontline-health-workers/articleshow/88038340.cms||---

However, if the person has travelled to any at risk country in last 14 days, he/she will be asked for post arrival testing and other additional restrictions. “A passenger can exit the airport or can take connecting flights for final destination once the negative report is received. He or she need not wait for the report of all the co-passengers,” the government said.

But the Maharashtra government directive that made RT-PCR reports mandatory for all inter-state arrivals amid Omicron scare has left many year-end travel plans in a limbo, say travel industry insiders. Coronavirus live updates“The major concern is about spending January 1 queueing up at Goa’s testing centres and hospitals to undergo an RT-PCR test.

Late on Tuesday night, the Maharashtra government had imposed new entry restrictions, among which was a mandatory week-long hotel quarantine for passengers arriving from or even transiting from “at-risk” countries. Prashant Pitti, co-founder, EaseMyTrip, said: “People were gradually opening up to the idea of international travel. In comparison with January-March 2021, we had witnessed a 50% jump in international travel bookings.” A travel agent, requesting anonymity, said most cancellations and rescheduling came from students and passengers arriving and transiting from the UK and Europe. For those who have decided to go ahead with the India trip, booking hotels for quarantine is a problem.

---||India||Mamata Banerjee meets Sharad Pawar, says ‘no UPA now’||MUMBAI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee targeted the Congress on Wednesday saying “what is UPA, there is no UPA now” amid signs that her party is opposed to a Congress-led opposition front to take on the NDA. Banerjee also took a swipe at the Congress leadership saying politics required continuous endeavour, “if you are going abroad to enjoy, how will people trust you”. She said only those politicians can take on the BJP who know ground realities. “We have done it in West Bengal,” she said. Though Banerjee did not name a party or a person, observers said the comments came in response to a question about the role of the Congress. The Bengal CM’s statements were made during an interaction with civil society in Mumbai and after a meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar at his residence. NCP was a constituent of the Congress-led UPA coalition, which formed the last government at the Centre and is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance in Maharashtra with Congress. The opposition’s choice of PM would be decided by the evolving “situation and the states”, Banerjee said in the interaction with civil society members, explaining that the important “issue now... was to wipe the BJP out of the country politically and save democracy.” Read AlsoMamata Banerjee has become BJP's 'oxygen supplier': CongressThe Congress on Wednesday reacted strongly to Mamata Banerjee's remarks against the UPA and accused the West Bengal chief minister of helping the BJP by becoming its "oxygen supplier." Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused Mamata of weakening the Congress to keep the BJP happy.Her response on the UPA came when asked if Pawar will lead the UPA against the BJP in the 2024 general elections. Banerjee shot back, saying “what is UPA, there is no UPA now”. “We have to draft a comprehensive strategy to take on BJP, we need united opposition. We need a firm alternative against BJP. My meeting with Sharad Pawar was to work out an action plan to defeat the BJP... I know Pawar, I have worked with him,” she said. The TMC made it clear that it refuses to toe the Congress line on a strategy for the opposition in and outside Parliament. In the recent past, it has poached Congress leaders in a bid to expand its footprint in the north-east, Goa, Bihar and Haryana. “Regional parties will build up national parties. They alone can defeat the BJP,” the Bengal CM said, accusing Congress of being “the BJP’s TRP.” “They just waste their time and the BJP becomes more and more powerful. But we will not tolerate that. We saw what happened in Goa (after the last assembly elections). People’s mandate was for the Congress, not the BJP, but the BJP formed the government. This cannot go on. I do not want division of votes but no political party is bigger than the nation,” she said. Banerjee conceded that the policy would differ from state to state. “Why will we disturb the system in Maharashtra?” she asked, referring to the anti-BJP coalition. “But where there is no possibility, where the Congress is not fighting and where the BJP is growing…, we will not let the BJP grow,” she added, accusing the BJP of “dividing society”. Pawar said “leadership is a secondary issue” and was a collective responsibility. “The prime objective is to set up an alternate platform that can win people’s trust. Those who are against BJP are welcome,” he said when asked about Congress’s possible role. Congress leaders, including state president Nana Patole, former CM Ashok Chavan and party leader in legislature Balasaheb Thorat, slammed Banerjee’s statements. Patole said the fight against BJP should be fought unitedly, keeping egos aside. “Congress is the only viable alternative to BJP,” he said. General secretary K C Venugopal in Delhi said, “Everybody knows the reality of Indian politics. Thinking that without Congress, anybody can defeat BJP is merely a dream.” Banerjee was on a two-day visit to Maharashtra. She was scheduled to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, but that was cancelled since he is recovering from a surgery. However, Banerjee met Shiv Sena leaders Aditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut.

Netflix spokeswoman Emily Feingold confirmed that Jacqueline Avant was killed in the shooting. Avant's daughter, Nicole, is married to Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer.  Jacqueline Avant, 81, a local philanthropist, was president of the Neighbors of Watts and served on the board of directors of the International Student Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.  Her husband, Clarence Avant, is known as the "Godfather of Black Music" and was recently inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Former president Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris were among those who paid tribute to him in a video made for the induction ceremony in October.  Nicole Avant, who served as US ambassador to the Bahamas from 2009 to 2011, is now a film producer whose work includes a 2019 Netflix documentary about her father, "The Black Godfather". In an interview with NBC News about the documentary, she praised her mother.  "My mom is really the one who brought to my father and our family the love and passion and importance of the arts and culture and entertainment," she said. "While my father was in it, making all the deals, my mother was the one who gave me, for example, my love of literature, my love of filmmaking, my love of storytelling."  Beverly Hills police have not identified Jacqueline Avant as the victim in Wednesday's violence. They have only said that detectives are investigating a shooting that killed one person.  The coroner's office has not yet officially identified the person, either, but said the victim was reported as a woman in her 80s.  The suspect - or suspects - fled the scene and have not been found, Beverly Hills police said in a news release.  Police received a call at 2:23 am, reporting the shooting in a neighborhood. Officers found a person with a gunshot wound, who was later pronounced dead.  The shooting was reported on the street where the Avants live, according to voter registration records.  The police chief was expected to hold a briefing later in the day with more information.  TMZ first reported Jacqueline Avant's death.  The Avants were married in 1967. They had two children, Nicole Avant and Alexander Du Bois Avant.  Clarence Avant, 90, is a Grammy-winning executive, concert promoter and manager who mentored and helped the careers of artists including Bill Withers, Little Willie John, L.A. Reid, Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.  He founded Sussex Records and Tabu Records in the 1960s and 1970s, and was chair of Motown Records in the 1990s.  Basketball icon Earvin "Magic" Johnson wrote on Twitter that he and his wife were "devastated" by the news of Avant's death, calling her "one of our closest friends".  "This is the saddest day in our lives," he wrote.  Rep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, said she was heartbroken by the violence.  "Mrs Avant was a force of compassion and empowerment locally and nationally for decades, as well as a model of service and giving back to those who needed it most," Bass wrote on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/jacqueline-avant-wife-of-music-legend-killed-in-shooting/articleshow/88038598.cms||---

However, several principals whom TOI spoke to wondered how the board would not know about the questions in the paper. "A committee appointed by the board prepares the questions. It then goes through various filtering and checking processes. It is amusing that out of the over 30 centres I was overseeing, no student or teacher voiced any concern about the paper. The board issuing such a statement raises questions about its credibility," said a principal on condition of anonymity. However, a senior CBSE official, said, "The board does not get to see the paper. If that is done, there won’t be any secrecy." The questions are finalised in two stages. A four- to five-member expert committee is constituted for each subject for framing the questions. A question bank is then prepared. These questions are then checked by an expert committee which then selects them and finalises the paper. Another principal pointed out that the topic was very much a part of the syllabus. "There is a topic on anti-Muslim riots where the Gujarat events are mentioned," said the principal. Students and teachers claimed that the paper had several grammatical errors and one of the questions was incomplete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbse-frowns-upon-gujarat-riots-question/articleshow/88038604.cms||Shradha Chettri

In its report on the ‘Suspension Of Telecom Services/Internet And Its Impact’ tabled in Lok Sabha on Wednesday, the Standing Committee on Information Technology pointed to absence “absence of parameters” to decide the merit of shutting down the internet during certain times, saying there is no clear-cut definition of what constitutes public emergency and safety. It stressed on the need to put in place a proper mechanism at the earliest to decide on the merit or appropriateness of telecom and internet shutdowns. The panel recommended that a thorough study be commissioned by the government to assess the impact of the internet shutdown on the economy and find out its effectiveness. It said that the Cellular Operators’ Association of India had submitted that “telecom operators lose Rs 2.45 crore per hour in every Circle Area where there is a shutdown or throttling”. “As per the department of telecommunications, since the actual shutdown is ordered either by the state governments or by the ministry of home affairs, the department are not assessing whether the objectives have been achieved or not, and the responsibility for assessing the effectiveness of internet shutdown lies completely with the ministry of home affairs or the state government concerned. The Committee have also been informed that no assessment is available with MHA,” the report noted. Referring to the shutting down of internet in the digital era as “both anachronistic and acting as a bulwark against economic development and democratic rights of the people”, the committee recommended that the government should explore the option of selectively banning services like Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram, among others, “instead of banning the internet as a whole”, when needed. It also observed that according to the government, internet shutdowns are preventive measures taken in the interest of public safety, sovereignty and integrity of India, and security of the state, among other things, and that such suspensions are revoked when situation comes under control. “When the Committee pointed out that communal riots took place during pre-internet era also and enquired if any study has been conducted by DoT/MHA to establish the correlation between internet and riots, both DoT and MHA have informed the Committee that they have not conducted any study to establish the link between internet shutdown and communal riots,” the report said. Frequent internet shutdowns indicate that states and Union government resort to this method as a “convenient way to deal with any restive situations without properly assessing the effectiveness of such drastic measure in controlling such situations”, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/avoid-blanket-internet-ban-says-parliament-panel/articleshow/88038643.cms||Swati Mathur

Setting aside the order National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which held Bombay Hospital & Medical Research Centre and its doctors liable for medical negligence for death of a patient, a bench of Justices Hemant Gupta and V Ramasubramanian said that the fault cannot always be fastened on the doctors and hospital if a patient did not survive. It said that delay in conducting some medical test due to fault in machine can also not be said to be negligence on the part of the doctor or the hospital, saying "Any machine can become non-functional because of innumerable factors beyond the human control as the machines involve various mechanical, electrical and electronic components" "No fault can be attached to the Hospital if the operation theatres were occupied when the patient was taken for surgery. Operation theatres cannot be presumed to be available at all times. Therefore, non-availability of an emergency operation theatre during the period when surgeries were being performed on other patients is not a valid ground to hold the Hospital negligent in any manner," the bench said.. The bench said that in this case the patient was in serious condition impending gangrene even before admission to the hospital and if the patient did not survive after surgery and re-exploration, the fault cannot be fastened on the doctors as a case of medical negligence and turned down the plea of the family member of the deceased who blamed the hospital for the death. "There is a tendency to blame the doctor when a patient dies or suffers some mishap. This is an intolerant conduct of the family members to not accept the death in such cases. The increased cases of manhandling of medical professionals who worked day and night without their comfort has been very well seen in this pandemic," it said. The court said that a team of specialist doctors was available and attended to the patient and there was no proof of any negligence and set aside the commission order for compensation of Rs 14 lakh to the patient's family. "The family may not have coped with the loss of their loved one, but the Hospital and the Doctor cannot be blamed as they provided the requisite care at all given times. No doctor can assure life to his patient but can only attempt to treat his patient to the best of his ability which was being done in the present case as well," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/doctors-cant-be-always-blamed-for-negligence-in-deaths-says-supreme-court/articleshow/88038719.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

The panel, which has been discussing ‘Ethical Standards in Media Coverage’, tabled its report in Lok Sabha on Wednesday. In the report, the panel recommended setting up a media commission comprising experts, for wider consultations amongst interested groups and stakeholders, to build a consensus on how the proposed media council should evolve. The report also pointed to the need for changes in the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, as per the deposition made to it by the secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting. “The Press Council is a statutory body and is in existence for the print media but for the television there is no such statutory body. While the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) and the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) have developed as organisations, they are not formally recognised by the government. There are many channels that are not members of NBA. By amending the Act, a provision would be made that action on any complaint should be by rule instead of being by an executive order,” the committee said. It also said that stakeholder comments to the proposed amendments to the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 are under the ministry’s consideration and that there is a discussion over having an umbrella statute for the entire broadcasting sector covering print, electronic and online media. “The committee would desire the ministry to expeditiously look into making necessary amendments in the existing Cable TV Network (Regulation) Act, which is 25 years old, and needs changes in accordance with the changing regulatory environment, while ensuring that the grey areas in the interpretation and implementation of the said Act are duly addressed and also to ensure that the proposed amendments are consumer friendly. This will address the issues of stakeholders by bringing more transparency in the system,” the report said. Among other things, the committee expressed concern over the “disturbing trend” of fake news, and, separately, asked the I&B ministry to pursue the law ministry for early implementation of certain recommendations of the Law Commission to make paid news an electoral offence. “The committee has noted that ‘Media’ which was once the most trusted weapon in the hands of the citizenry in our democracy and acted as trustees of the public interest is gradually losing its credibility and integrity where values and morality are being compromised,” it said. Until such time that the government establishes a larger ‘Media Council’, the panel asked the information and broadcasting ministry to consider expanding the existing regulatory framework to monitor e-newspapers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/set-up-a-council-for-all-forms-of-media-parliamentary-panel/articleshow/88038763.cms||Swati Mathur

If the FDA gives emergency authorisation to the drug, it may also open the path for emergency use authorisation for drug in India. Usually expert committee recommendations are accepted by the regulator. The regulatory subject expert committee (SEC) in India has held back its recommendations primarily because the drug is yet to be approved in its country of origin, sources said. Experts said the pill can play a significant role if vaccine induced and natural immunity are threatened by the new variant Omicron. In its next meeting, the SEC is likely to again consider the application for recommending EUA to the drug if additional data is found satisfactory, an official said. Many Indian companies, including Natco, Dr Reddy’s, Cipla, Sun Pharma, Hetero and BDR Pharma are awaiting the regulatory nod to introduce the generic antiviral in the country, which is expected to be at affordable prices. Coronavirus live updatesThe development assumes significance because the antiviral oral pill Molnupiravir, developed by Merck and its partner Ridgeback, is touted as the gamechanger for high-risk individuals and people with weakened immunity and reportedly cuts the risk of hospitalisation and death by half. The drug has shown promise in the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults. At present, antiviral drugs in use in Covid therapy such as remdesivir, are administered intravenously, and in hospital settings.

The drug is authorised in the UK for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Covid-19 in adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test and who have at least one risk factor for developing severe illness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/usfda-nod-to-clear-way-for-molnupiravir-use-in-india/articleshow/88038789.cms||Sushmi Dey

The MPs have been suspended for the current winter session for “unruly” conduct that included obstructing proceedings and clashing with watch and ward staff. Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu has refused to revoke the suspension, saying the suspended MPs have shown no remorse for their “unacceptable” actions. “Coming to the well of the House, climbing on the table, throwing papers, snatching papers from the minister and also challenging the Chair, doing everything which is unparliamentary, undemocratic and they have no remorse” Naidu said. “If you are determined, you don’t want to have Zero Hour (where), very important issues (are listed to be raised), special mentions are there,” he said before adjourning the proceedings. Lok Sabha, however, passed a bill to regulate and supervise assisted reproductive technology clinics by a voice vote. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, seeks supervision of assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics and assisted reproductive technology banks, prevention of misuse and safe and ethical practice. The bill was taken for debate and passage even as TRS MPs continued with protests sitting in the well though they didn’t shout slogans due to which the debate was conducted smoothly. Health minister Mansukh Mandaviya also moved various amendments to the Assisted Reproductive (Regulation) Bill based on recommendations made by a parliamentary committee. Earlier, initiating the debate on the ART Bill, Congress MP Karti Chidambaram highlighted the existing lacuna in the bill and also asked that if the donor was anonymous, why do they need to share their Aadhaar number. “Will there be a contact tracing if the child wishes to do so after turning adult?” he asked and said the bill excludes those who cannot afford the expensive procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lok-sabha-conducts-business-but-rajya-sabha-logjam-persists-over-mps-suspension/articleshow/88038835.cms||---

Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and south interior Karnataka received 169% excess rainfall last month while the country witnessed 645 ‘heavy’ (64.5 to 115.5 mm), 168 ‘ve heavy’ (115.6 to 204.5 mm) and 11 ‘extremely heavy’ (over 204.5 mm) rainfall events in November. The Met department attributed such rainfall events to the active phase of northeast monsoon and also to five low-pressure systems over the Andaman Sea in November which was nearly double the average number of low-pressure systems in the month. The IMD said the monthly rainfall over the south peninsular India consisting of five meteorological subdivisions — Tamil Nadu, Puducherry & Karaikal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh & Yanam, Rayalaseema, Kerala & Mahe and South Interior Karnataka — is likely to be above normal (>132% of Long Period Average) in December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/southern-india-saw-highest-rainfall-in-november-since-1901/articleshow/88038875.cms||---

After undergoing Covid tests at the Srinagar international airport, travellers will have to stay for eight hours in mandatory quarantine at these centres,” a senior official said.  He added in case any traveller tests positive for the Covid-19, he/she will be shifted to DRDO Covid hospital for special treatment.  Kashmir is all set to witness international tourist arrival with the onset of winter and the activities to be conducted by the tourism department.  Health services director, Kashmir, Dr Mushtaq Ahmad Rather on Tuesday held a meeting with all the medical superintendents of hospitals across Kashmir and reviewed the Covid-19 arrangements.  The director reviewed all the Covid-19 related arrangements and discussed measures being put in place in view of the Covid variant, Omicron, which has been classified as a Variant of Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO).  He directed all the superintendents to remain in an alert situation and keep the hospitals in ready mode in case of any kind of eventuality.  The director also directed them to keep the Covid-19 related supplies available in hospitals and also create separate isolated beds, which shall be kept ready for any kind of eventuality.  Further, Dr Mushtaq stressed awareness should be increased among the general public and said that adherence to SoPs, Covid-appropriate behavior, social distancing and wearing of masks are the first line of defence for any kind of variant.  Controller stores DHSK who was also present in the meeting was directed to keep the Covid-related supplies available in abundance in all the hospitals.  All the medical superintendents were given the latest guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India, which were revised afresh in the wake of the identification of Covid variant Omicron.  The director also emphasised focusing on testing and directed the hospital administrators that testing should be increased so that case detection becomes easy.  “There has been an increased prevalence of cases. We should have more focus on testing so that once cases are traced, we can isolate and treat them properly,” he said.  Dr Mushtaq added people have been a bit complacent and they should continue to follow the precautionary measures and follow the guidelines in letter and spirit.  The director also said that showing disregard towards established SoPs could have disastrous consequences and can be very detrimental in “our fight against the virus”.  He further said the department is ready and all the measures related to oxygen supplies and availability of medicines, besides other arrangements, have already been put in place to face any eventuality.  Additional chief secretary, J&K health and medical education department, Vivek Bhardwaj, asked the director to visit Srinagar international airport in the wake of the issuance of fresh guidelines for international arrivals.  It is pertinent to mention here that the director recently reviewed the Covid-19 testing facility on strategic Srinagar-Jammu Highway near the entry point of Qazigund tunnel (Zig Tunnel) and directed CMO Kulgam to increase the testing and ensure that every traveller is tested before their entry to Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-jk-sets-up-3-special-quarantine-centres-in-srinagar-for-foreign-travellers/articleshow/88038886.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The new camouflage fatigues, with a mix of colours from earthen to olive, will be showcased for the first time during the Army Day Parade on January 15. “The new combat dress has been finalised after extensive deliberations, which included consultations with the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT), and a study of the military uniforms of other countries,” said an officer on Wednesday. The shirt will also not be tucked into the trouser in the new combat uniform. But it is as yet unclear whether the present shiny stars, badges and accoutrements, worn by officers on shoulders and collar tabs, will be blackened for better camouflage. “The overall aim is to have a combat dress that is more comfortable in both summers and winters, durable and provides better camouflage. A new regular uniform to replace the present one is also in the works,” said another officer. The Navy, incidentally, had introduced a digital camouflage-pattern uniform last year to replace its earlier light-blue half-sleeve shirt and navy-blue trousers. The Army, Navy and IAF have different sets of uniforms to be worn on different occasions. While officers get Rs 20,000 as the annual “basic dress allowance”, which includes shoes, the other ranks get Rs 10,000. Any special clothing for high-altitude areas like the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region, submarines and the like is provided by the government. The change in the Army’s combat dress also comes in the backdrop of the defence ministry repeatedly asking all ministries and states to not allow their uniformed personnel to wear camouflage fatigues akin to the force. “This unnecessarily leads to false alarms that the Army has been deployed for crowd control or other law and order duties,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-to-sport-new-lighter-combat-uniform-from-january-15/articleshow/88038949.cms||---
---||India||Maharashtra may roll back some curbs for flyers after Centre objects||MUMBAI: A day after Maharashtra introduced stringent air travel curbs in the backdrop of rising concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid, the Centre pointed out that the restrictions were “in divergence” with guidelines from the Union health ministry and urged the state to scale back its orders. In response, state health minister Rajesh Tope said his government will do away with the need for an RT-PCR negative report for fully vaccinated domestic travellers. “I spoke to the chief secretary and the CM, a revised notification will be issued,” Tope told TOI. However, officials said that the state was considering the proposal, but no decision has been taken yet. The BMC on Wednesday said curbs on international passengers will kick in from midnight of December 2. For domestic travellers from other states, it has extended validity of RT-PCR reports to 72 hours. In exceptional cases, testing may be allowed on arrival at Mumbai airport. The Maharashtra government on Tuesday issued curbs for domestic travellers and international passengers. The Centre has not objected to its plan to put passengers from countries at risk of spreading the Omicron variant in institutional quarantine for 7 days, but it flagged other restrictions in order “to align” the state and Centre’s rules. The state government has made it mandatory for international passengers arriving from at-risk countries (declared by the Centre) to undergo a seven-day institutional quarantine. Read AlsoCovid-19: Align state’s international travel norms with Centre’s, Maharashtra govt toldThe Centre on Wednesday asked Maharashtra government to align its international travel guidelines with those issued by it to ensure uniform implementation across the country. The Maharashtra government has imposed guidelines making RT-PCR testing mandatory for all international travellers at theThe passengers will be tested on the second, fourth and seventh day. The state has also made mandatory RT-PCR testing for all other international passengers and said they will undergo a 14-day home quarantine even if found negative. RT-PCR tests have been made mandatory for taking a connecting flight; only those who test negative will be allowed to board. In a letter to Maharashtra health secretary Pradeep Vyas, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan has written that these measures diverge from the SOPs and guidelines promulgated by the Centre. “I would, therefore, urge you to align the orders issued by the state with the guidelines issued by the ministry of health and family welfare, government of India, so that uniform implementation of the guidelines may be ensured across all states/UTs,” it said. State government officers said that they have received the letter and even as the rules may not be modified at the moment, a review will be taken by speaking to officials on the field, especially from cities like Mumbai and Pune where passenger traffic is high. Officials said as per rules, the state is within its rights to make the curbs more stringent keeping in mind the local situation. “Chief minister Thackeray is of the view that precautionary steps be taken to ensure that the spread of the new variant is prevented in the state,” said an official on condition of anonymity. “The letter received from the Centre is advisory in nature and as done on earlier occasions the government will come to a considered view after seeking the opinion of the municipal commissioner and district collectors. Although, we are conscious of the fact that some amount of convenience for the passengers may be desirable but that has to be done keeping in mind the large public interest issue of preventing the spread of the new variant of Covid-19. We have not closed our views on the issue and we will see the way the situation evolves,” Debashish Chakrabarty, who is currently handling the chief secretary’s duties, told TOI. Senior officials said the state was considering suspending flights from at-risk countries, but because they are not empowered to do so, they decided to add curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/maharashtra-may-roll-back-some-curbs-for-flyers-after-centre-objects/articleshow/88039111.cms||Bhavika Jain

Baldwin, who was holding a gun he was told was safe when it went off, spoke in his first full interview about the October 21 shooting in New Mexico.  "Well, the trigger wasn't pulled. I didn't pull the trigger," the actor told ABC television journalist George Stephanopoulos, according to the excerpt of the interview, which is to be broadcast on Thursday.  "So you never pulled the trigger," Stephanopoulos asked.  "No, no, no. I would never point a gun at anyone and pull a trigger at them. Never," Baldwin replied.  Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed and director Joel Souza was wounded in what Baldwin has previously called a tragic accident on the set of the Western movie he was making near Santa Fe.  Authorities in Santa Fe could not immediately be reached for comment on Baldwin's statement on Wednesday.  No criminal charges have been filed. Investigators have been focusing their efforts on how live ammunition found its way onto the set.  Baldwin says in the ABC interview that he had no idea how a live bullet got onto the set.  The actor, best known for playing an egotistical TV network executive on the TV comedy series "30 Rock," has kept a low profile since the accident at the Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe.  Baldwin, who was the star and also a producer on the low-budget Western, "went through in detail what happened on the set that day", Stephanopoulus said on Wednesday on ABC's "Good Morning America" show ahead of the broadcast.  "As you can imagine he's devastated but he was also very candid, he was very forthcoming. He answered every question," Stephanopoulos said.  Two crew members have filed civil lawsuits accusing Baldwin, the producers and others on the production of negligence and lax safety protocols. The producers have said they are conducting their own internal investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/alec-baldwin-on-fatal-movie-set-shooting-i-didnt-pull-the-trigger/articleshow/88039199.cms||---

The men had been booked for arson and loot. The communal clashes eventually resulted in the death of over 50 people and nearly 50,000 being rendered homeless. District government counsel Rajeev Sharma said, “Ashish, Naresh, Vinod, Surender and Narender have been acquitted as the witness turned hostile.” One Nanu, a resident of Bahawadi village in the district, had filed the case on September 8, 2013. In his police complaint, he said that an angry mob led by the five accused attacked his house and looted household goods, jewellery and domestic animals. The rioters then allegedly set his house on fire and fled. Nanu said he somehow managed to escape. This is not the first instance in which courts have let off the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots cases for “lack of evidence”. In October, a local court had acquitted 20 men accused of brutally killing a man and then setting his house on fire after looting valuables. In the last eight years, over 1,100 people accused in about 100 cases of murder, rape, robbery and arson in connection with the riots have been acquitted for the same reason or due to witnesses turning hostile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muzaffarnagar-riots-5-let-off-for-lack-of-proof/articleshow/88039269.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Neeraj Das, alias Kola Lora, was to be produced in court during the day. Jorhat SP Ankur Jain said three cops in the vehicle trailing the one ferrying Neeraj were injured as the car crashed into a roadside wall after hitting him. This happened when the arrested youth, also being investigated for narcotics smuggling, was being taken to Nakachari in Mariani around 1.30am to show where he had hidden a suspected drugs consignment. “At Cinnamora, on the way to Mariani (19km from Jorhat), he jumped out of the back of the vehicle and the escort vehicle accidentally hit him. The driver of the escort vehicle then lost control and collided with a wall,” the SP said. “Neeraj was rushed to Jorhat Medical College and Hospital along with three injured police personnel. He was declared dead on arrival.” While Neeraj, arrested on Tuesday morning, didn’t make it to court, seven of his 12 co-accused were remanded in police custody and the rest sent to jail.  There has been widespread outrage over Aasu leader Animesh Bhuyan’s lynching last Monday when he and two others were attacked by a mob following an argument over how an accident occurred. Animesh and the other two youths — Mridusmanta Baruah and Pranay Datta — were apparently trying to help the accident victim but were instead blamed for it. Without directly referring to the circumstances of Neeraj's death, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma said, “Many have said that Assam police have done well. But I am not satisfied. Why have we pushed our society to a position where our boys kill our boys only? After the Jorhat incident, I think it is high time we introspect”. Sarma, who had given the police full authority to combat crime soon after taking over as CM, said the drive must continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-custody-assam-lynching-accused-killed-in-accident/articleshow/88039295.cms||Mukut Das
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BBMP engineer, truck driver arrested for pothole death||BENGALURU: A BBMP engineer and a truck driver were on Tuesday arrested for the death of a 21-year-old food-delivery executive, who fell off his gearless scooter while negotiating a pothole on Thanisandra main road and was run over by a goods truck on Saturday. The arrest of the civic employee comes amid outrage among citizens over the BBMP’s apathy in filling up potholes, which have been causing accidents with grievous and fatal consequences. The arrested are: S Savita, 34, assistant executive engineer, Mahadevapura zone, BBMP, and truck driver R Ravi, 31, of Bidarahalli, east Bengaluru. They have been booked under the IPC sections for rash and negligent driving and causing death due to negligence. “It was found that Savita had acted in sheer negligence by not filling up the pothole. The fatal accident was (the) result of the unattended pothole. In accordance with the guidelines of the court, we arrested Savita for causing death due to negligence,” joint commissioner (traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda said in a release. Youth lost his life due to civic officials’ failure: KinA yet-to-be-identified contractor has been named the third accused. Savita and Ravi have been released on station bail. Azeem Ahmed, a resident of Chikkabanavara, was on his way to deliver food and was riding towards Thanisandra from Hegdenagar when he came across a pothole around 1.30pm on Saturday. He lost balance and fell while negotiating the pothole. A goods truck coming behind hit him. A seriously injured Ahmed was shifted to a private hospital where he succumbed in the evening. The bereaved family members are in a daze, four days after the youth’s death. “The pothole was responsible for the accident. When I visited the accident spot, locals told me it was the third accident in two days. Azeem lost his life due to the civic officials’ failure,” a relative told TOI. “His father passed away a few years ago. He and his elder brother began working to run the four-member family,” the relative said. The youngest of the three brothers is a college student. “I don’t see any big outcome from the engineer’s arrest as the BBMP knows how to fight the case. Such officials should be summarily dismissed. They join BBMP to make money and forget their real service,” the relative said. Spot couldn’t be considered pothole, says BBMPThe BBMP, however, has said the spot where the accident occurred could not be considered a pothole. Responding to six queries sent in by police, the BBMP said buffer zone works were under way at the accident spot and wet mix had been laid to ensure smooth movement of traffic. The buffer zone is a spatial provision for the utilities to lay wires and cables. “We suspect that the victim applied brake suddenly, causing the vehicle to skid. The truck driver, who was driving in a rash and negligent manner, rammed him,” the civic body stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-engr-truck-driver-arrested-for-pothole-death/articleshow/88039324.cms||---

According to the revised travel guidelines, only those coming from ‘countries at risk’ notified by the Centre will have to undergo Covid-19 tests at the port of entry. If their test results are negative, they will stay in home quarantine for a week. These passengers will be tested again on the eighth day. The countries at risk (as on Tuesday) are European nations, South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel. Passengers coming from other countries (not at risk) will not be subjected to RT-PCR tests. Tests on 2% of flyers from 'safe' nationsHowever, 2% of the flight passengers, identified bythe airlines, will be subjected to random testing at the airport. State health officials said this is in line with the Union government's guidelines. According to the revised rule, all international passengers have to upload a negative RT-PCR report not older than 72 hours on Air Suvidha portal before boarding the flight. They will have to undergo thermal screening and show the self-declaration form at the airport on arrival. On landing, the passengers have to bear the cost of testing. The state government had on Tuesday said passengers from all countries would be subjected to tests and they would have to mandatorily undergo home quarantine for seven days.

A circular posted on the KEA website dated November 11 reads: “As per directions of the government, Rs 10,000 as ‘other fees’ has been added to the already announced tuition fees of Rs 23,810 in government engineering colleges. Hence, the total fees to be paid with regard to allotment to government engineering colleges is Rs 33,810.” However, vice-chancellor of Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karisidappa, said it is not a hike in fees, but only a streamlining of existing fees. “Earlier, students paid tuition fees at KEA and colleges charged extra fees for uniforms, textbooks, NSS, teacher welfare etc., which was paid at the college level. However, this year we have streamlined it and capped it at Rs 10,000. Students have to pay this too at KEA,” he said. KEA also shows a Rs 20,000 hike in fees for CET seats in aided and private engineering colleges. With this, the fees in unaided colleges is Rs 83,526 or Rs 90,060. It was earlier Rs 66,526 or Rs 70,000-odd. “This is the ‘other fees’ being charged by colleges at the college level. Some of them used to charge up to Rs 50,000. We wanted to streamline it and put a cap of Rs 20,000, and make it payable at KEA level. However, not every college charges Rs 20,000. Colleges have to show break-up of their fees to KEA and collect only their fees,” he added. There is nothing yet in the public domain on what each college can charge as ‘other fees’ this year. The ‘other fees’ is apart from skill lab fees, which is optional. Skill lab fees can be Rs 20,000, Rs 15,000, Rs 10,000 or Rs 5,000, depending on the facilities. Around 100 colleges are not charging any such fees. Despite clear instructions not to charge extra ‘other fees’ at the college level, many institutions are still doing so, allege students who took seats after the first round of counselling. “The student community is reeling under the terrible effects of Covid-19 and the lockdown. Many students have become wage workers. Many have been kept away from higher education... Coffee plantations and agricultural fields faced severe loss due to heavy rain, which tremendously affected students who come from farming families. Now, this fee hike has come as a severe shock. This is highly anti-student and anti-education. The government must roll back the fee hike and resume the earlier structure for all students,” read a statement from All India Democratic Students Union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cet-students-upset-as-feesat-kea-go-up-by-10k-20k/articleshow/88039333.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

In 2022, CIOs in India will build on renewed interest in technology from the business to gain funding for new IT projects.”Indian CIOs are expected to increase their spending towards projects that drive innovation and modernising legacy systems. Hiring a workforce that can deliver on these needs will also be a key priority. Next year, Indian CIOs are seen to be prioritising a move away from rigid and monolithic ways of doing business to a more composable business and IT architecture where they will be able to better respond to disruptions.All segments of IT spending in India are expected to grow next year, with software emerging as the highest growing segment. Spending on software is forecast to total $10.5 billion in 2022, up 14.4% from 2021. While experiencing a slower growth rate than 2021, spending on software in 2022 is forecast to be nearly double of what it was pre-pandemic.As hybrid work adoption increases in India, there will be an uptick in spending on devices in 2022, reaching $44 billion, an increase of 7.5% from 2021. “The growth in devices is a combination of two components – hybrid work and pent-up demand from 2020 for device upgrades,” said Roy. “Spending on devices will make up 43% of total IT spending next year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/indias-software-spending-is-surging-says-gartner/articleshow/88039354.cms||---

The investment bank will also extend 20 days of paid family care leave for the loss of a family member, and five days of paid leave for loss of non-immediate family members.It has introduced a new sabbatical programme to either spend time with family, travel, volunteer, or just take a break. Under this, it will provide six weeks of unpaid leave for employees with 15 years of service, and will provide an additional two weeks for every five years of service at the firm thereafter.“We’re focused on delivering energy optimisation, resilience, and mental health programmes that support our people in caring for themselves and their families. These new and enhanced benefits are the latest part of providing an environment where our people can continue to thrive personally and professionally,” said Bentley de Beyer, head of human capital management at Goldman Sachs.Goldman Sachs Services in India is the investment bank’s second-largest office after New York. It has over 7,000 employees in its Bengaluru office and more than 350 in its Hyderabad centre. The new benefits provide for a 4-week paid family care leave benefit for care of family members due to serious illness, military deployment or foster placement. Two years ago, the bank announced equal parental leave time of 26 weeks for men and women. A Pathways to Parenthood initiative was launched to assist with the expenses associated with adoption, egg retrieval, egg donation, and surrogacy.

---||Bengaluru||Simplilearn buys back staff shares worth ₹49cr||Bengaluru: Digital skilling platform Simplilearn has bought back employee shares worth Rs 48.7 crore. The buyback, the company's first, was part of the recent investment by private equity firm Blackstone. Blackstone invested $250 million to acquire a majority stake in the Bengaluru-based venture.“Having launched our ESOPs (employee stock option plans) in 2012, this was an ideal time to offer liquidity on the same. All our active employees had the option to sell 25% of their vested equity at the same price at which investors made an exit. For those who sold as part of the process, we gave them new grants too. Many times, companies buy employee stock options at a discount compared to the price at which investors exit. In our case, it was the same price,” Krishna Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Simplilearn, said. The company bought back the options at Rs 63,500 a piece. Some of the earliest employees had received the options at as low as Rs 10 a piece. Those who were granted options about four years ago got them at Rs 11,600 each. Once an employee leaves the firm, she has a 5-year window to exercise the options. The returns for the employees have been fabulous. But not all of it comes to the employees, since there are substantial taxes on these earnings.A number of new-age ventures have been buying back employee stock options as a way to reward them. Recently, online meat delivery company Licious said that starting January, all its eligible employees will have their ESOPs vested daily. They will also have the option of anytime liquidation of ESOPs with no terms and conditions.Simplilearn provides online courses in areas such as AI, data, full-stack, cloud, and digital marketing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/simplilearn-buys-back-staff-shares-worth-49cr/articleshow/88039359.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: No decision taken yet on leaning police quarters near Binny Mills land||BENGALURU: It has been over a month since a seven-storey apartment built for police personnel near the erstwhile Binny Mills land, Magadi Road, was found to be leaning by about 1.5ft, forcing 32 families to evacuate. However, it continues to stand in the same precarious position today, posing a threat to the adjacent quarters. On October 16, B block of the police quarters, occupied since 2018, was found leaning to the right. The occupants are now living in another police quarters, at Annapoorneshwari Nagar near Nagarbhavi. A technical committee carried out preliminary examination of the structure and adjudged its foundation had sunk. It recommended regular monitoring of the cracks and deflections and pointed out that the subsoil strata and superstructure should be examined. There are no new cracks in the walls and the structure has not leaned further, police said. “Had it leaned any further, the occupants of C block would have been evacuated,” a source said. Another cop said experts have made multiple visits and carried out tests, but nothing more has happened. Asked whether B block could be demolished, he said, “The expert panel has not said anything on demolition. Since there are blocks adjacent to it, demolition is not easy. We are waiting for the report of the technical evaluation committee and other experts. A two-page preliminary report on the findings has reached senior IPS officers. There has been communication with Karnataka State Police Housing Corporation and they will make the future plans.” ASN Murthy, additional director-general of police, KSPHCL, did not respond to queries on the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-decision-taken-yet-on-leaning-police-quarters/articleshow/88039338.cms||---

But only 235 drivers have got their meters calibrated so far. The city has around 1.3 lakh autos. Transport department and legal metrology department officials said they have given auto drivers time till February 2022 to recalibrate meters. “We calibrated 235 meters on Wednesday. These are mainly auto drivers who bought new meters. We are expecting drivers to recalibrate existing old ones Thursday onwards and get them certified from the department,” said Kumar MS, assistant controller of legal metrology (technical). The minimum auto fare increased from Rs 25 (for the first 1.9km) to Rs 30 (for 2km). For every additional kilometre, fare went up from Rs 13 to Rs 15. C Sampath, general secretary, Adarsh Auto Drivers’ Union, admitted that auto drivers with old meters are yet to recalibrate them according to the revised fare. “A driver will have to pay Rs 350 to the legal metrology department to get a certificate that the meter is recalibrated. In addition to this, meter manufacturers/dealers charge an amount for repairs. However, that rate is yet to be fixed. There should be some clarity by Thursday and all drivers have been asked to carry fare charts.” Many passengers complained that auto drivers were charging more than the government-mandated fare. However, neither traffic police nor the transport department conducted enforcement drives on Wednesday. “Normally, traffic police and transport department conduct special raids once the fare is revised but no such inspections are being done here now. Most drivers are now seeking Rs 50 as minimum fare. None of them is ready to ply by meter,” said Sanjay S, a commuter in KR Puram. Another passenger, Veena S, said: “This fare revision is just an eyewash. No driver has a new fare chart either. It’s high time authorities enforced these fares. Otherwise, people will look for alternatives.” There’s a 50% premium on night rides (from 10pm to 5am). While there’s no waiting charge for the first five minutes, it’s Rs 5 for every 15 minutes. There’s no luggage charge for up to 20kg, and it’s Rs 5 per kg beyond the threshold. A commuter can carry a maximum of 50kg on an auto ride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/few-auto-meters-calibrated-users-complain-of-overcharging/articleshow/88039344.cms||---

While the first round of allotment for engineering is over, the second is likely to happen by December 15. However, if NEET counselling doesn’t take place before the second round of CET counselling, students are likely to find themselves on a shaky ground since colleges they’ll be allotted are likely to change as many allottees may switch to medical courses later. The counselling for NEET-PG has hit a hurdle as the Supreme Court is hearing a case on the validity of Rs 8 lakh as the limit to avail Economically Weaker Section quota. The government has sought time till January to respond to it, when the hearing will be held. “Counselling for NEET UG generally happens after NEET PG. We can start our counselling here after the central agency conducts it for the All-India quota. Therefore, there is uncertainty over the date when we can conduct our counselling. They have to give us directions,” said director for medical education PG Girish. Officials say the counselling may happen only after January. The seat matrix for MBBS is also not yet ready. “Some new colleges are coming up and some are getting their seats enhanced. November 27 was the last date for sending proposals for the same. Every day, there are changes in the matrix. We have to wait for a few more days to get the entire picture,” he added. Karnataka Examinations Authority that holds counselling for both engineering and NEET said it is likely to announce second round counselling for engineering seats by December 15. “We are trying to accommodate NEET first round before engineering second round. We are making all efforts. Since this is not in the hands of the state government, we will have to see,” said Ramya, executive director, KEA. ComedK said it will go ahead with both rounds of counselling. “Without medical seats being finalised, whatever is done for engineering is useless. The moment a student gets a medical seat, he or she is going to jump. However, we cannot wait for NEET counselling to get over as AICTE has issued an order that all admissions should be done by November 30, which was over on Tuesday. It was not possible as both CET and ComedK could complete only one round of counselling. It is up to the government on how they will legalise these admissions now. We will be conducting the second round with the rider that it is subject to the interpretation of Supreme Court,” said Dr S Kumar, executive secretary of Comedk. Students said it’s a trying time. “There is no clarity on where we are going. We understand that Covid is beyond our control. But things like reservation could have been avoided,” said a student awaiting NEET counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/lack-of-clarity-on-neet-counsellingdates-leaves-engg-aspirants-in-a-fix/articleshow/88039335.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

To the surprise of doctors, the tumour weighed 7.5kg. The woman, who was experiencing continuous weight gain and progressive distension of the abdomen over a period of six months, visited Fortis Hospital, Bannerghatta Road for a routine check up-on November 15. Barring abnormal weight gain, there were no other evident symptoms of the tumour growing inside her. The woman was diagnosed with the non-malignant tumour; ultrasound scan and investigation showed that there was a cystic growth measuring 28x25x20 cm. Doctors advised immediate surgical removal of the tumour owing to its weight and the threat it posed to the patient’s health. “An extensive major surgery was required to remove the tumour. We decided to go ahead with laparotomy, which was straightforward and uncomplicated,” said Dr Manisha Singh, senior consultant gynaecologist, Fortis Hospital. Laparotomy is a surgical procedure where small incisions are made through the abdominal wall to gain access into the abdominal cavity. During the procedure on November 22, the doctors removed the 7.5kg benign tumour and the woman was discharged four days later. According to the medical team that treated her, this is the heaviest tumour they have surgically removed so far. “Women over the age of 40 should go for annual check-ups, including breast check-up and ultrasound scans to detect abnormalities, if any. In her case, the tumour could have become malignant and difficult to operate on if diagnosis and treatment had been delayed,” said Dr Singh. It is important for all women to engage in preventive health check-ups and get themselves scanned, the doctor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/43-yr-old-woman-gets-rid-of-7-5kg-ovarian-tumour/articleshow/88039347.cms||---

Reason: The new Covid-19 protocol that kicked in for passengers from countries categorised “at risk” in the wake of concerns over Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Airport authorities said that a high volume of passengers caused delays in Covid testing at the terminal and they have addressed the issue. With the state government initially making it mandatory for all international passengers to undergo Covid-19 testing at the airport post arrival from December 1, chaos set in at KIA’s arrival terminals 12am onwards. One of the first flights to touch down after the new rules came into effect at midnight was Air India AI 182 from Frankfurt to Bengaluru, which landed at 12.53am. The rules were modified on Wednesday. Davanagere residents Naveen Andanur and Pooja Naveen, who landed with their four-year-old son, were shocked to be caught in the jostle for Covid tests. “There was only one counter and over 500 people waiting to get tested. There was no social distancing; people were scrambling for their turn and the staff were struggling,” said Naveen, a design engineer with an automotive company in Germany. Software engineer Anusha Annagowni, 30, who arrived on British Airways flight BA 119 from Glasgow via Heathrow, termed the experience ‘hideous’. “There was no crowd management and there was one booth for over 200 passengers, where tests were conducted. The area where people were waiting for the results was packed and there was no adequate seating arrangement. People with small children were seen struggling as there was no arrangement even for drinking water,” the Ananthapur resident said. Many passengers who landed from Germany, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe that have been flagged as “at-risk countries” for Omicron variant, complained of lack of communication among the airport ground staff. There were no signages to inform passengers about the revised rules they needed to follow. “The ground staff were clueless and outnumbered and the testing zone was jampacked and utterly mismanaged,” said Arvind N, who landed from England. Airport sources said the crowding was because one flight got delayed and it coincided with a few other arrivals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/crowding-chaos-as-mandatory-covid-test-stumps-intl-flyers-arriving-at-kia/articleshow/88039361.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||Passengers fume at tedious testing system at Bengaluru airport||BENGALURU: Cumbersome Covid testing procedures at KIA is giving a hard time to passengers travelling from high-risk countries. While foreign returnees with hardly any cellphone internet data have to wait for an email alert about the test results, priority is allegedly being given to Indian currency holders for rapid RT-PCR tests. Devasandra resident Nirupama, 27, executive with a pharmaceutical firm in the Netherlands, arrived on Lufthansa flight LH 754 from Amsterdam via Frankfurt at 3.02am on Wednesday. “The ground staff gave no briefing to passengers on how or where to head for Covid testing and there were no signs,” she said. With rapid RT-PCR tests costing Rs 3,000 per person, she claimed passengers with Indian currency were given preference over many carrying international credit cards or opting for online payments. “Many like me who are coming to India after two years due to the pandemic situation didn’t have Indian currency and the testing counter was not accepting foreign cards or even online payment,” she said. Auriga Research Private Limited, the sole agency conducting Covid tests at KIA, saw their website crashing on Wednesday, possibly due to hundreds accessing the portal. Their helpline for passengers to pre-book RT-PCR test remained ineffective for hours, much to the annoyance of disembarking flyers. There was more trouble in store for those overseas passengers who didn’t have Indian sim cards and had to use 45 minutes of free internet data option provided by KIA. “We were told to check our emails for the rapid RT-PCR test results and we had the free WiFi running out as the waiting period stretched up to two hours. Thereafter, we had to run to another end of the terminal to collect a printout of our test results, but the counter was already full of people,” said Nikhil, a Vijayanagara resident who landed with family at KIA. Those who had connecting flights to catch were left fuming, thanks to the chaos and mismanagement. Only those with prints of the negative results were allowed to exit the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/passengers-fume-at-tedious-testing-system/articleshow/88039365.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Guard among 7 held for robbing gold biscuits worth Rs 2.5 crore in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Seven men, including a watchman of Attica Gold, were arrested recently by two police teams for allegedly robbing a bullion trader of 5,593 grams of gold biscuits worth over Rs 2.5 crore on 22nd Cross, Cubbonpet, on the night of November 19. Police have recovered gold biscuits weighing around 4,984 grams and worth around Rs 2.3 crore from the gang. The accused are Mohammad Farhan, 23 of Sarvajnanagar, Mohammed Hussain, 35, of Nagawar Main Road, Mohammed Arif, 34 and Anjum, 39, both residents of Venkateshapura, Shahid Ahmed, 24, of Kushalanagar, Umesh, 54, of RT Nagar and Suhail Baig, 24, of Govindapura. Police said Umesh was a security guard at Attica Gold office on Queens Road and allegedly played a major role in the robbery. According to police, around 8.30pm on November 19, Siddeshwar Haribha Shinde, 32, who runs bullion trade in the name of Samskar Enterprises on Bettappa Lane in Nagarthpet, and his employee Srikanth Jadhav visited Attica Gold office on Queens Road. The duo purchased gold weighing 5,593 grams and were returning to their shop on Shinde’s scooter. Around 9.20pm, two miscreants followed them on a bike and tried to intercept them at 22nd Cross. One of the miscreants took out a machete and swung it at Shinde, who ducked and escaped from being hit. However, he lost control of his scooter and fell on the road. Another miscreant got on to the scooter and rode away with the gold. Ulsoor Gate police registered a case of robbery and MN Anucheth, DCP (central), formed two special teams headed by Najma Farooqi, assistant commissioner of police (Ulsoor Gate sub-division) and Ulsoor Gate police inspector CV Deepak to crack the case. Probe revealed the seven accused ganged up a year ago and in 2020 attempted to rob gold near Vidhana Soudha. They failed and were waiting for another chance. Umesh reportedly tipped off his fellow accused about Shinde leaving Attica Gold office with gold worth a few crores. The six other miscreants swung into action and succeeded in robbing the gold. Police collected CCTV footage from Attica Gold till up to the point where the robbery took place. Cops learnt the gang was following Shinde and identified the two who committed the crime as Farhan and Hussain. Police commissioner Kamal Pant applauded the police teams and gave them Rs 70,000 as reward.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/guard-among-7-held-for-robbing-gold-biscuits-worth-2-5cr/articleshow/88039367.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||2017 diary case: HC quashes proceedings against I-T dept||Bengaluru: In the infamous diary case of 2017 pertaining to senior Congress leaders, the high court has quashed the FIR as well as further proceedings against the income tax department, placing reliance upon the specific bar contained under sections 293 and 138(2) of Income Tax Act.Based on a complaint from Congress MLC K Govindaraj, Indiranagar police had registered the FIR on February 28, 2017 and also sent a notice to the IT department on April 13, 2017 under section 91 of CrPC to produce the diary that was seized during a search on March 15, 2016. The director general of income tax (investigation), principal director of investigation and principal commissioner of income tax (all in Bengaluru) had challenged the FIR and the proceedings.“It is rather shocking that what the complainant wants is the diary and what police want to secure from the petitioners is also the diary. No other document is required by police for probing the allegations of offences, which run into 15 in number, but only the diary. It cannot but be held that the third respondent (Indiranagar police) was acting at the behest of the complainant to secure the diary by invoking section 91 of CrPC, thereby summoning the diary. Since the FIR couldn’t have been registered against the petitioners in view of the specific bar under section 293 of the Act, the aftermath of such registration would be rendered without authority of law,” Justice M Nagaprasanna observed while allowing the petition.The judge has also negated the argument put forward on behalf of the complainant that the writ petition is not maintainable as nobody is named in the FIR. It was pointed out that the ulterior motive in registration of the FIR is seen in subsequent proceedings, which indicated police wanted to probe the act of search and seizure done by the petitioners, as found in the communications sent to the IT department.The petitioners had contended that under section 293 of I-T Act 1995, there is a clear bar regarding entertaining of civil suits and also prosecuting any officer for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under the Act. They claimed that section 138(2) of the Act bars disclosure of information related to I-T assessees on certain occasions and city police have no jurisdiction in view of the bar under section 293 .Further, the department had asserted that the diary was seized from his (Govindaraj’s) bedroom as per law in the presence of his wife and other family members during their raid on March 15, 2016. The department claimed it had confronted several persons with the contents of the diary and that Govindaraj himself had copies as it was supplied to him after being scanned and the department had not leaked it to anybody.The petitioners said the notice issued by Bengaluru city police for securing the diary appears to be an attempt to hamper investigation by the I-T department owing to political pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/2017-diary-case-hc-quashes-proceedings-against-i-t-dept/articleshow/88039368.cms||---

As such, we do not find any justification in handing over the reserve to BBMP. We, therefore, quash the impugned notification and direct the forest department to look after it,” the bench said. It asked the government to release Rs 25 lakh, which has been allotted to carry out pending works in the reserve and ensure proper maintenance and development to preserve birds, their young ones, eggs, nest. A direction was issued to BWSSB to take adequate measures to prevent/stop leakage of sewage into the reserve for the safety of flora and fauna. The petitioners contended that in April 2015, Puttenahalli lake had been declared a bird conservation reserve and the move to hand it over to BBMP was not only illegal but also could harm the environment. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/forest-dept-to-look-after-puttenahalli-lake-bird-conservation-reserve-hc/articleshow/88039369.cms||---

Tejashwi made the demand a day after Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai said in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that the central government had not ordered conducting caste census in the country, other than that of the constitutionally backed Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. Incidentally, earlier this year, after Rai told the Lok Sabha that the central government did not favour general caste census, Tejashwi had met Nitish, who later led a delegation of 11 parties and met PM Narendra Modi on the issue. However, PM Modi did not say anything on it, even though he heard the CM on the issue. Later, Nitish had said his government would first look into its feasibility in the light of legal and constitutional aspects of it, and only then take any concrete decision on holding the caste census in the state. “First, the CM said the government will hold an all-party meeting after the byelections to the two assembly seats with regard to holding the caste census with its own resources. But he has not made any efforts in this direction till now,” Tejashwi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-should-announce-caste-census-tejas/articleshow/88037180.cms||Abhay Singh

Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, took a jibe at the state government for empty liquor bottles found on the premises of state legislature. He said the number of bottles were being counted, instead of investigating as to how these bottles reached there. “They are coming up with stunning things. Had they worked on prohibition seriously, they would have not been ashamed,” said Tejashwi. His mother and former chief minister Rabri Devi also demonstrated outside the legislature building over illegal liquor trade in Bihar. In the legislative council, RJD MLC Rambali Singh demanded the House adjournment. Sharing a data of National Family Health Survey-5, Singh said 15% of the state population was consuming liquor, while in Maharashtra, the percentage was less than in Bihar. “This is the mockery of prohibition. It is a shame that liquor bottles have been recovered from the premises of Vidhan Sabha,” he said. JD(U) MLC Neeraj Kumar asked Singh to tell who had informed them about the empty bottles. “After getting the information, did you call on the toll-free number or the number released by KK Pathak? You did not fulfil your responsibility,” said Neeraj. Without naming anyone, he said an RJD leader’s son was found in a drunken state, but the party has taken no action yet. Singh then reminded Neeraj of liquor bottles seized from a school run by the brother of a cabinet minister. Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra raised the issue of increase in crime in Madhubani district and mentioned several incidents, including assault on a judge in Jhankharpur by the cops, murder of scribe Avinash Jha, who had exposed the fake hospitals and dead body of a girl Gulshan recovered from officer’s colony in Madhubani. MLC Sanjeev Shyam Singh raised the issue of increase in air pollution in different towns of Bihar. BJP MLC Sanjay Prakash alias Sanjay Mayukh backed Singh and asked the government to take this issue seriously.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/opposition-mocks-govt-over-recovery-of-alcohol-bottles-on-house-premises/articleshow/88037478.cms||---

It was declared a Covid-dedicated hospital during the second wave of the pandemic that hit the country in March and April this year. The GM, who visited the Khagaul-based railway hospital recently, instructed the doctors and the employees to stay on high alert and take appropriate measures to fight the new variant with courage and patience. “The doctors and the healthcare workers had shown admirable restraint during the second wave of Covid-19 and fulfilled their duties sincerely. The frontline workers of the ECR, including station masters, loco pilots and guards, had also worked hard,” Sharma said. During his visit, the GM inspected the oxygen plant installed on the premises of the railway hospital. He also visited different wards to check the infrastructure and interacted with the patients. Later, he honoured 52 ‘corona warriors’ of Danapur division and gave them certificates and cash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/doctors-of-danapur-hospital-asked-to-stay-on-high-alert/articleshow/88036722.cms||---

Soon therafter, five persons came and fired several rounds at Shagir,” Alam said. He said at least seven persons, including Firoz, were involved in the killing. “All the accused fled. Police suspect that two or three pistols were used in the killing as two types of empty cartridges were recovered from the spot,” the in-charge said. He said Shagir was pressurising Firoz to help him get back the money he had lent to his associates. Alam said Shagir’s father has lodged an FIR against seven persons, including Firoz, and mentioned financial dispute as the reason for his son’s murder.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan imposes new travel rules at Jaipur airport over Omicron scare||JAIPUR: Following the guidelines issued by the Centre in the wake of emergence of highly infectious Omicron, a new Covid variant, health department officials met Jaipur airport authorities and implemented the guidelines at the airport at midnight on Wednesday. At the airport, a sample collection area, rapid RT-PCR Covid-19 test facility and a sample processing lab have been created. “We met airport authorities and now we are ensuring that the fresh guidelines issued by the Centre should be followed,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). World Health Organisation has declared recently reported variant B.1.1.529, termed Omicron variant, as Variant of Concern (VoC). For the purpose, the strict and effective measures to control the entry of VoC into the country and prevent the spread of transmission within, the health department is taking measures by following the Centre’s guidelines. The health department will ensure that if an international traveller tests positive, his samples will be sent for whole genome sequencing to ensure that he is not infected with Omicron variant of Covid. Officials said they had intensified surveillance across the state for identifying cases early. Also, focus will be on encouraging people for wearing masks, frequent hand sanitisation and ensure Covid appropriate behaviour, especially in areas where large public gathering is expected, as these are the key to protection against any variant of the Covid. The state reported 21 new infections on Wednesday taking the overall tally to 9,54,806. The state’s casualty count stands at 8,955. The active cases have now surpassed 200 mark after a long time as the figure touched 203. Out of 203, 115 active cases are in Jaipur. Ten cases were reported from Jaipur, two cases each were reported from Nagaur, Jodhpur, Alwar and one case each was reported from Ajmer, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Sikarand and Udaipur.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: In-flying passengers try to make sense of changing rules||KOLKATA: The alarm over the variant of concern that has led to India declaring fresh measures to shield itself from the virus has left travellers from countries that have been labelled ‘at-risk’, as well as others, confused. Travellers from the US, France, the UK, Singapore and elsewhere who are set to visit Kolkata for Christmas break called their family members in the city or travel agents to seek clarity in the absence of a central database that they can check for answers. “With countries now reinforcing restrictions on travel and putting in place safeguards, I want to know whether I can travel to Kolkata via Delhi as originally scheduled and whether I will require to get RT-PCR tested on arrival and quarantine thereafter,” said Mahuya Paul, a professor at a US university who is set to reach India on December 9. Her travel agent has told her that, as of now, there is no requirement for mandatory RT-PCR test for travellers arriving from the US or of quarantine thereafter. However, authorities at the port of entry, Delhi in her case, could ask her to get a Covid test done at her cost on arrival since the latest guidelines for international arrivals mandates RT-PCR tests on 2% passengers in each flight from countries other than those labelled ‘at risk’. For passengers arriving from the 11 countries labelled ‘at risk’, the confusion is greater. A person with Twitter profile Raja Babu wrote: “Can we have rapid PCR testing available for arrival at Kolkata airport please? Waiting for 6 hrs for result is too long.” Sarit Roy from Singapore has a similar issue. “Called Kolkata airport. They said PCR test on arrival and 5-6 hours wait for the results! We were to fly with an 11-month-old infant! Now rethinking the whole trip. How does a 5-6 hour wait make sense over home quarantine? Are safe-distancing measures even good enough to do this?” he posted. Though there is a rapid PCR facility available at Kolkata airport and is used by passengers departing for UAE where a Covid test is required within four hours prior to travel, passengers coming from ‘at risk’ countries must undertake an RT-PCR test, an airport official said. Another user with the profile name Protagonist Dev enquired: “I have a query for a family member who will be travelling to Guwahati via Kolkata from Singapore on December 8. After testing negative at Kolkata airport, can the person undertake the onward journey to Guwahati and maintain the home quarantine in Guwahati?” The notification from Union ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday said such a person can travel onward and be quarantined in Guwahati, but will be required to get re-tested for Covid on the eighth day after arrival.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-flying-passengers-try-to-make-sense-of-changing-rules/articleshow/88037821.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

While for some, the projects have been delayed, others have decided to go ahead with a restricted expansion in a desperate bid to enhance revenues. Yet others have stuck to their original expansion plan, taking the pandemic to be the right opportunity to enhance investment despite the barriers of logistics and funds. Belle Vue Clinic had announced a massive expansion plan in 2019 that was deferred. It was to build two hospitals in New Town—a 400-bed multi-speciality hospital and a 168-bed general hospital. Both were to be inaugurated in 2023. But Covid has pushed back the projects by three years. “Due to the pandemic, we could not begin construction work last year, as had been planned. Now, there has been a sharp escalation in construction material cost, which has forced us to redraw the projects and invite fresh tenders. The project cost has been revised and we are working out the details. We hope to be able to start construction early next year and complete the hospitals by 2025-26,” said Belle Vue CEO P Tondon. Peerless Hospital is ready to add a new unit at its existing premises off E M Bypass that will be shortly announced. According to hospital officials, Covid-induced rise in expenditure and revenue loss over the past 20 months have forced the hospital to think of ways to augment earnings. “In the prevailing situation, no hospital can afford to sit back and wait for things to get normal. Over the last year and half, it has been a roller- coaster ride for us with Covid patients swelling with the first and second waves and revenue from non-Covid treatment taking a hit. We need to expand, not only in terms of the number of beds but in other services as well," said a Peerless official. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has decided to go ahead with its Rs 600-crore expansion plan that includes new units in Kolkata, Siliguri and Ranchi. The group also plans to buy a hospital in Kolkata or in any other eastern city. The new Medica units include a 200-bed oncology centre in Kolkata and a 100-bed general unit at its Siliguri hospital, apart from two 50-bed oncology units at Ranchi and Siliguri. “We are going to invest Rs 600 crore on expansion over the next one-two years. This is the right time to invest despite the pandemic and the challenges it poses. The healthcare market, in fact, will now expand due to the pandemic and we see a lot more spending on health over the next four years. While people have lost lives and have become cautious, the government, too, has realized the importance of health investment and introduced schemes, like Swasthya Saathi, that will encourage a demand for private healthcare services,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. He added that health insurance now has a lot more takers. Medica’s new units in Kolkata and Siliguri will be functional by April, 2020, while the Ranchi unit will get off the blocks in September. Woodlands Hospital is setting up a 100-bed advanced cancer unit. “We didn’t face any major delay or stoppage of work due to Covid,” said Rupali Basu, MD & CEO, Woodlands. Ruby General Hospital chose to expand its existing 268-bed unit on E M Bypass despite Covid and the logistical difficulties that it posed. It has added 38 beds and will eventually have 356 beds by next year. “The project was announced before the onset of pandemic and we decided to go ahead with it. We needed to expand irrespective of the pandemic,” said Ruby general manager-operations Subhashish Datta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-forces-hospitals-to-rejig-expansion-plans/articleshow/88037857.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Ahmedabad||In 14 days, Gujarat serial rapist gets jail till death||AHMEDABAD: Less than a month after the offence was registered, a special Pocso court in Gandhinagar on Wednesday sentenced a 26-year-old man to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of a three-year-old girl, after completing the trial in two weeks. The crimes perpetrated by the serial predator had shocked the state capital when he was accused of three rapes including the murder of the 3-year-old girl. Citing the two other offences of rape against Vijay Thakor, a resident of Vansjada village, the prosecution demanded capital punishment for him for the heinous crime. Special judge S N Solanki, however, sentenced Thakor to imprisonment till his last last breath. Thakor faces two more trials for rape under provisions of Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act in the same court. On November 6, the parents of the victim, both casual labourers, approached Santej police and complained that their three-year-old daughter had been kidnapped the previous night from their makeshift shanty near Khatraj crossroads. Two days earlier, the police had received a complaint of abducton and rape from the parents of a five-year-old from Rancharda village. Two days later on November 7, Thakor was arrested. After Thakor’s arrest, he confessed to three crimes during custodial interrogation. In eight days flat, investigators filed chargesheet accusing him of trespassing into the residence, abducting the child, raping her, strangling her and destruction of evidence. The court began recording evidence on November 17. There were eighteen witnesses examined in all, and their examination ended in four proceedings. On November 25, the court completed the recording of evidence and recorded Thakor’s statement under Section 313 of CrPC. The next day, final arguments in this case ended. Thakor’s advocate argued that the evidence against the accused was insufficient. Police arrested him merely because his name was written on his bike. He also contested the forensic evidence. On the other hand, the prosecution argued that CCTV footage from Arvind Mills reflected that he had parked his motorcycle near the scene of the offence. Forensic analysis of soil from the spot and mud found on the back of the child revealed that the offence had taken place at the alleged spot. Samples of semen and blood stains also confirmed Thakor’s involvement in the crime. After the court held Thakor guilty on Wednesday on all counts, the court heard the prosecution and Thakor’s advocate on sentencing. While Thakor’s advocate prayed for leniency citing his poor financial condition, the prosecutor demanded exemplary punishment for him, citing the gravity of the offence as well as the other offences he admitted to before the police. It was argued that Thakor is a married man and father to a seven-year-old daughter. After the court handed down life imprisonment to Thakor, prosecutor Sunil Pandya said, “This is a welcome verdict delivered in a record time. This is the result of excellent work put in by the investigators and the superintendent of police. This was a case of circumstantial evidence. We wanted death for him. We are going to approach the Gujarat high court to seek the death sentence.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect their privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/in-2-wks-gnagar-serial-rapist-gets-jail-till-death/articleshow/88037871.cms||---

Movie-goers on Wednesday were spoilt for choice with the premiere of Subhrajit Mitra’s ‘Avijatrik’ coinciding with Kamaleswar Mukherjee’s ‘Anusandhan’. It has been a long time since the city witness two Bengali film premieres clashing. “The good old days seem to be back. Two auditoriums are full of viewers and one could even do with a third one,” Mitra said. “Suddenly, the industry seems to be buzzing with activity. People are returning to the old rhythm,” said Mukherjee. Both ‘Anusandhan’ producer Ashok Dhanuka and ‘Avijatrik’ producer Gaurang Jalan agreed that the clash of premiere dates was coincidental. “It was during the exchange of invites that we learnt about the clash,” Jalan said. Describing the box-office collection of ‘Golondaaj’ encouraging, he added the industry was showing signs of “bouncing back”. Dhanuka, however, insisted that the industry had already bounced back. “The industry is back on track. Every week, some Hindi film or the other is being released at our theatres. Now that vaccinated people are spontaneously returning to theatres, we decided to release the two films we shot in England immediately after shooting resumed after the first wave,” he said. A still from 'Dharmajuddha'The next big clash in on January 21, when Dhanuka will release Sayantan Ghoshal’s ‘Swastik Sanket’, starring Nusrat Jahan, Gaurav Chakraborty, Shataf Figar and Rudranil Ghosh.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal board X tests from December 13 to 24||KOLKATA: After the Higher Secondary council asked state board schools to hold offline pre-boards tests for Class XII by year-end, West Bengal Board of Secondary Education on Wednesday directed similar tests be held for for Class X between December 13 and 24. Like the exams for Class XII students, the tests that Madhyamik candidates will take will also be of 50 marks for each paper and will be held on campuses. But individual schools can decide on the total marks on which the exam will be held. A few state-board schools in the city have already completed their offline exams for Class X. Taki House is among the state institutes that started offline exams for classes X and XII, even before the directives came from the council and board. While the teachers have already started evaluating Class X papers, XII pre-board tests began from November 29. St Lawrence High School started its offline tests for Class X on Wednesday and decided to bring the schedule for Class XII tests forward to December 8 after it received the council notification about the December-31 deadline. Principal Fr Francis Jimmy Keepuram said, “We had scheduled the Class XII offline test in January but after getting the council’s directive, we have decided to hold it from December 8. The exam will be completed by December 20, before Christmas.” Jadavpur Vidyapith started tests for classes XI and XII on Wednesday. “We are holding full-length exams. The council has set the full mark for each paper at 50 and we will stick to it,” said headmaster Parimal Bhattacharyya. Jodhpur Park Boys had postponed its offline tests for classes IX, X and XII, given their school will be taken over for KMC elections on December 19. But after receiving the exam notices, the authorities have decided to hold a meeting on Friday and decide how to conduct the offline tests for the board years within the deadlines set by the Madhyamik board and HS council. Jodhpur Park Boys headmaster Amit Sen Majumdar said, “We have a meeting of academic council on December 3, where we will take the final decision. We have already printed question papers of 80 marks each.” While Hare School will decide the exam schedule after a consultation with teachers, Bethune School plans to take offline tests by the stipulated date of December-end. Ballygunge Siksha Sadan has completed offline tests for classes IX and X and the exams for classes XI and XII will start from December 13. “Students will appear for full-length papers because they need to practise. But we will stick to 50 marks, according to the council directive,” said Sunita Sen, principal. The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education issued a clarification for HS pre-board exams. About subjects, like music, visual art and automobile, where the total theory marks cannot add up to 50, the council said those papers could be marked for less.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-board-x-tests-from-dec-13-to-24/articleshow/88037877.cms||---
---||Kolkata||International travel plans in limbo after Omicron bar, calls flood Kolkata travel agents’ offices||KOLKATA: Travel plans of hundreds booked on transit flights to North America, Australia and the Far East via Singapore are in jeopardy following the Centre’s decision to push back reopening of scheduled international flights from December 15 following the Omicron scare. Travel agents in the city were inundated with calls from clients and faced a barrage of queries on whether they could go ahead with the journey or cancel the flights. “We have booked several tickets for clients who connect onward to Australia or the US from Singapore. All of them are worried because if scheduled flights don’t operate, they will not be able to do a transit journey. In that case, they will have to stop in Singapore, which will require a visa, fulfilling the country's entry and quarantine norms and then travel on separate legs. All that will not only mean huge delays but also exponentially drive up costs,” said Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. Travellers used to prefer flights via the Gulf before Covid since they offered flexible options with more frequencies. The scenario has changed post-Covid with Emirates operating only three flights a week against 12-13 earlier and Qatar flying to Kolkata two times a week instead of daily. But with Singapore starting daily flights from November 29, passengers have opted for the airline to travel to US, Australia and destinations in East Asia. Homemaker Bhaswati Biswas, who took the Singapore Airlines flight on Wednesday, didn’t face any such anxiety as her final destination was Singapore. Her two-year-old daughter is travelling with her. “Travelling internationally has become a challenge, but we have to comply with norms,” she said. The flight left with 12 passengers from Kolkata while it had arrived with 75 from Singapore. All 75 will be quarantined. Those booked on Gulf flights are better off as Emirates and Qatar will continue to allow transit passengers. “There is no problem if one transits Dubai or Doha,” said Travel Agents Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has said it will notify its decision on the date for resumption of scheduled commercial international flights in due course. The Centre had hinted at a postponement on November 28 when it said it would take a decision on an effective date to resume flights after reviewing the evolving global scenario over concerns related to the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Scheduled international flights have remained suspended in India since March 23 last year due to the pandemic. However, special international passenger flights have been operating since July 2020 under air-bubble agreements with 31 countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/intl-travel-plans-in-limbo-after-omicron-bar-calls-flood-travel-agents-offices/articleshow/88037850.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The students and teachers harvested the paddy cultivated within the school compound in the presence of civic body leaders and locals. The school began paddy cultivation in the 25 cents on the compound in 2014 and students have been part of the cultivation at every stage under the supervision of school principal Fr Tomy Kochilanjickal. The paddy cultivated here was of the variety ‘Uma’ and on Wednesday around 130kg of paddy was harvested. CMI Provincial Fr Benny Nalkkara presided over the festival. The harvesting was inaugurated by Kottuvally panchayat president KS Shaji. Fr Kochilanjickal welcomed everyone to the function, which was felicitated by district panchayat member Sharon Panackal, Kottuvally agricultural officer Raihana and school administrator Fr Joby Kozhikkottu. “The aim of the project was to inculcate the values and importance of agriculture and nature in the students. The seeds were sowed in August amid the pandemic restrictions,” Fr Kochilanjickal said. School vice-principal Anila Alexander, headmistress Durga Purushotham, PTA president Sheela Joy, Kottuvally panchayat vicepresident Anija Viju, standing committee member Sebastian Thomas, ward member Biju Pazhampilly, etc. were also present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cmi-school-celebrates-paddy-harvest-festival/articleshow/88037649.cms||---

Activists say the lack of timely interventions to fight added infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia and meningitis is leading to maximum deaths not just in the state but nationally. Latest data shows that Maharashtra continues to record an average of 9,000 deaths in people living with HIV (PLHIV) every year, contributing to at least 15% of the AIDS fatalities seen in India annually. Between 2016-17 and 2021-22 (October), the state had recorded more than 47,000 (47086) deaths in HIV patients. After recording 9,124 deaths in 2017-18 and 9,754 deaths in 2019-20, a decline was registered in the Covid pandemic year (7,316). However, a lag in reporting is likely to be responsible for the dip. Nationally, nearly 59,000 AIDS-related deaths were estimated in 2019. The National Aids Control Organization (NACO) said in a report early this year that deaths had declined by 66% since 2010 and by 78% since attaining its peak in 2005. Ganesh Acharya, a TB and HIV activist, said the mortality numbers that had seen a steady decline have stagnated now for a variety of reasons. “A delay in diagnosis combined with a delay in enrolment in antiretroviral treatment stacks the odds against them,” he said. On World Aids Day observed on December 1, activists and civil organisations wrote to NACO stating that PLHIV are dying due to AIDS-related illnesses such as TB, pneumocystis pneumonia in the lungs, and cryptococcal meningitis, a painful fungal infection of the brain. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Foundation said NACO must strengthen preventive therapy for TB and pre-emptive therapy for cryptococcal meningitis as it protects PLHIVs with stage-3 or 4 diseases. The letter underlined that one-third of PLHIV still present for treatment when their white blood cell count (CD4) drops to less than 200 cells/mm. An analysis of 7,875 deaths by the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) in 2017 had shown that half of the deaths occurred within three months of ART initiation. “We found maximum deaths in those with CD4 count less than 100 during registration, meaning they enrolled in a very sick condition,” an MSACS official said. But the official said that maximum deaths are now seen in patients who have been on treatment for a while. “They are also dying of heart attack, cancer, diabetes, and not directly due to AIDS,” the official said, adding that with early diagnosis and treatment, PLHIVs can have an almost normal lifespan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/47000-aids-deaths-in-maharashtra-in-6-years-15-of-indias-toll/articleshow/88038939.cms||Sumitra Debroy

---||Ahmedabad||Nearly 40% of MBBS aspirants in Gujarat this year are repeaters!||AHMEDABAD: Anay Nanavati scored 487 out of 720 in NEET-UG 2020 but did not take admission in medicine. He slogged one whole pandemic year and appeared again in 2021 posting an impressive score of 618. By investing one year, Navanati not only has better chances of getting into top medical colleges in the state but also save lakhs in fees of his parents. “I took a drop as my NEET-UG score last year wasn’t nearly close to my year-round average, meaning I had significant room for improvement. I also didn’t want to burden my parents with payment of the hefty fees that private colleges demand. I'm happy my investment paid off,” said Nanavati. Nanavati is one among 9,331 out of 24,228 applicants for admission in medical, dental, ayurveda and homeopathy courses, 9,331 are of candidates who passed class 12 in 2020 or earlier. Effectively, this number comes to nearly 40%. The data was compiled by the Admission Committee for Professional Undergraduate Medical Educational Courses (ACPUGMEC) during the verification process for admission in 5,504 MBBS seats among other courses. Experts say the number of candidates adopting the repeat approach is growing for a solid reason. To study MBBS at a private college, the fees range from Rs 8 lakh to 14 lakh per year. Government colleges that need higher cut-off marks than most private colleges, have annual fees of about Rs 25,000. At GMERS colleges which are government trust run colleges, the annual fee is about Rs 3 lakh. Nanavati said he spent most of the 2021 appearing for mock tests which put him on a solid footing. “I wrote a total of 183 mock tests and countless other quizzes before taking NEET 2021,” he said. Another candidate, Kartikey Sharma, who scored 611 in NEET 2021 compared to 403 the year previous, was getting admission at a private dental college in Gujarat but wanted to pursue MBBS. With his latest NEET score, Sharma is confident of getting an MBBS seat at a government medical college. For NEET 2021, Sharma said he improved his performance in physics and chemistry, which had hurt his NEET score last year. Gandhidham-based Salonee Shah, who took online classes to prepare for NEET 2021 said she is now confident of pursuing her childhood dream of becoming a doctor. Her NEET score improved from 425 in 2020 to 598 marks this year. Besides, she also managed to save Rs 50 lakh in fees for her family that would be required to pursue an MBBS degree at a private college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nearly-40-of-mbbs-aspirants-in-guj-this-year-are-repeaters/articleshow/88037825.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Ahmedabad||‘Strict screening, testing of fliers from at-risk nations’||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government is all geared to screen, test and isolate passengers who arrive from countries classified ‘at risk’ by the Centre, as a rigorous precaution to prevent spread of Covid, particularly the Omicron variant. Addressing media in Gandhinagar on Wednesday, government spokesperson and education minister Jitu Vaghani said, “As per the latest directive from the Centre, we will test all visitors from ‘at risk’ countries. If any passenger is found to be Covid positive, they will have to adhere to the guidelines.” The minister further added that those found positive will be kept in isolation for eight days. Direct flights from Singapore and London in the UK, which have been classified as ‘at risk’, operate from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International airport in Ahmedabad. Ironically, passengers from a Singapore Airlines flight which arrived at SVPI airport late on Tuesday, alleged that they were not screened. “We were asked to submit a self- declaration form and an RT-PCR negative report taken within 72 hours of the travel time. As soon as we stepped out of the aerobridge at Ahmedabad airport, we saw three officials seated at a counter. They checked our documents and Covid-19 test reports and let us go. No other screening was done or advisory given,” said a passenger from Singapore, seeking anonymity. The flier had landed at the city airport on Tuesday night. Sources said that SVPI airport operator did not screen passengers from Singapore as they were asked to implement the screening and testing of passengers from ‘at risk’ countries effective December 1. The city airport operator has set up at least 5 testing counters for passengers from the 11 countries at the arrivals area of Terminal-II. Passengers can choose between RT-PCR or RT-LAMP test at the city airport, the cost of which they will have to bear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/strict-screening-testing-of-fliers-from-at-risk-nations/articleshow/88038931.cms||---

A temporary structure like canopy, porta cabin or pre-fabricated structure will be put on both sides to expand the security hold area (SHA) with a view to decongest the terminal building. A plan to set up temporary structure has been sent to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for its approval. Earlier on November 29, the AAI, on the instruction of the ministry of aviation, asked 15 airports, including regional airports like at Darbhanga, to work on decongesting the terminal building to mitigate passenger inconvenience while looking at the three main issues of infrastructure, flight timings and workforce. Suggestions were also given to increase the duration of flight operations and change in flights timing to avoid bunching of aircraft. Darbhanga airport director Manish Kumar said the AAI officials and security personnel during the airport security committee meeting decided to put up a temporary structure on both sides of the terminal building to enhance the SHA capacity and manage the crowd at peak hours. “We will start work as soon as the AAI approves the proposal. This temporary arrangement is a short-term plan to decongest the terminal building. I have also asked the airlines and security personnel to allow the passengers inside the terminal building almost two hours before the boarding time to avoid chaotic situation in the SHA. Chairs have been put outside the terminal so that flyers who reached early can wait there,” Kumar said. The airport has also requested to increase the flight operation hour time from 9am to 5pm from the existing 10.45am to 4.30pm. The director told this newspaper on Wednesday that the Indian Air Force is likely to hand over 2.4 acre land to the AAI for the expansion of the existing terminal building. “We are hopeful that the process for the transfer of land will be done by December-end, following which construction work may begin. Expansion of the existing civil enclave is a medium-term plan. And for the long-term plan, a big terminal and other amenities will come up over 78 acre land, which we are likely to get in the next 5-6 months,” Kumar said. The new civil enclave will be constructed over 54 acre land and will include the terminal building, cargo, multi-level car parking, fire station and other auxiliary buildings and a 24-acre plot for installation of CAT I.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/darbhanga-airport-plans-to-expand-security-hold-area/articleshow/88037135.cms||Faryal Rumi

A bench of Justice PB Bajanthri also directed the chief secretary to submit a compliance report in six months after taking action. The court was irked by a series of writ petitions filed related to service matters where dismissal of employees has been challenged on the grounds of procedural lapses and violation of rules and regulations. The bench was hearing a writ challenging the dismissal of Akbarpur (Nawada) block education officer Anil Kumar Sharma. The petitioner had challenged his dismissal on the grounds that the provision of the Rules, 2005 were not followed in conducting the proceedings. The petitioner has also challenged his dismissal order upheld by the appellate authority. The bench granted him relief by allowing his writ petition and setting aside both the orders. The court also ordered the petitioner’s reinstatement and remanded the matter back to the parent department. The high court observed that similar errors in conducting departmental proceedings and making dismissals were leading to litigations. On November 26, the bench, while hearing a similar case, had ordered the state government to make its officers aware about the procedures explained in the Rules, 2005 for conducting departmental proceedings and making dismissals. Petitioner Sharma was arrested by the Vigilance Investigation Bureau while allegedly accepting Rs5,000 as bribe in 2017. He remained in jail for three months before his dismissed from service in 2019. Ashok Kumar and Bibhuti Nayaran represented the petitioner while government pleader Madhav Yadav appeared for the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/take-action-against-officers-for-procedural-lapses-hc/articleshow/88036734.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Though no case of the new Covid variant has been detected in the country, the hospitals are busy reviewing their healthcare facilities and keeping beds and intensive care units ( ICUs) in a ready state. The IGIMS, Patna, has added a new feature by setting up genome sequencing lab, the first in the state, in preparation to deal with any new variant, including the Omicron. The lab is equipped with 100 robotic arms in biosafety cabinet. “This equipment, costing Rs1.5 crore, is set up in a highly specialised lab developed at a cost of Rs3.5 crore to study the gene sequences, both of DNA and RNA, of 392 samples of any virus in its 98 slots at a time. The cost of the reagent used for sample test in one slot was about Rs14 lakh, IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said. This lab may examine the mutant forms of other virus like hepatitis and AES. It recently carried out test of 30 Covid samples from different states, including Kerala and Maharashtra, and counter verified the results in labs at Pune and Bhubaneswar. The IGIMS lab findings absolutely matched with those in other labs. The IGIMS, with its 1,000 beds equipped with oxygen supply, is ready for any new challenge, he said. “The Covid ward with 100 beds in MCH building at NMCH-Patna is ready with all support system like ventilators, oxygen supply through pipeline and necessary medicines,” said its superintendent, Dr Binod Kumar Singh. Though no Covid patient is admitted there, the doctors and paramedical staff are regularly deputed there as per the roster. He said unlike the first and second wave, the NMCH has two oxygen generation plants functional and the hospital has even stopped getting the life saving gas through cylinders from outside. If the situation demanded, 650 more beds with sufficient oxygen supply could be ready for Covid patients within a day, Dr Singh added. The PMCH has kept 30 ICU beds ready for Covid patients, its medical superintendent, Dr IS Thakur, said. “We have ready stock of medicines and sufficient oxygen required for Covid patients,” he said. The Covid in-charge of AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said his director, Dr PK Singh, has already directed all the heads of the department to remain alert as per the standard operating procedure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/omicron-threat-puts-govt-hospitals-on-alert/articleshow/88036714.cms||VK Tripathi

The girl’s parents travelled from Navsari to Vadodara to meet the senior railway officials who are part of the investigating team.  “We are not satisfied with the investigations. I think the cops aren’t acting against Oasis Institute due to some pressure. If they had informed us about her ordeal, she would have been alive today,” the mother said. The girl, who was undergoing training at Oasis Institute, had committed suicide inside a train in Valsad on November 4. A diary found from the girl’s bag revealed that she was sexually assaulted. She had described in the diary about how she was kidnapped by an auto-driver and his aide in Vadodara on November 29 near Vaccine Institute compound. Her notes revealed that the duo raped her inside the compound. A bus driver had later told the police that he had helped the girl and even called her friend.  Police also learnt that photos of the girl’s diary’s pages were sent to trustees of Oasis Institute. “The institute didn’t even tell us about her condition. We learnt 10 days later that my daughter was sexually assaulted. They tried to destroy the evidence and hence the cops aren’t able to find any,” the mother alleged.  She insisted that her daughter hadn’t committed suicide. “She wanted to live and become like (Swami) Vivekananda. In fact, my daughter used to inspire others and always told them to not take any extreme step that may cause pain to their parents. The FSL report may say anything but I don’t think my daughter has committed suicide,” she added. A special investigation team (SIT) formed to investigate the case has questioned hundreds of auto drivers and scanned CCTV footage of the areas around the spot where the girl was allegedly raped. But they haven’t been able to arrest the accused yet.

According to sources, the building, which is being constructed in Indo-Saracenic style, will have two digital galleries — ‘Origin of Ganga’ and ‘Patliputra’. The first will showcase the evolution of civilization on the banks of the Ganga and the latter will depict the emergence of Patliputra through an audio-visual medium. The executive engineers of the building construction department told this reporter on Wednesday that the U-shaped building would cover the left, right and back sides of the Patna Museum. “Since 60% of civil work on the new building has been completed, it is likely to be ready by March, 2022,” they said. Apart from the two digital galleries, the new building will have an office, a reception area, an auditorium, a conference hall, an orientation room, storerooms as well as a proper space for Kashi Prasad Jayaswal Research Institute (KPJRI). At present, KPJRI is being run at the back side of the museum building. A garden with around 700 old sculptures will add to the beauty of the museum. The museum’s curator, Shankar Suman, said the new digital galleries would tell the tales of the formation of Patliputra, its transformation into Patna and the origin of the Ganga. “After all the offices are shifted, there will be more space in the existing building. We will then display the artefacts in chronological order keeping in mind the timeline and era they belonged to,” he added. Sources claimed, “Only 5% of the total artefacts that the Patna Museum possesses have been displayed in different galleries. It has a collection of 75,000 artefacts, including 25,000 old coins and 4,000 rare stones.” The main objective behind construction of the new structure at the Patna Museum is extension of the display area of the existing building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/new-building-at-museum-to-be-ready-by-march-next/articleshow/88036633.cms||Faryal Rumi

The court also observed that the investigation by CID will be carried out by a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police (SP) and to be supervised by an ADGP-ranked officer. The division bench of Justices Rajan Gupta and Mohit Kumar Shah also observed that there should be no interference of Madhubani district police or its SP in the investigation of the case. The matter was related to the alleged assault on Jhanjharpur ADJ Avinash Kumar-I by two police officers, including Ghoghardiha police station SHO Gopal Krishna, inside his chamber at Jhanjharpur sub-divisional court on November 18. Later, the lawyers and court staff had thrashed the two police officers. They were soon arrested after an FIR registered by police on the ADJ’s written complaint. During Wednesday’s hearing, the court orally queried about the background of the SP posted in Madhubani. Advocate general Lalit Kishore submitted that he is an IPS officer. The bench even pulled up the state police by orally observing that will they do anything to misuse power. The AG, however, submitted that there was no anarchy in the state. The HC ordered the transfer of the case to the CID after the state DGP submitted a status report in sealed cover before the bench on November 29. DGP S K Singhal was present in the court even on Wednesday. However, he has now been exempted from further physical appearance in the matter. The high court has fixed December 8 for hearing the matter again. During the earlier hearing on November 29, the court appointed counsel Mrigank Mauli an amicus curiae in the matter. Mauli will also submit his report before the court. The high court had taken a suo motu cognizance of the matter within hours of the incident on November 18. It had made scathing observations that the incident put the independence of judiciary in jeopardy while holding a special hearing till night that day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/hc-hand-over-judges-assault-case-probe-to-cid/articleshow/88036646.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Mehta, who was posted at the circle office of Madhepura, had demanded bribery for preparing reports necessary to process two online land mutation applications. A trap team led by DSP Arun Paswan arrested Mehta soon after one Suruchi Devi handed over the bribe money to him for mutation of her two plots. Sources said Suruchi’s husband is an engineer and works for a private firm in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. “Suruchi and her husband own several plots in Madhepura. She had made an online mutation application for two plots measuring 139 decimals at Hanuman Nagar Chaura in Madhepura circle,” a source said. He said the online applications for mutation were made on July 29 and August 11 this year, respectively. “Since Mehta was not preparing the necessary reports due to which mutation process for both the plots was pending,” a vigilance officer said. He said Suruchi met Mehta on October 10 after visiting the Madhepura circle office several times to get her work done, but in vain. “Then Mehta demanded Rs51,000 as bribe. Suruchi tried to bargain but the revenue employee said she will have to pay the amount,” he said. Another officer involved in the raid said the woman finally approached the vigilance on November 25 and her complaint was verified and found to be true the next day. “Finally, the trap team was formed to arrest Mehta,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-employee-held-for-taking-rs-51k-bribe/articleshow/88014854.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary told this newspaper on Wednesday that the recruitment process had been suspended following the imposition of model code of conduct owing to the panchayat elections, but the same would be resumed as soon as the it is over. “Earlier, the process was to be over by December 12, hence the education department had announced the commencement of the third cycle of counselling and appointment of teachers from December 14,” Chaudhary said, adding that now that the counting is scheduled on December 12, the dates of counselling and recruitment have been extended by a few days.

Health experts, however, have urged people to stick to the safety protocols instead of panicking. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, told this reporter that no person had been infected with the Omicron variant in the country yet. “However, chances of a third wave of the pandemic have increased considerably because a lot of people are blatantly ignoring the safety protocols,” he added. The doctor asked everyone to adhere to the government guidelines strictly and wear face masks to protect themselves. Echoing similar views, Dr A K Ashu, the joint director of the Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology, pointed out that the prevailing scenario in the state indicated that the people had become careless. He warned, “If they do not protect themselves now, the third wave will definitely strike the state sooner or later.” On the other hand, the former superintendent of the Patna Medical College Hospital, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, claimed that the new variant “is a cause for concern, but not a cause for panic”. “It spreads rapidly, but its virulence is not as strong as that of the Delta variant. Hence, a lower-intensity third wave may strike the state if the people become complacent,” he said, adding that more and more people should get vaccinated. Dr Prasad also requested the government to start administering the booster dose of the Covid vaccines to the people who were fully inoculated. Dr Punam Raman, a gynaecologist, also laid stress on the need to administer the booster dose to fully vaccinated individuals. She said, “A booster dose is imperative if the new variant is less sensitive to the antibodies generated by the vaccines. It is also necessary because the immunity ensured by the vaccines may fade in a year.” Dr Arun Shah, a paediatrician, asked people not to panic. He, however, urged the government to ramp up the vaccination drive because “if a large number of people are fully vaccinated, there are less chances of a fresh wave”. Nalanda Medical College and Hospital’s deputy superintendent, Dr Satish Kumar, also advised people to remain cautious and safe by following the guidelines of the health department. “At present, it cannot be predicted whether the third wave will hit the state or not,” he claimed. According to sources, although there is not enough information about the new variant, the state government has started making necessary preparations to tackle a possible third wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/stick-to-covid-safety-norms-instead-of-panicking-doctors/articleshow/88036653.cms||B K Mishra

On November 22, 65 operations were performed by doctors of Muzaffarpur Eye Hospital at Juran Chappra during a free eye check-up and surgery camp for poor patients suffering from cataracts. At least 15 of them lost vision in one eye. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma said eyes of four patients were removed due to chronic infection, ‘panophthalmitis’ (inflammation of the internal tissues as well as external layers of the eye). “Thirteen persons were admitted to SKMCH after infection in their eyes and 11 of them lost vision in the operated eye. The doctors were forced to remove the eyes due to severe infection. Two patients are undergoing treatment at SKMCH. They, too, may lose sight,” he said.  The four-member team comprising additional chief medical officer Dr Subhash Prasad Singh, head of eye department (SKMCH) Dr Ajit Kumar Singh, senior medical officer (Sadar hospital) Dr Haseeb Asghar and eye specialist (Sadar hospital) Dr Neetu Kumari collected the swab samples from the instruments in the hospital OT. “I have also sought the list of patients who underwent cataract operation at the hospital to ensure their safety. The officials will contact each patient to check if anyone else was also experiencing infection in the operated eyes or receiving treatment at other health facilities,” Dr Sharma said. He added: “I have also asked the hospital administration to provide the list of doctors who performed the surgeries. Action will be taken against the hospital administration and doctors, if they are found guilty.” The NHRC, in its letter, has also cited medical protocol, which allows one doctor to conduct maximum 12 surgeries daily. “But in this case, the doctor conducted cataract surgeries on 65 patients,” the NHRC stated while observing that conducting eye surgeries in such a reckless manner by violating the medical protocols at a government hospital, is a serious matter of concern. The NHRC has sought a details of the patients, who lost their eyes, and the medical treatment provided to them. The response is expected within 4 weeks. The NHRC also stated, “The condition of six patients is very serious. The hospital authorities tried to hush up the matter by not informing the district administration or the state health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rights-panel-seeks-report-after-15-lose-vision-at-hospital-in-muzaffarpur/articleshow/88037097.cms||Faryal Rumi

The project has been hanging fire for over a decade. When assured by the minister concerned, Singh said “he had no faith in the minister’s assurance”. Singh expressed his anger when labour resources department minister Jibesh Kumar was replying to a call attention jointly raised by MLCs Kumud Verma, Ram Vachan Rai, Sameer Kumar Singh and Sanjay Paswan, who pointed out that in spite of the villagers being ready to provide the land, an ITI could not be established because of delay by the administration. When the minister said he will get the land acquisition done in this financial year itself, the acting chairperson got angry and said, “This is enough,” adding, “I have no faith in your assurance.” Singh further said the project got cabinet’s approval when he was the labour resources department minister. “One of the principal secretaries even got the location changed. However, it was decided to establish it on the same location,” he said. The acting chairperson asked the minister to reply in the House as to what action he will take against officers if the work was delayed again. He even told him to be ready with the reply as call attention on it will again be raised in the next budget session. Singh even asked revenue and land reforms department minister Ram Surat Rai to pay attention to the problems being faced by people of Koilwar block. Rai was replying to a call attention raised by MLC Sanjeev Shyam Singh, who pointed out to the names of fake people being incorporated through online medium and alleged involvement of officials. “See to it. People of Koilwar are suffering. It is a block where even Covid-19 positive deceased were having difficulties in getting aid.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/delay-in-setting-up-iti-at-his-village-irks-chairman-of-legislative-council/articleshow/88037111.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Shivani Agarwalla, won double gold at the Kettlebell World Championship organised by the International Kettlebell Marathon Federation in France last week. In the Half Snatch event she lifted a 16kg kettlebell non-stop for 30minutes and performed 369 repetitions to win gold and secure title of candidate for master of sport. She also competed in pentathlon event securing 988.25 points winning her second gold medal. Representatives of 16 countries participated in the event. “It is a very proud moment for me and my family,” said Shivani after returning to the city. Kettlebell is a cast iron or steel ball used for various exercises to gain muscles, lose fat, improve flexibility and strengthen the core. The sport that originated in Russia involves lifting a kettlebell of different weights for a set period. The winner is decided by bodyweight and number of repetitions performed by the athlete. In 2015, Shivani Agarwalla, a chartered accountant by profession, gave birth to her son and started working out to shed some postpartum weight when her coach introduced her to kettlebell. She started making gains and her coach convinced her to pursue it as a sport. Her efforts paid off when she won gold in Uzbekistan and Australia a couple of years ago. According to Shivani her achievements couldn’t have been possible without the support of her family. “I come from a very conservative Marwari family where wearing shorts and training with a male coach is out of question. But my husband Mayank stood by me like a rock and encouraged me to train hard and realise my dreams,” said Shivani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mom-and-ca-from-city-wins-intl-kettlebell-championship-in-france/articleshow/88037660.cms||---

The CM also said he never inaugurates any road or project before its completion, adding that all the departments should also inform the MLAs about the ongoing schemes in their respective assembly constituencies. The CM said this in the state assembly when the MLAs, including former ministers Nitish Mishra (BJP), Vijay Shankar Dubey (Congress) and Awadh Bihari Chaudhary (RJD), requested him to apprise the House of the government’s policy on keeping elected representatives informed about the ongoing construction projects. Nitish said it was only his government that started inviting the MLAs to the inaugural functions. While the issue cropped up in the context of the call attention information of Mishra, the other MLAs also asked supplementary questions on it. Earlier, on the ruling of Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha, rural works department minister Jayant Raj had told the House that he would inform all the MLAs about the road construction projects in their respective constituencies in a week. House Committee: Speaker Sinha announced on Wednesday to set up a House committee to inquire into the irregularities committed by former Darbhanga superintending engineer (SE) of the rural works department, Anil Kumar, and also recommend action to be taken against him by the department for indulging in irregularities. As much as Rs67 lakh unaccounted money had been recovered from the SE on August 28 this year, besides details regarding several immovable property in his possession, but the department did not take action against him and, instead, allowed him to continue at his post till October 10, BJP member Sanjay Sarawagi had said in his short notice question. The minister said an FIR was lodged against the SE, but he went on medical leave. Incidentally, when caught by the Muzaffarpur police with the unaccounted money, the SE had said if he opened his mouth, it would impact many persons at Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-departments-to-invite-mps-mlas-to-govt-functions/articleshow/88037205.cms||Abhay Singh

Rander police, which is investigating the case, said they are waiting for the family to complete the post-death rituals after which statements of family members will be registered. On Tuesday morning, 31-year-old Priyavandana Kosambia had strangled her three-year-old son Rishabh and then hanged herself at her father’s house where she had been living for the past four years. In her suicide note, Kosambia accused her husband Satish of having an extramarital affair with his sister-in-law, which led to bitter discord between them. She left him and started living with her father. Police sources said Kosambia has written in detail how she murdered Rishabh, the reason for the murder and her extreme step. She even slit her son’s wrist. She also blamed her mother-in-law for supporting Satish despite his affair. The woman said he had decided to commit suicide when she came to know about the affair, but did not take drastic step, thinking about her own parents. Police sources said for the last few months she had been even trying to strike a compromise with Satish for the sake of Rishabh’s future, but he was adamant. The investigation has been handed over to an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) rank officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/husbands-affair-blamed-for-suicide/articleshow/88037184.cms||---

Kais Bin Ahmed, the fourth child of Ayaz-Mariam Nisha couple from Maldives, was diagnosed to have beta thalassemia major, a blood disorder, at five months of age. Due to the disease, his body couldn’t synthesise normal haemoglobin mandating regular blood transfusions every month. Added with this, he was also diagnosed with a large atrial septal defect (a hole between the upper chambers of the heart). The child weighed about 14kg. In Maldives, all the doctors they consulted advised an open-heart surgery as it was felt that the hole was too big to be closed without surgery. But undergoing an open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass could carry very high risk in any person with beta thalassemia major. That’s when a cardiologist at Maldives advised the family about consulting doctors at Lisie Hospital. The child was re-assessed by the paediatric cardiology team headed by Dr Edwin Francis at Lisie Hospital. “Though atrial septal defects had been closed via keyhole, it was the first time that we decided to close such a large defect in a child under five years of age,” said Dr Edwin, head of paediatric cardiology team at Lisie Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/big-hole-in-childs-heart-closed-via-keyhole-procedure/articleshow/88037656.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Bravehearts overcome obstacles, take boards||Kolkata: An ISC student at St Thomas’ Kidderpore came on the first day of the exam, November 22, and complained that she was unable to see the question paper well and needed help. She had no prior complaint of any eyesight disorder. On the second day, she needed a magnifying glass and insisted on writing the exam with the fading vision. Doctors had diagnosed her with degenerating eyes. The school informed CISCE of her condition and alerted that she might need a scribe and extra time. On the third day on Tuesday, she could not write the paper and had to be wheeled into surgery to save her eyes. Secretary of the school John Ghosh has forwarded her case to the council with an appeal that when alternate dates are given to children with Covid and other ailments,she be considered. “She tried her best to write the test. We have a student-friendly council, so we hope there will be help,” Ghosh said. Several other bravehearts are writing their board exams, overcoming their challenges and their schools have done their best to help them. Some are fighting cancer, some are with heart diseases, some are visually impaired and some are tied to wheelchairs. ISC (commerce) student Ananya Das from AG Church, Tollygunge, was detected with stage-IV cancer of the lymph nodes last year. She was treated but there was a relapse in March and she has undergone stem cell transplant, which needs continuous treatment and monitoring. But despite her condition, Ananya has been brave enough to sit among friends and write ISC. “She got over 87% in ICSE. She has such grit that she doesn’t want to write alone in a comfortable room and doesn’t even want her parents nearby,” said principal Kajori Biswas. Prem Madhogaria, an ICSE student of The Heritage School, also rolls into the school in his wheelchair and beams his way to the exam hall. He has been a victim of meningomylocele or spina bifida and has no motor movement below the waist since birth. In August, he underwent a long spine surgery and was advised two-month bed rest. “He is just up for the exams and as a mother, I salute his grit. He hardly got 15 days to study,” said mother Anita. Three such bravehearts from South City International School are taking ICSE exam. CISCE has allowed them separate rooms. One of them has a heart disease, one, a nerve disorder, and the third student is visually impaired. Aarya Gupta has atrophy of the optic nerve since birth. “Though CISCE allowed him to use a scribe to read out the questions to him, he says he is happy with the MCQ pattern where he needs minimal help,” said principal John Bagul. A child at St Augistine’s Day School, Kolkata, was diagnosed with a neurological disorder a month before the exams. The child insisted on taking the exam. “We have informed the council about her condition. Under medication, she wanted to sit in the same hall as others. Her mother sits outside the hall,” said Richard Gasper, principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bravehearts-overcome-obstacles-take-boards/articleshow/88037883.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Business||New India pays Rs 2,350cr Covid claims in April-Sept||Mumbai: New India Assurance has paid health insurance claims worth Rs 2,350 crore on account of Covid during the first six months of the current financial year. This had resulted in the incurred claims ratio rising to 126% in the first half of FY22 from 74% in the same period of previous year. The state-owned non-life company is the largest provider of health insurance with a premium of Rs 8,812 crore in the first half, which is around 47% of its total book. New India’s health business has grown 53% in the first half, making up for the negative growth in motor insurance and helping it report 17% growth in the first half. “Q2FY22 was one of the most challenging quarters in recent times in terms of profitability. However, in terms of business growth, the company grew around 20% compared to the industry growth of about 13%,” chairman Atul Sahai said in a recent analyst presentation. Despite the adverse claims position, New India managed to report a profit supported by investment income. “On the positive side, the net worth has increased from Rs 36,451 crore in March 2021 to Rs 39,921 crore as of September 30. Investments, assets have also gone up from Rs 68,639 crore in March 2021 to Rs 82,001 crore as of September 30. The operating expenses were also lower,” said Sahai. Of the Covid claims paid by New India, Rs 1,250 were in Q1FY22 and Rs 1,100 crore in the second quarter. Although the second wave of the pandemic had receded by the second quarter, a larger chunk of the claims came under the reimbursement mode. Covid claims have fallen in the third quarter, but New India has been hit by Rs 235-crore claims due to floods in Maharashtra. Its overseas operations were also hit because of floods in Germany and hurricane ‘Ida’ in the US.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-india-pays-rs-2350cr-covid-claims-in-april-sept/articleshow/88038595.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Jaipur||World War II veteran to get arrears within six months with 8% pa interest: AFT||Jaipur: The 97-year-old World War II veteran from Jhunjhunu, who lost his leg fighting in Italy in 1944, will get the war disability pension along with arrears from 2008 to 2011 within six months with an interest of 8% per annum till the actual date of payment, said a detailed order of Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT). The order stated that the payment of the arrears should be expedited. Last month, the AFT had granted war disability pension to Sepoy Balwant Singh, who was inducted in the 3/1 Punjab Regiment in 1943, and lost his left leg in a mine blast during a brigade attack in Italy on December 15, 1944. Speaking to TOI, the veteran said he was happy with the court’s order as it would help his family financially. He was invalided out of the service in 1946 with basic disability pension after being transferred to the Rajputana Rifles. “I am extremely happy that I have finally received what I deserve, but more importantly it will help my children and grandchildren. My son is qualified but still unemployed so this pension would help immensely”, said Balwant Singh, who is still active at this age. Hailing from village Gidaniya in Jhunjhunu district, Balwant Singh was transferred to Rajputana Rifles after the injury before he was discharged from the forces. Last month, the AFT ordered that the war veteran would get 100% pension from 2008, which is prior to three years before he filed the case along with the arrears. The government in 1972 made a provision for grant of war injury pension to all who suffered injuries during various wars and were invalided out due to battle injuries, but denied the same to those who suffered injuries or were casualties during the world wars. The war veteran’s case had been in the AFT at Jaipur since 2010. His legal counsel Col(retd) S B Singh added, “In the detailed order, other cases of similar nature have also been mentioned. I am glad that Balwant Singh received the war disability pension after long fight and while he is still alive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/world-war-ii-veteran-to-get-arrears-within-six-months-with-8-pa-interest-aft/articleshow/88038311.cms||---
---||Business||Sensex up 620 pts on robust Q2 GDP growth||Mumbai: A strong GDP growth number for India and relatively steady Asian markets on Wednesday ensured investor sentiment improved on Dalal Street, despite a sharp sell-off in the US markets on Tuesday night. This helped the sensex close 620 points (1.1%) higher at 57,685. Short covering by speculators to limit their losses also helped the index gain in the closing hours, market players said. Wednesday’s surge came mainly on the back of strong buying in Reliance Industries along with ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI, while a lower closing in Bharti Airtel and Ultratech Cement limited the gains partially. On Tuesday evening, the government had said that during the July-September quarter this year the economy had grown by an 8.3% annual rate and it now targets double-digit growth for entire fiscal. This comforted investors about the economy coming back on track at a fast rate after the Covid-induced slowdown during the most part of 2020 and the early months of 2021. Surprisingly, foreign investors continued to be net sellers with an outflow figure of Rs 2,766 crore, although domestic funds more than neutralised this selling with a net buying figure of Rs 3,467 crore. Commentaries from doctors and pharma company executives that said that the newly emerged Omicron variant of the virus may not be as lethal as initially thought to be also helped to calm nervous investors globally, dealers said. With major European markets up over 1% each in late trades and US markets opening strong — up between 1% and 1.3% — market players here expect the Indian market to also trade strong on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-620-pts-on-robust-q2-gdp-growth/articleshow/88038466.cms||---

November recorded 86 deals amounting to around $4.8 billion, compared to October’s 115 deals totalling over $10.3 billion, data from Venture Intelligence showed. However, on a YoY basis, the value of deals grew over 3X from $1.5 billion in November 2020. Cumulatively, PE-VC firms have invested around $60 billion across 1,069 deals in 2021 (till November) compared to about $40 billion invested in the whole of last year across 900 deals. Analysts said the ecosystem is seeing a heavy ‘winner takes all’ trend with money chasing startups that have already raised funding in the past one year for their follow-on rounds. All eyes are on the Indian public markets’ appetite for new age digital ventures and the US Fed Reserve’s moves in the coming months as that will determine subsequent deal flows, they said. “The average deal size in the ecosystem is rising and hence the number of deals going down is to be expected and this is also likely to flatten going forward,” Venture Intelligence founder & MD Arun Natarajan said. The US government has acknowledged that inflation is worrying and the moves that global investors such as Tiger Global make in coming months will be closely watched by the entire sector, he added. November clocked 10 deals of over $100 million in value compared to October’s tally of 21 such deals. The average deal size at the early stages stands at around $5 million in November — almost double from the same time last year. At the growth stages, average deal size is up from $5 million to $7 million in the past one year, data from Venture Intelligence shows. Advent International’s acquisition of IT services firm Encora for around $1.5 billion, gaming startup Dream11’s $840-million fundraise from various investors, and Spinny’s raise of $285 million were the top deals of the month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-funds-drop-over-50-from-oct-to-4-8bn-in-nov/articleshow/88037988.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

This is despite the fact that all banks have brought down interest rates following the sharp rate cuts by the RBI in the wake of the pandemic. The high rates for two years will help compensate for the five-year interest holiday from March 2021. Although interest for subsequent years on high-value deposits that are locked-in will be capped at a return equivalent to the savings bank rate of SBI, the depositors will have an upside. Bankers said that as Unity SFB will be a startup bank with a high capital base, it will have every incentive to offer better terms to depositors and restore their confidence to ensure that they stay. In terms of the resolution plan, customers with up to Rs 5 lakh will get their money immediately as this would be made available by the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. Those with deposits up to Rs 10 lakh will get most of their funds in four years, while those with deposits above Rs 15 lakh will have to wait for 10 years. PMC has over 9 lakh depositors of which 8.8 lakh will get their money immediately. The bank had deposits of around Rs 11,800 crore, but lost over Rs 6,500 crore — most of which was illegally advanced to the HDIL Group. Usually, when a cooperative bank has such a high negative net worth, the only solution is liquidation, which would mean that depositors lose their uninsured deposits. But, given the large number of depositors, the RBI had decided to use the lure of a bank licence to draw investors to offer a better deal to the depositors. However, there were only two bidders. Besides Centrum and Bharat Pe, UK’s Liberty Group had also bid for the bank. But the Liberty Group did not win comfort with the regulator as the bid was not seen as a serious one. The group had earlier reneged on bids it had made in the insolvency process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/depositors-of-pmc-to-get-pre-covid-interest-rate/articleshow/88038481.cms||---

The changes in Infiniti Retail’s shareholding is the first rejig within the conglomerate’s omni-channel commerce business, even though the two-year-old Tata Digital has built a model through acquisitions (BigBasket, 1MG & CureFit). The move comes as Tata Digital tests its super app Tata Neu in beta version among the conglomerate’s huge employee base. Many of the Tata Group’s consumer brands, including Croma, are on Tata Neu, with a commercial launch slated for next year. The government’s proposed consumer protection rules, among other factors, pushed Tata Neu’s commercial debut to 2022 from this year. Electronics is a top category that clocks the highest share of total online sales and this is one of the reasons Tata Sons decided to transfer Croma’s shares to Tata Digital, said one of the sources quoted earlier. Infiniti Retail and Tata Digital didn’t respond to e-mailed questions. The move is also part of Chandrasekaran’s broader plan to streamline Tata Group’s corporate structure in a bid to sharpen focus on businesses that have a play in similar segments. For instance, the chairman transferred the ready-to-eat business (marketed under Tata Q brand) to the publicly listed Tata Consumer Products from Tata Industries. Likewise, he shifted Tata Cha — a tea parlour chain — to Indian Hotels Company (Taj hotels) from Tata Consumer to leverage on the former’s wide experience in managing food and beverage formats. There are also plans to shift fashion e-tailer Tata Cliq, which has largely remained a fringe player in the online shopping space, to Tata Digital from Tata Industries. The inter-se transfer of Croma shares among Tata Group entities and inorganic acquisitions (Tata Digital continues to look at M&As) will help the $103-billion conglomerate scale up its e-commerce play against larger rivals like Amazon, Walmart and Reliance Industries. The Tata Sons board met on Tuesday to review, among other things, the conglomerate’s growth initiatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-transfer-cromas-owner-to-digital-biz-arm/articleshow/88038429.cms||Reeba Zachariah

General Insurance Corporation informed the stock exchanges this week that its board, after legal examination, took note of vacation of director’s office by Madhulika Bhaskar, general manager, with effect from November 3. This followed an order issued by the Delhi high court in the matter of Ravi vs Union of India, where the court set aside selections of general manager and directors of public sector insurance companies by the BBB. Besides Bhaskar, industry sources said that there were two directors each in National Insurance and Oriental Insurance and one in United India who are affected by the order. However, the other companies are not listed and not required to make immediate disclosures to the exchanges. According to sources, while the board appointment is undone, the senior executive’s position is not affected as there is no difference in the service terms of a GM and a GM who is a director. Prior to the BBB taking over appointments in the insurance sector, the director positions were notified by the government after shortlisting candidates. Insiders feel that the old practice would need to be resumed or the government would have to come out with a notification authorising the BBB to make appointments in the insurance sector as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-order-on-bbb-non-life-cos-lose-6-directors/articleshow/88038583.cms||---

The projects will be carried out in three phases. In the first phase the consultant will prepare the report on techno commercial viability report. They need to keep in mind the tourism potential and how to make it sustainable. They will also have to keep in mind the ecological aspect and architectural design. Optimum route and alternative alignments for ropeway will be suggested along with locations for terminal stations. The project cost and ride cost will be worked out. In phase two, detailed project reports will be prepared mentioning the technical details of alignment and the project analysis to make it viable. In phase three, the projects will be executed in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode. “The ropeways are being planned to attract more tourists. The potential of these tourist spots are not fully utilised. Since these locations are near the border they have the scope to attract tourists from across the border. Ropeways can help boost footfall in these beautiful places as these areas are untapped and have good road links,” the official said. At the Ayodhya Hills. the ropeway can be connecting between the lower dam and the upper dam and offer to visitors a stunning view of the hills and water from the cable car. Similarly, visitors at Mukutmanipur can travel across the huge water body and can watch the people taking boat rides in the dam. The ropeway at Gajoldoba is aimed to give fillip to the economy of the place as it is a dream project of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. The CM plans a mega tourism hub at Gajoldoba located on the west of Teesta river and close to the Baikunthapur forest. The Gajoldoba dam is home to migratory birds in winter. More than 200 acres had been demarcated for the mega tourism hub. Earlier, the tourism department had also planned ropeways in Sunderbans and in Buxa, but it is yet to take place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ropeways-to-attract-more-tourists-to-mukutmanipur-mirik-ayodhya-hills/articleshow/88037677.cms||---

The apex court has asked the department of archaeology and museums to file its reply within eight weeks. The next hearing is expected to be held in January. On Tuesday, the plea filed by the state department of archaeology and museums and others against the tribunal’s order was mentioned for an urgent listing before a bench comprising justices U U Lalit, S R Bhat and Bela M Trivedi. But the department did not get relief. With this, all commercial activities will remain closed for at least two months till the next hearing. “In compliance with the NGT order, the archaeological department on Tuesday also issued an order to stop all commercial activities at Amber and Nahargarh forts in Jaipur. As stay was not granted on the NGT order, activities will remained closed,” said a district administration official. As per the order, effective from December 1, apart from restaurants operational in the two forts located on reserve forest land, the light and sound show held at Kesar Kyari at Amber foothills should be stopped till further orders.

The school had been awarded compensation for giving away one of its buildings for road widening. It was unable to use the amount, and now the government has asked the school to return it, citing the pandemic. Venugopal Hegde, senior assistant teacher, told TOI that the school celebrated its 125 years of existence in 2019. “In the last few years, admissions are only increasing. From 555 students in 2019-20, the number increased to 630, and the next academic year, it went up to 780. This year, the school saw 256 new admissions, of which 117 are for class I and 139 from classes II to VII,” he said. “Every class has two English medium sections and one Kannada medium section. The school has 21 teachers, of which 14 are regular, and the rest are honorary teachers. Classes are held in two buildings, the Kuvempu Centenary Building and cyclone shelter that was built in the school premises under a central government project supported by the World Bank, at a cost of Rs 2.6 crore in 2019. The office room functions from the school centenary building that was built in 1993. However, this building will be demolished for highway widening,” he added. Hegde said, “In 2017, the NHAI provided the school compensation of Rs 21 lakh. Since we already have sufficient classrooms, we decided to use the money to upgrade basic infrastructure, including purchase of furniture and computers. The school is using eight classrooms, dining halls and toilets of the cyclone shelter. However, last year, the government had asked the school to return the compensation amount, citing the pandemic,” he said. “We have informed the government to allow us to use this money for the works,” said headmistress Lalitha Sakharam. The school won the best school state award in 2002, secured A grade in KSQAAC exam in 2014 and won the ‘Paramparika Shaala’ recognition in 2019.

---||Pune||Maharashtra task force says vigilance, precautions enough to keep senior students protected||PUNE: The state paediatric task force has stressed on vigilance and precautions for in-person classes for Stds VIII to XII, amid Omicron concerns. The task force has insisted on following a set of standard procedures for systematic school closure if cases surface on their premises to avoid undue panic and knee-jerk reactions. “Other countries, even those where the Omicron variant has been detected, have not closed their schools neither is there a WHO advisory on it. School re-opening is not an irrevocable decision, and they can always be shut again if cases do show a rise,” Pramod Jog, the state’s paediatric task force member and senior paediatrician, told TOI. All reported cases of Omicron infection in countries outside India have been mild with hardly anybody needing hospitalisation or even oxygen. Although the age-group affected is below 40 years, about half of the cases were in people who had not completed their vaccination, Jog said. School closure, as a precautionary measure, has been advised by the task force when the positive cases among students, teachers, non-teaching staff of a school go above 5 % of total student strength in 14-day period or 10 positive cases are detected on school premises in a 14-day period. "This closure norm remains unchanged against the backdrop of the concern over Omicron. However, extra precautions and vigilance are currently enough to keep the physical classes running," Jog said. The state education department reopened schools from Stds VIII to XII in Covid-free villages in rural areas on July 7, this year. From October 4, the schools were allowed to reopen from V to VIII in rural areas and VIII to XII in urban areas. The GR on November 29 had allowed reopening of all remaining classes from Stds I to IV in rural areas and Stds I to VII in urban areas across the state. But local government bodies have stayed the order and deferred the reopening in many places which includes, Pune, Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nashik. In Pune, the local authorities have put on hold the reopening of primary classes till December 15. The authorities cited the threat from Omicron for the postponement. Bhagwan Pandekar, a secondary mathematics teacher at Laxmanrao Apte Prashala, said that attendance has increased to 95% since the schools reopened for Stds VIII to XII in October. “There is no fear among students about this variant. We have got no calls from parents till now," he said. Parents and students have realised the importance of offline classes and children are regularly attending the classes. Only those whose parents have gone out of the city are unable to attend. Reopening of schools was the best decision, Pandekar said. Mahesh Palkar, director of secondary and higher secondary education in Maharashtra, said that there were no cases of Covid-19 spread in any of the reopened secondary schools in the state. “There are no cases of the virus among students as of now. Schools are taking all precautions.We do not have reports of isolated cases in the government schools till now," Palkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-task-force-says-vigilance-precautions-enough-to-keep-senior-students-protected/articleshow/88038362.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Following a complaint by BJP MLA Ameet Satam, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday called for a meeting with stormwater drain (SWD) department officials. She said she would personally conduct an inspection to check if the machines are working on Friday. “If I find that officials are playing any mischief, they will be taken to task. I will seek answers from the administration,” Pednekar said. TimesViewDe-silting of the Mithi river over the years hasn’t shown results. The 2016 de-silting scam exposed how contractors duped the BMC. Carrying out a performance analysis of imported machines after 10 months and paying Rs 50 crore for them is unacceptable. The civic administration must come clean on the allegations and clarify whether the imported machines which were launched with fanfare are effective or not.When TOI contacted P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), he refused to comment. In February, the BMC in February had awarded a two-year Rs 110-crore contract to desilt Mithi river using three silt pushers and three pontoon excavators that can float on water, desilt and transport the silt to the riverbank. The imported machines were to remove 2 lakh tonnes of silt from Mithi per year. While a silt pusher costs around Rs 3.5 crore, a pontoon excavator is priced around Rs 2.3 crore. “I have been told that the machines are not being used and the BMC is carrying out their performance analysis. This is nothing but a policy flip-flop and a loot of public money,” said Satam. “If the machines were not working, then why buy them in the first place? Was no performance analysis done before issuing a Rs 110-crore contract and releasing Rs 50 crore to the contractors? I have written to the mayor, but have not got a detailed response. I will take up the issue in the state legislature session,” he added. In a recent RTI reply to Satam, the BMC had said that it has spent Rs 1,000 crore on desilting in the last decade. Civic officials said these imported machines were used successfully in Kerala for desilting rivers. “BMC engineers visited Kerala during the pandemic to see how they work. The machines can reach the centre of the river and desilt, which we could not do even by using makeshift excavators on barges,” said a senior civic official. Officials said that the silt pusher was basically a floating bulldozer and pontoon excavator, a floating excavator fitted on a barge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-faces-flak-over-performance-check-of-10-month-old-machines-to-desilt-mithi/articleshow/88038967.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Mumbai||Why fine us too if passengers flout Covid rules?: Mumbai cabbies, bus drivers||MUMBAI: Cabbies and private bus associations are fuming over the new state guidelines, imposing an additional fine on drivers and owners of transport agencies if a passenger in their vehicle is found not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Meanwhile, Mumbai police have stepped up checks on streets to penalise motorists and bikers not found wearing masks. The new guidelines issued by the state on November 27 say any individual not following Covid-appropriate behaviour will be fined Rs 500 for each such instance. If a default is found inside a taxi, private transport car or bus, then the driver, conductor or helper providing the service will also be fined Rs 500. The owner (transport agency), in case of buses, will be fined Rs 10,000 for each instance. Frequent defaults will lead to withdrawal of licence or closure of operations for the owner agency till the notification remains in force. TimesViewWhile masking up is essential to keep the new Covid variant at bay, the guidelines cannot put the onus on the driver of a public transport vehicle to ensure that his/her passengers are following rules. Apart from requesting passengers to mask up before a journey begins, drivers cannot afford to keep a watch on them during the journey. Such impractical restrictions which stipulate hefty penalties for non-compliance are bound to create friction and make the task of policing more burdensome. Citizens should be singularly made responsible for wearing masks without waiting to be prodded by someone.Currently, Mumbai police is fining only those individuals not wearing masks Rs 200 (as per old guidelines) as official orders about higher fines are awaited. Every police station is making an average of 100 cases daily. But officers are concerned that heavier fines should not translate into arguments and traffic jams. Cabbies fear they will end up paying more than what they earn per day. “Why should the driver be fined if he is wearing a mask and the passenger isn’t? Our union will oppose this strongly and take to the streets if drivers are additionally fined,” said K K Tiwari of Taxi Rickshaw Cell, BJP. Malik Patel of Mumbai Bus Malak Sanghatana said asking transport agencies to shell out Rs 10,000 is unwarranted. “Before commencing on a journey, our drivers inform all passengers to wear masks and sanitise hands. A helper checks their body temperature. But when the journey is on, it’s impossible for the driver to keep tabs on passengers. The association will take a delegation to traffic police chief on this issue,” he said. A tourist bus owner said, “We are alerting passengers about the new rules that make our drivers liable.” Aggregator cab firms such as Ola and Uber have already informed all their driver-partners to alert passengers about the new rule and ensure that everyone in the vehicle wears a mask throughout the ride.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cabbies-bus-drivers-why-fine-us-too-if-passengers-flout-covid-rules/articleshow/88038365.cms||Somit Sen

Officials of Archaeological Survey of India said action is being taken to rectify it. Artha Mandapam is the space between the temple’s exterior and Garba Griha (sanctum sanctorum). Noticing water on the floors, the matter was brought to the notice of authorities by devotees and tourists who visited the temple. Subsequently, Thanjavur Palace Devasdhanam, which takes care of pujas, informed officials of ASI which is tasked with maintenance of the temple’s structures and sculptures. When contacted, ASI conservation assistant for the Big Temple, S Shankar, said there was no leakage from the roof of the mandapam, but only dampness caused by continuous rain. “We came to know that there was some dampness inside the mandapam. Subsequently, we attended to the issue. We will do the needful to seal it if there is any crack on the top of the mandapam, which is unlikely,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/water-leakage-in-big-temple-mandapam/articleshow/88038360.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Corporation calls for EoI for digitization of records||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The city corporation which has often had to deal with instances of missing crucial files is set to undertake a massive digitization exercise of the vast tranche of documents and files. The civic body has called for expression of interests (EoI) from firms to implement a document management system in the civic body as part of digitization. As per EoI, the main objectives of the project include secured storage of hardcopy files, reducing frequent manual handling, to provide easy access with self-search facility and to ensure high document security and compliance. The firm chosen for the work will have to capture documents through scanning and improve document quality through image enhancement and cropping tools and to upload and store the digital documents. With the document management system, a digital record repository will be created to manage records in a simplified manner. Tag based search options will be provided using identity tags for documents. This will enhance user and access management. Documents can be searched based on content tags, document name, keyword tags and date range. Each staff will be assigned credentials and all the user activity will be recorded for security reasons. The project also envisages a comprehensive user management system to create different user groups and roles. The major requirement of the system as per EoI document would be the availability of a document management solution which facilitates advanced search and retrieval of all types of corporation documents. Also, the system should support the various steps in digitization techniques, including document preparation, scanning, meta data preparation and indexing. The system should collect the data and produce them in multiple formats such as images, PDF, PDF/A documents etc. The proposed solution should provide an easy way to access, search, view and retrieve digitized documents from the repository for long term preservation of documents, quick and comprehensive search and retrieval, creation of paperless environment and reduced storage space and to enable advanced search on each metadata item for retrieving only the desired set of results, EoI notes. The issue of missing files had figured in the local fund audit report for 2016-17. The audit had mainly cited lack of documents with regard to building permits and files for regularisation of unauthorised constructions. The lapses had been reported in main office and zonal offices. The audit report mentioned an instance at Attipra zonal office where 13 files related to regularisation of unauthorised buildings were deemed to be missing. In 2015 when a school building had collapsed at Muttathara, the engineering and town planning wing of the city corporation had groped in the dark trying to retrieve the files of a building constructed less than 10 years ago. In 2014, the corporation had come under fire from district administration after it failed to produce blueprints of commercial establishments which had altered the original building plan and converted mandatory parking space for other purposes. It had initiated disciplinary action against an overseer with the engineering wing after the file of a newly constructed apartment at Pattom, reported of violations, went missing. In 2018, files of an apartment unit at Kazhakootamwere missing, when the application was filed for occupancy certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corporation-calls-for-eoi-for-digitization-of-records/articleshow/88037679.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Under the mission, district collector R Vimala has urged the taluka-level officials to ‘adopt’ one orphan each and extend them all possible support and assistance. She has also instructed the tehsilders to ensure the taluka-level teams are geared up to help the orphans and widows through counselling, co-ordination and communication to ensure the government schemes and benefits reach them. The tehsilders, who are made taluka heads of the ‘Mission Vatsalya’ team, were asked by the collector to take weekly review meetings and report. ‘Mission vatsalya’ was launched by the state government to extend support to the victims afflicted by the Covid onslaught, especially the widows, as the viral infection took toll on the socio-economic fabric of the society with substantial breadearners of the families losing their lives. The children too were brought into the ambit of the mission as many of their futures were confronted with uncertainty after losing either one or both their parents.While the orphaned children of Covid calamity were declared beneficiaries of monetary schemes of central (PM Care) and state government funds, nothing was announced for the widows. Officials said Covid widows can avail monetary benefits from several government schemes like Sanjay Gandhi niradhar anudan yojana, Shravanbal seva state pension scheme, Indira Gandhi national old age penion scheme and Indira Gandhi national widow pension scheme and so on.Ravindra Patil, divisional deputy commissioner, women and child development department, said the women and children find it difficult to collect form, fill them and attach relevant documents for availing the benefits of any scheme if they come to know about it. “A team under every taluka will work on a mission mode to extend miscellaneous help to Covid widows and orphans in terms of availing government schemes and benefits. It’s almost like a service being rendered at their doorstep,” said Patil. He added that efforts of the women and child development minister Yashomati Thakur played a key role in launching ‘mission vatsalya’.According to a official source, 161 Covid orphans were issued special fee waiver letter which the eduction department would take up with the private schools and institutions to ensure their dues are settled. Around 63 children were issued ‘Covid orphan’ certificate while 44 beneficiaries got domicile certificate through ‘Mission Vatsalya’. The district administration is now aiming to ensure the children below the age of three years are issued domicile certificate on a priority basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/544-covid-widows-2200-orphans-to-get-help-under-mission-vatsalya/articleshow/88036828.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Record 51% attendance on Day 1 in rural primary schools||Nagpur: As primary schools in Nagpur (rural) reopened on Wednesday, a record breaking 51% of the enrolled students were back in classrooms. This attendance figure, especially for day one, has been unheard of in Nagpur where schools have gone through closure, reopening, closure and back to opening again phases. Technically, this can be called ‘full attendance’ because as per rules, only 15-20 students per class can be called back. But going by such reference is a bit tricky because over a period of time, it has been observed that very few schools adhere to the ‘limited students’ rule. The overwhelming demand of parents in many rural schools to send kids back to campus has principals bending the rules. In city, school reopening for Std I-VII has been postponed till December 10 after which a review will be taken. An overwhelming majority of the schools which reopened on Wednesday come under zilla parishad, which also reconfirms the belief that parents in rural areas were eager to send kids back to school. Chintaman Vanjari, district education officer (primary), told TOI that all small kids were extremely happy to be back on campus. “I visited multiple places today to see how students were reacting to this new experience. One of the schools in Kalmeshwar had a superb attendance response for primary section and students there said they now want schools to continue. Students need not only academic knowledge, but also the company of their peers for overall development,” said Vanjari. Sharad Bhandarkar, an extension officer with ZP who supervises a cluster of schools, said reopening educational institutes is the need of the hour. “In rural areas now, Std I-XII are open. Children in a lot of rural areas do not have access to online learning and that’s why it is important for them to be present inside classrooms. We had a very good response to reopening today. There is no doubt that attendance figures will remain steady,” said Bhandarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/record-51-attendance-on-day-1-in-rural-primary-schools/articleshow/88038379.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

After 10 months, an international flight from Sharjah will also resume from December 5, and all passengers will be quarantined and tested.The state had issued new guidelines considering the mutated variant. Till November 30, fully vaccinated flyers from other states were not required to have RT-PCR negative report. In the revised guidelines, the government made RT-PCR negative report from within 48 hours of arrival mandatory for all passengers coming from other states.Flights from New Delhi, Hyderabad, Goa, Kolkata, Indore, Bengaluru etc arrive at the city’s airport. Around 1,500 flyers arrive daily from other states to reach city or other parts of Vidarbha and adjoining Madhya Pradesh as per NMC data.NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Our team at the airport in association with a private laboratory used to test flyers from other states who were not fully vaccinated.

The order does not prescribe any procedure to be followed by the officers to assess and impose fine. The order is also silent on giving notice or chance of hearing to the organisation or establishment concerned before imposing fine on it. Such unbridled powers given to the filed officers will increase inspector raj manifolds and open floodgates for corruption at ground level.”In revised guidelines issued on November 27, the government has made provisions of fine of Rs10,000 on shop or establishment if any individual violates the norms on its premises and fine of Rs50,000 if a shop or establishment does not comply with the guidelines.Agrawal added, “It is surprising to note that shops are made soft target and fined even if visitors are not following guidelines. The order is silent on fining government departments for similar default.”Agrawal also said, “CAMIT shares the concern of administration about Omicron variant of Covid-19. To prevent spread of new variant in the state, penalty is not a solution. Effective implementation of testing and quarantine guidelines for all domestic and foreign passengers returning/traveling to India is must. Stringent checking at all entry points (international airports) and directing passengers for mandatory institutional quarantine should be the norm,” he said.CAMIT has urged the government to direct the authorities to follow principles of equity, good conscience and justice instead of harassing traders. It has requested the state to reframe the five-level order dated June 4 to address the contingency arising from Omicron variant. “Government’s decision to open all economic, cultural, social, sports and entertainment activities is a welcome move,” the association said.Copy of the letter has been also forwarded to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and disaster management minister Vijay Wadettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fine-of-rs10k-rs50k-on-shops-will-encourage-corruption-traders-assn/articleshow/88036832.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

This act by the police set in motion events that saw the woman ending up in jail for attempted murder of the accused. The woman is now out on bail after spending 47 days as an under trial prisoner. The woman, who hails from Mumbai, said that she came here in June this year along with her six-year-old daughter after she received a marriage proposal from the accused, who is reportedly an officer of the Armed Forces. He had a 16-year-old son from his previous marriage. She said that though the purpose of her visit was to check the background of the accused, he convinced her to stay back and conduct the marriage ceremony at a local temple as he was desperately seeking for someone to take care of his son, who is a person with special needs. On July 16, after a day of the marriage, she caught him sexually abusing her daughter at night after she woke up hearing the child’s cry for help. He held her captive in the house using intimidation tactics. “On August 31, I got an opportunity to file my complaint before the police. That was when some police officers visited to enquire about a false case he filed against me for attempting to kidnap his son. He took that step after two failed attempts to get rid of me, first by sending a few men to attack me and second by leaving the LP gas cylinder open,” she said. After she registered her complaint, the police delayed his arrest citing official formalities. On that night a scuffle ensued between the two, which she claims to have happened when he tried to kill her again. When he failed he injured himself and summoned the police. The next morning, the police recorded her arrest and sent her to prison. Her partner was also arrested. But, he got out on bail after two weeks. The district police authorities dismissed the allegations levelled against them. Meanwhile, senior officials have sought an explanation from the officers concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sexul-abuse-victims-mother-accuses-police-of-inaction/articleshow/88037687.cms||---

A driver losing control due to wet roads is said to be the reason behind the late night incident. The incident took place when a driver of one of the vehicles lost control and suddenly applied brakes in the road that was slippery due to rains. This led other vehicles behind it to run into each other. The pile up as a consequence had two buses, two trucks and three other vehicles leading a couple of these vehicles including a bus of the Rajasthan state transport (ST) to be badly damaged from the impact.

---||Delhi||11 cops under scanner for taking bribe from ATM gang ‘untraceable’||Noida: None of the Noida police personnel being investigated for allegedly taking Rs 20 lakh and a four-wheeler in bribe from a gang of ATM hackers has turned up before the inquiry officer, 48 hours after notices were sent. “Their mobile phones are also switched off,” a senior police officer said on Wednesday. The role of the special weapons and tactics team (SWAT) personnel is being investigated by DCP (crime) Abhishek Singh. SWAT inspector Shavez Khan and constable Amrish Yadav have been dismissed, while the others facing inquiry are sub-inspector Satender Motla, head constables Nitin Kumar, Amit Sharma and Krishan Kumar and constables Babar Ali, Aditya Singh, Udayvir Singh, Puneet and Udit Rathi. Police sources said that inspector Khan has been known for his role in cracking several criminal cases during his stints in the crime branch and as the Sector 58 station officer and was also feted at the Independence Day function this year. Notices to the SWAT personnel were issued on November 29 by Singh “to present yourself in my office at 10 am today for the recording of your statements”. But none of them turned up. The notice stated: “The issue is pertinent and if you do not present yourself to record your statements, then it will be considered that you don’t have anything to say and a one-sided decision could be taken.” TOI has a copy of the notice. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar told TOI that inspector Khan and constable Yadav were dismissed under Section 8 (2) (b) of the UP Police Officers of Subordinate Ranks (Punishment and Appeal) Rules, 1991, which allows an officer above the rank of inspector general to “dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank if he is satisfied that for some reason, it is not reasonably practicable to hold such inquiry”. “It is a rare action and has been taken because the image of the police has been affected,” Kumar said. Former police officers said the bribery allegations were serious and needed to be thoroughly investigated for deeper links. “This (bribery scandal) came to because a police team from the neighbouring district shot off a report to the headquarters,” a former officer said. Ghaziabad police had on November 29 arrested five members of the gang that allegedly used malware to hack into ATMs across the country. During interrogation, the accused claimed they had been caught by Noida police in August but let off after a bribe of Rs 20 lakh and a Creta. The Ghaziabad cops obtained CCTV footage of SWAT personnel outside the alleged hideout of the ATM hackers’ gang. ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said that the police headquarters has taken cognizance of Ghaziabad police’s findings. “The headquarters has taken note of the issue and directed the Noida police commissioner to conduct an inquiry and submit the report within three days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/11-cops-under-scanner-for-taking-bribe-from-atm-gang-untraceable/articleshow/88038977.cms||Shikha Salaria

Currently, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has nearly 50,000 Covaxin doses but these are mostly available in 10 or 20 unit vials.When TOI visited NMC’s Pachpaoli Maternity Home vaccination centre in the afternoon, the staff asked Covaxin seekers to either wait till 10 persons are available or come on Thursday morning. “We can’t open the vial for one or two persons,” the staff said. When TOI informed higher officials, they ask the Pachpaoli Hospital staff not to send back anyone. A woman said she had come for first dose. “I couldn’t take the jab due to pregnancy. I have a six-month-old baby. I will have to come again tomorrow leaving him at home,” she said.Ambedkar Hospital staff said the doses were over by 3pm. The staff said many people couldn’t take the Covaxin shots today.Centres continued to witness heavy rush on Wednesday too with many centres again falling short of both Covishield and Covaxin doses. Centres had to divert stock to keep the drive going. The Nagpur district again crossed 50,000 mark with city carrying out over 20,000 vaccinations.The rush was witnessed mainly in the morning hours while it started receding post lunch. Officials said the beneficiaries queued up since early morning, apprehending that the free first dose would soon be stopped. The NMC is non-committal on its plan to stop free first dose under the fresh challenges posed by new variant Omicron.While vaccination for Covishield went on after even after 4pm, Covaxin beneficiaries were a disappointed lot. The city’s daily Covaxin demand is not more than 2,000 doses. Officials said the PHD has been sending 20 dose vials despite their requests to allocate smaller unit vials.A top official of Ambedkar Hospital said the NMC provided 300 doses and all were utilized. “Earlier, we were getting 200 per day and all would be consumed. We had written to the NMC to provide us one dose vial or units less than 20 doses. Single dose vials will be better and no one would be sent back or asked to wait,” he said.Asked about short vaccination duration, the official said, “We shall increase the timing by half an hour from Thursday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-sent-back-from-vaccination-centres-sorry-cant-open-20-dose-covaxin-vials/articleshow/88036854.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Recently, the state government had issued an 11-point guideline in which it reiterated that places frequently visited by a large number of people need to be cleaned with disinfectant. At the beginning of the pandemic, disinfectants were regularly used at public institutions and even government and private offices.Doctors also used to say that fomites or dried droplets on surfaces need to be cleaned with disinfectants. But of late, the trend of disinfecting surfaces has been shunned as fear of Covid infection subsided.Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat said disinfecting surfaces is no more valid. “Covid-apt behaviour includes distancing, mask and sanitizer. How much disinfecting can be done? It is not possible. I agree that the government is right in making surgical or N95 mask, not a handkerchief, compulsory. It is a matter of research how long the virus can survive on plain surface. There are many assumptions and we were required to follow the disinfection rules in the beginning when nothing was known. Now, person to person contact has to be prevented. I don’t think people should follow surface disinfection any more,” he said.Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde too said surface cleaning is no more relevant in prevention of Covid19. “A lot has changed between March 2020 to December 2021. Disinfectant use has been dismissed by many scientific societies. Maximum transmission takes place through the air. Once a person send the virus in air, others inhale it, mostly in close contact. Surface virus doesn’t survive for long. Surface transmission is probably one percent,” Dr Shinde said.Internal medicine expert Dr Mohan Nerker agreed that surface spread does not pose any major risk but cautioned that fomites may be possible carriers. “Droplet infection causes spread more easily. So best is to cover your face and wash your hands. If we follow these precautions, we don’t need to bother much about surface cleaning,” he said.Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said the virus can’t replicate outside the human body. “It sustains as a particle on fomites, from where it travels inside the human. So personal hygiene is more important,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/surface-disinfection-no-longer-relevant-in-covid-prevention-doctors/articleshow/88036861.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Nagpur||Sr citizens neglected due to withering jt family system: HC||Nagpur: Expressing concern over withering of the joint family system, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court said a large number of senior citizens are not being looked after by their children after separation. A division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and Pushpa Ganediwala ruled that the maintenance tribunals for addressing grievances of senior citizens against their families could cancel gifted properties to their children, if the latter failed to take their care as per the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. While hearing a plea filed by a 77-year-old retired person from the city against his wife, two sons and a daughter for neglecting him, the judges said, “Ageing has become a major social challenge and there is a need to give more attention to the care and protection of elderly persons.” “Consequently, many older persons, particularly widowed women, are now forced to spend their twilight years all alone. They are exposed to emotional neglect and lack of physical and financial support. Though the parents can claim maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the procedure is both time-consuming as well as expensive. Hence, there is a need to have simple, inexpensive, and speedy provisions to claim maintenance for parents,” they said. The petitioner had challenged the tribunal’s verdict that declined maintenance to him from his children and also his prayer to cancel the gift deed of August 1, 2019, made in favour of his wife and children. Quoting the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, the bench said it was enacted to provide more effective provision for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognized under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. “The statement of objects and reasons refers to how traditional norms and values of Indian society laid stress on providing care for the elderly.” Pointing out that the petitioner has an alternate and efficacious remedy by way of an appeal to the appellate tribunal, the judges said the statement of objects and reasons accompanying the bill, which ultimately became the said Act in 2007, proposed to cast an obligation on the persons who inherit the property of their aged relatives to maintain them and also proposes to make provisions for setting up old-age homes for providing maintenance to indigent older persons. “The statement of objects and reasons also refers to the provision for better medical facilities to senior citizens and provisions for the protection of their life and property. There is further reference to an appropriate mechanism to be set up to provide need-based maintenance to the parents and senior citizens, better medical facilities, institutionalization of a suitable mechanism for protection of life, property of older persons and setting up of old-age homes in every district,” the judges said, before referring the case to lawyer Sumant Deopujari for resolving the family dispute through mediation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sr-citizens-neglected-due-to-withering-jt-family-system-hc/articleshow/88038426.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Vijayawada||Accident claims hit 5-year low in 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: The number of motor accident insurance claims settled or booked in 2020-21 in Andhra Pradesh was the lowest since 2016. The third-party insurance claim settlements witnessed a steep decline of about 50 per cent in 2020-21 compared to the year before, according to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) on the basis of data submitted by the insurers. Similar was the case with the quantum of compensation paid to the claimants in the last five years in Andhra Pradesh. In absolute numbers, as many as 18,308 claims were intimated or booked in 2019-20 in Andhra Pradesh. This dropped to 12,470 during the corresponding period last fiscal. According to experts, this can be attributed to the nation-wide lockdown during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and mobility restrictions, and the subsequent reduction in the number of road accidents. For instance, there was a 16% drop in the number of accidents in Andhra Pradesh in 2020 compared to the year before. The state reported 15,512 overall road accidents last year against 18,462 accidents in 2019. Correspondingly, the death toll slid to 5,174 from 6,257 during this timeframe, representing a 17% decline. Even the national figures reflected the same trend with a drop in the number of insurance claims. The number of claims stood in India at 4,87,085 in 2019-20. This number declined to 3,78,343 last fiscal. Interestingly, the top three claimant states in terms of insurance settlement numbers in 2020-21 are located in south India. Kerala settled the highest numbers of claims at 52,301, followed by Tamil Nadu (48,036) and Karnataka (43,653). The number of claims in the majority of the north-eastern states was limited to double-digit numbers in 2020-21. As per section 149 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, upon receipt of information of an accident, the insurance company shall designate an officer to settle the claims related to such accident. The officer will make an offer to the claimant for settlement before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal within 30 days. If the claimant accepts such an offer, the Tribunal shall make a record of such settlement and the insurance company shall make payment within 30 days from the receipt of such record of settlement. And if the claimant rejects such an offer, the Tribunal shall fix a date of hearing to adjudicate the claim on merits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/accident-claims-hit-5-year-low-in-2020-21/articleshow/88036897.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

When Deshmukh’s counsel Anita Castellino sought information from Waze as to who normally briefs the home minister, he said it all depends on the minister’s order. “I met him following official message. I do not remember if I was called for unofficial purpose or work,’’ Waze told the commission during the cross examination. Further Waze explained at length the procedure for securing entry in Mantralaya when the officer is called for official purpose or otherwise. “I do not know if a record is kept at the Mantralaya entry gate for officials or outsiders,’’ Waze said. It was Waze’s third consecutive day of cross examination. In the past, Waze had told the commission on how he knew Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande and his suffering when he was in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate.  Now, his statement will be recorded on December 13. On the application submitted by Parambir Singh’s counsel Anukul Seth, he was granted exemption from appearance before the commission.

---||Varanasi||Transparency, time-bound executiontwo hallmarks of KV Dham project||Revised Varanasi: The grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham (Corridor) project has neared completion in a time-bound manner with utmost transparency as per the directives issued by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to realise the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of restoring the ancient glory of Kashi, Varanasi divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal said here on Wednesday. Talking to reporters, the commissioner said, “Built over a sprawling area of 5,000 hectares, the corridor has decongested the temple complex, which was earlier surrounded by buildings on three sides. The project will connect the two things Varanasi is famous for — Kashi Vishwanath Temple and river Ganga.” Giving details of the project, Agarwal said that when the project was conceptualised it was considered an impossible task considering the dense structure of the temple premises. “However, with the organised and dedicated efforts of both the Centre and the state governments, and despite two waves of Covid-19 pandemic, the entire process is being completed in record time with utmost transparency.” “To start with, the Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (KVSADB) was entrusted with the task of planning and execution of the project. The project was taken forward on a war-footing right from getting the properties vacated to compensating the owners,” he said adding, “The execution of the project was done in the most transparent manner, as a result of which the project faced no litigations.” According to him, the demolition of buildings around the temple led to the recovery of at least 40 very ancient temples which were buried under other constructions around them. People had built kitchens, bathrooms and much more atop these ancient temples. “Centuries-old ancient temples, earlier hidden, are now visible. They will be preserved and will be opened to the public,” he said. Another area of concern was a direct link between Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT) and the river Ganga. “Now, with a direct link between the temple and the Ganga, one can reach the temple premises within minutes, without going around in the lanes. It will give the KV temple complex a new and spacious look.” The architect of the project, Bimal Patel, said that without tampering the original structure of the temple, the beautification work has been done and facilities for tourists have been increased. “The work includes construction of Temple Chowk, Varanasi city gallery, museum, multi-purpose auditoriums, hall, devotee facilitation centre, public convenience, salvation home, Godowlia gate, Bhogshala, shelter for priests and sevadars, spiritual book space, and others. About 70% of the 5.50 lakh sqft area of the project would be kept open for the green cover,” said Patel. The commissioner further said that a total of around Rs 800-crore has been spent on the entire project which includes Rs 70-crore spent on the rehabilitation of people living in the area. “Even during the time of construction entry was not prohibited to the site for complete transparency and public participation,” he said. The PM laid the foundation of the corridor in March 2019. For the project, over 300 buildings were purchased and demolished. The state government constituted the board to expedite the work on it. The CM inspected the project work around three dozen times. The idea behind the project is to preserve existing heritage structures, provide new facilities in the temple complex in the public-private partnership mode, ease the traffic and movement of people around the temple and connect the temple with ghats with direct visibility. Hundreds of small temples have been made a part of the corridor. The project ensures easy pedestrian movement for pilgrims with the least wait, travel and walking time, and comfortable holding zones, as well as crowd management and emergency operational procedures and better experiences around the religious rituals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/transparency-time-bound-executiontwo-hallmarks-of-kv-dham-project/articleshow/88037718.cms||---

But it rejected a similar default bail plea of 8 co-accused-Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira. ‘Bharadwaj exercised right & sought default bail, others delayed’Law professor and activist Sudha Bharadwaj (59), who was arrested on August 28, 2018, in the Elgar Parishad case, was granted default bail by the Bombay high court on Wednesday. She was initially kept under house arrest on court orders and that period, the HC said, stood excluded from the 90 days granted by law for the prosecuting agency to file its chargesheet. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has accused Bharadwaj and eight other arrested accused of alleged Maoist links and booked them under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Bharadwaj is lodged in Byculla women’s prison. The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar directed she be produced before the special NIA court on December 6 so that it can set her bail amount and conditions. Default bail is a right of an accused to seek liberty when police or any special agency fails to file the chargesheet within the legally mandated deadline. It is not on the merits of the case. The HC cited the UAPA Act which, it said, expressly confers the power to extend the period of detention up to 180 days on the ‘court’ having jurisdiction to try such offences—the special NIA court in this case. It said only in the absence of such special courts being designated would the sessions court have the jurisdiction. But as pointed out by Bharadwaj’s counsel Yug Chaudhry, special courts were constituted in Pune. The HC noted that Bharadwaj had exercised her right under the law and applied for default bail on November 26, 2018, on the grounds that 90 days after her arrest had expired, no chargesheet had been filed. On November 26, 2018, Pune additional sessions court judge K D Vadane extended her remand by another 90 days under the NIA Act and the agency got 180 days to file chargesheet. But the HC had earlier held that the days spent in house custody are to be excluded from the judicial remand, hence the initial 90-day custody expired on January 25, 2019. But till then, the NIA had not filed its chargesheet against her or even Rao, Gonsalves and Ferriera. The additional chargesheet against them was filed on February 21, 2019. The eight other accused had sought default bail on the grounds that they had been in custody for over 180 days with no proper cognizance of the chargesheet against them. Their custody was extended by 90 days by the Pune additional sessions judge “without jurisdiction’’, noted the HC. But it held that its declaration that the extension was not lawful “is of no assistance’’ as they “did not avail of the right to be released on default bail by filing an application after the expiry of the initial period of 90 days and before the lodging of the chargesheet on February 21, 2019’’. The bench said, “Where the accused fails to apply for default bail… and subsequently a chargesheet is filed before the magistrate, the right to default bail would get extinguished as the accused has not availed such right.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bharadwaj-exercised-right-sought-default-bail-others-delayed/articleshow/88038402.cms||Swati Deshpande

Bhamidipaty, however, held ground to log the biggest upset of the tournament.Bhosale, 25, ranked 534, had to work her way through her match against qualifier Shreya Tatavarthy. The 21-year-old from Hyderabad called the trainer on court early in the second set to attend to her lower back. The top seed came through 6-4, 6-3. While Bhosale broke in the ninth game of the opening set before serving it out, she did well to negotiate her opponent’s powerful ground game. In the second set, the top seed was more in control of the play as her opponent’s challenge wilted. The 22-year-old Yadlapalli, now ranked 782, but was as high as No. 265 two years ago before a series of injuries checked her progress, put out the battling Sharmada Balu 6-0, 7-5. While there were no surprises for either player in the Yadlapalli-Balu exchange, both have been training at the Rohan Bopanna Tennis Academy, the latter took time to hit stride. The duo stayed in step in the second set, before Yadlapalli broke in the seventh game, but struggled with her own serve for the score to inch to four-all.Balu then had chances to level set scores in the tenth game, but Yadlapalli held serve and nerve before closing the match with a forehand winner in the 12th game.Results: (I round; Indian unless mentioned): Zlata Yankovskaya (Rus) bt Saumya Vig 7-5, 7-5; Reshma Maruri bt Ashmitha Easwaramurthi 6-1, 6-3; Sai Samhitha Chamarthi bt Elena Jamshidi (Den) 6-2, 6-2; Sowjanya Bavisetty bt Snehal Mane 6-1, 6-2; Rutuja Bhosale bt Shreya Tatavarthy 6-4, 6-3; Prathyusha Rachapudi bt Renne Singla 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3; Yubarani Banerjee bt Arthi Muniyan 6-3, 6-0; Pranjala Yadapalli bt Sharmada Balu 6-0, 7-5; Sathwika Sama bt Sravya Shivani Chilakalapudi 3-6, 6-3, 6-2; Akanksha Dileep Nitture bt Humera Baharmus 6-1, 6-1; Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipathy bt Zeel Desai 6-3, 7-5; Pratibha Narayan Prasad bt Sai Deepa Yedulla 6-3, 7-5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/rutuja-pranjala-prevail/articleshow/88039482.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka opener Vrinda makes opportunity count||Bengaluru: On December 2, 2018, teenager Vrinda Dinesh’s budding cricket career was at the crossroads. On the day, she had scored seven runs against Gujarat for Karnataka in the BCCI senior women’s One-Day Trophy. In the previous match against Bengal, her maiden outing, she had returned a mere eight runs. It put her place in the team under the scanner and she failed to make the playing XI for 22 matches thereafter. Cut to 2021, on the same day, she is preparing to represent India ‘A’ at the BCCI Challenger Trophy beginning in Vijayawada on Saturday.The turnaround in the 20-year-old’s career came about in the same tournament this year. Having earned her place back in the playing line-up, the top-order batter made the opportunity count. The opener scored a patient 135-ball 100 against Uttar Pradesh on October 31, her first ever century. The Bengaluru girl didn’t stop there. The next day she scored a 113-ball 104 against Pondicherry and two days later smashed back-to-back unbeaten fifties against Chhattisgarh (67) and Baroda (69). In the tournament, in which Karnataka ended up as runners-up, Vrinda scored 348 runs from six innings at an average of 87, emerging the top run-getter for the state.“It was quite depressing when you are not part of the side and later no cricket happened because of Covid-19. However, I worked hard, followed my routine, maintained fitness and once the restrictions relaxed I worked with my coach. That way, I was fully ready for the call and the hard work paid off,” said Vrinda. Currently in quarantine, Vrinda pointed out that the focus was on keeping it simple and enjoying the game. “I am not going to let the pressure of Challenger affect me. I am looking forward to doing well. I hope the performance would help me get into the national side.” “This will be a great opportunity for me to understand how players from different parts of the country are approaching the game, how they handle situations and how to bring out the best in you when the team wants it. It is also an opportunity to tap into the experience of international cricketers,” added Vrinda, who trains under Kiran Uppoor at Nice Cricket Academy in Yelahanka.Influenced by cricketers in the family, Vrinda took up the sport at the age of 13. Her father S Dinesh and brother Rajath played club cricket while uncle Bharath Bhushan represented Karnataka at the U-19 and U-22 levels. Vrinda showed her flair for the sport quickly and was selected for the state U-19 squad the same year and later captained U-16 and U-19 sides. She started as a medium-pacer and later switched to batting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-opener-vrinda-makes-opportunity-count/articleshow/88039483.cms||Harigovind

In the plea submitted on November 23 for his interim release from Decemb-er 4, Anand said his mother is over 90 years old and his presence by her side would be a great moral support, and the gathering of all family members would be a solace to one another. While Anand has been in jail in the Elgar Parishad case since April 2020, Milind was an absconding accused. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty had opposed the plea. Meanwhile, co-accused Surendra Gadling has submitted pleas for allowing him a plastic table and chair and a personal shaving kit in prison. The court has directed the jail authorities to submit replies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/teltumbdes-interim-bail-plea-rejected/articleshow/88038422.cms||---

From Thursday onwards, the airport operator will be able to facilitate 700 covid tests in an hour. The decision was taken following a meeting chaired by Cial managing director S Suhas on Wednesday. Cial decided to incorporate both rapid PCR and RT-PCR tests to ensure hassle-free passenger movement in the international arrival area. At present, Cial has the capacity of conducting 350 RT-PCR tests per hour. In addition to this, rapid PCR testing facilities will be arranged for 350 tests per hour, taking the total capacity to 700 tests per hour. “As per the latest guidelines issued by the central health and family welfare ministry, all passengers arriving from risk countries have to be tested at the airport and will have to wait at the holding area till the result comes. Health authorities informed that the RT-PCR test results could be delivered in 5 hours, whereas the rapid PCR result will be delivered in 30 minutes. Passengers will have the option to choose between RT-PCR and rapid PCR as per their requirements. They have to pay the testing charge as prescribed by the government,” a statement from Cial said. If the result is negative, the passenger can leave the airport and have to be in quarantine for seven days. The samples of those turning positive would be sent for genome sequencing laboratories under the aegis of the Indian SARS Covid-2 Genomic Consortium for further analysis. Positive patients will be admitted to a separate isolation facility and given treatment as per standard protocols. A special holding area has been set up for passengers to wait at the terminal to get the results delivered.

It was the 2016 Olympics that created the spark in her. Now this 16-year-old from Vattiyoorkavu is a proud girl who won gold medal at the 56th Junior Artistic Gymnastic Championship held in Jammu and she is the first gymnast from Kerala to achieve this feat. She also won the all-round championship and gold medal for vault table and bronze medal in floor exercise. “I decided to join the gymnastics coaching when I saw my younger brother doing a few gymnastic tricks. I was not really interested at first. Later, watching the 2016 Olympics, I decided to take this seriously and it became my aim. My goal is to participate in the Olympics,” said Meharin S Saj. She is pursuing her 10th-grade classes from Cotton Hill Government Higher Secondary School. She started to attend gymnastics coaching at the age of nine along with her younger brother Minhaj. She was able to balance her academic and gymnastics training by adjusting the timings. The gymnastics coaching is scheduled in the evening after the school time. She has also started to balance her diet to make her body fit. She avoided oily and junk foods and has also started to do dance workouts to reduce body weight. Five competitors from each state participated in the competition and she is the only one from Kerala to win this championship. This year’s competition was her fourth attempt and it was a dream come true moment for her. In previous years, she was able to get selected to the final rounds. She has been attending the coaching classes under trainer Jayakumar D. He has been giving coaching for the students from 30 years at D J Sports Club, Vattiyoorkavu. “I am extremely happy and proud of my daughter’s achievement. I would like to convey my gratitude to her coach Jayakumar D for motivating and supporting her to reach high levels of achievements,”said Sajudeen H, Meharin’s father. “I have been coaching gymnastics for the past 30 years and I have not seen a student with such great potential. I am sure that she can achieve her dream to participate in the Olympics and make India proud. She is very hardworking and dedicated to gymnastics,” said Jayakumar D. She is also preparing to compete in the “Khelo India Championship” which will be held in Haryana.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Village secretariats are now sub-registrar offices too||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has issued orders delegating the powers of sub-registrars to village panchayat secretaries attached to village and ward secretariats. As village and ward secretariats have become familiar and closer to the people, the government has taken the decision to delegate these powers. Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan issued the orders giving exemption to beneficiaries from user charges on sale deeds to be executed for the houses distributed under the flagship programme of One Time Settlement of the housing department. The governor also gave exemption from stamp duty remitting the same in favour of the beneficiaries. The village secretariats in the rural areas and ward secretariats in the municipal areas would now become sub-registrar offices. These offices are now authorised to handle the registration of houses for the poor under one-time settlement scheme introduced by the government. The government has taken this decision to clear the pending loans on houses for the poor, and register the houses under one-time settlement scheme across the state. The governor has appointed panchayat secretaries and ward administrative secretaries in the state as sub-registrars to discharge functions of the sub-registrar for the purpose of registration of documents under one-time settlement scheme of the housing department. The state government has offered the beneficiaries to pay one-time amount from the pending housing loans since 1983. The successive governments have given houses to the beneficiaries across the state with loan through the housing department. However, the beneficiaries have not paid their loans over the years as no government had looked into the issue. Because of this, the housing department had not issued ownership pattas to the beneficiaries to mortgage with the banks for loans or sell them for their financial requirement.

These passengers will be selected at random and asked to take either a RT-PCR or a Rapid RT-PCR, said Dr Anuradha Medoju, senior regional director (MoHFW) and incharge of Airport Health Organisation (APHO) for Telangana and AP, on Wednesday. The list of these countries include Azerbaijan, Armenia, Sweden, Russia, Greece, Ireland among others. “In fact, for the last one month we have been screening passengers from all these countries — including the ones at-risk— at the Hyderabad airport. We started this even before the recent health ministry guidelines were issued,” Dr Medoju said sharing data collated between October 25 and November 27. According to it, as many as 3,096 international passengers from these destinations underwent Covid-19 tests at RGIA, on arrival, during this period. “None of them tested positive,” the official said. But unlike earlier, when these flyers were allowed to submit samples and exit airport — reports were later mailed to them — they will now have to wait at facility for test results. “This can take four to six hours. In case a passenger tests positive he/she will immediately be shipped to institutional quarantine facility set up by government,” Medoju said. She added: “We have also decided to screen people seated in vicinity of a Covid-19 positive passenger — three rows in the front and three rows at the back — as part of contact tracing. In case any of these flyers also test positive, they too will be sent to institutional quarantine. If not, they will be asked to home quarantine for seven days and report back to health authorities. If they still do not have any symptoms, they will be advised to stay home for another week.” Dr Medoju appealed to public to refrain from travelling if sick.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/covid-check-on-pax-to-be-widened-at-rgia/articleshow/88037738.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The PM will also inaugurate Gorakhpur AIIMS and 9 high tech labs of Regional Research Medical Centre (RMRC) at BRD Medical College from the fertilizer plant’s premises on the same day. He will also address a public meet from the same stage. “We have worked hard with the Gorakhpur administration, state government and central government and the most awaited day has come as our fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur is ready for inauguration. PM Modi took a review of the project in which CM Yogi and people of state administration were also present. The secretary from Gorakhpur plant was also there in the meeting,” Gupta said. “PM Modi will inaugurate the plant on December 7. However, the time schedule hasn’t been decided yet, but it may be inaugurated between 1pm-3pm,” he added. The fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur is the dream project of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as he has worked hard for the plant for 19 years. In 1968, The Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI) was established and but was closed after an incident in 1990. The government then showed no interest in running the plant again. In 1998, when CM became MP, he raised the voice regarding fertilizer plant in parliament and continued it till 2014 and on July 22, 2016, PM Modi laid the foundation stone of new fertilizer plant in Gorakhpur. After becoming the CM of the state, Yogi expedited the construction of the plant and it was not even hindered by corona wave, said an employee of FCI, Vineet Pathak. The plant will produce neem coated urea and it has world’s tallest prilling tower of 149.5 meter and will create 10 thousand direct and indirect employment opportunities. More than 30% jobs in the plant have been given to youth of Purvanchal area which includes more girls. The production capacity of the plant is 3850 metric tonne per day and 12.7 lakh metric tonne per year. It will also produce 2200 metric tonne liquid ammonia per day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-modi-will-inaugurate-fertilizer-plant-on-dec-7-hurl-md/articleshow/88037739.cms||---

Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma convened a meeting with municipal commissioner Pranay Singh, Varanasi Municipal Corporations corporators, in-charges of offices of Central and state government including CPWD, PWD, NHAI, railway, BLW, CRPF, CISF, NDRF, civil defence, Indian Medical Association, Red Cross Society, office-bearers of traders unions, social and voluntary organisations to chalk out a work-plan for celebrating the occasion on the lines of Diwali and Dev Deepawali. Agrawal said, “Mega celebrations for the opening of KV Dham by the PM will commence from December 12 and continue till December 14. It has to be observed like the festivals of Diwali and Dev Deepawali with the cooperation of all natives of Kashi.” He called upon the participants to mobilize people to present an image of Kashi as per its stature before the world. “All government, commercial, hotel and institutional buildings should be cleaned and decorated beautifully with lights. Cash prizes for the best three decorated buildings will also be given,” he said. The strategy for ensuring distribution of ‘prasad’ of KV temple and booklets containing history of the shrine at each home of the district was also discussed with the participants. The DM said that apart from buildings, electric poles, crossings, residential homes and complexes and boats will also be decorated and people would be appealed to light earthen lamps on this occasion. He also directed a special sanitation drive in the district. He said that opening of KV Dham will boost the district’s economy, hence it is also the responsibility of all to take part in the efforts of exhibiting a better image of the city before the world. The CP said, “Apart from the three-day main event, a series of celebrations and arrival of VIPs including governors, chief ministers of many states, foreign delegates and also pilgrims would continue for one and half months. Hence, streamlining traffic arrangements would be a major task.” To achieve this task, he sought cooperation of traders, vehicle owners especially of four-wheelers to avoid improper parking of vehicles. The officials also sought suggestions from participants for improvement in the traffic scene and assured them that basic problems like repairing of roads and removal of encroachment would be done before the mega event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/diwali-like-celebrations-planned-ahead-of-kv-dham-opening-by-pm/articleshow/88037744.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The ward, due to its prime locations, is among the major commercial hotspots compared to other civilian areas in the Cantonment. Many residents, from over a dozen residential colonies in the West Marredpally area, who go for morning walks are irked over the closure of Wellington Road (towards AOC Circle from Picket) are irked over the LMA’s arbitrary closure of the Wellington Gate whenver they receive a red alert from headquarters. “We want to get rid of the Army’s restrictions over civilians. Merging the civilian areas with GHMC is the only solution apart from shifting the military installations to the AOC other areas,” B Ramesh Babu, a resident of Jyothi Colony who regularly uses the stretch for his morning walks, told TOI. Meanwhile, the proposal to construct a skyway near Secunderabad under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) is yet to take off. Traffic congestion is a major problem on the road along the wall of Secunderabad Club which sees nearly 1.5 lakh commuters daily. While water supply issues are relatively lower in this area compared to other areas, several households do face erratic supply and have to pay abnormal tariffs. The Picket nala, which passes through ten colonies, the second-longest in the Cantonment after the one in Hasmathpet, can also become a hindrance for residents in the area. “We have experienced severe flooding twice — in 2000 and 2020 — but SCB could not find a permanent solution. The nala needs to be widened and retaining walls must be built along its 3.5-km e length to prevent such situations,” said Rukmini Devi, resident of Akula Narayana Colony. “The strengthening of Picket nala’s walls is a long-standing demand. While the SCB has demolished major encroachments which were obstructing the flow of sewer water, in certain areas, the nala is still quite narrow,” said former ward member Nalini Kiran. Kiran said that while water supply network has been covered extensively, erratic supply is still an issue. “There is also huge demand among residents for the 20-KL free water supply scheme and we can avail this once a merger with GHMC is done,” she added.

There has also been massive cutting of trees and hills close to the lake even as a new concrete road is being laid with storm water drains, a concrete wall on the lakeside and a Gabian wall lining the hills that have been cut. The road, which is being developed, is part of environment minister Aditya Thackeray's ambitious 39km cycling track from Mulund to Wadala along the Tansa water pipeline. When TOI visited the site, work was underway on the Tulsi water mains but not on the road. The Bombay high court has ordered a stay on the cycling track. Large mounds of debris, earth and stones can be seen at different places close to the lake as also huge boulders, clearly indicating that hills have been cut. The area is visibly a forest as there are a large number of trees on the hills. The hills slope down towards the lake. Monsoon streams flowing down the hills fill the lake. TimesViewPromoting cycling to work or for leisure has become a worldwide phenomenon and it is certainly good for the environment. To introduce a cycling track by destroying the environment, which will impact the city adversely, is not a fine idea. One at the cost of the other is never a good proposition. Discussion and debate help push forth sustainable ideas. The area around Vihar lake must be restored and conserved.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal forwarded TOI’s queries on the activities (and whether the BMC had requisite permissions) to hydraulic engineer Ajay Rathore, who in turn forwarded the queries to the assistant engineer in charge of Vihar lake. While TOI was promised the BMC would revert after a site inspection, there has been no response yet. G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, Sanjay Gandhi National Park, said the area is not part of the forest department’s land. “The Forest Conservation Act is very stringent. No part of the work is being carried out on forest land,” he said. To reach this road, if coming through Aarey Colony, one has to reach Saki Vihar road and turn left just where the Tulsi water main goes over the road. Entry to the road is from Kailash Nagar, a slum to the rear of Hotel Renaissance. The road runs close to Powai lake for a short distance and then between Pipeline Road and the back of IIT, and further up along Vihar lake going towards Tembipada in Bhandup. To the rear of Hotel Renaissance, the road branches off into a deer park. This arm is still incomplete. The new road is for around 2.5km. At a couple of places iron grills with a cyclist motif have been put up as also an arch across the road. “The hills have been cut to create the new road adjacent to an existing rail track used by the water supply department to attend to leakages on the trunk mains. The hills have been cut in step form so that seeing from the road one does not realise the actual height of the hills,” said Amrita Bhattacharjee of the Aarey Conservation Group which is opposed to the cycling track. Environmentalist Debi Goenka said the area is certainly part of the eco-sensitive zone. He said cutting trees and demolishing parts of hills will only increase siltation in the lake. He said constructing a road along the city’s drinking water lake is a bad idea. “It will eventually lead to the destruction of the lake and the city will need a second desalination plant,” he said.

Accompanied by winds, the rains pushed temperatures down considerably forcing a few to bring out the woollens besides raincoats to deal with the weather. Owing to western disturbance, some parts of the state including Vadodara, Aravalli, Anand, Narmada, Bharuch, Tapi, Amreli and Bhavnagar were slated to receive heavy rainfall. Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said, day temperatures will drop due to the wet spell. But what’s winter in Gujarat if there isn’t weather-friendly food to set the mood? And so, piping hot bhajiyas set the mood right for a few urbanites who enjoyed the cool temperature with long drives amid the rains. But, sadly the unexpected and unseasonal wet spell didn’t have the same affect for the farmers who were left worried about potential crop loss. “Our crop will suffer major damage from the unseasonal rains. We grow cotton, tuver (pigeon peas) and a variety of vegetables on our farmland. We hope the government compensates us for our loss,” said Bhaskar Patel, chairman of Padra APMC. If the vegetable crops suffer major damage, prices of veggies may shoot up in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/unseasonal-rains-leave-tillers-worried-about-loss-of-produce/articleshow/88036823.cms||---

Senior police officials said that the booklets would help negligent bikers understand the importance of following traffic rules and the need to use helmets. The city police has decided to conduct counselling sessions-cum examination of helmet-less bikers at 12 different locations and the bikers would be given the booklets at the sessions. Though the counselling and tests were to start from Wednesday, it could not get underway owing to continuous rainfall in the city. ACP Sitaram Gaikwad of the city traffic branch said that the counselling and exams of such bikers could not be taken on Wednesday due to the rainfall. Nonetheless, these sessions would start anytime now. On spotting helmet-less bikers, they would be made to undergo a two-hour counselling session and appear for an exam on traffic rules and helmet. Further, such bikers would be made to undergo a written test on traffic rules and use of helmet, which they have to pass with minimum 50% marks. If they fail in the exam, they would again have to undergo the two-hour programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-print-25000-booklets-on-traffic-rules-for-bikers-caught-helmetless/articleshow/88036111.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The TOI had published a news report on the issue on November 30. The staffer of the private hospital in the city had accused the SMO of sexually harassing her by passing lewd comments at her during a vaccination camp organised by the health department in Model Town over a week ago. She had also lodged a written complaint with chief medical officer (CMO) SP Singh. The 28-year-old complainant said, “I have been working with the private hospital for the past seven months. The health department had approached our hospital for providing staff to organize vaccination camps. Some of the hospital staff members and I have been working with the health department teams and organizing Covid vaccination camps.”“On November 22, one such camp was organized in Model Town. During that camp, the SMO asked me to come to his cabin. When I went there, he started passing lewd comments at me. He said he would take me to a flat. I went numb and could not say anything for a few seconds. When I came out of his cabin, I told my colleagues about it. They suggested that I should take up the matter with the senior officials. The next day, I talked to the senior officials in the hospital and they gave me permission to lodge a complaint against him,” she addedPunjab State Women Commission chairperson Manisha Gulati, said, “I have sought a report from the health officials. They have also been directed to get an inquiry conducted by a senior official in this case.” Chief medical officer SP Singh said, “The SMO had not received the copy of the complaint.

---||Kanpur||Do you want Yogi sarkar or a yogya sarkar, Akhilesh asks people in Banda||Jhansi: Addressing a public meeting in Banda on Wednesday, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav described the ruling BJP as “inefficient” and asked those present if they want “a Yogi government or a ‘yogya’ (efficient) government”. He said people in Bundelkhand supported the BJP in the 2017 and 2019 polls, but the government did not for the poor and farmers of Bundelkhand. Time has come to show them the door, he added. Accusing the ruling BJP of having failed to come to the rescue of the immigrants from Bundelkhand, who had to walk hundreds of kilometres to reach home during the pandemic lockdown, Akhilesh cited instances where migrants were left to fend for themselves by the government. “Some of them lost their lives but the government did not come forward to help them. Samajwadi people reached out to them and helped them with Rs 1 lakh because we feel and care for the poor. The government has turned a blind eye to the plight of the families of farmers who are committing suicide,” he said. The former UP CM then went on to say: “Pariwar wale hi pariwar walon ka dukh dard samajh sakte hain … Jinke paas pariwar nahi hai .. wo aapki parwah nahi karenge (we have families and understand the ordeal of the families who lose their family members in such a situation. Those who don’t have a family will never understand the pain and look after you as a family).” The SP national president reached Banda on Wednesday morning on day one of his three-day Bundelkhand tour as a part of election campaign on board his Vijay Rath, which received a rousing welcome from party workers and supporters. Taking a jibe at recent claims of the ruling BJP that the party has a “dumdaar sarkar” (gutsy government), Akhilesh said the reality is that the ruling BJP excels in speaking “dumdaar jhoot” (bold lies). The SP chief cited the instances where BJP leaders on “responsible positions in the government” used photographs of a fly-over in Kolkata, a factory in America to claim that they got it built. “Recently they released a photograph claiming that it is a dam in Bundelkhand, but the image was of a dam situated elsewhere,” he pointed out. He also alleged that the recent leak of TET papers was deliberately done by the existing government so that they may not have to give jobs. “This is a government of bulldozers which is ruining everything but now the people will throw it out by the bulldozer of their votes. Remember that this flower is an artificial one having no smell.” After the rally, SP chief went on to meet the parents of Aman Tripathi, who was found murdered in Banda last month at the site where they are sitting on dharna for many days demanding a CBI enquiry for justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/do-you-want-yogi-sarkar-or-a-yogya-sarkar-akhilesh-asks-people-in-banda/articleshow/88037753.cms||---

The information came to light on Wednesday when the defence side demanded in the court to remove Bheekha’s name by giving an application with regard to his death. At the same time, one other accused Vishwanath alias Putani and Shyambabu appeared in the court. After hearing the defence and prosecution, the court has fixed December 13 for hearing the case. On February 14, 1981, a gang of 35 to 36 people including Phoolan Devi, Mustakim, Ram Autar and Lallu had carried out the incident of robbery in Behmai village of Sikandra police station area in Kanpur Dehat.

Around 16 accused, including the main accused Phoolan Devi, have died and cases against them have been abated. One of the alleged dacoits, Posa, is in jail while three other accused — Shaym Babu, Vishwanath and Bheekha — are out on bail. The trial had started on August 24, 2012, against four accused — Bheekha, Posay alias Posa, Vishwanath alias Putani alias Krishna Swaroop and Shyambabu. The hearing of the case is going on in the additional district and sessions court, special judge (anti-dacoity), Sudhakar Rai.

Narsingi police registered a cheating case and arrested Shilpa and her husband on November 27. The second complaint against the couple was from Priyadarshini alleging Shilpa took Rs 2.9 crore with a promise to invest in business and give handsome monthly returns. As Shilpa failed to fulfil her promise, Priyadarshini also approached police. The third complaint was from Rohini, a businesswoman from Manchirevula area of Narsingi. “Rohini gave Rs 3.1 crore to Shilpa. After realising the fraud, Rohini lodged a complaint with us on Tuesday and a cheating case was registered,” Madhapur DCP M Venkateshwarulu said.

A video of the assault was widely shared on social media on Wednesday. Senior police officers said that following a complaint from the woman survivor, they have arrested the two women accused, both in their 20s, seen in the video. The survivor and the accused belong to different political parties, police said. On November 19, the survivor, who runs an NGO, and her daughter were returning home from Pitampura. According to the complainant, as soon as her daughter stepped out of the car, the accused started thrashing her. “She said when she tried to intervene, she, too, was assaulted in the parking area of her residential colony. She said that the attackers were armed with sticks and rods. The incident was also caught on a CCTV camera, which shows that when the woman started screaming for help while lying next to her car, the attackers fled from the spot,” said an officer. The woman then called up police and reported the matter. An FIR was registered under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). “The complainant has also alleged that the accused took her gold chain and ring, and molested her. She has also accused an MLA of executing the attack,” the officer said. “Both the alleged MLA and the survivor have filed several cases against each other earlier. According to the survivor, the MLA was taking revenge for a previous case and, hence, sent her associates to thrash her,” he added. Usha Rangnani, deputy commissioner of police (northwest), said “A non-bailable warrant has been issued against the two men identified from the video and raids are being carried out to arrest them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-her-minor-daughter-assaulted-by-4-video-goes-viral/articleshow/88039025.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana keen to set up Omicron variant detection centre||HYDERABAD: In a first in the country, the Telangana government said it intends to establish an advanced S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF) facility to detect the Omicron variant among other types of Covid-19 mutants. Officials said the government has sent an SOS to the Centre for assistance in developing an SGTF facility since testing on samples requires a Biosafety Level 4 (BS4) centre and clearances. The facility would have very advanced mechanisms and is exclusively available in India at the National Institute of Virology (Pune). While findings of normal whole sequence genome testing takes over 24 hours, using SGTF marker, results can be obtained in three hours. “Since advent of Omicron variant, the department has felt we need advanced centres. Health department has made various proposals, including requesting Centre to evaluate booster dosage of vaccination, shorten time between Covishield doses and setting up of modern test facility,” T Harish Rao, health minister, said.

The raids at Khotkar’s premises were preceded by Somaiya holding a news conference in Aurangabad and levelling allegations against him (Khotkar) for committing fraud of Rs 100 crore in connection to the purchase of Ramnagar sugar factory, in a money laundering case connected with the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) fraud. To register their protest against Somaiya’s arrival in the town on Wednesday, a large number of Shiv Sena workers took to the streets and shouted slogans. Not taking any chance, the Jalna police deployed heavy bandobast and successfully averted friction between supporters from both sides. During the day-long visit, Somaiya visited the business establishments, commercial complex as well as agriculture market produce committee (APMC) office related to Khotkar. Later, he claimed that apart from the alleged fraud related to the sugar factory, there has been an alleged fraud in the transaction of the land APMC took on lease for construction of a commercial complex. Somaiya also claimed to having some documents against another minister from the MVA government and stated that he will soon come out with more details about it. Somaiya alleged that the case related to the cheating in sugar mills has been closed by Mumbai economic offences wing at the behest of MVA government. He said, “Around 2010, there was a conspiracy to usurp sugar mills in the state. Khotkar copied that model.” Kirit alleged, “As many as 27,000 farmers were duped, while in Jalna, 10,000 farmers have been duped. The fraud in Jalna sugar mill is not limited to the mill alone. There was irregularity with connection to 240 acres of land worth Rs 940 crore and the matter is currently pending before Jalna additional collector.” He also named a senior police officer’s wife to be one of the beneficiaries during the transaction carried out around 2012. The allegations have been refuted by Khotkar. He said, “This is all being done on the behest of a BJP MP and is aimed at setting a false narrative to defame me and my party. BJP has been misusing central agencies against all the non-BJP politicians capable of defeating BJP candidates in next general elections.” He said that time has come to counter these attacks by exposing alleged frauds and misdeeds, especially in contracts of the road works carried out in Jalna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/somaiya-visits-jalna-levels-allegations-against-khotkar/articleshow/88036134.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Allahabad||HC turns down PIL against KVT ‘sugan darshan’ system||Revised Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL) petition challenging ‘sugam darshan’ (easy holy glimpse) system at Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi. Dismissing the PIL filed by one Gajendra Singh Yadav, an advocate, a division bench comprising Justice Manoj Misra and Justice Sameer Jain observed, “Having considered the rival submissions and having noticed the statutory provisions, we are of the view that once the Board of Trustees are vested with the power to fix fees for the performance of any worship, service, rituals, ceremony or religious observance in the temple and in exercise of such power, they take a decision to provide a facility of ‘sugam darshan’ for those who, on account of their disability, be it physical or otherwise, cannot wait in a queue.” “And, while taking such a decision, they do not exclude the common class from exercising their right of worship or perform puja as per religious practices, in our view, the decision of the Board of Trustees does not fall within the ambit of judicial review,” the court said. The petitioner had filed the PIL with regard to the decision of the Board of Trustees to have a system of ‘sugam darshan’, which, according to the petitioner, violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 (right to equality), 15 (prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth) 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion) and 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs) of the Constitution of India. It was further submitted by the petitioner that Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, which is constituted under the provisions of UP Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983 (for short the1983, Act) has certain duties cast upon it by Section 14 of the 1983 Act. One such duty is to provide facilities for the proper performance of worship by the pilgrims and worshippers. It was the case of the petitioner that by providing a special facility of ‘sugam darshan’ on payment of certain charges, in effect, the Board of Trustees has excluded the common man from exercising his right of worship and performing necessary religious practices. However, while opposing the writ petition, it was submitted by state counsel that section 15 of the 1983 Act provides that the Board shall exercise all such powers, as are necessary for or incidental to the performance of its duties and functions under the Act and in particular shall have power to fix fees for the performance of any worship, service, ritual, ceremony or religious observance in the temple. The court gave this decision on November 26.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-turns-down-pil-against-kvt-sugan-darshan-system/articleshow/88037763.cms||---

We are yet to ascertain what caused it.” The factory is located on a narrow, congested lane, which made its access difficult for the firemen.Leading fireman Vijay Kumar said, “Four fire tenders were stationed at the spot. These made more than 25 rounds. The situation was brought under control around 3am. We had started the operation around 8.30pm.”The incident caused panic in the area, with people crowding on the road outside. “It was tough to keep the public away,” Kumar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fire-breaks-out-at-daba-road-cardboard-factory/articleshow/88036980.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Realty booming now, but Hyderabad staring at excess homes by 2024||HYDERABAD: Come 2024, Hyderabad could be sitting on a fat stock of excess homes – at least four to five times the market demand – if the RERA data is any indication. A quick scan of numbers retrieved from Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA) website shows that the body approved over 60,000 apartment units across the city between January and November this year. In comparison, the annual absorption of residential properties in Hyderabad is no more than 10,000 to 14,000 units. This gap in demand-supply, industry insiders say, is likely to widen further over the next two years – as more projects are launched - resulting in an oversupply. “Even if these projects come up in a phased manner, we are unlikely to bridge the gap considering there are another 60,000 to 70,000 units expected to be launched in the next two quarters,” said Sumanth Reddy, managing director of the India Institute of Real Estate. He admitted that the city could be staring at a “serious problem of unsold inventory” if this trend continues. “Several developers now are individually building as many as 2,000 to 3,000 units per project – three to four times of what they used to construct until a few years ago. That’s adding to this excess pile,” he added. The no-cap Floor Space Index rule prevalent in Hyderabad is a primary reason driving this excessive construction activity, say industry sources reiterating their appeal for a FSI regulation. Another concern: The skewed growth model. “While the growing demand in recent years is supported by a steady rise in new launches in the last three-four years, this demand is not uniform across all pockets. There is a significant spurt in new launches further away from the ORR (and established catchments) where physical and social infrastructure is still largely non-existent. And this could impact the demand-supply balance in the near future,” said Veera Babu, managing director, Cushman & Wakefield, Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/realty-booming-now-but-hyd-staring-at-excess-homes-by-2024/articleshow/88037776.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

The judge made this interim arrangement while hearing pleas by theatre owners. A petition by nearly 100 theatres from various districts questioned inaction of authorities in taking a decision on their representation to hike charges in view of rising operational costs. Counsel for cinegoers association objected to interim relief and charged state and authorities with conniving with theatres’ lobby. The judge served an ultimatum to authorities that they have to forego their opportunity to file counter if they still dodge the issue. Theatres’ counsel K Durga Prasad said though the state had issued a GO allowing a hike, implementation is in abeyance. Judge gave four weeks to the state to file counter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/interim-hc-nod-to-hike-film-tickets/articleshow/88037783.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

---||Allahabad||Around 77% dengue beds lying vacant in hospitals; city now has only 19 cases||Prayagraj: Even as the tally of dengue cases crossed the 1,087 mark in Prayagraj district on Wednesday, around 77% beds reserved in dengue wards in the three government hospitals are lying vacant. Health officials claimed that the winter season or drop in temperature sees the lowest reproduction rate among mosquitoes, and they also become inactive in this season. As a result, the larva which turns into a mature mosquito in seven days, takes at least three weeks to become a mature male or female mosquito, if it survives. District health authorities also claimed that the graph of the dengue cases is showing a declining trend in the city as well as in trans-Ganga and Yamuna pockets. As per the latest trend, on an average, seven or eight cases were reported daily in the district in the past one week while the figure was more than 25 or above in the peak season. Till now, the city has reported a total of 1,087 dengue cases, including 804 in urban and 283 in rural areas. District malaria officer (Prayagraj) AK Singh said, “There are a total of 110 dengue beds reserved in three government hospitals: SRN (25), TB Sapri/Beli (60), Colvin (25). Similarly, 84 are currently lying vacant at SRN hospital (22), Beli hospital (42) and Colvin hospital (20). He further added that private nursing homes/hospitals have hardly reported one or two cases, indicating that the situation has improved in the district. “Dengue cases will witness a further dip as the temperature has been decreasing. Mosquitoes usually turn inactive with the onset of winters. However, the health department is not taking any chance and has intensified anti-larval measures to keep the dengue situation in check,” the DMO said. “At present, there are 19 active cases, including 13 admitted in hospitals and six in homes in the district and the situation is completely under control,” he added. Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr. Anupam Dwivedi said, “Dengue cases are seeing a dip with the onset of winter. Mosquitoes usually breed in warm weather conditions. The temperature is falling which is not conducive for mosquito breeding. But people should take precaution and not let water stagnate in their homes.” Dr Dwivedi also advised the citizens to take all precautions to be safe from contracting the disease. “People should regularly clean areas and prevent mosquito breeding. They should wear full sleeve shirts and full pants. They should also consult doctors if they suffer from symptoms of fever, body ache, joint pain and skin rashes, among others,” he added. Officials claimed that anti-larva spraying has still been intensified in colonies which reported frequent cases. The localities are: Rajapur, MLN medical college campus, Colonelganj, SRN campus, Mumfordganj, Kailash Puri colony, Manmohan Park, Teliyarganj, Shivkuti, Rasoolabad, Kutchehary and Dhoomanganj area. Besides, fogging has also been done in city, trans-Ganga and trans-Yamuna pockets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/around-77-dengue-beds-lying-vacant-in-hospitals-city-now-has-only-19-cases/articleshow/88037782.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Builder asked to pay interest over delayed flat possession||MUMBAI: MahaRERA chairman Ajoy Mehta in a recent order directed the promoters of the Parinee Adney project in Borivali West to pay interest to four home buyers for delay in handover of possession. He also directed the handover of possession of flats to two home buyers. Mehta’s predecessor, Gautam Chatterjee, had in an interim order passed in 2020 declined to direct payment of interest for delayed possession, citing the larger interest of the project’s completion. The four home buyers had booked 2BHK and 3BHK flats between 2013 and 2015, and paid sums ranging from around Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. The flats were to be handed over by 2016 and 2017. While the home buyers were represented by advocates Sanjay Chaturvedi and Anil D Souza, the promoter was represented by advocate Laxmi Murli. The promoter in his response stated that the delay caused in handing over possession was due to a lack of approvals and shortage of labour. The promoter also stated that two of the complainants had taken possession of their flats. However, MahaRERA observed that the promoter has admitted to a delay in handing over the possession as per the respective agreements. In agreements for sale executed in ongoing projects before commencement of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, the due date of possession specified in the agreement for sale will prevail over the completion date declared by the promoter in MahaRERA. The purpose of the Act is to implement such agreements for sale executed in ongoing projects and not to re-write those agreements and change the date of possession therein. The Act also does not provide for any retrospective amendments to the executed agreement. Mehta also observed that the promoter must take steps to enable the allottees to form a co-operative housing society. In the final order, Mehta stated that the home buyers are entitled to claim interest from possession date, as per their respective agreement up to the date on which the OC is received, on the amount paid as per MahaRERA rules. For two complainants, who were yet to get possession of the flats, the promoter was directed to handover possession along with the OC. The MahaRERA chairman also stated that the promoter is entitled to claim the benefit of moratorium period as per MahaRERA notifications. The moratorium period shall be deducted from the total period for which interest is payable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-builder-asked-to-pay-interest-over-delayed-flat-possession/articleshow/88039041.cms||Sanjeev Devasia

The maximum temperature also fell to to 20.5 degrees celsius — 11 degrees below normal. The minimum temperature recorded early on Wednesday morning, however, however was 19.2 degrees celsius, which is 8 degrees higher than normal. The minimum temperature is expected to drop on Thursday, said the weather officials. The unseasonal showers that lashed almost all parts of the district are likely to continue at least for another day, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said, though cloudy skies are likely to continue for several more days thereafter. Nashik city witnessed 19.1 mm rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm, as per the IMD-Nashik records. While all the 15 talukas received rainfall on Wednesday, Igatpuri, Sinnar and Nashik talukas got about 19mm rain each. Peth received 17mm, and Trimbakeshwar and Dindori each received about 16mm rainfall. Grape, onion and vegetable farmers are now wary of the rain replacing sunny and dry weather. The unseasonal rain can have an adverse effect on the budding, flowering and harvesting of the fruits at various stages. “We just can’t understand the weather. We had to wait almost till August (two months into the monsoon season) for good rainfall, and now we are two months into the winter (December) and it is raining like its monsoon,” said Ganesh Patil, a resident of Niphad taluka. Jagannath Khapre, the president of the Grape Exporters’ Association of India, said, “Nashik has about 1.5 lakh acre of vineyards. While in north Nashik (Chandwad, Malegaon, Baglan) the farmers are harvesting grapes, the grapes in Niphad, Nashik, Dindori talukas are in the flowering phase. The rain and the chill leads to cracking of ready fruits. In case of flowering, water staying on for a duration of five hours can lead to decay. What will the farmers do now?” Some farmers are trying to save their crop by putting up a polythene sheets over the vines. “All year we have laboured for the crop. Now that it is the time to harvest, our efforts are likely to go down the drain. We hope the polythene covers will be of some help,” said Bapu Khairnar, a farmer from Satana. Low-pressure in Arabian sea, western disturbance cause rain Apart from north and central Maharashtra, even Mumbai, its satellite cities, and south Gujarat received rain on Wednesday, owing to a low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea and a western disturbance, the IMD said. Jayanta Sarkar, the head of Mumbai's Regional Meteorological Centre of the IMD, said Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Mumbai, Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar received rainfall on Wednesday.  The rainfall is likely to continue on December 2. But the intensity will decrease by December 2 as the system will head to central India, said Sarkar. — With PTI inputs||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/grape-onion-vegetable-farmers-worry-as-rain-lashes-nashik-dist/articleshow/88036148.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Actor Bhaskar, who introduced comedian Munawar Faruqui (now under fire from right-wing groups) to Banerjee, asked her about her stand on UAPA. “It is not for civil society or people. This law was meant for internal security issues. But it is being used like anything, against the media, against civil society. Neither me nor my chief secretary can remember when we last used UAPA,” the CM replied. Banerjee reminded her audience that “both private and public sectors” were necessary: “Adani, Ambani bhi chahiye aur kisan bhi chahiye.” But what the Modi government was doing — selling off the public sector — was wrong, she added. The Bengal CM proposed “an advisory committee of civil society in all major cities”. “We can start with Kolkata and Mumbai, then rope in Chennai, Bengaluru,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-even-shah-rukh-was-victimised-she-says/articleshow/88038497.cms||---

We need a firm alternative against BJP. My meeting with Sharad Pawar was to work out an action plan to defeat the BJP...I know Pawar, I have worked with him,” she said. NCP was a constituent of the Congress-led UPA coalition which formed the last government at the Centre and is part of the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance in Maharashtra with Congress. Mamata Banerjee takes swipe at Congress, says- 'There is no UPA now'The TMC has made it clear that it refuses to toe the Congress line on a strategy for the opposition in and outside Parliament. In the recent past, it has poached Congress leaders in a bid to expand its footprint in the north-east, Goa, Bihar and Haryana. Mamata accused Congress of being “the BJP’s TRP.” “They just waste their time and BJP becomes more and more powerful. But we will not tolerate that. We saw what happened in Goa (after the last assembly elections). People’s mandate was for Congress, not BJP, but BJP formed the government. This cannot go on. I do not want division of votes but no political party is bigger than the nation,” she said. Banerjee conceded that the policy would differ from state to state. “Why will we disturb the system in Maharashtra?” she asked, referring to the anti-BJP coalition. Read AlsoMamata Banerjee has become BJP's 'oxygen supplier': CongressThe Congress on Wednesday reacted strongly to Mamata Banerjee's remarks against the UPA and accused the West Bengal chief minister of helping the BJP by becoming its "oxygen supplier." Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused Mamata of weakening the Congress to keep the BJP happy.“But where there is no possibility, where Congress is not fighting and where BJP is growing…, we will not let BJP grow,” she added, accusing BJP of “dividing society”. Congress leaders including state president Nana Patole, former CM Ashok Chavan and party leader in legislature Balasaheb Thorat reacted to Banerjee’s statements. Patole said the fight against BJP should be fought unitedly, keeping egos aside. “Congress is the only viable alternative to BJP,” he said. General secretary K C Venugopal reacted in Delhi saying “Everybody knows the reality of Indian politics. Thinking that without Congress, anybody can defeat BJP is merely a dream.” Banerjee was on a two-day visit to Maharashtra. She was scheduled to meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, but that was cancelled since he is recovering from a surgery. However, Banerjee met Shiv Sena leaders Aditya Thackeray and Sanjay Raut.

We found hundreds of litres of ethanol. The FSL team that accompanied us revealed that the accused was using it to make liquor at the unit,” said Jatin Patel, police inspector, PCB. “A man identified as Bhajanlal Bhuralal, a resident of Rajasthan, had taken the unit on rent. Another accused Nitin Kotvani is also involved in the crime. Kotvani was even earlier arrested in a duplicate sanitizer racket,” Patel told TOI.

---||Kolhapur||Kolhapur: Alternate day water cuts for A, B & E wards in city||Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to initiate alternate day water cuts in A, B and E wards along with suburbs and fringe rural areas starting from Thursday. Every time the alternate day supply or cut is initiated it is mainly due to lowering of water level of the Panchaganga river at Shingnapur barrage. But this time, the alternate day cut has been planned because half of the water pumped from Shingnapur barrage will be passed through the newly built water treatment plant (WTP) at Puikhadi. The WTP is part of KMC’s Rs 488 crore ambitious Kalammawadi direct pipeline project. The work of WTP is completed and before commissioning it needs to be subjected to various tests required for efficiency and durability. Ajay Salokhe, chief hydraulic engineer of KMC, said, “The alternate day supply or cuts will be in place for four to five days, which is the time required for testing the newly-built WTP. The hydraulic testing will require large amount of water and therefore though pumping from the river will be at full capacity, Puikhadi plant will get only half of the water.To ensure that the citizens do not face any inconvenience, we will be releasing water for additional hours so that the residents can store adequate water.” The immediate commissioning of the new WTP is necessary owing to its extra capacity of 20 million litres than the existing WTP which is two-decade-old and purifies less water due to the sedimentation. Once the new WTP is commissioned more water can be treated and therefore the areas under this system will receive adequate supply. The A and B wards will receive water on Thursday while the most populous E ward will face water cuts on the same day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-alternate-day-water-cuts-for-a-b-e-wards-in-city/articleshow/88036161.cms||---

The state government has planned the construction of about 31 lakh housing units spread over 17,000 colonies in two phases. The work on the first phase for construction of about 15 lakh housing units will be resumed immediately. Although the state government launched the works in many colonies last June, the project was brought to a grinding halt following a verdict of single judge of the high court. Subsequently, the state government filed an appeal in the division which cleared the decks for continuing the housing programme. Housing minister Sriranganatha Raju reviewed the progress of the project with the housing joint collectors and asked them to resume all the works. He said that the evil forces initially made every attempt to stall the distribution of house sites to the poor by raising frivolous petitions. He said that the government had succeeded in distributing the house sites by clearing the legal hurdles. He said government had distributed the house sites to over 31 lakh people across the state. “We have distributed house sites to nearly 31 lakh women beneficiaries across the state and launched the YSR Jagananna housing colonies in order to provide houses to all the poor,” said Sriranganatha Raju. He said that the government wanted to complete the first phase of the housing project by next Sankranti and complete the second phase of the project by June, 2023. The minister asked the officials to take the completion of the housing project as a prestige issue and reach the timelines fixed by the government. The minister wanted all joint collectors to personally supervise the progress of the project on a daily basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/collectors-told-to-speed-up-housing-project-work/articleshow/88037051.cms||Samdani MN
---||Hyderabad||Nimmagadda Prasad defuses CBI’s Serbian salvo in Vanpic case||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Wednesday reserved its order after conclusion of arguments in the Vanpic quid-pro-quo case against businessman Nimmagadda Prasad involving now AP chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Upon resumption of hearing in the quash petition filed by Prasad before Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of HC, CBI counsel K Surender said that the former should explain why he was detained in Belgrade by Serbian police in July 2019, hinting that it could have been at the behest of Vanpic project’s main financier Ras Al Khaimah (RAK). The CBI’s claim came after Prasad’s counsel had argued that RAK never had any complaint. “We have not probed the case and there is nothing on record about that episode in the current case,” the CBI counsel said, insisting that Prasad should clear the air on any role of RAK in his detention. Countering the CBI, senior counsel T Niranjan Reddy appearing for Prasad pointed out that neither the CBI has placed any record in connection with that case nor is it part of the record before the court. Continuing his argument, CBI counsel Surender said Prasad first roped in RAK for Vadarevu and Nizampatnam Industrial Corridor (Vanpic), but once AP and RAK signed the MoU on March 11, 2008, he entered into a separate treaty with RAK and later RAK share in Vanpic stood reduced. He said that Prasad secured 12,000 acres and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s firms received Rs 850 crore, and in between these two events there were several GOs by AP state issuing scores of notifications, exemptions, privileges in favour of Prasad and Vanpic, the CBI counsel said. “CBI had filed its chargesheet in 2012 and now after a gap of nearly 10 years the accused were questioning the cognisance order to delay the trial,” he alleged. Refuting CBI allegations of criminal conspiracy, Prasad’s counsel accused the agency of making baseless allegations, pointing out that all decisions were taken by the state cabinet and executed by bureaucrats. “If CBI wants to see a scam and prosecute people, then it should book the entire cabinet and then governor,” he said. “Prasad’s investment in Jagan’s firms is only Rs 450 crore and CBI keeps on quoting an exaggerated figure of Rs 850 crore. The complaint was made by TDP and Congress leaders and the CBI wants to prosecute Jagan with politically mala fide intentions,” he said, while stoutly reiterating that RAK’s share in Vanpic never fell below 26%. Appearing for KV Brahmananda Reddy, an IRAS officer who came on deputation to serve with AP’s infrastructure and investments department as a special officer, senior counsel Vinod Kumar Deshpande said that CBI had unnecessarily made him an accused though he was not a competent authority and all decisions were taken by the cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nimmagadda-defuses-cbis-serbian-salvo-in-vanpic-case/articleshow/88037799.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

While oil marketing company BPCL is a major company on the sell-off list, its privatisation is expected to spill over into next fiscal year, along with sale of IDBI Bank and a general insurer. The government has also announced the privatisation of two nationalised banks, which are likely to be Indian Overseas Bank and Central Bank of India, for which it needs to move legislative amendments. After a slow start to the privatisation programme, the Modi government announced the sale of loss-making Air India earlier this year and followed it up with CEL this week. Unlike AI, which was saddled with massive debt and accumulated losses, Pandey said there are no major liabilities with CEL. “It has much bigger potential. A private owner will help the company grow and enable it to participate more actively in the ‘Make in India’ initiative, especially when electronics is a major part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme,” he said. Pandey said that despite multiple regulatory issues, the government and the Tata Group are targeting the completion of the AI sale by the month-end, although the long stop date is towards the end of January. Approvals from Competition Commission of India and other agencies are awaited, while AI also needs to make some filings in other countries. Besides, the government has to complete certain formalities related to debt and banks too need to sort out some of the Dipam is processing the privatisation of 17 public sector companies, the government had informed Parliament earlier this week. In five cases such as Scooters India and units of Cement Corporation, the process has been stopped as they are now going to be shut down. issues on the loans extended to AI, Pandey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-plans-4-more-strategic-selloff-deals-by-march-end/articleshow/88039613.cms||Sidhartha

According to university authorities this has been done to keep the varsity clean. “Many outsiders use the university to walk their dogs, picnics and regular walking. They end up leaving the premises filled with garbage. They use the water facilities of the colleges. We have to spend a lot of money towards cleanliness and upkeep of the campus. Therefore, we have decided to levy charges so that only genuine fitness enthusiasts can enter the university and it doesn’t become home for trespassers,” said P Laxminarayana, OU registrar. OU campus has, for long, been used extensively by scores of fitness enthusiasts residing in neighbouring areas such as Amberpet, Tarnaka, Habsiguda, Vidya Nagar, DD Colony etc., during morning and evening hours. Henceforth, entry will be allowed only to those who pay the university on a monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annual basis, the latest rate-card issue by the university stated. The university’s department of physical education has also issued user charges for the centre for fitness and exercises (gym) for outsiders and other facilities such as basketball courts, football grounds and athletic camps. As per ground user charges fixed by the university, walkers will be charged Rs 200 per month per person. For basketball, football and athletic camps, outsiders will be charged Rs 500 per month. The campus will be held open for outsiders only for three hours in the morning (6 am to 9 am) and three hours in the evening (5 pm to 8 pm). “The university students of OU campus can utilise the above facilities free of cost by showing the college ID card to the security on demand,” read the notification. Some suspect that the move is also aimed at generating revenue for the cash-strapped university. “OU is clearly not getting sufficient funds from the state government to enhance its sports facilities. Levying charges on outsiders also seems like an attempt at generating some revenue,” said a retied faculty member from OU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-more-free-walking-jogging-in-ou-outsiders-have-to-pay/articleshow/88037810.cms||---

He was referred to another hospital in south Delhi, where he succumbed to his injuries. “The man was stabbed on his neck by some locals due to personal enmity. Police have arrested Ladla, the woman’s brother, and Shahlam. There is no communal angle in the case,” said DCP (West) Urvija Goel. An investigator said Ladla was unhappy with Dablu being in a relationship with his sister. Security forces were deployed at the place where the deceased lived to ensure that no untoward incident took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/26-yr-old-stabbed-to-death-over-love-affair/articleshow/88039065.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad: Falling for rumours, villagers force health staff to give jabs till late night||AURANGABAD: The health workers deployed at the Fardapur village-based vaccination centre, in the Soyegaon tehsil, had a tough time dealing with the villagers who sought to be vaccinated and did not allow them (the workers) to shut the vaccination centre till late in the night on Tuesday. The health workers were finally able to call it a day after they ran out of all the vaccines doses available at the centre. Police authorities said that in the evening, suddenly a rumour spread in the village that the state government is permanently calling off the vaccination drive from Wednesday. Before the health workers could close the centre for the day, a large number of villagers rushed to the vaccination centre and demanded that they be vaccinated. Initially, the health workers thought that these were just some latecomers, who wanted to get the jabs. However, as the rush of villagers continued — most of them asking the health workers to not to close the centre unless they are vaccinated — they alerted the Fardapur police station. Assistant inspector Amol More told TOI, “The villagers had panicked. Beneficiaries who were yet to get the jabs and those who were due for the second dose rushed to the vaccination centre.” To control the mob and to avoid any law and order situation, the vaccination drive was carried out amidst police bandobast. The health authorities said that a total 410 people got vaccinated. They also said that the number was more than double the number of beneficiaries coming over the past several days. District health officer Dr Ashok Gaikwad said as the villagers were not ready to relent, vaccination was carried out till late in the night. Gaikwad said the people who could not get the vaccine had to be counselled and convinced that the drive will continue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/falling-for-rumours-villagers-force-health-staff-to-give-jabs-till-late-night/articleshow/88037108.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Patna||EOU raids Lalganj SHO’s premises for amassing assets beyond income||PATNA: The Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of state police on Wednesday raided the residential premises and office of Lalganj police station SHO Chandrabhushan Shukla for allegedly amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income. The EOU registered a disproportionate assets (DA) case against Shukla on Tuesday and conducted the raids after procuring search warrants on Wednesday. He has allegedly amassed assets worth more than 93% of his known sources of income by conniving with liquor smugglers. This is the first of its kind action where a case was registered against a police officer for amassing disproportionate assets by supporting liquor smuggling. Sources said the prohibition wing of the state police headquarters had provided the inputs to the EOU about Shukla. The EOU, in its raids on Shukla’s private residence at Chhapra in Saran and paternal residence at Raghunathpur in Siwan besides his office at Lalganj police station and rented accommodation in Vaishali, found one residential and an agricultural plot in Bettiah as well as Rs11.79 lakh deposited in the bank accounts in his wife’s name, a residential house in the name of his father Ghanshyam Shukla at Chhapra worth Rs42.93 lakh as per value on papers, investment of Rs34.74 lakh in insurance, mutual funds and vehicles and Rs13.72 lakh on other heads. EOU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said the value of disproportionate assets of Shukla will increase further as property and investment documents recovered in the course of raids were yet to be scrutinised. “Besides Rs92,000 in cash, money receipts have been found in raids indicating hefty investments in real estate. Details of about nine bank accounts, two lockers, land deeds and investment documents recovered in raids are to be scrutinized,” he said. Khan also said Aadhaar and PAN details of most of his family members and other relatives are being gathered for further investigation. The EOU sources said Shukla earned Rs64 lakh from salary and other sources of income. Shukla is a sub-inspector-ranked officer, who joined the police service in 2009. He was posted in East Champaran before getting transferred to Vaishali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-lalganj-shos-premises-for-amassing-assets-beyond-income/articleshow/88037855.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Delhi||Man who posed as cop, molested minor, arrested||New Delhi: A 40-year-old man who posed as a cop and molested a minor in a park in Rohini has been arrested. The incident took place on November 27 when the 17-year-old girl was sitting in the park with her 21-year-old male friend. A woman cop located the accused and posed as a customer to nab him. “The girl and her friend were sitting and talking in the park when a man came up to them and told them that he was a cop and started moral policing them. He then asked them to remove their clothes and molested the girl. The man threatened them and took the mobile phone number of the girl’s elder sister. He later messaged the girl’s sister and told her that he had caught the 17-year-old sitting in a park with a man,” said an investigating officer. A case was lodged under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and for molestation at Aman Vihar police station. A women sub-inspector, Arti, probing the case launched a manhunt to nab the accused. The location of the accused was traced to a mobile shop, but he was not found there. “When Arti saw the accused online again, she traced his location but couldn’t get exact coordinates. She then checked all shops in a 200m radius on foot. She also checked several numbers on an app and found that the accused had saved his number as Gajendra. He was found to be a labourer. She then posed as a customer seeking to get some repair work done at her house. When she became sure of his identity, she called her colleagues and the man was arrested,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-who-posed-as-cop-molested-minor-arrested/articleshow/88038532.cms||---

---||Business||Sensex up 620 points on robust Q2 GDP growth||MUMBAI: A strong GDP growth number for India and relatively steady Asian markets on Wednesday ensured investor sentiment improved on Dalal Street, despite a sharp sell-off in the US markets on Tuesday night. This helped the sensex close 620 points (1.1%) higher at 57,685. Short covering by speculators to limit their losses also helped the index gain in the closing hours, market players said. Wednesday’s surge came mainly on the back of strong buying in Reliance Industries along with ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI, while a lower closing in Bharti Airtel and Ultratech Cement limited the gains partially. On Tuesday evening, the government had said that during the July-September quarter this year the economy had grown by an 8.3% annual rate and it now targets double-digit growth for entire fiscal. This comforted investors about the economy coming back on track at a fast rate after the Covid-induced slowdown during the most part of 2020 and the early months of 2021. Surprisingly, foreign investors continued to be net sellers with an outflow figure of Rs 2,766 crore, although domestic funds neutralised this selling with a net buying figure of Rs 3,467 crore. Commentaries from doctors and pharma company executives that said that the newly emerged Omicron variant of the virus may not be as lethal as initially thought to be also helped to calm nervous investors globally, dealers said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-620-points-on-robust-q2-gdp-growth/articleshow/88039679.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Ticket prices in theatres across Andhra Pradesh to start at Rs 5, go up to Rs 250||AMARAVATI: The government fixed ticket prices for film theatres across the state on Wednesday, with ticket prices in smaller towns lower than those in bigger towns and cities. The government recently cleared a Bill in the assembly to regulate film ticket prices, shows, and also introduce online ticketing system. While the online ticketing portal is yet to be launched, the government has decided to enforce the new ticket slabs with immediate effect. The government has also imposed a ban on screening of benefit shows. According to the GO, the ticket prices have been fixed in the range of Rs 75, Rs 150 and Rs 250 in multiplexes in municipal corporation cities. The prices are slightly higher or almost similar to the existing prices in the multiplexes. However, the prices are in the range of Rs 40, Rs 60 and Rs 100 in AC single screen theatres in corporation cities. Previously, the highest price in these theatres were around Rs 150. The prices in non-AC single screen theatres have been fixed at Rs 20, Rs 40 and Rs 60. However, majority of the theatres in municipal corporation cities are now air-conditioned, barring a few. In municipality areas, the prices of movie tickets in multiplexes have been fixed at Rs 60, Rs 100 and Rs 150. In AC theatres, the ticket prices would be Rs 30, Rs 50 and Rs 70, while they have been capped at Rs 15, Rs 30 and Rs 50 in non-AC theatres. In villages and rural areas, prices in multiplexes (if available) have been fixed at Rs 30, Rs 50 and Rs 80, while those in AC theatres would be Rs 10, Rs 15 and Rs 20, and Rs 5, Rs 10 and Rs 15 in non-AC theatres in villages. Veteran director K Raghavendra Rao has appealed to the government to reasonably fix the rates as lower rates would severely hit the industry. He said movie goers will not watch films without good content just because the prices are low. People will not bother to pay higher prices if the content of the film and facilities in the theatres are good, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ticket-prices-in-theatres-across-state-to-start-at-rs-5-go-up-to-rs-250/articleshow/88037110.cms||Samdani MN

But ironically, many students will not be able to apply for this facility. According to sources, first year students of Bachelors of Commerce (BCom) enrolled at the Faculty of Commerce, the largest faculty of the university in terms of student strength, are yet to receive their permanent registration number (PRN) because of the delayed admission process. Around 9,500 students are enrolled in first year BCom and they count for the major beneficiary group when it comes to taking advantage of the financial support scheme. MSU’s Directorate of Students’ Welfare (DSW) on Tuesday started inviting application form for the financial assistance, fee waiver and/or freeship for which the students have to apply online. Regular students whose total household income does not exceed a sum of Rs 3.5 lakh per annum and have secured at least 55 % marks in his or her preceding examination are eligible for the financial assistance or fee waiver under the scheme. But in order to register online, the students need to enter their user name and password which are linked to their PRN. Officials however said that based on the progress made by the faculty officials in winding up the admission process, they may extend the date of applications invited for DSW scheme, if needed. Currently, the date of submitting the online applications is December 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/students-may-not-get-dsw-benefit/articleshow/88036862.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC tells HC it will strive to resolve dispute with Malvani heritage church||MUMBAI: BMC told Bombay high court on Monday it will try to amicably resolve the dispute over acquiring a portion of the heritage St Anthony’s Church land at Malvani, Malad (West), for road widening.  “We’ll see how far we can resolve the issue amicably without prejudice to the rights of both sides,” senior advocate Anil Sakhare told a bench of Justices Amjad Sayed and S G Dige. A petition was filed by parish priest Fr Agnelo Fernandes and the church. It urged to quash and set aside the two notices issued in February by the deputy municipal commissioner, P-North ward, under section 299 (acquisition of land falling within regular line of a public street) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888.  The petition said the land of which possession is sought includes church, cemetery, parochial house (built in 1872), grottos of Mother Mary and St Anthony (existing since 1630) and is a notified Grade-II A heritage property. It said road-widening cannot be done to affect a notified heritage property and BMC must take heritage permission.  When the church’s advocate Vijaya Ingule sought a short adjournment, Sakhare also asked for “some time” saying the petitioner had submitted a proposal. Ingule said that on November 23 a meeting was held with the assistant municipal commissioner (AMC) but the proposal was not considered. The church offered to surrender 20 feet “for which kitchen, dining hall and a priest’s living quarters will be sacrificed”. “A straight line will be maintained so as to give a proper elevation (for the road), save the grottos of Our Lady and St Anthony which are sacred,” said the August 30 letter by Fr Fernandes to the AMC. The judges directed him to meet AMC. They posted hearing for December 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-tells-hc-it-will-strive-to-resolve-dispute-with-malvani-heritage-church/articleshow/88039082.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Police said Kahare, who earned livelihood as a labourer, had consumed liquor on Tuesday afternoon. Intoxicated, he called up his wife Surekha stating about being manhandled after meeting with an accident. Creating a suspense, he told his wife that an unidentified man had kidnapped him by whisking away in a car to an undisclosed location. He had later switched off his cellphone. Police said an unnerved Surekha rushed to Hingna police station. The cops too had registered a case of kidnapping before launching a search. The cops from other police stations and crime branch too had joined in the search. Around 500 cops had fanned out in different directions to trace out Kahare. Despite a night-long search, the cops were anxious too as no clue was received. The suspense had come to an anti-climax as the cops later found him at his home. The search was supervised by the senior officers including DCP crime branch Chinmay Pandit. The cops were trying to locate his bike on the road. It was also baffling for the cops as there was no reports or information about any accident from where Kahare had called up his wife. As his cellphone was switched off, it had become a challenge for the cops to trace him. CP Amitesh Kumar too was monitoring the search and had issued strict instructions to trace the so-called missing man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/drunkard-concocts-own-kidnapping/articleshow/88037865.cms||Soumitra Bose

Following the commission's intervention, one of the three schools withdew the suspension order against students. But the two other schools have not yet revoked the suspensions. In a statement issued on Wednesday, WBCPCR chairperson Ananya Chatterjee Chakraborti said the action was taken after the commission heard out what the schools had to say about repeated complaints from guardians of these schools and was “completely dissatisfied with the unreasonable and unsympathetic behaviour of the school authorities towards their students”.  The commission said the schools' actions also violate provisions of the Right to Education Act. In addition, it said, the schools had also violated the order passed by the Calcutta HC on October 1 that stated that “For the time being the school authorities will not prevent any student from sitting in any board or annual or mid-term assessment examination of the school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fir-against-3-city-schools/articleshow/88037875.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Samples of +ve travellers to be sent for genome sequencing||Kolhapur: The samples collected from people arriving in Kolhapur district from other countries and states, and testing Covid positive will be mandatorily sent for genome sequencing to detect the type of coronavirus variant. Also, the swabs of local Covid positive patients will also tested to understand the makeup of the coronavirus. The decision has been taken in the wake of threat posed by Omicron, the newest variant of concern of the novel coronavirus. Kolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar said that Omicron has more than 50 mutations and has been a cause of worry. “We have now set up to fix genome sequencing in the Coronavirus at our labs. Earlier we had to send the swabs to Pune based lab. We will mandatorily check the genetic makeup of the persons arriving from outside and testing positive for Covid. Also, we will carry out genome sequencing of the local patients randomly in the ratio prescribed by the government,” he said. The government has prescribed that at least 10% of the swabs of Covid positive patients should be submitted for genome sequencing. The second wave which is almost receded in the district was propelled by the Delta variant. “We do not know how the new variant behaves. So far we know that the symptoms are the same, precautions to be taken are more stringent especially making the nose and mouth with triple layered mask. However, the RT-PCR testing seem continue to help in detecting Covid positive and negative even if the variant is changed. We are therefore going to ramp up testing in coming days,” said Rekhawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/samples-of-ve-travellers-to-be-sent-for-genome-sequencing/articleshow/88037116.cms||---
---||Pune||Man uses civic clean-up fine threat to dupe elderly||Pune: The Alankar police have started investigation into a man’s complaint stating that an unidentified person duped his grandfather of Rs82,000 by posing as a conservancy employee of the civic body. The 20-year-old complainant said that by promising to clean the washroom drainage system of their bungalow at Erandwane on September 22, a man took Rs82,000 in five instalments from his grandfather posing as a Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) worker. The same man is also suspected of having duped another bungalow owner of Rs17,000 in a similar manner. The incident came to light when the grandson learnt about the exorbitant money charged by the self-proclaimed civic staffer from his grandfather and decided to approach the police. He told the police the suspect put his grandfather under pressure that the PMC would impose a hefty fine on him if the drainage system was not cleaned in time. He promised to clean the drainage system using a machine. Senior police inspector Pratibha Joshi of Alankar police station told TOI, “The incident occurred on September 22 and in the two weeks that followed. The suspect claimed that the PMC will impose a heavy fine if the drainage is not cleaned which was causing nuisance in the area. He promised to clean the drainage using a machine and took the money and did some cleaning. The suspect also went to the victim’s house a few more times and threatened saying that the PMC might send them a notice and will impose a heavy fine. Thus, the elderly man paid the money in five instalments.” Speaking to TOI, the complainant said, “My grandfather, a retired MSEDCL engineer, and grandmother were tested positive for chikungunya in September. A team of PMC officials had visited our bungalow. They inspected the premises to look for breeding space for mosquitoes. However, they did not find any.” “As soon as the team left the bungalow, this man approached my grandfather. He said the drainage was choked and it was causing a nuisance in the area. He said if it’s choking, the PMC will issue notices and a heavy fine will be imposed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-uses-civic-clean-up-fine-threat-to-dupe-elderly/articleshow/88037872.cms||---

A regular RT-PCR test costs Rs 500 and its result takes up to six hours. On Wednesday, 1,013 passengers from four ‘at risk’ flights successfully completed arrival requirements, Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) said on its Twitter handle. While 792 of them took rapid PCR tests, the remaining 221 opted for RT-PCR tests. “Operations for international arrivals are running smooth after the implementation of the new health ministry guidelines,” DIAL tweeted. Airport sources said DIAL “does not get even a penny” from the amount passengers pay to Genestrings Diagnostics, the lab conducting the tests. Meanwhile, aviation insiders sounded a note of caution about testing arrivals from ‘at risk’ countries. “Passengers are required to declare their 14-day travel history before coming to India. It is possible that someone does not do so and travels from an ‘at risk’ country to a third country on one ticket and from there to Delhi on another ticket. Passports must be thoroughly checked to ensure no one can escape the test,” said sources across airlines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-delhi-bound-passengers-can-take-90min-pcr-tests/articleshow/88039094.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Sealdah link of East-West Metro gets international safety nod||KOLKATA: East-West Metro’s Sealdah extension project is now armed with the crucial international safety clearance. The French safety assessor, Certifier, has approved the signal and other systems, paving the way for Metro Railway to apply for inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS). The third party assessment and a fire safety clearance are prerequisites for Metro Railway to apply for the CRS inspection. The CRS, under the ministry of civil aviation, is the autonomous body that clears any new Metro project in India. East-West Metro now runs a truncated 6.9-km service between Sector V and Phoolbagan. The corridor can extend by another 2.3km till Sealdah only after the CRS gives its nod. Before inspecting the new stretch, CRS officials, at its Lucknow headquarters, will scrutinize the safety documents and then give a date for inspection. The French agency that awards the safety certificate to all new Metro lines worldwide was chosen as per international standards to give its “Independent Safety Assessment (ISA)” by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the 16-km East-West Metro corridor, which will link Sector V with Howrah Maidan. A global tender was floated to select the ISA consultant for the entire East-West corridor. A truncated 5-km from Sector V to Salt Lake Stadium of Kolkata’s Line 2 was launched in February 2020. In October, another 1-km till Phoolbagan was added. A French team had come down in the first week of November to conduct the safety audit and they checked the signalling system of the 2.3-km Sealdah stretch and the integration of automatic train control with the Operation Control Centre — East-West’s futuristic control room capable of running driverless trains. Subsequently, the ISA certificate was issued and KMRC engineers heaved a sigh of relief. “The ISA clearance is a milestone for the Sealdah extension,” said an engineer. On November 2, Metro Railway general manager had visited the underground Metro station coming up below Sealdah railway station. He had told TOI, “We should be able to start the stretch by early 2022 after CRS authorization.” The first trial from Phoolbagan to Sealdah station was conducted on July 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sealdah-link-of-e-w-metro-gets-intl-safety-nod/articleshow/88037882.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

Apart from Jhargram and East and West Midnapore, the Met officials have issued a warning for Kolkata, Howrah, North and South 24 Parganas for Sunday. The rainfall in these areas will range from 7cm and 20cm along with gusty winds (40-50/kmph). On Wednesday, the system took the shape of a low pressure over the central parts of Andaman Sea and its neighbourhoods. This system is likely to move west-northwestwards and turn into a depression over southeast and its adjacent east-central Bay of Bengal by Thursday. “The system is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal during the next 24 hours. Then, it is likely to move northwestwards and reach near north Andhra Pradesh– Odisha coasts on December 4 morning,” said a bulletin from IMD. The cyclone, if it forms, will be named Jawad. Under its influence most parts of Gangetic Bengal will start getting rain from Saturday. The minimum temperature will start shooting up from Thursday. “Some weather conditions will push up the minimum temperature. These include a total cut-off of the cold bearing Northwesterly wind, the southerly wind injecting much moisture into the land, cloud cover that will not allow the heat to radiate during night,” said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, deputy director general of meteorology at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata. Disaster management secretary Dushyant Nariala held a meeting with the DMs in south Bengal virtually to check the preparedness for the rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heavy-rain-alert-for-city-on-sunday/articleshow/88037884.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The accident occurred around 5.30am at Balajinagar in Chakan when victim Pawan Koli of Medankarwadi was waiting for his office bus. “Koli had done an ITI course and was working in an automobile company plant in Chakan,” his room-mate Sachin Patil told TOI. Assistant sub-inspector Suresh Gorde of the Chakan police said that on Tuesday around 5.30am, Koli and his colleagues were waiting for their company bus near a fuel-refilling station at Balajinagar in Chakan. “An elderly woman was crossing the Pune-Nashik highway when a vehicle hit her in front of Koli and his colleagues,” Gorde said. He added that Koli noticed that the woman fell on the road and he ran towards her and helped her stand up. “The woman suffered minor injuries. He then helped the woman cross the highway but before he could return to his colleagues, a speeding bus knocked him down,” Gorde said. He said Koli suffered injuries in his head, chest and right leg. “Though his colleagues rushed him to a hospital immediately, he was pronounced brought dead by the doctors,” Gorde said. He added that the bus driver did not stop after the hit, and Koli’s colleagues were thus unable to see the registration number of the vehicle. “They told us that it was a white bus that drove towards Nashik. It could be a bus ferrying employees of some company in Chakan MIDC,” Gorde said. He said there are CCTV cameras installed at the nearby gas station. “But incidentally the cameras couldn’t get a grab of the accident site,” Gorde said. Koli is survived by parents and younger brother. “His body was sent to his native village in Jalgaon district for cremation,” Patil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/good-samaritan-ran-over-after-saving-woman/articleshow/88037887.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pen versus power row may wrack Marathi litfest that starts tomorrow||Mumbai: Controversy has wracked the 94th Marathi litfest which is set to begin on Friday. With senior minister Chhagan Bhujbal hosting the literary meet, as chairman of the reception committee, in his sprawling 30-acre knowledge city near Nashik, the BJP has accused the NCP leader of appropriating the event. Astrophysicist, writer and Cambridge scholar Dr Jayant Narlikar will preside over the three-day conclave. Satish Kulkarni, BJP mayor of Nashik, said that his party would keep away from the literary meet which, he alleged, has been appropriated by the NCP. That the sammelan organisers should ignore former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister of state for health Bharati Pawar has upset the BJP. NCP president Sharad Pawar and industries minister Subhash Desai of Shiv Sena will attend the sammelan, while CM Uddhav Thackeray may join the proceedings online, it is said. Discerning readers are upset over invites to as many as 10 civil servants from across the state. Scholars said the pen versus power row may obscure Dr Narlikar’s contribution to Marathi literature as ace sci-fi writer. The growing intervention of politicians in the world of letters is the crux of the matter, said Arundhati Sakharkar, a literature student. “As literary bodies are starved of funds they have to depend on politicians who loosen their purse strings and hijack the sammelan. Hobnobbing with writers and publishers enhances their prestige and clout in their political fiefdoms,” Sakharkar said. The Marathi sahitya mahamandal, an apex body, is caught in a dilemma of its own making, Sakharkar pointed out. “The mahamandal is hopelessly cash-strapped; on the other hand, it wants to a turn the sammelan into a glittering event with a dash of glamour,” she added, recalling that actor Amitabh Bachchan was invited as a special guest a few years ago. Stating that “politics and printed word do not go hand in hand”, Asmita Mohite, the literary editor of Popular Prakashan, said the sahitya mahamandal should shun politicians “in toto”. “Politicians can attend the proceedings like thousands of others, but should keep away from the centre stage.” Mohite wanted the organisers to provide enough amenities to publishers and booksellers at the meet venue in order to reach out to maximum readers. Veterans recalled the 1975 sahitya sammelan, held in Karad during Indira Gandhi’s infamous Emergency, with Durga Bhagwat in the chair. The crusty cultural anthropologist-writer made it clear that she wouldn’t want politicians to be seated on the dais. Yashwantrao Chavan, the legendary Congressman and a minister in Gandhi’s cabinet, quietly got off the stage and occupied a seat in the front row—although he was head of the reception committee. While stating that the sammelan helped promote the sale of books and deepen the reader-writer-publisher bond, Ashish Patkar of Manovikas Prakashan said that fiscal discipline and organisational skills will go a long way to popularise literature under the auspices of the sahitya sammelan. “The Marathi sahitya sammelan may be a snubbed as a jamboree, but it holds a key place in Maharashtra’s cultural calendar,” Patkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pen-versus-power-row-may-wrack-marathi-litfest-that-starts-tomorrow/articleshow/88039093.cms||Ambarish Mishra

At the Kolhapur airport, over 230 passengers were screened. Only 35 had the RT-PCR negative test reports. The rest were given first or second dose of the Covid vaccine. At the Kognoli checkpost, he home guards have been deployed to check the vaccination certificate and RT-PCR reports. The health employees are checking people’s body temperature. Those with high fever are taken to nearby Covid care centre and their swab is collected. Though it is mandatory to put those with symptoms in quarantine facilities, they were allowed to travel further after being told to be in home isolation until the test reports come. The local authorities are apprised about the arrival of such travellers in their villages and towns and the local health staff have been asked to monitor the health of such travellers. Yogesh Sale, district health officer of Kolhapur Zilla Parishad, said, “It was the first day of restrictions imposed in the wake of new variant of the coronavirus. Slowly, quarantine centres will come up near the checkposts. We have plans in place to alert local authorities if anyone with travel history and symptoms arrives in the towns and villages. The details of such persons are gathered at the checkposts.” No vaccination, no transport service Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) will not let the citizens without both doses of vaccination done to board its buses from Thursday onwards. Civic chief Kadambari Balkawade said that teams will make surprise visits to the buses to check for the implementation of the decision.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: ESI hospitals migrate to online system in bid to end malpractices||AMARAVATI: Bringing complete transparency in the management of ESI hospitals, all operations have been switched to online across state. AP is the first state to move into online system right from recording the patient profile, prescription, treatment and procurement of drugs and other needs.  The ESI hospitals administration was mired in controversies in the past where anti-corruption agencies unearthed multi-crore sandals. Former minister K Atchannaidu and several top officials including the then directors and hospital superintendents were arrested in connection with the massive irregularities taken place during the TDP regime. Drugs worth several hundreds of crores were purchased but on paper, thanks to the connivance of the top officials of ESI administration in the past.  However, the ESI hospitals management was completely transformed within few months of Dr SB Rajendra Kumar Laghimsetti, an IRS officer, taking the reins of Insurance Medical Services (IMS), which is known as ESI. Rajendra studied the situation in the ESI hospitals across the state for a couple of months and found that lack of transparency is the root-cause of the irregularities. Without wasting time, he initiated measures in such a way that there is no scope for the private contractors to influence the officials to get favours.  Following the recommendations of Dr SB Rajendra, the state government decentralised the powers of the ESI director by appointing the regional nodal officers. The nodal officers have been empowered to procure the medicines and surgical material required in the hospitals. About 40 lakh workers across the state are getting benefited from the new initiatives. “Centralisation of services, purchases at office of the director, Insurance Medical Services (IMS) has resulted in vigilance and ACB inquiry into fraudulent purchases and payments. We have decided to supply all surgical, laboratory needs and equipment directly to the dispensaries. We have completely removed the middlemen from the system,” Dr Rajendra told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/esi-hospitals-migrate-to-online-system-in-bid-to-end-malpractices/articleshow/88037145.cms||Samdani MN

The deceased were identified as Asim Mondal (54), his aunt Kakoli Middhe (52) and Atithi Hakder (48), an employee. The powerful blast blew the roof off a house and flung the charred bodies of Asim and Middhe to several feet away outside the house. When locals reached the spot, they found Atithi in flames. They doused the fire, but she died by then. The explosion happened at 8am on Wednesday. Cops said firecrackers were manufactured in the house and the blast had occurred when two big containers packed with the ingredients for firecrackers caught fire. Satgachia MLA Mohan Naskar said, “The deceased were possibly engaged in manufacturing firecrackers.” Diamond Harbour police district superintendent of police Avijit Banerjee said, “We are probing whether the fireworks unit had a valid licence or not. The area is dotted with several illegal units manufacturing firecrackers. We have raided such units earlier and the raids will continue.” Karina Das, a Class-VIII student and a neighbour of Mondal, who was studying near a window, was hit by the glass pieces of the windowsill. Avik Middhe, who was returning home from tuition, was thrown to the side of the road by the impact of the explosion. Local BJP leader Sufol Ghatu said, “The illegal firecracker unit was functioning under the nose of administration. It shows the lawlessness in the state.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-killed-in-cracker-factory-blast/articleshow/88037900.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

The students were delighted to meet their friends and teachers. However, a few schools in the district are yet to resume operations and will reopen only once they get consent from the students’ parents. Shankar Yadav, KMC administrator for KMC schools said, "Out of the 183 primary schools in KMC limits, 76 have reopened after consent from the parents. 65% attendance was seen on the first day. The students were welcomed back to school after almost two years by offering them a rose, sanitiser and mask. Fifteen teams of the KMC visited various schools in the city and guided the school administration.” To maintain all Covid safety protocols, we have asked all the schools to start health clinics on the school premises where the kids will be checked by the doctors. We have also asked the schools to keep thermal screening guns, sanitiser and oximeter in stock. Conducting sports and cultural programmes in the schools that will bring students together have been prohibited," added Shankar Yadav. Aishwarya Patil, a Class VI student said, “We are happy to be back on the school campus and among our friends. Understanding issues were there during the online lectures and now, with the schools reopening offline, it is good that we can get our doubts cleared by our teachers in the school. The situation was the same in Sangli and Satara districts as most of the schools reopened on Wednesday for the students of Classes I to IV in rural areas, and for students of Classes I to VII in the urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-students-delighted-to-meet-friends-teachers-again/articleshow/88037152.cms||---

The extension is also applicable for registration of new voters, change in constituency or booth within constituency or any other corrections. TOI had on Wednesday reported the district administration deleted names of 1,58,936 persons from voters list in the district for not submitting their photographs. They will not be able to cast their vote in any election in 2022. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections are due in February next year and some 1,14,481 deleted names are from the city limits. Chances of more deletions cannot be ruled out as scrutiny of 88,024 names, of which 79,800 are from the city, is still going on. Last date for submitting photographs and availing other services was November 30 under the special summary revision of photo electoral rolls. ECI letter dated November 30 to state’s chief electoral officer has now given an extension up to December 5. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said, “Voters should submit their photographs with required documents if they have failed to do so. All those who have completed 18 years as on January 1, 2022, should register as new voters. The voters can get correction or change in address done. Political parties and public representatives should extend necessary help. It is the national responsibility of eligible people to check their names in voters list and ensure their name in it. All should check their name in voters list and consult booth level officer or election office in case they fail to find their name.” All types of forms are available and can be submitted online on https://www.nvsp.in/ which is the website of National Voters’ Service Portal.

---||Business||Manufacturing activity rise at 10-month high in November||NEW DELHI: Activity in the country’s manufacturing sector rose at its fastest pace in 10 months on the back of rising new orders, led by robust domestic demand and strong increase in production & sales, highlighting a swift recovery in the key industrial sector. This augurs well for overall economic growth, a survey showed on Wednesday. Increasing from 55.9 in October to 57.6 in November, the IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) signalled the strongest improvement in health of the sector in 10 months. Moreover, the headline figure was well above its long-run average of 53.6. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction. Manufacturers said strengthening demand, improving market conditions and successful marketing boosted sales in November. Factory orders rose for the fifth month in a row and at a sharp pace — the fastest since February. The survey is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to purchasing managers in a panel of about 400 manufacturers. Since the lifting of curbs after the second Covid wave, the economy has scripted a robust recovery. The pickup in vaccination is expected to add to confidence and spur consumption and help overall growth. But the new virus variant has cast a shadow on overall global growth and added an element of uncertainty about the durability of global economic recovery. “The fact that firms purchased additional inputs at a stronger rate amid efforts to restock, combined with recurring declines in inventories of finished goods and tentative signs of a pick-up in hiring activity, indicate that production volumes will likely expand further in the near-term,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/manufacturing-activity-rise-at-10-month-high-in-november/articleshow/88039701.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi airport’s Covid lab cancels notices, to hire more staff||NEW DELHI: Last month, about 150 staffers of Genestrings Diagnostics, the Covid testing lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport, were serving their notice period. PCR testing on arrival had fallen from a peak of 5,000-6,000 daily earlier this summer by almost 90% to 500-600 ever since flyers from the UAE were no longer required to undergo the same. And in mid-November, India allowed fully vaccinated and Covid-negative (from pre-departure test) travellers from 99 countries to skip quarantine. The spread of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 in other countries and its imminent threat to India is set to change that. From Wednesday, new rules mandate everyone flying in from ‘at risk’ countries — a list that is likely to grow with time — to undergo tests. Genestrings Diagnostics has cancelled the notices of the staffers and plans to hire more hands. A part of Ghaziabad’s Yashoda Hospitals, it currently has a total workforce of 650 at Delhi Airport and will add about 75 more people. “We conducted about 1,500 tests on Wednesday and 60% of these passengers from ‘at risk’ countries opted for rapid PCR tests over the regular RT-PCR tests. We can process 500-600 samples every hour and have an overall capacity of performing 12,000-15,000 tests daily, which can be expanded,” Genestrings Diagnostics COO Chetan Kohli told TOI. The rapid test costs Rs 3,900 and its result is out in just 90 minutes. The normal test result can take up to five to six hours and it is no surprise that weary passengers coming from long international flights opt for the faster — and nearly eight times more expensive — option. Passengers from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe need a negative report to leave the airport, as do those coming from an ‘at risk’ country who have to take a connecting domestic flight. Asked if there any plans to lower the cost of the rapid tests, Kohli said, “It has been contemplated but it is not steep as a function of the input (costs). We have 350 people handling only rapid on-arrival tests. Then there are other costs like that of machinery, swabs and reagents.” “The rapid kits are very, very expensive, costing upwards of Rs 2,000. There has been a slight price reduction since the second wave. They come from a leading MNC which has not reduced prices though we are the biggest buyers in the country,” Kohli said. Defending the cost as “not an unreasonable ask”, he said travellers abroad pay about 200 euros (Rs 17,000 for the same test. “We saw on Wednesday (morning) that people are keen to get rapid tests done. Many travellers had booked RT-PCR and changed that to rapid when they came to know that the option is available here. They see the value in this,” Kohli said. Genestrings anticipates it will be required to conduct 2,000-3,000 tests for arrivals from ‘at risk’ countries. “A lot of European countries are still not open. The authorities saw that on-arrival testing went on very smoothly and might open a few more European sectors. So even if three or four more flights are added, that is 1,000 more passengers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igis-covid-lab-cancels-notices-to-hire-more-staff/articleshow/88039107.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Caught in the plunging temperatures, Surtis were confused about whether to carry woollens or cover up in a raincoat while going out to work. In total, Surat district’s rural and urban areas received 134mm of rain since the morning and the wet spell is likely to continue for a couple of days more. In the past 24 hours, maximum temperature in the city dropped by 10 degrees on Wednesday. While the maximum remained at 22 degrees C, 10 degrees less than Tuesday, the minimum was at 20 degrees C. Meanwhile, rain only multiplies citizens’ woes by several degrees more. Already facing trouble due to dug up and blocked roads, people had to manage sludge and bad roads owing to ongoing development work of Metro Rail and underground construction roads that are dug up or blocked at multiple locations in the city. Apart from commuters, even locals in certain areas were left wet and fuming in the unexpected rain that forced them to take long diversions to reach nearby spots. Due to the ongoing work routes of BRTS, even the bus service have been changed by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC). Fishermen in Valsad and Navsari have been advised by local administration to avoid venturing into the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/south-gujarat-districts-under-wet-spell/articleshow/88037333.cms||---

ED issued a notice to Kozhikode native Yakoob Parayil who was among the six persons to file a detailed complaint against Mavunkal which led to his arrest. As per the notice, Yakoob was directed to appear at ED’s office as part of the probe into a case registered against Mavunkal under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Wednesday. The notice was issued under Section 50 of PMLA. But, it is learnt that he has sought more time to appear before the agency. The notice directed Yakoob to produce details of the transactions between him and Mavunkal along with relevant documents and his contact details. Also, details of other persons involved in the above transactions, along with their contact details, have been sought by ED through the notice. Yakoob has been also asked to produce a copy of his Aadhaar card, Pan card and Passport and other documents/evidence relating to Mavunkal. He has been directed to give a statement under Section 50 of PMLA. The notice was issued by Vikas C Mehta, deputy director, Kochi zonal office. Crime branch had initially arrested Mavunkal on Sept 25 for allegedly duping various persons of nearly Rs 10 crore. He had decorated his mansion at Kaloor like a museum and had kept several ‘antiques’ on display, which were fake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/monson-case-ed-issues-notice-to-complainant/articleshow/88037934.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 3 fake cops abduct Chandkheda man||AHMEDABAD: A 25-year-old man was abducted from his Chandkheda house by three men posing as the city crime branch officers on Monday. It is suspected that the man was abducted by relatives of a woman who had allegedly eloped with the victim’s friend. Paresh Chaudhari, a 24-year-old resident of Vrundavan Flats near Godrej Garden City in Chandkheda, filed a police complaint in this regard on Tuesday. The share broker claimed that his friend Nailesh Chaudhary was abducted when he was alone at home. According to the FIR, Paresh’ elder brother Bhavesh Chaudhary was in a relationship with a woman named Deepika Chaudhary from Mehsana. On November 10, Deepika and Bhavesh eloped from their respective houses, following which they went incommunicado. Since then, her relatives have been hunting for the runaway couple, Paresh alleged. On Sunday, Paresh went to a friend’s wedding in Banaskantha while Nailesh stayed behind at home. “Around 11am on Monday, Nailesh called me to say that three men from the city crime branch had come to the flat. The three men told Nailesh that there was an incident of loot on New CG Road and they were checking for illegal tenants. The three asked Nailesh if he had a rent agreement. When Nailesh could not produce one, they told him to accompany them to Chandkheda police station,” said Paresh. Paresh called up Chandkheda police station only to find that Nailesh had not arrived there. He called up his friend’s phone but it went unanswered. Paresh rushed back to Ahmedabad and filed a complaint of abduction and impersonation with Chandkheda police. He claimed that Nailesh had been abducted by Deepika’s relatives. Chandkheda police have registered an FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-fake-cops-abduct-chandkheda-man/articleshow/88037909.cms||---

The civic body’s advisory to the private doctors comes in wake of the emergence of the new Omicron variant. “In case a patient is tested positive for Covid-19, the doctor concerned must report it to the civic body immediately,” NMC’s medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje said. According to him, the doctor has to start treatment of Covid positive patient as per the set protocol. The civic body has already ramped up its daily testing for the last few days after the emergence of the new Covid variant came to the fore. It has started conducting tests at its OPD clinics, market places and colleges to detect people infected with the virus. The former president of IMA Nashik chapter and critical care specialist Dr Sameer Chandratre said medical practitioners have been sending details of the patients who test positive to the NMC ever since the pandemic unfolded. Even private labs of the city also send a list of patients who are testing positive. “Although NMC has increased daily tests, there is a further need to increase testing, especially the RT-PCR, to detect people infected with virus. I feel that special focus should be on those who have come to city from other bigger cities like Delhi, Mumbai or those who have had recent international travel history,” Chandratre said. Few days ago the NMC had tested four returnees from South Africa and all of them tested negative for the Covid-19. However, the Nshik civic body instructed them to isolate themselves at home for a week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-pvt-docs-tell-those-with-symptoms-to-get-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/88037175.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Balwinder is the elder brother of Simarjit, who is Atam Nagar constituency MLA.Dhanda said, “As non-bailable arrest warrants were issued by the court, the local police were supposed to arrest Bains and present him before the court on December 1. However, the police submitted a document in the court stating that they did not find him at his house. Bains has been organizing political rallies every other day for which cops are deployed on VIP duty. Moreover, he has been provided security by the police. So, how can the police not find him? The ruling government and the police are giving full support to Bains.”“We learned Wednesday that another SIT has been formed to probe the case. The chargesheet has already been submitted by the police, so it hardly matters what new SIT does,” he added.A woman had lodged a complaint against Simarjit Bains, his accomplices Karamjeet Singh, Sukhchain Singh, Paramjeet Singh, Pardeep Kumar alias Gogi Sharma, Baljinder Kaur and Jasveer Kaur alias Bhabi on November 16, 2020.

There he sought explanations from the officials present on why work was going on despite the ban on construction activities in the capital. The minister claimed to have regularly received phone calls from citizens complaining about the continuing work at the site. Rai also pointed out several violations of norms for dust pollution control at the central Delhi area where the central government’s hub of offices is being built. He demanded to see the “papers that permitted construction despite the ban” after being told that the Central Vista, being “a project of national importance like Metro Delhi and numerous defence projects”, was exempt from the ban. Rai asked all the departments concerned in the Delhi environment ministry to send two separate show-cause notices to the Central Public Works Department, the first demanding an explanation of why the construction was continuing despite the prevailing prohibition, and another on the violations of dust-pollution controlling measures. The notices, to be sent by the capital’s pollution monitoring agency, Delhi Pollution Control Committee, hadn’t, however, been dispatched till Wednesday evening. “We were repeatedly getting calls informing us that despite the ban, construction activities were in full swing at the Central Vista site. That is why we have come here today for an inspection,” Rai said. “And we can see that work is in progress here in spite of the ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi. We are, therefore, issuing a notice to CPWD to explain on what basis and on whose orders it is operating.” The Delhi minister added, “CPWD must respond to these notices by tomorrow and further action will be taken on the basis of its response.” Rai was told by the CPWD officials at the site that all the documents exempting the construction from the anti-pollution prohibition had already been submitted to the Supreme Court and the matter was sub-judice. Rai, however, insisted that they submit the papers to his ministry upon receiving the show-cause notice. On Monday, the Supreme Court had sought an explanation from the central government on why the construction related to the Central Vista project was carrying on despite the various measures undertaken to check the drastic deterioration in air quality in the capital. While solicitor general Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Centre, asserted that dust-control measures were being adhered to at the construction site, the court gave the central and state governments two days to explain the construction activity under their jurisdictions. The matter of the air pollution is to be heard in the apex court on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-at-central-vista-site-asks-why-work-still-on/articleshow/88038587.cms||Kushagra Dixit
---||Delhi||Six from at-risk nations admitted to Delhi's LNJP hospital, 4 Covid positive||NEW DELHI: At least six persons arriving from the UK, Belgium and some African nations were referred to Lok Nayak Hospital on Wednesday from the Indira Gandhi International Airport. Sources said four of them had tested positive for Covid-19, while the test results of the remaining two were declared as indeterminate. Lok Nayak is the designated hospital for isolating and treating persons arriving in India from countries where the Omicron variant of the Covid coronavirus has been detected. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak, told TOI that one individual arriving from the UK, one from Belgium and four from African countries had been kept in isolation while their samples were away for genome sequencing. “Most of them are asymptomatic. One has a sore throat,” Kumar disclosed. A team of doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff has been deputed in the isolation ward. They are trained to look after the high-risk patients while avoiding getting infected themselves. The Lok Nayak director said all staffers posted in the ward have been asked to wear PPE kit and maintain a distance from possible Omicron-infected travellers. According to the Union health ministry, more than 3,000 international travellers were tested across airports in the country on Wednesday, of whom six proved positive to Covid. “The samples of the Covid-positive passengers have been sent to INSACOG, a consortium of 28 national laboratories, for genome sequencing,” the ministry said in a statement. It added that the Centre was keeping track of the evolving situation. Initial reports from South Africa, where the Omicron was detected first, suggest that the new variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant. However, it is not yet clear if it causes more severe symptoms and whether it can escape the immunity developed by a person through natural infection or vaccination. According to World Health Organization, preliminary data suggests an increase in hospitalisation in South Africa, but said this might be due to overall rise in people becoming infected rather than as a result of specific infection with Omicron. “There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants,” the UN health body said. In a recent statement, WHO said, “Understanding the severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of Covid-19, including Delta, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and, thus, prevention is always key.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/6-with-travel-history-admitted-to-lnjp/articleshow/88039110.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

According to the FIR filed with crime branch, Munaf Shaikh made a plea before Shahpur police on October 23, saying that his passport had gone missing and he got a certificate from the police. Using this certificate, he made a fresh plea and got a new passport. He then went to Dubai on November 13 and returned on November 19. Meanwhile, special operations group (SOG) of crime branch got an input regarding this case and found that Shaikh’s passport was still with the court in a sub-judice case of cheating.

---||Nagpur||Questions raised over DGCA clearance to NFC’s grounded aircraft||Nagpur: Days after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) granted a green signal to Nagpur Flying Club (NFC) to restart admissions of students and training programmes, a lawyer has questioned how one of its four aircraft, a Cessna-172R (VT-ACQ), was included on Flying Training Organization (FTO) list of ‘approved equipment’ in the absence of airworthiness certificate. Shrinivas Deshpande, who has been fighting for the revival of the British-era club for over two decades, filed a civil application in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Monday. He has prayed for explanation from the apex body in this regard. He contends that including the grounded aircraft in NFC’s FTO would put the lives of students at risk, as it has never flown since 2017. Deputy divisional commissioner Milind Salve refused to comment on Deshpande’s allegations. On Friday, the judges at Nagpur bench of Bombay high court had visited the NFC premises and sat inside this aircraft for about 10 minutes. Only its engines were started as a demonstration when they were inside, but the aircraft did not fly. Deshpande, himself an NFC alumnus, alleged that the officials from divisional commissioner’s office did not give the judiciary all the information in this regard. His application was filed in a PIL by late Flt Lt Shridhar Ghatate, which was later pursued by his wife Sumedha, after the British-era club stopped operating on account of the Maharashtra government’s apathy in 2016. The DGCA cleared the decks for restarting NFC after a gap of over 4.5 years by granting its certificate of approval on November 16 for flying all four of its aircraft – three Cessna 152s and one 172R. “If you see the DGCA’s certificate, the approval for 172R aircraft is handwritten. It is very surprising that a top office like DGCA is giving handwritten approval, which was not even counter-signed by it. The judges sat in the aircraft and may have been impressed, but that plane is not in a position to take to the skies till it is made airworthy,” the lawyer said. Quoting experts, Deshpande added the aircraft has been lying defunct for the last four years and was overhauled twice in 2017 and 2020. However, it has never taken to the skies, which is mandatory for receiving airworthiness certification from the Delhi-based apex body. “Over time, its avionics developed some snag and mandatory airworthiness test never took place. To receive an airworthiness certificate, an aircraft must take-off and land three times within 30 minutes after attaining a particular altitude,” said Deshpande. The Cessna-172R (VT-ACQ) is manufactured by a company in the United States, and was gifted to NFC by the Aero Club of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/questions-raised-over-dgca-clearance-to-nfcs-grounded-aircraft/articleshow/88037919.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Shekhar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forests and chief wildlife warden, said they had directed district forest officer T K Ashok Kumar to find a suitable location near Chadivayal in Boluvampatti forest range and four other areas in Coimbatore forest division to set up the centre. “We will require 40 to 50 acres land for the centre, which will be equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and veterinary experts.” The centre, he said, would house advanced operation theatres and laboratories. “Animal rescue team members will also be trained at the centre.” The government, Niraj said, has plans to set up similar centres in Trichy and Tirunelveli districts as well. “Presently, we are trying to find suitable locations in the three districts. It would cost at least Rs25 crore to set up the three rescue, treatment and rehabilitation centres. A detailed project report will be prepared very soon.” S Ramasubramanian, field director of Anaimalai Tiger Reserve, said all the injured animals, be it elephants, tigers, leopards or other small species, will be treated at the centre. “At the Chadivayal elephant camp in Boluvampatti forest range we have more than 50 acres land to set up the centre.

The woman, who is an OT (operation theatre) technician at a private hospital, in the FIR said that she came into contact with an NRI from the US over a social media platform.

---||Coimbatore||Coimbatore: Officials to fine people sans face mask in public places||COIMBATORE: The district administration is all set to strictly enforce the face mask etiquette in public places and has asked officials to fine the people flouting the precautionary measure. It has also instructed commercial establishments to ensure compliance with the face mask rule by their staff and customers. In a press statement, collector G S Sameeran said the decision to penalize the public was taken as a growing number of people was taking the relaxation of Covid norms for granted and thronging public places sans face masks and without maintaining social distancing. The collector said he, along with corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara, had inspected a few places in the city to check for the people’s adherence to Covid norms and was disappointed to find people roaming the streets without wearing face mask. Pointing out that the district had reported more than 4,500 positive cases a day during the peak of the second Covid wave in May, Sameeran said the caseload had now come down to an average of 100 a day. “This was possible because of the cooperation of public in following Covid norms.” The district, which has inoculated 92% of the eligible population with the first dose and more than 60% with both the doses, is placed second in the state in the vaccination front, he said. A senior city corporation official said the neighbouring Kerala had been collecting hefty fine from the people not wearing face mask. “Kerala has also denied free Covid treatment to the people who are not vaccinated. Such stringent measures are likely to be enforced here too in the coming days if there is a spike in cases. Dropping the guard may cause another spike, that too when there are apprehensions about the new variant.” The official said the passengers from the countries, where the Omicron variant is identified, would be made to undergo Covid testing at the city airport and kept in isolation till the test results were out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/officials-to-fine-people-sans-face-mask-in-public-places/articleshow/88037937.cms||---

The daily vaccination number has gone up from 1,200 to 3,000,” said Dr Sapna Thakre. “We are now taking measures to improvise vaccination in the power loom sector by seeking the cooperation and the infrastructure for setting up vaccination camps,” Dr Thakre said. Over 1.5 lakh people work in the power loom of Malegaon, where vaccine hesitancy is maximum. The administration has decided to initiate the dialogue with the power looms and their organisations to carry out the vaccination of the owners, office-bearers and appeal to the workers to get vaccinated. “We will be conducting vaccination drives in the areas even at night as per the convenience of the employees,” the officer added.

Gayatri Makwana, resident of Sajal Park in New Naroda, said in her FIR with Cybercrime police said that she had taken a loan from a financial services firm in September 2021. The agent Makwana had approached for the loan, Pushpa Rajbhar, asked her if she wanted to a company called Capital Finance. As she was looking for work, she joined the firm and her task was to call people, offer them loans and collect processing fees from them. After working for around a month, her employer, Rakesh Trivedi, told her to call all the clients and take more processing fees from them. As she opposed the idea of taking more money from their clients, Trivedi told her that if the clients did not pay the extra money, they would not get the loans. She followed his instructions and recovered extra money, which varied from client to client. Later, Makwana learned that the firm named Capital Finance was not registered and Trivedi in connivance with Rajbhar defrauded 59 prospective clients of around Rs 4.48 lakh. She approached Cybercrime police and filed a complaint of breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy along with charges under the IT Act against Rajbhar and Trivedi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-files-complaint-against-employers-for-cheating-clients/articleshow/88037935.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Before polls, BJP’s vacationing corporators to face RT-PCR test upon return||Nagpur: The state government’s decision to make RT-PCR test mandatory for all those coming from other states has posed a challenge before BJP corporators who are currently on a party-funded tour to various locations. There’s always the possibility that someone might test positive and in turn put his/her voting right in jeopardy. The MLC polls are scheduled for December 10 and many of BJP’s public representatives in Nagpur local bodies have been sent on ‘vacation’ to Goa, Uttarakhand etc. MLC Pravin Datke, who is also party’s city president, said, “As required by law, all our public representatives will undergo RT-PCR test. I will enquire with authorities as to what will be the procedure if any of them tests positive.” He added that all their vacationing public representatives will return on December 7. Datke said, “When they come back on December 7, all of them will be quarantined at a common facility right till the election date. Calling them on December 7 itself has nothing to do with Omicron, it’s just a party decision.” TOI spoke to a few other BJP corporators, who said on condition of anonymity, that this was purely ‘bad luck’. “See, our party would not have ever imagined that something like Omicron would come and rules for RT-PCR would be put in place. I am still in Nagpur due to prior commitments and feel very happy about that. If I had tested positive upon return to Maharashtra then it would have been a big problem,” said a senior corporator. A BJP party functionary, who earlier held public office, said it’s a tricky situation. “Calling all of them back immediately won’t serve any purpose now, because the timeline is too tight,” said the leader. District collector R Vimala said what happens with voters who are Covid-19 positive on polling date is still uncertain. “This will depend on instructions from Chief Electoral Officer. We have asked for directions (on this issue),” said the collector. Till a reply comes, BJP members will no doubt be on the tenterhooks. A senior party member, who is also a corporator, said, “Chances of dozens of them testing positive are virtually nil. Have you ever seen such a thing happen, except during the second wave. Even if we assume that half a dozen test positive and that rules do not allow them to vote, it won’t affect the party’s chances and I think it’s a non-issue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/before-polls-bjps-vacationing-corporators-to-face-rt-pcr-test-upon-return/articleshow/88037936.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva to adjourn Delhi Waqf Board’s plea for three weeks. The petition sought to preserve and protect its heritage properties that are likely to be impacted by the project. Mehta said that the redevelopment had not reached the properties in question as it is a “long plan”. “Kindly have it after three weeks. Nothing is happening to these properties. It is a very long plan and we have not reached anywhere near it,” said the solicitor general who represented the Centre. Taking note of the senior law officers’ stand, the court posted the plea till January 20, saying it has “full faith” in the solicitor general and turned down the request of the senior lawyer representing the petitioner to take the statement on record. In its petition, Waqf Board has sought the preservation and protection of six of its properties in the area in which the redevelopment work is ongoing —Masjid Zabta Ganj at Mansingh Road, Jama Masjid at Red Cross Road, Masjid Sunehri Bagh Road Near Udyog Bhawan, Mazar Sunehri Bagh Road behind Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Masjid Krishi Bhawan inside Krishi Bhawan Compound and Masjid Vice President at the official residence of the Vice President of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nothing-happening-to-waqf-properties/articleshow/88038600.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Doctor to compensate for woman’s death||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered a doctor at Una in Gir Somnath district to pay compensation for a woman’s death caused by an adverse reaction to oral contraceptive pills, after she started developing blood clots. The doctor has been ordered to pay Rs 11.3 lakh to the family of the woman with 9% interest since 2011, and one third of the sum will be put in a fixed deposit in the name of her youngest son, who can withdraw the money after five years. According to the case details, in March 2011, 29-year-old Jyotika Patel went to Dr Chaitanya Nenuji with a complaint of irregular menstruation. The doctor prescribed oral contraceptive pills. On March 3, he prescribed ‘Intimacy Plus 2’ and on March 28, she was advised to take ‘My Pill’ for the next three weeks. A few days after taking the pills she went to the doctor complaining about quivering in her hand. The doctor allegedly told her not to worry and to continue with the pills. As the problem in her hand continued and she started having pain, she was referred to another doctor in Junagadh, but did not get any respite. She was further referred to a doctor in Vadodara, where after a doppler test of her upper limbs, it was found that there was blood clots in her vein. She had to undergo a surgery in May 2011, but a few days later she complained of acute headache, indigestion and vertigo. As her health deteriorated, she was rushed to a private hospital in Rajkot and then Ahmedabad, where she was treated at two hospitals in July 2011. By then, she was diagnosed with spastic paralysis and 100% disability. She was confined to bed and passed away in September 2014. Her relatives sued Dr Nenuji for compensation, claiming that she had died because of side effect of his medicine. When she complained about the side effects, the doctor assured her that the tablets would not cause any problems and insisted on her continuing with the medicines. The doctor had not asked for any drug sensitivity test. Dr Nenuji defended himself by saying that he had given contraceptive pills because the woman was suffering from irregular menstruation cycles. These medicines do not have side effect after 40 hours. The patient did not return to complain and no side effect was noticed so he asked her to continue with the pills from March 28 to April 18, 2011. He stated that the tablets contain the hormone estrogen and progestin and the side effect is normally vomiting. The doctor also placed other oral contraceptive pills such as ‘Choice’ and ‘Mala-D’, which the government distributes at subsidised rates, to show that the ingredients of the tablets are same. An opinion of a neurologist, Dr Jitendra Singh, was also put on record by the applicant, that ‘My Pill’ contains 0.035mg of ethinylestradiol and when the patient had shivering in her hand, the pills should have been immediately stopped. Dr Nenuji claimed that the patient was taken to different doctors and this could be a side effect of any medicine prescribed by any other doctor. There was no direct evidence that her health deteriorated because of his prescription. There was no postmortem report placed on record. After considering the opinions of doctors and claims by contesting parties, the commission held Dr Nenuji liable to compensate for the patient’s death and computed the amount on the basis of her age and the two children she left behind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/doc-to-compensate-for-womans-death/articleshow/88037949.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||No assent to Gunda Act for over a year||GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat Gunda and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, which was passed by the Gujarat assembly more than a year ago, in September 2020, still hangs fire as the President has not given his assent to the law. Sources in the government said that the Union home ministry had raised a few queries and clarifications, which were replied to by the state government. However, there has not been any progress ever since and sources said it appears as if the state government will not be able to implement the law, even as assembly elections are scheduled to be held a year from now. While passing the legislation last year, the state government claimed it would be effective in curbing the illegal trade of alcohol, gambling, cow slaughter, human and child trafficking, sale of counterfeit medicines, narcotic drugs, kidnapping, transport and sale of illegal weapons. Sources said most of the clarifications and queries raised by the Union home ministry related to clauses dealing with punishment for various offences. “In some cases, the punishment prescribed in existing Acts like the NDPS Act or IPC is more stringent that the punishment prescribed in the Gujarat Gunda and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act,” sources said. According to sources, the state government contended that the law has been enacted to ensure better law enforcement. “The state government informed the centre that the punishment clauses have been defined by the government to ensure that anti-social activities can be controlled,” said a source. Those found guilty will face prison terms ranging from seven to ten years, along with fines of up to Rs 50,000. Government employees found guilty of abetting culprits will face jail terms. Gundas are defined as those who threaten and bully people individually or in groups, or those engaged in destruction of public properties.

---||Nagpur||PIL filed to stop contaminated water flowing into Surabardi lake||Nagpur: A citizen has approached the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court for directives to take corrective and remedial measures to prevent contamination of Surabardi lake water. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare on Wednesday issued notices to the respondents, including Maharashtra government, asking them to file reply within four weeks. Government pleader Ketki Joshi accepted notices on behalf of various state departments. The respondents include secretaries of state urban development and irrigation departments, divisional commissioner, collector, zilla parishad chief executive officer (CEO), minor irrigation department executive engineer, Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MSETCL), Nagpur Metro Region Development Authority (NMRDA), Nagpur tehsil office sub-divisional officer, tehsildar, panchayat samiti’s block development officer and Wadi police station officer. City resident Nitin Shendre, who has agricultural land adjacent to the lake, pointed out that its water is highly polluted as entire sewage of Surabardi village is dumped into it. However, the same water that is not potable is being provided to the villagers to quench their thirst. Spread over a area of 75.39 hectare, the Surabardi lake was built by the Maharashtra Jiwan Pradhikaran (MJP) to provide a source of drinking water for Suraburdi and nearby villages. The MJP purifies the water under Lava-Surabardi Peri Urban Water Supply Scheme and then supplies it to the nearby villages. Petitioner’s lawyer Sudhir Malode said the water is extremely dangerous to drink even for cattle. Submitting photographs and maps in HC, he highlighted several encroachments in and around the water body coupled with illegal constructions such as cattle sheds, towers for high tension lines, some construction on the pandhan road and others. He also pointed out that Grampanchayat Suraburdi has constructed an unauthorized public toilet on the lake bed. Shendre informed that the Surabardi Gram Panchayat had constructed two big cement concrete platforms near the lake without any sanction. Those are being used as crematoria to burn dead bodies and the ashes are thrown into the lake, thus adding to the pollution. The petitioner further raised concern over growing encroachments in the lake area by citizens, right under the 220KV Khaparkheda Wardha high tension line. On January 5, 2015, the same petitioner had filed PIL regarding illegal construction of crematorium and public urinals that are polluting Surabardi lake.

The authorities of these districts said the students’ response on day-1 was encouraging. The teachers and staff at some schools welcomed the students by playing the drums, distributing chocolates, and even performing symbolic ‘aartis’. Rajendra Kshirsagar, the CEO of Ahmednagar said, “All the efforts are being taken to ensure that the schools function by adhering to the covid norms.” In Ahmednagar, 4,579 schools started functioning and around 2.20 lakh students were present on the first day. BJ Patil, the primary education officer of Ahmednagar said, “With all safety measures in place the schools have started functioning in rural areas .” “The students were happy to come to the school formally even as the informal schooling in the villages was being carried out in the Zilla Parishad schools to facilitate their education,” said Sunita Gosavi one of the teachers in Dhule taluka. In Jalgaon too the schools started on a positive note. Shama Jawale, a resident of the Pachora said, “Being daily wage workers, we hardly know anything about education. The children skip studies when we are off to work. The formal schooling will help a lot.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/primary-schools-in-jalgaon-dhule-ahmednagar-reopen/articleshow/88037202.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||BP: Rural areas feel urban pressure||Ahmedabad: Women and men of rural areas of the state are more prone to suffering from blood pressure problems than their urban counterparts. Changing lifestyles in rural areas are contributing to the health condition. Doctors said that there is no longer a marked difference between the lifestyles in rural and urban areas. The easy availability of junk food in rural areas, for instance, is a factor in causing blood pressure spikes. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), covering the 2019-2020 period, for the first time recorded blood pressure in rural and urban populations. The findings revealed that 3.8% of the urban women had moderately or highly elevated blood pressure. The percentage was 5.1 in rural areas. Among men, 3.9% of the urban population had moderately or highly elevated blood pressure; the figure was 4.9% in the rural population. A senior superintendent of a civil hospital, who wished to remain anonymous, said that women who are homemakers have to contend with stress. He said tensions become acute when such women are part of large families. These dynamics increase blood pressure, he said. The doctor said that his hospital has been treating patients with high blood pressure who reveal personal problems such as severe financial crisis. “In the group of patients who constitute the labour force, the very question of survival is a stressor,” he said. “Such distress became common after the outbreak of the pandemic.” Dr Tapan Shah, a Satellite area GP, said: “The cases of heart attack are increasing in rural areas. We have seen several cases of young people dying of heart attack.” Dr Shah added: “With more farmers using modern equipment, sedentary lifestyle has become a rural ailment too.” Junk food and packaged snacks are contributing to the health calamity, Dr Shah said. He said that at his Sanand clinic, three of five patients have blood pressure and blood sugar problems. Dr Dinesh Jani, physician in Surendranagar, said that high blood pressure has become a common condition in rural areas. “We do not have the data to establish that more people are getting the disease.” He added: “I personally feel that 80% of the people in rural areas are hooked to one or the other form of tobacco. This spurs diseases.” He said that in urban areas, people are turning to yoga and working out at gyms and hence are getting fitter. That is not the case in rural areas, he said. Dr Ashvin Ghadhvi, another physician, said that life expectancy has increased in the state and people above 50 are being affected by high blood pressure and other lifestyle diseases. He said that in urban areas, health awareness makes people stick to their medication regimes. But, he said, in rural areas people stop taking medicines once they feel better even if that would not have been recommended by their doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bp-rural-areas-feel-urban-pressure/articleshow/88037957.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The fire reportedly followed a blast in the main engine and it was soon contained by the ship’s crew. The ship was sailing with 322 passengers and 85 crew members when the incident was reported around 12.40pm on Wednesday. Lakshadweep administration said that everyone on the ship was safe and that no one was injured. With the help of a coast guard ship, the passenger ship was being towed towards Andrott Island and sources with the administration added that the ship would reach the island late on Wednesday night. The largest passenger ship of Lakshadweep administration had left Kochi and was on its way to Andrott island after dropping passengers at Kavaratti island. The ship was scheduled to dock at Andrott, Kalpeni and Agatti islands before heading back to Kavaratti and Kochi. Official sources said all passengers were islanders and there were no tourists on board. Sources with the press information bureau said ICGS Samarth, which was on routine patrol in Lakshadweep, was diverted to render assistance. “At 3.02 pm, master of MV Kavaratti intimated that the fire was under control and boundary cooling was in progress by the ship’s crew. At 3.30 pm, it was ascertained that MV Corals and MV Sagar Yuvraj are being dispatched by Lakshadweep administration for rendering necessary assistance,” the source said. The official added that ICGS Samarth arrived near the passenger vessel at 4.45pm and it also reported that the fire was under control. All passengers and crew were safe and the vessel is on emergency power supply. The master requested ICGS Samarth to evacuate a few passengers and accordingly the ship’s boarding team did an evacuation/assessment. Additionally, INS Shardul was dispatched from the headquarters of Southern Naval Command in Kochi for rendering further support, the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fire-aboard-mv-kavaratti-doused-passengers-crew-safe/articleshow/88037959.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, she said they were testing 5,000 swab samples a day. “While different kits are used for RT-PCR tests, TaqPath kit was helpful in detecting the Delta variant. While the Omicron variant could not be detected with the kit, if the ‘S’ gene is not detected in the sample, it was considered an indication of either Delta or Omicron variant.” If there is ‘S’ gene dropout, Nirmala said, the sample would be sent to a higher lab, where it would be subjected to genomic sequence. “This will help detect the variant, be it Alpha, Alpha Plus, Beta, Delta or Omicron.” The CMCH dean said the government had issued guidelines on the samples to be subjected to such tests. She said the swab samples from a cluster and that of passengers coming from countries hit by the Omicron variant, youngsters with severe symptoms and young children would undergo tests to check the ‘S’ gene dropout. “If there is dropout, samples will be sent to Chennai.” Nirmala said the health department had assured them of adequate stock of TaqPath kits. “This will help us ramp up testing among the vulnerable population. As of now, the virus spread is limited in the district, where the test positivity rate is just 1.2%. The daily caseload is also limited to around 110.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmch-to-get-more-covid-testing-kits/articleshow/88037943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

November recorded 86 deals amounting to around $4.8 billion, compared to October’s 115 deals totalling over $10.3 billion, data from Venture Intelligence showed. However, on a YoY basis, the value of deals grew over 3X from $1.5 billion in November 2020. Cumulatively, PE-VC firms have invested around $60 billion across 1,069 deals in 2021 (till November) compared to about $40 billion invested in the whole of last year across 900 deals. Analysts said the ecosystem is seeing a heavy ‘winner takes all’ trend with money chasing startups that have already raised funding in the past one year for their follow-on rounds. All eyes are on the Indian public markets’ appetite for new age digital ventures and the US Fed Reserve’s moves in the coming months as that will determine subsequent deal flows, they said. “The average deal size in the ecosystem is rising and hence the number of deals going down is to be expected and this is also likely to flatten,” Venture Intelligence founder & MD Arun Natarajan said. The US government has acknowledged that inflation is worrying and moves that global investors such as Tiger Global make will be closely watched by the entire sector, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-funds-drop-over-50-from-october-to-4-8-billion-in-november/articleshow/88039719.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||India||Spotlight on west UP as SP, RLD to hold joint rally in Meerut on Dec 7||LUCKNOW: The communally sensitive west UP region is set to come under a sharp political spotlight with the Jayant Chaudhary led-RLD and Samajwadi Party (SP) calling a joint rally in Meerut on December 7, days after the two outfits announced their intention to forge a pre-poll pact to take on the might of ruling BJP in the 2022 UP elections. The proposed rally is being timed after the Centre annulled the three farm laws, which were at the centre of a raging farmers’ protests.  Top sources in the RLD confirmed that the rally, scheduled to be organised in Dabathua block of Meerut, will be attended by SP boss Akhilesh Yadav. This comes in sharp contrast with the 2018 Kairana and Noorpur by-elections when Akhilesh had decided against campaigning to arrest the chances of communal polarisation in the west UP region. The SP-RLD alliance had then defeated the BJP much to the chagrin of the saffron brass.  Significantly, the Dabathua block happens to come under Siwalkhas assembly seat, which was won by BJP's Jitendra Pal Singh who defeated SP's Ghulam Mohammad by a margin of little over 11,000 votes. RLD's Yashveer Singh, a Jat, had come at third position, cornering around 20% of the total votes polled. Siwalkhas falls under Baghpat parliamentary constituency, which had been the stronghold of the RLD until 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP knocked off the then Ajit Singh-led outfit, wiping it off completely. The RLD could not regain the seat in 2019 Lok Sabha elections even as BJP's Satyapal Singh defeated Jayant by a margin of 23,000 votes.  The proposed rally of the SP-RLD combine comes even as the BJP gears up for a rally in Saharanpur scheduled to be addressed by Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday. The BJP sources said that the home minister is expected to turn the heat on opposition from the district, which also houses Islamic seminary of Deoband. The recent row over Akhilesh’s comment comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel had only armed the saffron brigade to fire nasty salvos at the SP chief, accusing him of resorting to minority appeasement. The BJP has also been harking on the issue of mass exodus of Hindu families in west UP during the previous SP regime.  Sources said that the SP-RLD rally could set the tone for two political parties, which have been seeking resurrection in west UP after a brutal decimation at the hands of the BJP in 2017 assembly elections. Of the 71 assembly seats, straddling across 14 districts, the BJP had won 51 seats, while SP and BSP were limited to 16 seats and one seat respectively. In fact, of the five seats in Meerut, four were won by the BJP while the lone Meerut sadar seat was bagged by SP's Rafiq Ansari in 2017.  The rally also attains much political pertinence even as the SP positions itself assertively against the BJP while rallying smaller outfits behind it. The BJP, too, has been flexing its muscles to take on the opposition through amalgamation of Jats, Gujjar and Dalits in the region, especially after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots that left the then SP dispensation in a quandary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/spotlight-on-west-up-as-sp-rld-to-hold-joint-rally-in-meerut-on-dec-7/articleshow/88035750.cms||Pankaj Shah

The application was filed by five workers and their heirs, seeking action for contempt of court against those responsible for denying them the money. When the court found that five workmen, some of whom passed away during the pendency of the litigation, were not paid according to a court order for 32 years, even after the village panchayat gave an undertaking to the high court in this regard, the bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri got furious. The CJ asked the incumbent sarpanch and his predecessor to remain present in court with preparedness to go to jail, if they do not pay the workers. He told panchayat’s advocate, “You ask them to come with two pair of clothes in a bag. Let the sarpanch go to jail straightaway. Let him cool his heels for a couple of months.” The panchayat’s lawyer tried to defend it by submitting that the village panchayat has only Rs 3 lakh with it and it is difficult to make such a huge payment so quickly. To this,the CJ said, “This is about the dignity of the court. You beg or borrow. You may kneel before the government. But you will have to pay. We are not concerned about the panchayat’s financial condition.” On the lawyer’s insistence that the panchayat has to divert money from its development funds, the court said that the panchayat better disburse the amount from its development funds among these workers, “or we will disperse you”. The court has also asked the applicant’s advocate to ensure the presence of his clients in court so that their testimony can be recorded and a decision can be taken soon on the contempt case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-summons-village-sarpanch-to-court-tells-him-to-prepare-for-jail/articleshow/88037977.cms||---

B Kumar, 45, hailing from Shivapur village in Mulugu district had been pestering officials to buy his stock of paddy, but with the paddy impasse continuing, nothing moved for the past 20 days. Kumar, who has two daughters had given his elder daughter away in marriage and gifted 1.5 acres to her as dowry and farming activities a year ago. He also borrowed money from people and police said he owes Rs 4 lakh to various people. Kumar cultivated paddy in seven acres of land and he was mentally distraught due to financial problems and with no one lifting his paddy stocks, he consumed pesticide near the centre, adjacent to his house close to midnight. Other farmers noticed him in unconscious condition and rushed him to nearby hospital and was later rushed to MGM hospital, Warangal, where he succumbed while undergoing treatment on Wednesday, Eturunagaram CI S Kiran said. The inspector said that while other farmers and family have alleged that the suicide was related to the paddy procurement standoff, Kumar did not leave behind any suicide note. “The victim used to drive a tractor till four years ago and took up farming recently. He also had some tractor loan to clear. So, it could be anything,” the CI said. A case was registered under section 174 of CrPC.

---||World||Michigan teen charged with murder, terrorism in Oxford High School shooting||OXFORD TOWNSHIP: A 15-year-old boy was charged with murder and terrorism for a shooting that killed four fellow students and injured others at a Michigan high school, authorities said Wednesday, revealing that his parents were summoned just a few hours before the bloodshed.  No motive was offered by Oakland County authorities, a day after violence at Oxford High School, roughly 30 miles (50 km) north of Detroit. But prosecutor Karen McDonald said the shooting was premeditated, based on a "mountain of digital evidence" collected by police.  "This was not just an impulsive act," McDonald said.  Indeed, sheriff's Lt. Tim Willis told a judge that Ethan Crumbley recorded a video the night before the violence in which he discussed killing students.  Crumbley was charged as an adult with murder, attempted murder, terrorism causing death and gun crimes. During his arraignment, he replied, "Yes, I do," when asked if he understood the charges. Defense attorney Scott Kozak entered a plea of not guilty.  "He deliberately brought the handgun that day with the intent to murder as many students as he could," assistant prosecutor Marc Keast said in successfully arguing for no bail and a transfer to jail from a juvenile facility.  Earlier, Sheriff Mike Bouchard told reporters that Crumbley's parents were called to the school Tuesday "for behaviour in the classroom that was concerning". The teen remained in school, and the shooting occurred a few hours later.  Keast said in court that Crumbley entered a bathroom with a backpack and came out holding a semi-automatic handgun, firing at students while moving down the hallway. The four students who were killed were identified as 16-year-old Tate Myre, 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year-old Madisyn Baldwin and 17-year-old Justin Shilling.  Bouchard didn't offer details about what had troubled school officials. He said investigators believe the gun was already in school.  "There is nothing that he could have faced that would warrant senseless, absolutely brutal violence on other kids," the sheriff said.  Deputies rushed to the school around lunchtime Tuesday and arrested Crumbley in a hallway within minutes of the shooting. His father bought the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun last week, according to the sheriff.  McDonald said charges were being considered against the parents.  "Owning a gun means securing it properly and locking it and keeping the ammunition separate," she said.  The shooting should be a wake-up call for new gun laws in a country that has become "desensitized to school shootings," McDonald told reporters.  "We have to do better," the prosecutor said without offering specific changes. "How many times does this have to happen? How many times?"  She said the terrorism charge also fits.  "What about all the children who ran, screaming, hiding under desks? ... Those are victims, too, and so are their families and so is the community," McDonald said.  Video posted on social media showed students rushing to get out of first-floor classroom windows rather than open a door to someone who claimed to be a police officer. The sheriff said he likely was a detective.  After the attack, authorities learned of social media posts about threats of a shooting at the roughly 1,700-student school. The sheriff stressed how crucial it is for such tips to be sent to authorities, while also cautioning against spreading social media rumors before a full investigation.  Isabel Flores, a 15-year-old ninth grader, told Detroit television station WJBK that she and other students heard gunshots and saw another student bleeding from the face. They then ran from the area through the rear of the school, she said.  A concerned parent, Robin Redding, said her son, 12th-grader Treshan Bryant, stayed home Tuesday after hearing threats of a possible shooting.  "This couldn't be just random," she said.  Bryant said he had heard vague threats "for a long time now" about plans for a shooting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/michigan-teen-charged-with-murder-terrorism-in-oxford-high-school-shooting/articleshow/88039721.cms||---

According to the new guidelines, such passengers will not be allowed to leave the airport till the results are out. However, if you are not willing to shell out so much and also have time to spare, you can opt for the regular RT-PCR test costing about Rs 400, the result of which will, however, take over six hours. Until you get an all clear result, stay put in the airport. With the guidelines in place, airlines have been instructed to collect details and charges from these passengers at the boarding itself to avoid delay. If found positive, the passenger will be isolated at a government facility and samples will be sent for genome sequencing. Even negative passengers will have to follow guidelines for home quarantine for seven days. Those who were in close contact with the positive passenger coming from countries at risk will also be put under observation by the local authorities. “In Rapid RT-PCR it is now possible to declare results in 45 minutes to one hour. Passengers will have to pay for the test and wait till the results are declared,” said a health official. “The screening of passengers is actively being done at the airport and there are multiple checks to ensure that passengers coming from high-risk countries do not enter the city without testing. Passengers coming to the city but landing at other airports are also checked on arrival in the country,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rt-pcr-must-for-flyers-coming-from-at-risk-countries/articleshow/88037356.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Roses fed to cattle as prices plummet||VADODARA: Cattle sheds in some villages of Kalol taluka in Panchmahal district may be perfumed by the sweet smell of rose, if you can smell above the usual dung and more odour. The reason? Bovines are being fed Kashmiri roses these days! No, not that cattle breeders are experimenting with rose-flavoured milk, or pampering their livestock, but just to ensure that effort that has gone into cultivating the roses is not lost totally. With no takers for their crop, horticulture farmers have been forced to dispose of their stock by turning it into cattle fodder. Apart from feeding roses to the cattle, flowers are also being donated to temples and religious places and for free to whoever wants them. Recently, some farmers also threw roses in the Narmada water in a canal to highlight their plight. Mukesh Patel, a farmer, said that he has been forced to throw away 100kg of flowers in a day or distribute them for free. “We get around Rs 10 per kilo of roses in Vadodara. We sell whatever we can and then the remaining flowers are fed to the cattle or distributed free,” he said. Rose farming is largely done in the Ramnat, Kandach and Saganpura villages located near Delol. Most of the stock is sold in Vadodara and Godhra. Farmers pluck the flowers early in the morning and then transport them to the market. Delol sarpanch Nirav Patel, who is himself involved in rose farming, said that the pocket produces around 2,000kg rose flowers every day. “About 800kg of crops are sold currently. The remaining crop has to be disposed of,” said Patel, adding that the fall in prices has been dramatic. It was priced around Rs 500 per kg during Navratri which dwindled to nearly Rs 10 or 15 per kg. Nirav added that if the situation continues even in the coming days, farmers will have to give up rose farming altogether. And so agreed Kaushal Patel, another farmer who said that rates were just one part of the problem for those cultivating flowers. “There is no space in the Agriculture Produce Market Committees for us. The flower market in Vadodara is unorganized which operates on roadsides early in the morning. Brokers take 10 per cent to sell the flowers,” he added. Besides roses, even marigold prices are at rock bottom, said the farmer, who cultivates marigolds adding that these too were distributed for free, though hasn’t turned into fodder yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/roses-fed-to-cattle-as-prices-plummet/articleshow/88036890.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Junior doctors threaten to boycott all services from December 4||HYDERABAD: Junior doctors at the state-run Gandhi Hospital and Osmania General Hospital (OGH) boycotted out-patient (OP) services on Wednesday over repeated delay in NEET counselling by the Centre. The OP boycott would continue for two more days and the Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association (TJUDA) has threatened to extend it to all services from December 4 if the Centre failed to act. On Wednesday, the patients were only partially affected, but if junior doctors go ahead with their threat then things would become difficult for patients from December 4. “The impact of boycott on Wednesday was not felt sharply as patient footfall has been less for last two days. It might be due to the news of the new variant of Covid-19. Instead of 5 doctors manning a department, today 2-3 were present. It only caused a delay of 30-40 minutes,” said a source at Gandhi Hospital. “While we only boycotted OP services today, if no measures are taken by government to speed up the process, we’ll escalate the protest after meeting with all other RDAs. Currently, other staff were able to handle most departments, but if we extend it to all services then it’ll be difficult to manage,” said TJUDA president Dr Sagar Dharmula.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jr-docs-threaten-to-boycott-all-services-from-dec-4/articleshow/88038005.cms||---

The accused confessed that he shot his cousin with a country-made firearm and stole the cash at Trimulgherry on Monday. Police arrested T Narender Reddy (44) on Wednesday and recovered two pistols and three live rounds from his possession. On Monday, Narender shot dead his relative T Vijay Bhaskar Reddy (48) in a car at RTC Colony in Trimulgherry. After locals alerted police on ‘Dial 100’, Bhaskar’s body was found in the car on Monday night. During the investigation, police found out that Bhaskar had left with Narender for registration of a plot at Alwal. Initially, police thought that Bhaskar was attacked with a blunt object on his head, but during the postmortem, a bullet lodged in his skull was retrieved. Narender was picked up in Alwal, while he was trying to leave the city and Rs 7.2 lakh was recovered. According to Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar, differences between Narender and his cousin over payment of commisssion for real estate deals led to the murder. “A few months ago, the accused procured two firearms and ammunition from Ram Kumar of Madhya Pradesh. Narender also wanted to eliminate a former councillor of Alwal with whom he has a land dispute,” the CP said. Recently, Narender took Rs 3 lakh as advance from Bhaskar to facilitate registration of a plot in at Bharath Nagar Colony, Alwal. On Monday morning, the accused called his cousin and asked him to come with the balance amount for completion of the registration. After reaching RTC Colony, Narender asked Bhaskar to stop the car by the road, saying that the seller of the property would meet them there with documents. “When Bhaskar was looking at his phone, Narender shot him in the head and fled with the cash,” police said. The accused was produced before court for judicial remand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/realty-agent-held-for-cousins-murder/articleshow/88038021.cms||---

The incident came to light when the girl’s mother returned home from work. The accused is a resident of Shankarpally and he has been working at a police station in Madhapur zone of Cyberabad commissionerate for the past three years. The accused is married and he had given out on rent a portion of his house, to a working couple. On Wednesday morning, the couple went to work, leaving their 15-year-old daughter at home. Around 11 am, the girl’s mother returned home from work and she noticed the accused hurriedly coming out of their house. “When she confronted her daughter, the latter said that the accused banged on the door and, when she opened it, he barged into the house and hugged her. As the girl raised an alarm, the accused fled from the house,” Shankarpally police said. The family of the 15-year-old, along with the neighbours, confronted the accused. They roughed him up and handed him over to the local police. Based on the complaint of the survivor’s family, a case was registered against the accused under Section 354 of the IPC and the POCSO Act.

---||Vijayawada||Police should follow norms while arresting a person: AP HC||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Wednesday pulled up the police department for not producing arrested persons before the magistrates concerned within 24 hours as stipulated by the law. Hearing a habeas corpus petition, the bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that a large number of such cases are coming up before the court by way of habeas corpus pleas. Taking a serious note of the issue, the court said if the situation continues like this, they will have to summon the DGP to court to give explanation. Stating that they are not certifying any accused as innocent, the court said police nevertheless should follow guidelines in accordance with law when they arrest any person.  One Obulreddy Lakshmamma from Narepalli Vemula in Kadapa district moved the high court alleging that the inspector and sub-inspector of the special enforcement bureau (SEB) at Pulivendula detained her husband Venkata Prasad Reddy about a week ago but are not producing him before the court. The bench asked the government pleader as to why the accused is in custody for more than a week. The government pleader said Reddy was named as second accused in a case related to illegal liquor. Noting that police do not have the powers to detain him for more than 24 hours even though he may be an accused in the alleged crime, the court said the action of the police gives scope for suspicion. The court directed the SEB inspector to submit a report over arrest of Reddy and posted the matter for further hearing to December 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-should-follow-norms-while-arresting-a-person-hc/articleshow/88037206.cms||Srikanth Aluri

They said that a survey had revealed that only around four per cent people were concerned about a hike. RTC chairman Bajireddy Goverdhan and MD VC Sajjanar confirmed that the management had submitted the proposal for fare hikes to the government. “TSRTC proposed a hike of 25p/km for ordinary and Pallevelugu and 30p/km for other services. RTC needs 6.8 lakh litres of diesel every day to run the fleet. Diesel prices have gone up by 27.5 per cent since the last fare hike in December 2019. 95 per cent of RTC’s revenue comes from ticket sales,” the officials said. The losses, they said, were partly due to the pandemic and aggravated by hike in fuel prices and spare parts. RTC officials have urged transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar to consider the proposal and take it up for discussion with the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fare-hike-vital-for-rtcs-survival-say-officials/articleshow/88038011.cms||---
---||Mumbai||No refund to homebuyers: Come to court, HC orders developers in Mumbai||Mumbai: Ordering the partners of a realty firm who did not refund Rs 1.25 crore alongwith interest to a Navi Mumbai couple to remain present before it on Thursday, the Bombay high court warned it will even issue an arrest warrant to ensure their presence. A bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav on November 29 passed the direction on a petition by Seawoods residents Sabhajit and Gita Yadav to direct the collector (suburbs) and tehsildar (Borivali) to comply with “long-pending” directions of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) to recover the amount from the developer. Yadav had booked a flat in February 2014 with M/s Reliance Enterprise, Builders and Developers for its project in Chembur (East). As Indiabulls Distribution Services Ltd was directly involved in it and were coming up with several towers in Panvel, they trusted the developer. They were promised possession by December 2015 and paid 95% of Rs 1.29 crore cost of the 1200 sq ft flat. As possession was delayed indefinitely, they moved MahaRERA which in March 2020 ordered a refund of the amount with 10.15% interest per annum. When partners Hemendra and Chetan Mapara did not comply with the order, MahaRERA in April 2020 issued a recovery warrant and wrote to the collector to recover the amount from the developer as arrears of land revenue. The collector did not respond. In reply to Yadavs’ Right to Information application seeking progress of the recovery warrant, he placed the onus on the tehsildar. The latter also did not respond. The petition said collector and tehsildar are duty bound to recover the amount from the developer. Yadav’s advocates Ajit and Vikram Jakhadi submitted that the Maparas never appeared before MahaRERA. The judges then directed the Maparas to remain present before the court on December 2. “It is made clear that if they fail to remain present in Court as directed, the Court shall be constrained to pass necessary orders to ensure their presence before the Court, including issuing warrant of arrest against them,’’ they noted in the order. Since the Maparas have their registered office at Malad (East), the judges directed the local (Dindoshi) police station to assist the petitioners to serve the copy of their order on the Maparas and obtain their acknowledgement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-refund-to-homebuyers-come-to-court-hc-orders-developers-in-mumbai/articleshow/88038656.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Lucknow||UP: Suspected Covid treatment record enough to apply for death ex gratia||LUCKNOW: Families of patients who succumbed to suspected Covid-19 will be able to apply for ex gratia of Rs 50,000 even if there is no certificate confirming a Covid death. Medical records or doctor’s certificate detailing treatment of symptoms of Covid will be acceptable for claim, said an order from the state government on Wednesday. Rajkumari along with her children Pooja, Shivangi and Ayush in Bada Kasmandi village of MalihabadSuch applicants will have to submit whatever medical summary or doctor’s note they have indicating suspected coronavirus infection. However, the claim would be verified by a panel of experts. It would also only be applicable if a patient has succumbed within 30 days of treatment. Further, responding to a query from TOI, additional district magistrate (finance) Bipin Mishra, the nodal officer for the Rs 50,000 ex gratia disbursal, said that even if there are no medical records at all, the application would be accepted. In an investigation, TOI had found that there were many such patients who succumbed at home. In remote villages, victims died at clinics or private hospitals, often run by quacks. Such families had no document except for a death certificate to file for ex gratia claim. The assurance from the administration has brought a ray of hope to scores of families which had followed the state government’s directives of home treatment in the absence of oxygen-supported beds in hospitals. One such family is that of Sunita Singh’s. Her husband Sunit died in April and since then, life has been extremely difficult for Sunita and her three children. As Sunita is illiterate, her two daughters—Saumya (18) and Shubhi (15)—have become bread-earners by taking tuition classes. The family till now could not receive any financial aid from the government because they had no medical summary or doctor’s note saying their father died of suspected coronavirus. “There were no oxygen beds available at the time. We all were infected and took medicines (Ivermectin and Paracetamol) as advised by state health authorities. However, my father’s condition kept deteriorating and he succumbed on April 17, at a non-Covid hospital. Doctors did not give any medical summary, fearing action for admitting a Covid patient,” said Saumya, a student of LU. They live in a rented accommodation in Para. “We have also applied for claims under Mukhyamantri Bal Vikas Yojana (Samanya) for non-Covid orphan and widow pension but have not received anything till now. On compassionate grounds, our landlord and children’s school waived off rent and fee for a year,” said Sunita. Daily wage labourer Sanjeevan Lal (45) succumbed to suspected Covid on May 3. He is survived by his wife and five children. His eldest daughter Pooja (17) and wife Rajkumari had taken him to a local clinic in Bada Kasmandi village. “We weren’t aware that the clinic was run by a quack. My father had all symptoms of corona, but since we don’t have certificates, we couldn’t apply for ex gratia,” said Pooja, who dropped out of school to work as domestic help to support the family. Application to be made at Collectorate : According to the district administration, the official figure of coronavirus victims in Lucknow is 2,651. The state government has released funds for all these. An applicant needs to submit the form at room number 54 on the second floor at Collectorate along with Covid and death certificates. If there is no Covid certificate, the claims will be verified by an expert team. “If a family is denied a form at room number 54, they can visit my office. As many families don’t have Covid certificates, the directive says that a medical summary or note of symptomatic treatment will be acceptable for ex gratia sans Covid report. We will also allow submission of applications where there is no medical record. Such applications will be verified by an expert team,” said additional district magistrate (finance) Bipin Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/suspected-covid-treatment-record-enough-to-apply-for-death-ex-gratia/articleshow/88038630.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Ahmedabad||A feather in the birding cap: Compendium of flight secrets||AHMEDABAD: Have you ever picked up a feather and wondered to which bird it might belong? The ‘birdman of India’ Salim Ali referred to birds as feathered bipeds in his field guide, “The Book of Indian Birds”. That statement signals the centrality of feathers in the avian story. A couple of young birders have now come together to create what is perhaps the first online feather library for Indian birds, www.featherlibrary.com.  Did you know that the spotted owlet does not have ‘real spots’? The feathers overlap each other, giving the impression of round spots. And are you aware that the yellow-legged buttonquail has only eight feathers in its tail? “Our findings are based on the two buttonquails we have documented. The reason behind eight tail feathers could be that they are short-distance fliers,” said Esha Munshi, an architect, a birdwatcher, and a founder of Feather Library. Munshi added: “When we studied the feathers of the Indian hoopoe, we were surprised to find that the distinctive crest on its head is made up not of a single row of feathers but by the interlocking of two rows of feathers.” One of the regional reviewers of Gujarat for eBird of Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Munshi is among the top 20 birders of India on eBird. That distinction is based on the number of different bird species she has sighted. Munshi has spotted more than 1,000 of the over 1,350 species of birds found in India. She said she got interested in feathers recently, when she rescued a silverbill that was attacked by her pet cat. “I rescued the Indian silverbill during the Covid-19 lockdown,” she said. “The biggest feather of the bird was tinier than our smallest finger. It got me interested in studying feathers.” But there was no such reference for Indian birds, she said. Munshi joined hands with Sherwin Everett, another founder of Feather Library, who works with Jivdaya Charitable Trust, an animal hospital in Ahmedabad. “The hospital receives 1,500 to 2,000 birds per month, mostly pigeons, kites, and crows, but also several other common and rare species,” said Everett. “A number of the birds succumb to their injuries and ailments, after which their bodies are sent to the local corporation for disposal.” He added: “I thought that this was a colossal pool of data just going to waste, literally. So, we decided to use this opportunity and began documenting feathers of birds that had been declared dead by vets.” Together Munshi and Everett decided to document feathers from dead birds, noting the number of primaries, secondaries, tertials, alulas, and rectrices, and creating a digital library with photographs. They have collaborated with Jivdaya and WildArt (a team of wildlife photographers with a website of 950+ bird species). The dictionary defines a feather as “one of the horny structures forming the principal covering of the birds, consisting typically of a hard, tubular portion attached to the body and tapering into a thinner, stem-like portion bearing a series of slender, barbed processes that interlock to form a flat structure on each side.” But Munshi believes that feathers define a bird. “Feathers are among the most beautiful and striking features of birds,” she said. “Variations in feathers are unlimited, changing with each bird.” She added: “One of the best ways to differentiate species and even individuals is to study and understand their feathers.” The initiative has so far documented 40 species and aims to cover the majority of Indian species over time. The website www.featherlibrary.com went live on November 15. Some birds whose feathers are documented on the e-library are wire-tailed swallow, dusky crag martin, white-throated kingfisher, Indian thick-knee, sooty tern, western reef egret, rosy starling, oriental magpie robin, and plum-headed parakeet. The plumes or feathers of birds play an important part in breeding and the feathers of many male birds undergo a change in colours. In the case of Indian skimmer, an endangered species, people normally assume that the central black patch is made of a single feather. “After studying their feathers, we learn that both the central tail feathers (R1-L/R) are half-white and half-black and form the black patch as they are hidden from plain sight,” Munshi said. Waders migrate long distances. Parrots and peafowls shine in their rich colours. Small skulkers and owls hunt in silence. Their feathers tell stories that are as unique as their traits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/a-feather-in-the-birding-cap-compendium-of-flight-secrets/articleshow/88038040.cms||Maulik Pathak

In the first year, the fatality rate was 30%, in the second year it dropped to 7% and now it’s 4 %,” said Dr Yuri Dias Amborcar, head of plastic surgery department, GMC. Earlier, the burns unit was part of the general surgery department. Besides the decline in fatalities, they have better results, with burn patients having fewer or less severe deformities. “Having better facilities has significantly led to reduction of deformities in patients and improve their quality of life. Earlier, burn-related deformities were common, requiring surgical correction. Patients would end up crippled after surviving burns,” he said. They have been able to cut down deformities by adopting preventive procedures. There is a dedicated team of physiotherapists and occupational therapists. By adopting preventive measures it’s seen that patients with severe burns having chances of being crippled after the recovery, are healed in the correct mode. The department receives all kinds of burn cases, those having burnt accidentally, either at home or factory, homicidal and suicidal. It also, receive one or two cases a month of elderly women having suffered burns at home accidentally while performing pooja. “We see a lot of cases of aged women getting burnt accidentally at home while performing a ritual,” he said. Besides regular procedures, it also perform aesthetic surgeries – liposuction, fat grafting, hair transplant, breast reduction. “We do aesthetic procedures such as breast reduction, rhinoplasty, hair grafting but people generally do not opt a government facility because of privacy factor. We have a fewer case in this segment,” he said. The department has 24 beds – 12 each for general and plastic surgery – it will be allotted more beds after it is shifted to in new super-specialty block which has been used as a covid hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plastic-surgery-dept-records-decline-in-burn-mortalities/articleshow/88037996.cms||Bindiya Chari

Even as Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts record higher percentage of early marriages than the state rate, there has been an evident dip in the rate of early marriages when compared to NFHS 2015-16. Meanwhile, Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Alappuzha districts have recorded a rise in the rate of young women getting married before 18 years of age. Marriage rate among women aged 20-24 years who had married before 18 years in Malappuram slid from 23.3% to15.3% between NFHS 2015-16 and NFHS 2019-20. Wayanad and Kannur, two other districts which recorded above10% in early marriages in NFHS 2015-16, recorded 8.4% and 5.4%, respectively, in the latest survey. In the last five years, Ernakulam lost the zero status of early marriages among women: from 0% in NFHS 2015-16, it is 2.9% in NFHS 2019-20. Thiruvananthapuram with 6.2% too recorded a rise in rate of early marriages among women, while it was 2.3% in NFHS 2015-16. Demographic experts said that the census data between 2001 and 2011 too had hinted at a slight rise in early marriages in the southern and central districts of Kerala. “The common notion has been that age of marriage will increase with tenure of education. Now, women get married and still find options to study. We are planning a study on variation in early marriage rates in southern districts. There is also an increase in love marriages in the state where couples get married at a very young age. In districts like Malappuram, legal interventions and a sense of awareness have played a part in bringing down early marriage rate,” said Anil Chandran S, head, department of demography, University of Kerala, who has done studies on trends and patterns of child marriages in Kerala. Officials of women and child development department said that while there is a decline in early marriage rates in northern districts, there is still a long way to go. “Young girls are more focused on education than the past generation and most often they come forward to report early marriages. This facilitates legal interventions. However, many factors like being a single parent, skepticism about love affairs and a false belief that early marriage is a way of ensuring secure lives for the girls force many parents to marry off their daughters at a very young age. In Malappuram, we are conducting an intensive campaign against early marriages and it is a part of almost all social events in the district,” said Sharafudeen AA, district women and child development officer, Malappuram. Pathanamthitta is the only district in the state with zero early marriage rate as per NFHS 2019-20. Besides Malappuram, Palakkad district too has early marriage rate above 10%. Palakkad recorded an increase from 12.5% (NFHS 2015-16) to 14.1% (NFHS 2019-20). Kerala has managed to bring down the rate from 15.4% to 6.3% in 15 years. The median age at first marriage among women aged 25-49 years has increased from 20 to 21.5 in two decades: between NFHS1998-99 and NFHS 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/northern-districts-buck-early-marriage-trend-among-women/articleshow/88038003.cms||Aswin J Kumar

This is despite the fact that all banks have brought down interest rates following the sharp rate cuts by the RBI in the wake of the pandemic. The high rates for two years will help compensate for the five-year interest holiday from March 2021. Although interest for subsequent years on high value deposits that are locked in will be capped at a return equivalent to the savings bank rate of SBI, the depositors will have an upside.

---||Delhi||Total paralysis in civic administration: Delhi HC on dengue||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday lashed out at the authorities for their failure to rein in the spread of dengue, saying there was a complete paralysis in civic administration as no one was bothered about the deaths. The court highlighted that the number of cases doubled this year and said the authorities had become so populist in their approach that they were scared of doing anything that would lose them votes. “If only elections were fought and won or lost on real issues, we would have a different city. It doesn’t work that way. Today, they are being fought on what is free,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked. The anguished bench, while registering a suo motu PIL on the issue, further stated, “This is a sorry state of affairs. It is a disillusion. The officials are living with the attitude that since there is a large population, the disease will come and go, people will die, it doesn't matter.” The bench indicated that an amicus curiae would be appointed to assist the court in the matter, including dengue, malaria and chikungunya, and sent the case before the Chief Justice who’s dealing with another suo motu petition on mosquito breeding. “The number of people who have caught dengue and the number of fatalities this year is unprecedented. It is not like Covid-19, occurring for the first time. How is it that despite having science and technology and machines and manpower this problem cannot be addressed? Since 2013, there have been orders passed by this court, yet it is not under control,” the bench pointed out. Questioning East Delhi Municipal Corporation, the court said, “When are you going to cover your drains? It is so difficult to even go to that area as the stench is unbearable… Either we put up our hands up and say nothing can be done. But if anything has to be done, it has to be done in a proper manner.” South Delhi Municipal Corporation complained that several RWAs were not cooperating in fogging and keeping a tab on mosquito breeding. But the bench noted that there had to be a plan and not a knee-jerk reaction. “You would be failing in your duty if the numbers do not go down. We would be failing in our duty if we do not do anything,” said the court. When senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the AAP government, opposed a suggestion to appoint a doctor working with a central government organisation as an amicus curiae, the bench wondered, “Why politicise mosquito breeding?”. It said the amicus could seek help from any expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/total-paralysis-in-civic-admin-hc-on-dengue/articleshow/88039129.cms||---

Evey Trans will procure these 100 electric buses from Olectra and the delivery will be over a period of 12 months. The value of this 100 bus contract is approximately Rs 140 crore. During the contract period, the company will undertake the maintenance of these buses. “Olectra is committed in its efforts to reduce pollution levels through the efficient electric public transport system,” said chairman and managing director, Olectra Greentech Limited, K V Pradeep. This is Olectra’s second order from KTC. They are already operating 30 eco-friendly electric buses in Goa and delivered another five buses recently. Their buses are also deployed at Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Surat, Silvassa, Dehradun and Kerala. These nine-meter air-conditioned buses have a seating capacity of 35 people and the driver. The buses are equipped with CCTV cameras to ensure the safety of the commuters, an emergency button, USB sockets and other facilities. The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery in the bus enables it to travel up to 200 KMs on a single charge based on traffic conditions. The technologically advanced electric bus has a regenerative braking system that allows the bus to recover part of the kinetic energy lost in braking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/100-more-electric-buses-to-be-ordered-by-ktc-under-central-scheme/articleshow/88038006.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Coimbatore||Unlikely to bring Mudumalai tiger-23 back from Mysuru: Official||COIMBATORE: Chief wildlife warden Shekhar Kumar Niraj on Wednesday told TOI that they didn’t have any plans to bring back Mudumalai Tiger-23 (MDT-23), which was captured from the Nilgiris on October 15 and sent to Chamundi Animal Conservation, Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at Koorgalli in Mysuru, to the state. “The usual lifespan of a tiger in the wild is 15 to 16 years. The MDT-23 is aged about 13 years. When we captured the tiger, it had seven to eight injuries on the body. Veterinary experts have been treating the tiger at the rescue centre near Mysuru zoo. The animal is showing good improvement,” he said. Niraj said it was not easy to rewild a tiger at the age of 13 years. “If we release the old tiger again into the reserve forest, chances of infighting with younger tigers are high and that might turn out to be fatal. The chances of the tiger, which has killed four people in the Nilgiris, attacking people and searching for easy prey along the forest fringes are also very high.” He said after the full recovery of the tiger, they would consult with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the Central Zoo Authority and take a decision on whether to bring the tiger to Vandalur zoo in Chennai or not. “It already has 24 tigers and it is not easy to maintain them all in the zoo. When kept in zoos, the lifespan of tigers is at least 25 years.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/official-unlikely-to-bring-tiger-back-from-mysuru/articleshow/88038002.cms||A Subburaj

A life convict currently out on parole due to Covid-19 has been arrested for his alleged involvement in the firing. At 8.54pm, police received a call regarding the firing and the caller said two people had been injured. Deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parvinder Singh said both victims were taken to hospital. Later, they were identified as Saroj from Rajasthan and her daughter. “The woman is out of danger, but her daughter has been injured on the left side of the chest region and was getting treated,” the officer said. During the investigation, it was found that a group of people, who came to attend the wedding, was going to a temple for a ritual. When they were about to reach the temple, Rajiv (30) came with a countrymade pistol and fired a shot in the air. “The bullet hit the mother in the right upper thigh and then injured her daughter,” the officer said. A case has been registered. “Rajiv said he was sitting and drinking at home when he heard the sound of dhol.

---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu-Kerala interstate buses back on roads, commuters heave sigh of relief||COIMBATORE: The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) resumed bus services to destinations in the neighbouring Kerala on Wednesday after a gap of 20 months. Interstate services were stopped on March 25, 2020, following the Covid-19 outbreak. TNSTC’s Coimbatore division operated 15 buses to destinations such as Palakkad, Guruvayur, Thrissur, Munnar and Tattamangalam from Ukkadam and Pollachi bus terminals. The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation also operated buses to destinations in Coimbatore. As many as 13 buses from Kerala entered Coimbatore till 8pm. “Buses witnessed a good turnout of passengers in the morning peak hours. But the number of passengers thinned during the noon, when only 50% of seats were occupied. Again, good patronage was witnessed in the peak hours in the evening,” a TNSTC official said. “Passengers were asked to use hand sanitisers and masks. Teams were deployed to check mask compliance. Conductors were instructed to allow only passengers wearing masks.” In the absence of interstate bus services, people had to rely only on trains. “I am working in Palakkad. In the absence of buses, the only public transport option available was the train. We felt there was no logic in not operating buses, since train were operated between the two states. People like me are relieved as buses are plying again,” said V Sakthivel of Singanallur. B Vijayaragavan, another passenger, said buses are his preferred mode of transport. “I used to visit my daughter in Thrissur before the pandemic. After buses stopped plying, I rarely met her. Now, I can visit her whenever I want,” he told TOI. Passengers said that the nod to operate buses has come at a crucial junction as a large number of people from Tamil Nadu would visit Kerala once the Sabarimala season picks up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/interstate-buses-back-on-roads-commuters-heave-sigh-of-relief/articleshow/88038009.cms||---

Speaking at a programme organised by KGMU’s blood and transfusion medicine department on World AIDS Day to raise awareness about AIDS and voluntary blood donation, secretary, medical education, GS Priyadarshi, said the portal would help people directly contact blood banks for blood. “We often find that family members of patients in need of blood don’t know whom to contact. They are unable to find out if units of a particular blood group are available in blood banks,” he said. “We are working on a centralised portal that will display information about the number of units available in every blood bank along with contact details. People will be able to directly contact the blood banks,” he added. Meanwhile, a rally, flagged off by Governor Anandiben Patel, was taken out from Raj Bhawan to GPO crossing. Holding placards displaying AIDS awareness messages and benefits of blood donation, around 200 students from various schools across the city took part in the rally. A band marched alongside the students and played patriotic songs. Earlier, a group of 13 students presented a street play depicting the importance of voluntary blood donation. The Governor appreciated the play and said every college should organise voluntary blood donation camps even if only 10 students were willing to donate. She also gave gifts to 15 HIV negative children of HIV positive parents. Medical education minister Suresh Khanna said, “We have been successful in curbing HIV through several interventions. Such awareness programmes should happen regularly as they help in busting myths and promoting blood donation.” KGMU vice-chancellor Prof Lt Gen (retd) Bipin Puri said, “HIV claimed seven lakh lives and infected 15 lakh people in 2020 across India. The rate of increase has declined, but people should not be complacent. More awareness is required to check the disease.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centralised-portal-to-provide-info-on-blood-availability/articleshow/88038651.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Furthermore, these messages are being accompanied by a timestamp as well.Amid fears over the new variant of the novel coronavirus – the Omicron variant – there has been a surge in the number of people rushing to the nearest vaccination centres to receive their jabs. Many residents of Yadgir who have received these messages are now understandably worried, since they fear that this bureaucratic error could result in their not being given the second dose. There are allegations of health department personnel generating these messages to inflate numbers of people vaccinated while submitting their report to the government.Sharanakumar Solapur, a resident of Kakkera village in Shorapur taluk, is among those who, despite not having been administered the second dose of Covishield, has received a message stating that he was fully vaccinated.Yadgir district health officer Dr Indumathi Kamashetty told TOI that this discrepancy could be due to a technical glitch, which she assured the department would resolve at the earliest. “People who have not received the second dose, but have been sent messages to the contrary, need not worry,” Dr Indumathi said.In all, 11,39,813 people have been vaccinated in Yadgir district, of whom 4,08,343 have received both the doses, while 7,31,470 have been administered only the first dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/yadgir-residents-receiving-false-updates-about-vaccination-status/articleshow/88037260.cms||Mouneshwar Sonnad
---||Kochi||HC reduces jail term of former Catholic priest||Kochi: The Kerala High Court on Wednesday upheld the conviction of defrocked Catholic priest Robin alias Mathew Vadakkumchirayil in the infamous Kottiyoor child rape case of 2016 but reduced his punishment to rigorous imprisonment for 10 years. He was originally sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 20 years. Justice R Narayana Pisharadi said in the judgment that such a sentence would “meet the ends of justice in the case.” The court considered an appeal filed by 51-year-old Robin Mathew of Vadakkumchirayil House at Nadavayal near Manathavady in Wayanad. He was the vicar of Neendunokki praish at Kottiyoor under Mananthavadi diocese of Syro Malabar Church when the child rape took place. The girl was raped in the room attached to the church where the priest was staying when she stayed back to do “computer work” after holy mass one day in May 2016. The girl had initially told police that it was her own father that raped her. The girl, her mother, and her father had not supported the prosecution’s case during trial. As the girl was a minor, had given birth to a child, and as a DNA test had confirmed Robin’s paternity, conviction for child rape was upheld by the HC. However, the court said he cannot be convicted for raping a child under 12 years of age under Section 376 (2)(f) of Indian Penal Code. The high court’s judgment said, “Section 376(2)(f) of the Indian Penal Code is attracted when a person who being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman. Merely for the reason that the appellant/accused was the priest/vicar of the local church, it cannot be found that he had held any position of trust or authority towards the victim girl.” While altering the conviction to rape under Section 376(1) that carries a lesser punishment, the HC also pointed out that the state government had failed to challenge the trial court’s finding that the accused cannot be convicted for aggravated penetrative sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust or authority of a child, under Section 5(p) of Pocso Act. “In such circumstances, in the given facts of the present case, he cannot be found to be a person who was holding any position of trust or authority towards the victim girl so as to attract the offence punishable under Section 376(2)(f) of the Indian Penal Code,” the court held. But the court upheld his conviction under Section 5(f) of the Pocso Act, which provides punishment for a person who commits penetrative sexual assault on a child in an educational or religious institution while he is part of the management or staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-reduces-jail-term-of-former-catholic-priest/articleshow/88038014.cms||---

Police identified the accused as Ajit Kumar Verma, a native of Jamtara. Deputy Commissioner of Police (south-west) Gaurav Sharma said that a woman filed a complaint that she ordered clothing from Ludhiana and it was to be delivered through DTDC courier, but the delivery got delayed. “She started searching for the DTDC courier website on the internet. She found a page (phishing webpage), where she filled in her details. These details were accessed by the fraudster at the backend. Later, he made calls to her and her husband posing as a worker from the courier service,” the DCP said. The accused told them that their courier was stuck due to a technical glitch and they had to pay Rs 5 as fee. Thereafter, the accused sent them a malicious link. After clicking that link, a form popped up. The woman filled in her bank account number and UPI PIN, which was accessed from the backend by the fraudster. Thereafter, Verma made transactions from their bank accounts amounting to Rs 75, 000. During the investigation, a team under the supervision of ACP (operations) Abhinendra Jain led by inspector Raman Kumar caught the accused from Shahdara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teen-posed-as-courier-co-staffer-to-dupe-scores/articleshow/88038654.cms||---

Police have examined CCTV footage and have alerted other stations. The incident occurred at around 12.39pm. The trio, all middle-aged, entered the jewellery shop and asked to see gold chains. The staff showed them two trays of gold chains. Footage obtained from the CCTV camera shows one woman taking two good chains in her hand, but keeping back only one chain, with the other held in her fist. The group left the shop at 12.44 pm. It was only when they left that the staff realised that the gold ornament was missing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gold-chain-stolen-from-vasco-store/articleshow/88038010.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Funds blame game: Delhi HC says don’t make political speeches||NEW DELHI: Don’t make political speeches in court, Delhi High Court said on Wednesday as it dealt with the blame game between the AAP government and the three municipal corporations on delay in payment of salaries and pensions. “Please don’t make these political speeches here, let us proceed with the hearing; we will hear you when it is your turn,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh told senior advocate Rahul Mehra when he claimed that Delhi was not being treated fairly by the Centre. The court was hearing a batch of petitions on arrears in salaries and pensions to civic employees and retired staff. “We will hear all — Union of India, Delhi government and the MCDs,” the bench made it clear when Mehra persisted with his grievance against the Centre. The court’s reminder to Mehra to focus on the legality of the matter came when he submitted that the Delhi government was being given “stepmotherly treatment”. Mehra continued, “if this is a political speech, so be it, but we will argue on facts and show that this is correct. How can the big brother go scot-free.” The bench then asked the corporation lawyer to continue with his arguments, again telling Mehra that he would be permitted to argue the government’s stand later. The issue involves remittance of grant-in-aid and other amounts between governments and corporations. Mehra said when Union territories such as J&K, Daman and Diu are given funds directly by the Centre, why can’t they give them directly to Delhi. In its affidavit, the Centre has said the Delhi government’s claim to receive the grant-in-aid for its urban local bodies is “out of place” as Delhi is a “Union territory, and not a state”. Advocate Manu Chaturvedi, on behalf of East Delhi Municipal Corporation, told the high court that the employees’ unions were planning to go on strike on December 13 due to delay in payment of salaries and urged the court to pass some directions in this regard. The court was hearing a batch of petitions relating to the non-payment of salaries to teachers, hospital staff, sanitation workers and engineers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/funds-blame-game-hc-says-dont-make-political-speeches/articleshow/88039138.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||63 antiques find their way home from the US||NEW DELHI: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the US in September, one of his engagements was to accept the ghar wapsi, so to say, of some precious emblems of Indian history and culture. The Archaeological Survey of India has now received 63 of the 157 antiques that were repatriated to India after decades of stay in the US, either smuggled into that country or stolen from India. The articles that came home on November 9 include figurines in metal, stone and terracotta and paintings. “A consignment of the remaining artefacts will arrive in India from the US next month,” said Anil Tiwari, director of antiquities, ASI. An official at Dharohar Bhawan added on Tuesday, “ASI had been constantly communicating with the Indian embassy in the US and the Indian consulate in New York on the repatriation of the artefacts.” Tiwari spent a fortnight in the US prior to the PM’s visit inspecting the retrieved historic objects. Lingodhbhava, a black stone sculpture, was on display at the Birmingham Museum in Alabama. Another sculpture depicting Bodhisattva Manjushri, the embodiment of wisdom holding a sword and painted in gold leaf, was found at Ackland Art Museum of the University of North Carolina. Lingodhbhava dates to the late Chola period between the 12th and 13th centuries CE and depicts Lord Shiva as a four-armed god. At the bottom of the sculpture, Vishnu is depicted as a boar digging deep into the earth. Brahma is represented by a swan soaring into the sky. This antiquity’s state of origin has been traced by Dharohar Bhawan to Tamil Nadu. Bodhisattva Manjushri depicts the most significant Bodhisattva in Mahayana literature. The statute shows the left hand holding a lotus on which Buddha is seen seated. The Bodhisattva is seen wearing beautiful ornaments. A lion's image is carved on both sides of the pedestal. The artefact dates back to the Pala empire around the 10th century CE. According to ASI officials, its origin is either West Bengal or Odisha. There is also a paper painting on a copper sheet that depicts Rasikapriya from Samdehi Ragini. The painting by an anonymous painter has a scene possibly influenced by the famed Rasikapriya, a poetic work written by Keshava Das in 1555-1617. The painting’s reverse bears a rubber stamp marking that puts its provenance in the personal collection of the Maharaja of Bikaner. Among other repatriated items are Torso of a Woman from a period between the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE, Standing Monkey dating to the Gupta period, a beautifully carved statue of Buddha in red sandstone from around 7th-8th century CE, its origin, according to ASI, being probably Mathura in UP. The origin state of the other artefacts is yet to be determined by ASI. Buddha Head in terracotta probably from the Gupta period, Bull probably from the Harappa civilisation of 5th-3rd millennium BCE, a beautifully carved Yakshi and Bird from 1st century BCE-1st century CE and the stele of Varaha, dated 8th-11th century CE. “The Buddha Head seems to have its origin in central India and Yakshi and Bird in West Bengal,” surmised D N Dimri, retired director of antiquities, ASI. “The stele of Varaha, in which Varaha is the boar incarnation of Lord Vishnu, comes from an area ruled by the Palas and today comprises parts of the states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.” According to sources in Dharohar Bhawan, these artefacts were stolen at different times though several of them were smuggled into the US by jailed art dealer Subhash Kapoor, who was charged by prosecutors in Manhattan in 2019 with stealing and possessing artefacts worth millions of dollars. Kapoor is currently in an Indian jail awaiting trial. Over the years, several international museums have voluntarily shared information with India about antiquities they procured from Kapoor that they were unaware were illegally being traded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/63-antiques-find-their-way-home-from-the-us/articleshow/88038662.cms||Zumbish

However, it will take another 3-4 months to cover the entire population aged 18 years or above with two vaccine shots against the target of accomplishing the task by December end. Still, Lucknow is ahead of all the other UP districts in terms of number of vaccinated population. Overall, 33,385 people were jabbed - 19,080 with the second dose and 14,305 with the first – on Wednesday. This took the number of beneficiaries who have taken both the doses given 12-16 weeks apart to 18.8 lakh, which is over 50% of the total 37.4 lakh adult population eligible for vaccination in the district. The figure of those partially vaccinated with a dose rose to 14.5 lakh, about 39% of the population. These people will get their second dose after completing the gap period. However, there are still 4.1 lakh people who have not taken any doses so far. Official estimates suggest that to cover leftovers and those requiring the second dose it will take at least 3-4 months, if the turnout remains the same as it has been in November. Officers said that the daily vaccination rate increased steadily till September, but dropped in October and November due to several reasons, including festival season and hesitancy. Had the pace witnessed in September continued, the target of vaccinating the entire adult population would have been achieved by December end or January first week. Chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal said that efforts are being made to administer at least one shot by December end to the remaining population which has not received any dose so far. This way, he added, Lucknow’s entire adult population will be covered with at least one dose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/half-of-city-fully-jabbed-against-covid/articleshow/88038667.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

The initiative is based on the lines of steps taken by the Indore Municipal Corporation. They will be deployed at five locations on a pilot basis. The expansion will be planned based on the success rate of the pilot project. Civic officials said that tenders for the machines have been issued. They said that around Rs12crore will be spent on this initiative. The machines will be used for four years. The operation and maintenance of these vehicle-mounted machines will be done by the bidders. The tenders will be opened in the second week of this month. “Garbage disposal and lifting will be carried out. The civic body will use the machines in different shifts. They will be used at five zonal office levels,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional commissioner, PMC. The civic body has also made it mandatory for residents of big housing societies to set up their own garbage disposal units. Any property with more 50 houses or which generates more than 100kg garbage per day is supposed to have its own processing facility on the premises. “The PMC had given warnings to garbage generators, including housing societies as well as big commercial establishments. Residents throw garbage on public places like roads or open spots. This leads to chronic dumping of garbage,” said a senior PMC official. As per the PMC officials, the civic administration has taken several initiatives to promote garbage segregation at source. Around 5% discount was given for using solid waste management systems like vermicompost. But even this initiative has not helped much in reducing garbage dumping on roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-all-set-to-buy-garbage-disposal-suction-machines/articleshow/88038013.cms||Prasad Kulkarni

The men had been booked for arson and loot. The communal clashes eventually resulted in the death of over 50 people and nearly 50,000 being rendered homeless. District government counsel (DGC) Rajeev Sharma said, "Ashish, Naresh, Vinod, Surender and Narender were booked under sections 395, 149, 436 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code. They have been acquitted as the witness turned hostile.” One Nanu, a resident of Bahawadi village in the district, had filed the case on September 8, 2013. In his police complaint, he said that an angry mob led by the five accused attacked his house and looted household goods, jewellery and even domestic animals. The rioters then allegedly set his house on fire and fled. Nanu also stated that he somehow managed to escape from the spot. This is not the first instance in which courts have let off the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots cases for "lack of evidence". In October, a local court had acquitted 20 men accused of brutally killing a man and then setting his house on fire after looting valuables. In the last eight years, more than 1,100 people accused in about 100 cases related to murder, rape, robbery and arson in connection with the riots have been acquitted for the same reason or due to witnesses turning hostile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/5-let-off-for-want-of-evidence-in-muzaffarnagar-riots-case/articleshow/88037271.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The delay in repairing the dysfunctional display unit of the Air Quality Index (AQI) monitoring station on the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) premises has left many concerned citizens upset.Set up on the HDMC premises at the cost of Rs 1.5 crore in 2017, the AQI monitoring station’s display unit has been defunct for more than three weeks. What is more, the AQI station on the HDMC premises was the first digital air quality monitoring centre set up in Karnataka. On the other hand, the AQI station that was recently set up in Lingaraj Nagar under the central government’s ‘Clean Air’ initiative is not yet functional. Sources in the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said that the officials of the Central Pollution Control Board had decided to set up Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) on the HDMC premises. “The centre monitors the level of sulphur-di-oxide, nitrogen-di-oxide, carbon-monoxide, ozone, particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM 10 in the air. The centre boasted what was the first satellite-based digital display unit in Karnataka, while the rest of the centres in the state had manual units,” a source said.Hubballi-based marketing professional Rajendran Iyer told TOI, “Even before the outbreak of Covid-19, I used to wear a mask depending on the reading of air quality displayed at the HDMC office. Now, we are not so sure as to whether we are inhaling clean air.” He also lamented the pace at which work was progressing on the AQI station in Lingaraj Nagar.Activist Dr MC Sindhur opined that the government agencies seemed more preoccupied with inaugural ceremonies, but not so concerned about ensuring adequate maintenance. “The display unit served a larger purpose insofar as making the public more aware about environmental pollution. The authorities must ensure its maintenance in the interest of public health,” Dr Sindhur said.Mayur Patil, who works at a private company on Koppikar Road in Hubballi, recounted his meeting with HDMC officials more than a week ago, when, on being informed about the defunct display unit, they passed the buck by stating that it was maintained by the HDMC. “We are constantly told by the HDMC to intimate them in case of any trouble. Why is it that the HDMC is not too bothered to raise the matter of the defunct display unit with the KSPCB?” Patil asked.KSPCB official gets proactiveHubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation commissioner Suresh Itnal refused to respond on the issue, pointing out that maintenance of the air quality monitoring station came under the purview of the KSPCB. Senior environment officer for KSPCB, Dharwad Shobha Pol’s timely intervention meant that work on fixing the CAAQMS on the HDMC office premises was undertaken on Wednesday. “Work on the air quality monitoring stations in Lingaraj Nagar in Hubballi and Kalabhvan in Dharwad is under way, while the three manual stations are working,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/delay-in-fixing-aqi-station-display-unit-upsets-twin-cities-residents/articleshow/88037267.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Pune||Real estate agent scams e-commerce website, held||Pune: The Lonikand police on Tuesday evening arrested Hinjewadi-based real estate agent Sunilkumar Niranjankumar Gupta (55) on charge of cheating an e-commerce website to the tune of Rs1.22 lakh by purchasing gold online and then returning the packet to the company with a similar-looking fake jewellery. The incident occurred between September 13 and October 29 this year. Vishrantwadi resident Kiran Kamble (30), a representative of the e-commerce website, lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday, stating that Gupta ordered gold jewellery using their platform for delivery at Lonikand. “He is a native of Delhi and moved to Hinjewadi four years ago. He stays with his wife and daughter,” said senior inspector Gajanan Pawar of the Lonikand police. Pawar said, “Gupta has a fake Aadhaar card and he changes names when ordering goods from e-commerce websites. During the period, Gupta used the website twice and ordered a gold ring and a gold bracelet at an accumulated cost of Rs 1.22 lakh. He also paid money to the website. Instead of taking the delivery at his Hinjewadi apartment, he asked for delivery of the packet at Lonikand. He stood in the parking area of a residential building and called up the delivery agent to drop the packets at the building.” “After collecting the gold ornaments packets, he applied for a return and also claimed a refund online from the company,” Pawar said. “By the time the delivery agency sent an agent to pick up the packets containing the jewellery, Gupta had already kept a similar-looking fake in the packet and then handed it over to the agent,” Pawar said. “The jewellery vendor, however, realised it was a fake and flagged it to the e-commerce website. As the company had his phone number, we nabbed him,” said the cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/real-estate-agent-scams-e-commerce-website-held/articleshow/88038016.cms||---

Sutar has been lodged in the Yerawada central jail ever since his arrest on the day of the incident and would get the benefit of set off for the period served so far in jail, the court said. A day prior to the murder, Sutar and the victim, Nilesh Kamble, had an altercation over some matter and the former had threatened Kamble with dire consequences. Kamble had later informed his cousin Amol Mankar about the same. Around 3.45pm on December 14, 2014, Kamble was busy selling utensils at his shop when Sutar approached and launched a brutal assault on him with a big knife. The daylight assault had at the time caused a major sensation across the town. Hearing the victim’s cries, Mankar and other shopkeepers, including Lalit Mankar, Bandu Kamble and Santosh Waghmare rushed to the spot and saw Sutar dealing knife blows to the victim before throwing away the weapon nearby and attempting the run away. Mankar and others, however, apprehended Sutar and handed him over to Police Patil Prakash Pawle. A critically injured Kamble was rushed to a private hospital in the Kothrud area where the doctors declared him brought dead. In the ensuing investigation, the Paud police seized the murder weapon, Sutar’s clothes which had blood stains of the victim, and also recorded statements of the eye-witnesses and other witnesses. During the trial, Sutar had taken a defence of being falsely implicated by other shopkeepers out of some grudge. Public prosecutor S S More had examined a total of seven witnesses in support of the prosecution’s case. The court of additional sessions judge G P Agrawal relied on the “unblemished” evidence recorded by the eye-witnesses as well as the chemical analysis reports relating to seizure of the murder weapon, blood stained clothes and related facts established by the panch witnesses, while holding Sutar guilty of murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-gets-life-term-for-2014-murder-of-trader-at-pirangut-market/articleshow/88038023.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The tax mop-up also surpassed November 2020’s GST collections by 73%, largely driven by festive purchases and revenge tourism. The mop up includes CGST, SGST and IGST with Goa getting only the SGST component. The growth in the state’s gross GST earnings beat the national figures where GST revenues were 25% higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year and 27% over 2019-20. GST officials said that the strong GST collections have crossed pre-pandemic levels and confirm that the state’s economy is on the path to recovery. In October, GST collections stood at Rs 317 crore and also above the pre-pandemic levels. The recent trend of high GST revenues has been a result of various policy and administrative measures that have been taken in the past to improve compliance, said GST officials. Central tax enforcement agencies, along with the state counterparts have detected tax evasion cases and have also nudged reluctant GST taxpayers to file their returns on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-gst-collection-for-nov-up-by-63/articleshow/88038045.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Little-known Chennai company gets $8.5 billion valuation||CHENNAI: At a time when startup unicorns are the flavour of the season, a little known Chennai-based company dabbling in clean energy has bagged a valuation of around $8.5 billion after US based impact fund TFCC International announced the acquisition of a 46% stake for over $4.1 billion in privately held Ramcharan Group. TFCC will be investing over five to seven years with the first round scheduled to close by January 2022. The transaction size makes it one of the largest deals in the sector. The 55-year-old Ramcharan Group had started out in the chemicals space, but has now ventured into other areas — including logistics, education and restaurants — in addition to clean energy. Run by fourth-generation family members Divyesh and 47-year-old Kaushikses that recycle hazardous and carcinogenic chemicals and convert the waste into energy. The technology used, both product and process, will convert all types of unsegregated waste into energy, with zero residue, making it very safe, sources said. Both the Palicha brothers did not respond to calls. The financial details of the company too are unknown and kept under wraps. It is learnt that the family will run the business while the investor will provide financial support and guidance. Without disclosing the current revenues, the investors expect the business to be working on a revenue potential of $40 billion in seven years. TFCC chairman Chris Curtis said the fund has been in discussions with Ramcharan since December last year and entered into an agreement with the promoters in October. “The funds will be used to set up manufacturing facilities in India involving acquisition of land, construction cost and obtaining regulatory approvals... The initial investment will be used to set up multiple testing units as well,” he added. Curtis said the fund saw huge potential in Ramcharan’s products in the wasteto-energy field and new generation of energy storage devices to resolve waste management issues globally and the valuation takes into account the profitability of the business and the expected cash flows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/little-known-chennai-company-gets-8-5-billion-valuation/articleshow/88039764.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Malegaon blast witnesses turn hostile, NIA urged to seek ATS help||MUMBAI: After eight witnesses turned hostile in the 2008 Malegaon blast case, the families of the victims have written a letter to the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) superintendent of police to immediately pay heed and seek the assistance of the anti-terrorism squad (ATS). The case was initially probed by the ATS. Advocate Shahid Nadeem also submitted a copy of the letter to the special NIA court conducting the trial. The letter said that the statements of the prosecution witnesses who have turned hostile were also recorded by the ATS. It said that the ATS is in a better position to brief and assist the NIA on them. “It is requested that the ATS officers be called to assist the NIA in clarifying statements, investigation, and any other queries that the NIA may have that is causing the prosecution witnesses to turn hostile or for the purposes of an effective trial,” the letter stated. On September 29, 2008, a bomb exploded at Bhikku Chowk in Malegaon, killing six persons and injuring more than 100. So far, 208 witnesses have deposed in the case. The letter was also marked to the chief justice of the Bombay high court, Union and state home ministries and the Mumbai ATS chief. The letter said that based on the pattern of the witnesses, it can be inferred that the NIA’s competence regarding the trial is reducing. It said that witnesses are called upon without following any particular sequence. “While certain accommodations can be made in exceptional cases when witnesses are unable to be present, it can be seen that such lapses have become routine,” the letter said. The letter further said that many of the “able officers” assisting the prosecution were not part of the original investigations conducted by the ATS. “The ATS is in a better position to brief and assist the NIA and the court regarding the same. However, no effort has been made to reach out to the ATS and seek their assistance for the trial even though they are the ones that conducted the investigation and arrested the accused including Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, (Lt) Col (Prasad) Purohit and others,” it added. The letter said that the remaining witnesses are key to the prosecution’s case. It urged the NIA and the prosecution to devise a strategy to prove their case against the accused. “It has been seen in other NIA cases across India that the courts have made observations regarding the inability of the NIA to prove the prosecution case which has led to acquittals of the accused persons…” the letter claimed, adding that in the Samjhauta Express blast case 51 witnesses, in Mecca Masjid blast case 64 witnesses and in the Ajmer Dargah blast case 18 witnesses turned hostile. “To avoid a similar fate in the present case, as the victim’s advocate, I appeal to your good sensibilities and ask for your sincere efforts,” the letter pleaded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-blast-witnesses-turn-hostile-nia-urged-to-seek-ats-help/articleshow/88038723.cms||---

The union made the request to the chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni after the electricity department invited applications for filling up of regular posts of 300 line helpers. The union stated that the contract line helpers who have been risking their lives working on live lines and patrolling these in thick vegetation when there is a fault, be given priority over new recruits and be first absorbed into regular services on priority basis. “These contract line helpers have toiled day in and day out, risking their own life while working in the thick forest and vegetation to keep the electric supply without disruption. These contract line helpers have a right over new recruits for the vacancies announced in September,” the union stated in a letter to the chief electrical engineer. There are contract line helpers who have been working for more than a decade and have crossed the age of 45. The union has demanded that the age criteria limit of 45 be waived in respect of these candidates since the recruitment portal is not accepting applications of candidates who have completed more than 45 years. “We had raised this issue of Regularisation of Contract Line Helpers Service in the joint meeting with you held at conference hall of Chief Electrical Office at Vidyut Bhavan, Panaji.

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Cops sniff mava trail to 2 thieves||RAJKOT: Criminals always leave behind some clues, as it’s popularly said. But two wanted burglars in Gir-Somnath district never imagined that cops would pick up their addiction to ‘mava’ (lime-mixed betelnut with tobacco) as a hint to nab them. On Wednesday, the Prabhas Patan police nabbed Dinesh Solanki (30) and Paresh Solanki (23), who were wanted in over a half a dozen house break-ins. And, what lead to them to the duo was the mava wrappers and an empty plastic bottle that they left behind during one of the burglaries. Dinesh and Paresh, both residents of Veraval town, were confident that cops will find it hard to trace them as they never left behind any clues after break-ins. On November 20, they had decamped with Rs 10 lakh cash from the office of Gujarat State Co-operative Marketing Federation Ltd (GUJCOMASOL) and another trading office in Prabhas Patan town. The case was puzzling as there was CCTV footage that did not yield anything useful, but police found brown coloured mava wrappers and an empty water bottle there. Usually, paan shops give mavas in white wrappers. Talking to TOI, assistant superintendent of police, Gir-Somnath,. Om Prakash Jat said, “There is a batch number written on the water bottle. We went to a wholesaler who confirmed that he had sold water bottles of this batch number to two dozen shops in Veraval, Prabhas Patan and Gadu. We checked each shop and finally found one shop in Veraval who was giving mava in a brown wrapper.” Police checked the CCTV of this paan shop and found two persons bearing resemblance to the rough sketches they had from the previous footage. The duo was seen buying water bottles and mava from this shop. Cops then then got their mobile numbers and matched it with the tower dump of the crime spot. The call data showed that these mobiles were active in this range on the day of burglary. Based on that they were detained for interrogation.  Dinesh and Paresh were involved in Gondal Raj Mahal theft too. They admitted to breakins at GUJCOMASOL, Vishwas Trading and a gas godown. Paresh had also committed a theft in a temple of Prabhas Patan. The police recovered cash Rs 4.56 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 68,700 from them. This investigation was led by police inspector N M Ahir and D D Parmar. Ahir said, “These two thieves used to do recce first and thereafter enter into the house or godown by breaking the grills of the window.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/tobacco-addiction-leads-two-thieves-into-cops-net/articleshow/88037341.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

It is now mandatory for teachers to clear the state teacher eligibility tests – the first of which was held last month – to qualify for permanent teaching posts. Anyone aged 45 or below can apply for these 142 posts. A written test will be held as part of the selection process, the DoE has said. “General standard for passing in the written examination is 45 marks out of 100 marks. If sufficient number of candidates in the reserved categories are not available on the basis of general standard to fill all the vacancies reserved for them, candidates belonging to these categories shall be selected by relaxing standard with 35 marks out of 100 marks to fill up the remaining vacancies reserved for them,” the DoE has said. The DoE has said that if the teacher applying for the posts is lacking any of the specified qualifications, she or he can still apply for the post but has to clear the state teacher eligibility test within a period of two years. “If such candidates are appointed to the post of government primary school teacher, they should acquire the Teacher Eligibility Test qualification within their probation period of two years at their own cost,” the DoE has said. The directorate has also advertised for 72 permanent posts of lower divisional clerks in the state’s schools. As per a reply tabled in the Parliament last year, teacher vacancies in government schools in Goa stand at 19.9%, almost three points higher than the national average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/142-govt-primary-teachers-contractual-posts-to-be-filled/articleshow/88038075.cms||---

The interest equalisation scheme was up to September and the Centre didn’t extend it.“While 95% of the readymade garment exporting units are in the MSME sector, interest subvention is essential to sustain in the business at a time when raw material prices, accessories and job working charges have increased significantly,” TEA president Raja M Shanmugam said on Wednesday.“While the interest rate in banks is around 7-8%, it is much lower in countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, which are competitors in textile export. Interest subvention created a level-playing field for MSME exporting units. Competing countries are also enjoying the duty-free status in EU and UK markets unlike India,” Shanmugam said.As there was no announcement on interest subvention after September, banks started collecting full interest, Shanmugam said and sought extension of the scheme with retrospective effect from 1st October for another two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tea-extend-interest-subvention-scheme/articleshow/88038074.cms||---

In the meantime, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a normal winter for Delhi this season — December 2021 to February 2022. Delhi on Wednesday saw moderate fog in the morning that limited the visibility to 500 metres, weather officials said. The foggy morning with shallow-to-moderate fog is likely to continue for the next seven days, stated IMD. According to the Met department, Delhi and the surrounding areas may see light rainfall or drizzling on Thursday due to a feeble western disturbance while a stronger western disturbance may bring moderate rain around December 5-6. “There will be no major change in the wind speed” due to the first western disturbance, said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. Western disturbance is a flow of high moisture winds and clouds from Mediterranean Sea to Himalayas that forms a low pressure area and sometimes leads to thunder activities in north India. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature of Delhi soared by two degrees while the maximum dropped. The clouded sky blocked the sun and led to a chilly day. IMD recorded a minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius as against 9.8 degrees a day earlier, but it was two degrees below the season’s average. The maximum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius, two degrees above the season’s average but two degrees less than Tuesday’s. According to IMD, the maximum and minimum temperatures on Thursday may hover around 13 and 22 degrees Celsius, respectively. While forecasting for the entire region of northwest India, which includes Delhi, IMD said the region was likely to receive normal-to-above-normal minimum and maximum temperatures this season. According to the IMD record between 1981 and 2010, the daily mean minimum temperature in December, January and February were 8.3 degrees Celsius, 7.6 and 10.4, respectively. The daily mean maximum for the same months were 23.1 degrees Celsius, 20.5 and 20.5, respectively. Weather scientists, however, pointed out that there would be instances of extreme weather events. “Normal-or-above-normal temperatures don’t mean that there won’t be instances of cold day or waves,” said M Mohapatra, director general of meteorology at IMD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/met-predicts-normal-winter-for-capital-drizzle-likely-today/articleshow/88039151.cms||---
---||Delhi||At mercy of elements, Delhi air worsens, local sources weigh||NEW DELHI: The capital’s air quality began to deteriorate again from the lower end to the higher end of “very poor” category as the wind speed dropped to a level where pollutants could not be ventilated. According to the pollution monitoring agencies, the air quality may deteriorate further, but will stay within the “very poor” category. Track the pollution level in your citySeveral areas of the city, including Anand Vihar, Alipur, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, DTU, Jahangirpuri, Mundka, Narela, Punjabi Bagh, Rohini, Sonia Vihar, Vivek Vihar and Wazirpur, however, slipped into the “severe” category again as the pollution level soared. With the contribution of stubble burning negligible — 1% in PM2.5 — the city has its local pollution sources and climatic conditions to blame for the worsening of the air quality. Delhi saw an air quality index (AQI) of 370, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Wednesday as against 328 a day earlier. As the wind speeds were calm in the morning and the night, and reached only 4kmph towards the afternoon, the pollutants accumulated and were not flushed out. “There is a feeble western disturbance approaching, so the winds have changed their direction from westerly to easterly. When the wind direction changes, the speed drops. The air quality may stay ‘very poor’ or even deteriorate on Thursday due to almost similar weather conditions,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of meteorology and climate change at Skymet. Meanwhile, the volume of particle pollutants in Delhi’s air worsened. PM2.5 — particles with diameter less than 2.5 micron — oscillated between 155.2 and 205.4 micrograms per cubic metre, according to Central Pollution Control Board. This was over three times the safe limit as per the national standard of 60 units. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a central forecasting agency, AQI is likely to worsen on Thursday, but will improve slightly from Friday. “On Wednesday and Thursday, winds are likely to be calm, reducing ventilation that leads to deterioration of air quality, but within the same category,” SAFAR said. “From December 3, wind speeds are expected to increase, dispersing pollutants. But AQI is likely to remain ‘very poor’,” it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-mercy-of-elements-city-air-worsens-local-sources-weigh/articleshow/88039166.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Airport tests 2% flyers from Sharjah, none +ve||PANAJI: In a bid to avoid congestion at the airport, the norms for testing international flyers at Goa International Airport were relaxed a bit with random sampling limited to 2% of flyers from not-at-risk countries, instead of the earlier 5%. In keeping with the Standard Operating Procedure and guidelines issued by the Centre, travellers picked for random testing were allowed to leave the terminal after they submitted their samples for RT-PCR testing. State health officials carried out thermal screening of international passengers who arrived at the airport. On Wednesday, Air Arabia flight (G9492) from Sharjah landed early in the morning and passengers were randomly picked for testing. None tested positive, Goa Airport director Gagan Malik said. Meanwhile, though chief minister Pramod Sawant announced that all international passengers will be tested, instructions to that effect were not issued by the directorate of health services. As per the Centre’s directions, only passengers from at-risk nations will undergo RT-PCR tests and they will be allowed to exit the airport terminal only after their negative report is received. The Centre has directed all airports that all test samples collected should be in Viral Transport Media (VTM) and not in viral lysis buffer. Only VTM samples are compatible for genome sequencing. The ministry of health and family welfare has permitted airports to test arriving international passengers using the open system RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, CRISPR/TATAMD CHECK/FELUDA, CoviDx DirectPlex and Rapid RT-PCR tests. Travellers from countries, excluding those countries at risk, will be allowed to leave the airport and are required to monitor their health for 14 days after arrival. However, if any passenger arriving at Goa airport from a not-at-risk country has travelled to any country on the at-risk list in the last 14 days, he or she will be asked to get tested. Children under five years of age are exempted from testing, officials said. The same norms apply for seafarers and cruise passengers arriving at Mormugao Port Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/airport-tests-2-flyers-from-sharjah-none-ve/articleshow/88038080.cms||---

These people included policemen, underage schoolchildren and general public. The reality check was done at eight major locations of the city including Hazratganj, Ram Ram Bank Crossing, Engineering College Crossing and 1090 Crossing. At Ram Ram Bank Crossing, students of a private school were seen riding bikes without helmets. These students were under 18 years of age, raising questions on how they got a driving licence. Some bikes were even without registration number plates. At 1090 Crossing, people were seen tripling on two-wheelers, at Engineering College Crossing, cops were seen flouting traffic rules and riding without helmets. Traffic police personnel were not present at most places. “If anyone has photographs of people violating traffic rules, share them with us on traffic police social media handles and on phone numbers. We will take action as per law. It is vital for those riding two-wheelers to wear helmets and we will not discriminate while taking action against those without helmet,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Shrawan Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bare-truth-riders-in-city-belie-police-all-wear-helmet-claim/articleshow/88038701.cms||---

During interrogation, Gaurav Malaan, 28, a resident of Hajiapur Tappal region of Aligarh, revealed that a Kasganj-based primary schoolteacher, Nirdosh Chaudhary, had provided him and his gang the paper for Rs 5 lakh. Notably, the younger brother of Nirdosh, who is at large, is a constable in UP Police. Deepening the mystery, STF sources said constable Updesh Chaudhary was the one who had introduced Nirdosh to Gaurav Malaan and the police official’s role is being investigated. Already in a quandary and trying to connect the dots, the STF is now trying to ascertain if Chaudhary, who is posted in Agra and absent since November 13, “has anything to do with the scam”, revealed sources. Malaan's name has been added to the FIR filed in Shamli on Monday in which suspects Manish Malik, Ravi Kandla and Dharmender Pal were booked under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and 471 (fraudulent use of a document as genuine) of IPC and UP Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act. All of them are members of the gang that procured the examination paper for Rs 5 lakh from Nirdosh in Mathura.  "Malaan told us that Updesh Chaudhary was his friend and younger brother of Nirdosh Chaudhary. It was Updesh who had introduced Malaan to Nirdosh Chaudhary, saying the latter is the right person if one needs any help in online and offline examinations. So Updesh is the link between Malaan and Nirdosh which makes him a suspect too,” said additional SP and circle officer, Meerut field unit of UP STF, Brijesh Singh.  "Malaan also revealed Chaudhary's representative received Rs 5 lakh in Mathura and promised to send the copy of the question paper on social media a few hours before the commencement of the exam,” Singh added. Ever since the TET Exam 2021 was cancelled on Sunday, at least 30 suspects have been arrested across the state. UP government has also suspended secretary of the state's exam regulatory authority, Sanjay Kumar Upadhyay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cops-role-under-lens-as-up-stf-makes-another-arrest-in-paper-leak-case/articleshow/88037335.cms||Sandeep Rai

The daily case count, which had stayed below 50 all through November, breached the mark to touch 62 on Wednesday, which also corresponded with increased testing. The active caseload tally rose over 300 after 24 days. The last time the active caseload crossed 300 was on November 6. Asked how they read Wednesday’s jump in cases, director of health services Dr Ira Almeida said they would have to wait for at least three days to see if the numbers are indeed rising. “We will have to see if the rise was a reflection of the increased testing,” Almeida said. Following directions from the Centre, she said that all health centres have been directed to increase testing. On Wednesday, Goa recorded 3,100 tests. The daily case positivity rate rose to 2% after staying below 1% on most days in November, the minimal infectivity seen after the first and second waves of the pandemic. The Margao urban health centre’s active tally, which was 39 on Tuesday, climbed to 57. Other centres in South Goa whose tallies stood at 10 and above were Cansaulim, Balli, Quepem, Dharbandora and Ponda. In North Goa, active cases of the Panaji urban health centre rose to 29. The primary health centres of Porvorim and Chimbel also reported a marginal rise in numbers over the past 24 hours. Almeida said that the travellers coming to Goa from high-risk countries will have to undergo 14-days quarantine even if they test negative on arrival, while those who test positive will be placed in facility quarantine. Those in home quarantine, she said, will have to undergo the RT-PCR test on the eighth day, but will have to continue being in home quarantine for another seven days. The RT-PCR test will not be repeated on completion of 14 days of home quarantine, she said. During the deadly second wave, Goa recorded 32,953 active cases on May 13, the highest till date, while May 7 saw the highest number of new infections with 4,195.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-cases-see-rise-after-43-days-touch-62/articleshow/88038082.cms||---

The BJP functionaries, however, said the Delhi government’s decision to cut VAT on petrol from 30% to 19.42% was a late move. “ Delhi government said that Delhi’s diesel prices are already the cheapest in NCR at Rs 86.67 per litre, while the rates of diesel in Noida and Gurgaon are Rs 87.01 and Rs 87.11 per litre respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cut-vat-on-diesel-too-says-bjp/articleshow/88038721.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The maximum temperature on Wednesday was 25.6 degree Celsius, 1.2 degrees below normal, and the minimum temperature was 13.8 degree Celsius, 3.1 notches above normal.  State Met director JP Gupta said that a cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea has caused heavy moisture incursion into the atmosphere in Uttar Pradesh, leading to cloudy sky. “This moisture can precipitate into rain in some parts of the state on Thursday and Friday. In Lucknow, brief spells of light rain may occur on Thursday. Partly cloudy sky is expected on Friday as well.

The court was hearing the petition filed by P Veera Bhaarathi. In 1999, the Virudhunagar principal sessions court convicted and awarded death sentence to the petitioner and two others in a case of rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl. When the case was referred for confirmation of sentence, the Madras high court, in 2000, had commuted the death sentence to life. When the petitioner filed an appeal, the Supreme Court had dismissed the same by confirming his life sentence. The petitioner’s application seeking premature release was rejected by the government in 2017. Challenging it, Bhaarathi filed the present petition. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that the petitioner had served more than 14 years of imprisonment. From the date of conviction till the date of filing this petition, he was granted emergency and ordinary leave for more than 100 times. After filing this petition, he has obtained parole on the ground that he wanted to effectively contest this application. The judges said that the records reveal that the petitioner was enjoying the liberty of parole from January 1, 2019 till November 12, 2021, till this court directed him to surrender before the prison authorities. The judges said that there are two adverse remarks against the petitioner which includes collecting money from the remand prisons by promising to get them bail, when he was lodged at the Madurai Central Prison. The judges observed that under Rule 339 of the Tamil Nadu Prison Rules, good conduct is one of the factors for considering premature release. There are other factors, which are not favourable to the petitioner and therefore, the advisory board in its wisdom found the convict unfit for premature release. The judges observed that the state government, which is the final authority to exercise the power of remission, had accepted the recommendation of the advisory board and dismissed the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/premature-release-of-convicts-not-a-fundamental-right-hc/articleshow/88038083.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Covid testing had gone down in some parts of the state in the past two weeks. Last week, the Union health ministry directed nine districts in the state to scale up the daily average testing, which had fallen below the World Health Organisation (WHO) norms of 140 tests per day per million population for the week ending on November 22. Akola, Amravati, Buldhana, Dhule, Gondia, Hingoli, Nandurbar, Washim and Yavatmal were then listed as the districts conducting average tests per million below the WHO norms. These districts, however, registered an improved collection of samples this week. Public health department data revealed that testing in the past two weeks in Maharashtra was around 60,000-70,000, which included both the RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Tests. “We have directed all the districts to scale up testing and want to ensure 1 lakh tests a day,” state surveillance expert Dr Pradip Awate said. “Efforts are on to ensure that people testing Covid positive after international travel and their immediate contacts are immediately checked and their samples are sent for genome sequencing. Though there’s not much data as of now about the new variant, the state has stepped up the vigil,” he told TOI. The Centre has also cited the onset of winter, increased pollution in some states, prevalence of influenza like illness/Severe Acute Respiratory Infections and respiratory distress symptoms as reasons for close monitoring, stepped up testing and early identification of the hotspots. The state has also issued guidelines on these to all districts. Maharashtra has for the past three weeks registered daily Covod infections in three digits and the active cases have dropped to 7,391, revealed a report on Wednesday (December 1). A senior state health official told TOI that the situation in Maharashtra was under control. “We are vigilant. The state’s positivity rate last week was 1.1%. Testing will be scaled up in the coming week,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-plans-to-increase-covid-testing-to-1-lakh-a-day-official/articleshow/88047037.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Nagpur||Def PSU bags order from ‘unnamed’ NATO nation||Nagpur: Munitions India Limited (MIL) — the new defence public sector undertaking created after corporatization of ordnance factories — has bagged an order to make ammunition propellent for a developed country. Sources said the order has come from a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country. The name could not be disclosed due to confidentiality clause. Though a small order worth Rs30 crore, it is considered prestigious because of the country from where the indent came. The propellent will be used in small arms ammunition, which includes rifles. Propellent is the material which gives flight to bullet or shell out of the weapon. MIL will be making over 100 tonne of propellent for the foreign user. The order for propellent will be executed by the factory at Itarsi in Madhya Pradesh. MIL is also making multimodal grenades with Nagpur’s Economic Explosives Limited (EEL got the order). EEL is the first private company to make the weapon for the Army. EEL has got an order to make 10 lakh grenades over a period of two years. MIL, on the other hand, has received an indent of making one lakh grenades. The first batch of 10,000 will be delivered by March as the rest will be delivered in the coming fiscal. This is because MIL will have to first establish the grenade’s shelf life of 15 years. MIL follows intensive shelf life assessment (ISA) method, which takes two years. By the time the first order of one lakh grenades is completed, the shelf life also is expected to be proven. EEL has gone by the isothermal micro calorimetry (ICM) method which takes four months. According to MIL sources, ISA is the only method approved by the Army’s Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA). EEL’s ICM method is used by NATO countries, said sources. Following corporatization, the erstwhile ordnance factories are looking for global market to enhance their order book. MIL, which has its headquarters at Pune, also has ordnance factories at Bhandara and Chandrapur under it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/def-psu-bags-order-from-unnamed-nato-nation/articleshow/88037377.cms||Shishir Arya

The locals claimed that the supply water coming through the taps are grey in colour and smells as well. The Karumbalai Nadu Theru or Middle Street in the 43rd ward of the Madurai Corporation has houses on both sides and most of the residents in this section of the ward depend on the water supplied by the civic body for their daily needs. However, they suffer the most during monsoon because apart from the mosquito menace and water stagnation, lack of clean drinking water becomes a problem every year. S Balamurugan, district president of the Ahila India Satta Urimai Kazhagam and a resident of this ward, said that this has been a problem for many years. “When we inform the corporation, they either come and drain the sewage or open the manholes, but a permanent solution is never given,” he said. “We do not have bore wells and wait for the water that is supplied once in two days, but now it is dirty and we are trying to make do by catching rainwater,” said Mari, another resident. V Pandithurai, another resident, said that the corporation workers come to the spot when they send messages to the grievance cell but they refuse to look into the problem of whether the sewage and drinking water lines are damaged, he said. Stagnant water in the area has also led to the breeding of mosquitoes.

At many places, people purchase PDS rice in bulk from shop supervisors and sell it. There are frequent protests against bad quality rice being distributed through PDS. Brokers and traders, including flour mill owners, purchased substandard quality rice at very low cost and used it for various purposes, he said. ``If CCTVs are fixed in all ration shops, it could go a long way in controlling smuggling of rice and also ensure that people get better quality rice,’’ he said. Sankarapandian said people gave their biometrics to show they had purchased the rice when they were really not doing so. ``They say shopkeepers told them they would not get benefits like doles if they do not purchase the rice,’’ he said. PDS shops get only 70% of their quota of rice but only 20% of the people buy it. If the government gave just 10 kg quality rice, it would serve the purpose, he added.

He is likely to fly in from Chennai around 1.30 pm, visit a few inundated areas and check restoration works, conduct a review meeting with officials and return to Chennai from Madurai. The visit is amidst road blockades and protests by residents demanding that rainwater stagnating for a week and water mixed with drainage at many places be pumped out . Residents of Velankanni Nagar near Krishnarajapuram plan to erect black flag atop their houses to get the attention of the CM towards their misery. District collector K Senthil Raj said corporation officials will be instructed to redress their grievances without delay. Schools in the district remain closed for the seventh day as many are still inundated. Though the corporation claims to have deployed 400 motors to pump out water, the poor storm water drain infrastructure has made things difficult at many places. District collector K Senthil Raj said they have brought eight high power motors from Coimbatore to pump the stagnated water. Muthammal Colony, Rahmath Nagar and Athiparasakthi Nagar are among the worst hit. In Tirunelveli district, schools that were closed from last Thursday afternoon reopened on Wednesday, while it would take a couple of more days for the water to recede in quite a few schools in Tuticorin district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stalin-in-tuticorin-today-amid-stir/articleshow/88038104.cms||---
---||Nagpur||New defence PSUs: Time over for overtime||Nagpur: As a part of change of culture after corporatization, the age-old system of overtime in the erstwhile ordnance factories has been discontinued. Since October, most of the factories under the seven new defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) are having strictly 8-hour shifts and not more. Earlier, the work continued for around an hour beyond the 8-hour schedule, which led to payment of overtime to the workers. Extra hours had to be put in to meet the targets. This led to an average additional earning of Rs10,000 to Rs15,000 for the workers as well. Now with the overtime done away with, factories are sticking to the 8-hour schedule only. This has also affected productivity in some of the units. However, gradually workers are also adjusting to the new regime. This has led to a fast movement towards normal production, said sources. Going by the factories Act, the new DPSUs are also moving towards 48 hours of working in a week. At present, 43.75 man-hours are put in. With this, even Saturdays would be full-day work. The move on full shift on Saturdays has, however, left the unions in disagreement. A meeting has been scheduled with the secretary defence production on Thursday, in which the issue also would be taken up, said a source. Even doing away of overtime has affected the workers’ morale, said a union source. It has also affected the household budget of a number of them. Workers usually go for vehicle or housing advances on the basis of overtime earnings, said the source. So far, we have been able to meet the targets by deploying extra manpower for the same work, said a worker in one of the factories. There are some units where stopping overtime may affect the productivity, as a result it has been continued there, said a source. Apart from overtime, piecework allowance is also a part of the workers’ salary, which depends on the performance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/new-defence-psus-time-over-for-overtime/articleshow/88037424.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Ranchi||Protest greets govt’s new blood procurement rules||Ranchi: City-based activists and several voluntary organizations on Wednesday started a two-day-long dharna outside Raj Bhawan to demand the rollback of Jharkhand State Aids Control Society’s (JSACS) new laws on blood unit procurement. The activists claimed the new directives were issued without taking the mandatory consent of the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC). They also announced to go on an indefinite hunger strike and move the court against the directives. “The new directives will do more harm than good. Private nursing homes and charitable hospitals, which rely on government blood banks for blood components, will be unable to cater to their patients, who mostly come from the economically weaker sections of the society,” Atul Gera, founder of Ranchi-based Life Savers, a voluntary organisation which organizes blood donation camps across the state, said. On November 20, JSACS had issued a directive stating that private hospitals and their patients will not be able to collect blood units for free from state-run blood banks. However, it said that the poor patients will be provided blood for free if they produce an undertaking from the hospital authorities. After the directive, patients will have to purchase blood from government blood banks at Rs 1,050. “The same directive claims that private hospitals are indulging in malpractices and charging Rs 2,000 for a unit of blood from insurance companies under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Why can’t the government take up an audit and take the guilty hospitals to task rather than putting extra financial burden on the public?” another activist said. Gera also claimed that the directive doesn’t talk about providing relief to the poor. “Even in government hospitals, patients have to arrange for replacements if they are to collect blood for free. Why was this issue not addressed?” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/protest-greets-govts-new-blood-procurement-rules/articleshow/88037380.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp environment plan shows unfinished tasks as ‘done’||Thiruvananthapuram: Five years after construction and demolition (C&D) waste management rules were notified, the sole step taken by the city corporation was to identify Kalladimugham as the site for storage, processing and recycling facility for C&D waste being generated in the city. It was decided as part of the action plan being prepared in compliance with NGT direction. Going by the environment plan presented in the council here on Tuesday, the corporation has fixed rates to be paid by waste generators for collection, storage and transportation and it has been incorporated in the building approval plan. The task is marked as done in the environment plan; however, even the health wing is unaware about fixing the rate and incorporating it in the building approval plan. As regarding remediation of legacy waste sites also, the task is shown as done, apparently referring to the work undertaken at Palayam and Erumakuzhy; however, corporation’s biggest legacy waste site is at Vilappilsala and bio-remediation at Vilappilsala is still a pending task. Health standing committee chairperson Jameela Sreedharan said that the plan will be revised and additions will be made. It seems that the plan will have to be revised. We will do it accordingly,” said Jameela Sreedharan. The plan also wrongly shows that sites have been pre-identified and notified for disposal of C&D waste in the city. In 2017, the state pollution control board had issued a directive to all local bodies saying that urban local bodies shall be responsible for making infrastructure arrangements for management of C&D waste. In 2016, the corporation had submitted a proposal for managing C&D waste when the government had directed local bodies to submit proposals for various projects which could be funded using Rs 500 crores it had earmarked for special projects. Management of C&D waste has been one area corporation has not been able to chalk out a plan till date. While the previous council has earmarked a site for recycling facility, the environment plan sets March 2024 as the deadline for setting up the facility in the city. The city corporation will also have to fix charges to be levied by waste generators. As per the rules, every waste generator shall pay relevant charges for collection, transportation, processing and disposal as notified by the authorities concerned. Besides, waste generators who generate more than 20 tons or more in one day or 300 tons per project in a month shall have to pay for the processing and disposal of construction and demolition waste generated by them, apart from the payment for storage, collection and transportation. The rate shall be fixed by the local authority. Construction and demolition waste shall be utilized in sanitary landfill for municipal solid waste of the city or region as mentioned in Schedule I of these rules. Residue from construction and demolition waste processing or recycling industries shall be land filled in the sanitary landfill for solid waste. The processing or recycling shall be large enough to last for 20-25 years, the rules say.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-environment-plan-shows-unfinished-tasks-as-done/articleshow/88016302.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Speaking at a meeting in Kaushambi, Mishra urged people not to trust those leaders who took their vote and did not think twice before joining another party. Apparently referring to former party MLA Indrajeet Saroj, who has joined the Samajwadi Party, he said if he could not remain faithful to BSP chief Mayawati, who did everything for him, he definitely would not care for the people. BSP has been hit by a spate of resignations and expulsions, including that of nearly 10 sitting MLAs. Mincing no words on defections, Mishra said people should not trust betrayers. “Remember his face and make sure he doesn’t come back,” Mishra said. The party will also declare its candidates for 86 reserved constituencies this month, as and when Mishra visits the constituencies. On Wednesday, he announced the names of Neetu Kanaujia (Manjhanpur), Atul Dwivedi (Chayal) and Dashrath Lal Pasi from Khaga (Fatehpur). Mishra asked people not to forget that the BJP government had let them down. “BJP betrayed women by promising them safety but you can see the situation. Remember the Hathras incident where a Dalit girl was raped. Farmers were promised that their income would be doubled but there is no law on MSP. There is no law and order, and no jobs. BJP has betrayed everyone,” he said. Hitting out at the SP, he asked people to remember the ‘goonda raj’ and ‘mafia raj’ that terrorised people. Referring to party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, who once made a statement opposing capital punishment for rape, Mishra asked with such a thought process, how would the SP control law and order and provide security to women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sc-mishra-dont-let-betrayers-win-in-assembly-polls/articleshow/88038720.cms||Neha Lalchandani

The state is third after Kerala (36%) and Karnataka (30%) among southern states in terms of percentage rise in November GST collection. Overall, the state is ranked sixth along with Maharashtra (24%) for GST growth this year over November 2020. For Telangana, the YOY increase in October was 13% and for September it was 25%. The November GST results are also solid in the sense that they are close to crossing the Rs 4,000 crore barrier, a milestone that the state earlier touched in April for the first time since GST was implemented in the country in 2017. Across the country, the revenues in November 2021 are 25% higher and 27% higher than in 2019-20. The trend in Telangana is also similar with a 24% increase. Top YOY gainers in the country for November this year are Odisha (64 %), Kerala (36 %), Punjab (32 %), Karnataka (30%), Delhi (29 %) and Gujarat (26 %). In south, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu saw a 10% gain. Since July, the state has received an average of Rs 3,200 crore in GST income per month, which experts said was a positive trend. “Hyderabad’s robust economy always helps the state to get a stable and steady income. Also, with GST the scope of evasion is very limited and the numbers will improve further if there is no spike in Covid- 19 cases,” K Narasimha Murthy, director at National Stock Exchange, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-sees-24-increase-in-gst-collection-over-nov-last-year/articleshow/88038124.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

This process has been gradually and systematically thwarted in each of the big cities of the state. The notification had provisioned for nine to 21 citizens to be part for each of the area sabhas held in each ward to draw a priority list of development work. An RTI reply by the state urban development recently revealed that Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has just four councillors as ward committee members, with no information on holding of area sabhas in the city. Rajkot municipal corporation had rules and procedures set the process of ward committee. However, Junagadh and Gandhinagar municipal corporations had no provisions for ward committees or area sabhas at all. It is worth mentioning here that provision for ward committees and area sabhas was provisioned under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (74th CAA) in 1992. “In Ahmedabad, the additional collector at AUDA is usually appointed to elect citizen members for area sabhas and ward committees. At the moment, we do not have information on area sabhas,” replied a senior AMC official when asked about the due process. Each month, a senior AMC official confirmed that ward committee meetings are held, but no area sabha meetings involving citizens are minuted. “The purpose of area sabhas was to play a role in developing mechanisms to extract accountability of elected representatives and local officials by providing a space for citizens to critically evaluate their performance,” claimed RTI applicant Alpesh Bhavsar. He added that as per 74 CAA, the role of citizens went beyond that as a voter to include a more direct deliberative involvement in pressing policy issues. “The ward committee and area sabhas were to ensure equal distribution of power and fair distribution of resources,” said Bhavsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-citizen-voice-in-development-of-gujarats-cities/articleshow/88038749.cms||Paul John

The changes in Infiniti Retail’s shareholding is the first rejig within the conglomerate’s omni-channel commerce business even though the two-year old Tata Digital has built a model through acquisitions (BigBasket, 1MG & CureFit). The move comes as Tata Digital tests its super app Tata Neu in beta version among the conglomerate’s huge employee base. Many of the Tata Group’s consumer brands, including Croma, are on Tata Neu, with a commercial launch slated for next year. The government’s proposed consumer protection rules, among other factors, pushed Tata Neu’s commercial debut to 2022 from this year. Electronics is a top category that clocks the highest share of total online sales and this is one of the reasons Tata Sons decided to transfer Croma’s shares to Tata Digital, said one of the sources quoted earlier. Infiniti Retail and Tata Digital didn’t respond to e-mailed questions. The move is also part of Chandrasekaran’s broader plan to streamline Tata Group’s corporate structure in a bid to sharpen focus on businesses that have a play in similar segments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tatas-to-transfer-cromas-owner-to-digital-business-arm/articleshow/88039805.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Santhikavadom kicks up a row in city council||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation council that was convened here on Tuesday witnessed a heated debate over cremation of dead bodies at Santhikavadom as the opposition BJP raised an allegation that people were being charged higher rates than the agreed sum. The discussion began with the presentation of an agenda to approve expenses for gas cylinders that were used at Santhikavadom gas crematorium in June and July. BJP councillor Anilkumar said that the agenda lacked clarity and that no details were furnished regarding the number of bodies which were cremated during June and July. This allegation further led to the discussion surrounding the use of wooden pyres. Anil Kumar alleged that people who used wooden pyres were forced to pay higher sums than the agreed rate of Rs 1,500. The opposition party blamed the contractor for fleecing the people and said that the authorities failed to check that practice. Jayan, the contractor who won the bid for running the wooden pyre, denied the allegations. “As per the terms of contract, we have to bear the loss or reap the gain. We have not demanded an extra amount from the people, some of them do pay us extra. A pyre needs 350 kg of wooden logs and there is manpower comprising four employees. For 11 years, the corporation has not changed the rate of Rs 1,500 and we feel stretched to run this at such a low cost,’‘ said Jayan. It was also alleged that instead of wood, the contractor used coconut shells for cremation. Jayan said that it has been a traditional practice to prepare the pyre in a layered manner using wood and coconut shells. “We use coconut shells to light the pyre. Wooden logs are also placed in the pyre. It is a common practice,” he said. Mayor Arya Rajendran said that the city corporation will look into the complaints regarding the running of wooden pyres at Santhikavadom. About 2,780 bodies were cremated in four wooden pyres during 2020-21 and this year so far over 1,600 bodies have been cremated, the contractor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/santhikavadom-kicks-up-a-row-in-city-council/articleshow/88016323.cms||---

The UP special task force (UPSTF) formally arrested him at 3am on Wednesday and sent him to prison by noon. A 1995 batch Provincial Civil Services (PCS) officer, Upadhyay’s complicity in the paper leak was exposed during questioning of the director of RSM Finserv Ltd, the Delhi-based firm contracted to print Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) question papers. The director, Rai Anup Prasad, who was arrested in Noida late Tuesday, had told interrogators that Upadhyay was instrumental in handing over the contract to his company on October 26. Confirming Upadhyay’s arrest, additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar told TOI that no accused would be spared and the gang’s network would be dismantled. Senior superintendent of police, STF, Hemraj Meena said, “RSM Finserv Ltd based in Delhi’s Greater Kailash-II neither had infrastructure nor resources to print question papers on such a large scale. And the firm’s laxity led to a comprise in secrecy protocols enabling infiltration by the solver’s mafia. The government has instituted an inquiry against Upadhyay, who handed out work order without checking the Delhi firm’s antecedents.” On November 28, Uttar Pradesh Teacher Eligibility Test (UPTET) was cancelled after a question paper was leaked on social media, triggering arrests of 37 accused till late Wednesday.

---||Kochi||Study bares cancer’s financial burden||Kochi: Financial toxicity among patients with cancer in India is associated with poor quality of life, accumulation of debts, premature entry into the labour market, and non-compliance with therapy, reveal findings of a study.  The all-India study published in The Lancet Oncology, is relevant to Kerala as well, with one of the researchers of the study, Kochi-based oncologist Dr Aju Mathew admitting that the cost of cancer care is of greater concern in a state like Kerala where there is rising incidence, poor government spending on cancer care, widespread misinformation and high societal trust in alternative pseudo-medicine practices.  The researchers reviewed 22 studies for the prevalence, determinants, and consequences of financial toxicity among patients with cancer in India. The determinants of financial toxicity include household income, type of health-care facility used, stage of disease, area of residence, age at the time of diagnosis, cancer recurrence, educational status, insurance coverage, and treatment modality. The study findings stressed the need for urgent strategies to mitigate financial toxicity among patients, especially the most deprived sections of society.  Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in India. In 2020, around 1•3 million new cases of cancer and 8,50,000 deaths were estimated to have occurred in India. The high cost of cancer healthcare often leads to a substantial financial burden on patients and their families. One-third of households with individuals with cancer are estimated to spend more than half of their per-capita annual household expenditure on hospitalisations due to the disease. However, in Kerala, no studies have been conducted that systematically documented the financial toxicity of patients. “My guess is that plenty of patients depend on charity, borrow from money lenders, and sell off properties. This is emotionally challenging for patients and families. But an unsaid burden is that on the doctor who has to make decisions with little information about their patient’s finances and disease condition,” added Dr Mathew.  Well-known medical oncologist Dr V P Gangadharan at VPS Lakeshore hospital said financial toxicity is a real concern, especially amongst the middle class in Kerala. “Often, due to financial concerns, patients, especially women, avoid going to a hospital. With early detection and treatment, we could have been able to save many more lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/study-bares-cancers-financial-burden/articleshow/88038151.cms||Preetu Nair

Keyur took the bait and also took his two friends with him who are doing private jobs.” On Sunday, a woman, whose name was withheld by police, approached cops and told them that she received an extortion call for Rs 20 lakh. She said that the caller had kidnapped her husband and his friends. Using technical surveillance, cops soon traced the trio to a location near Kanpur.

As many as 56 varied departments and branches functioning under PMC have been asked to follow the social media initiative. The circular also said departments should begin with providing details about projects, plans, programmes, public notices, instructions and public appeals at earliest. They are expected to update information as per requirements, and content should be re-checked on a timely basis and revised if necessary. The social media cell has created a tracker sheet for every department, in which complaints and suggestions raised by citizens on the information can be reacted to.

An FIR was registered in the matter last week by the girl’s mother, who told TOI that her daughter was rescued from a petrol pump in Delhi a few days after she filed the complaint. "My daughter told me that the man had planned to sell her for Rs 3 lakh to a brothel," she said. The girl's statement was recorded before a magistrate on Tuesday. No arrest has been made so far but the investigation is on. The survivor’s mother alleged that the girl was kidnapped by their neighbour and two locals. She thereafter approached the police to register an FIR against four suspects, which included the neighbour's sister, who the mother claimed aided the other three accused.  The four were booked under sections 363 (kidnapping), 366 (abducting or inducing a woman to compel her to marry), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at the Kosi Kalan police station. Circle officer Varun Kumar said that after the girl's statement was recorded, the police added section 376 (rape) of the IPC, relevant sections of the SC/ST Act, and charges under POCSO to the FIR. He said that a medical examination had been conducted. This is the second incident of rape reported at the Kosi Kalan police station in the past two weeks. Last month, a 21-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a youth in a moving car on National Highway-2, which connects Agra and Delhi. She was returning home with the man and his driver after appearing for the UP police SI recruitment exam in Agra. Both the accused were arrested by the police and remanded to judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/dalit-girl-14-kidnapped-and-raped-for-resisting-prostitution/articleshow/88037415.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Madurai||Madurai: Tharaipalam bridge closed after overflow from Vaigai||MADURAI: Goripalayam junction in Madurai witnessed severe snarl-ups on Wednesday after the Yanaikkal Tharaipalam and the service roads near the river banks were closed by police due to an overflow from the Vaigai river. Residents said that they had not witnessed the Vaigai in such a spate in decades. Yanaikkal Tharaipalam was submerged, and water started entering the services roads close to the north and south banks of the Vaigai, and traffic police blocked entry to the bridge and the service roads with barricades. “As other bridges are still under construction, there were massive snarl-ups at Goripalayam junction. Most of the vehicles had to only use the Yanaikkal flyover and the Albert Victor Bridge to cross the river. Vehicles were moving at a snail’s pace through the day. Even an ambulance couldn’t get through the traffic,” said K Manikandan, a shopkeeper in Goripalayam. By afternoon, city traffic police completely barricaded entry of vehicles right from Goripalayam junction to the road leading below the Albert Victor Bridge towards Sri Meenakshi Government Arts College for Women. “During night, it is dangerous to allow vehicles to enter the submerged area. Hence we had to block all routes leading to the river and the Yanaikkal Tharaipalam. However, this means the only way to cross from North to South bank is through the Albert Victor Bridge leading to traffic snarl-up from Thallakulam,” said a traffic police official. On the other hand, many youngsters, especially college students were found to be stopping on Albert Victor Bridge and areas close to the river banks to take photos and selfies. L Sekarapandian, a 63-year-old resident of Simmakkal, said that it has been more than two decades since the city witnessed such flow in the Vaigai. Meanwhile, the water level in Vaigai dam reached 70.11ft on Wednesday morning, against its maximum level of 71ft. The shutters were opened to regulate the water level, as the inflow stood at 7,570 cusecs and discharge at 7,304. The water level at Mullaperiyar dropped to 141.90ft, just below its maximum permitted level of 142ft on Wednesday. Rain in the catchments of the dam resulted in an inflow of 4,598 cusecs, and a maximum discharge of 2,300 cusecs was released to Tamil Nadu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tharaipalam-bridge-closed-after-overflow-from-vaigai/articleshow/88038154.cms||---

---||Agra||Move on for construction of Krishna Janambhoomi temple in Mathura: Maurya||Agra: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted on Wednesday that preparations were on for the construction of the Krishna Janambhoomi temple in Mathura. “Ayodhya, Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jari hai… Mathura ki tayyari hai… (Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura),” he pinned the tweet, which was liked by over 15K people but also criticised by many as it immediately triggered a political row. Maurya then wrote: "#Jai_Sri Ram, # Jai_Shiv_Shambhu, #Jai _Sri_Radhe_Krishna". The tweet by the senior BJP leader came a few hours after right-wing group Hindu Mahasabha, which had announced plans to install statues of Lord Krishna at the Shahi Idgah on December 6, called off their proposed program. President of the organisation Rajyashree Chaudhuri tweeted a video claiming that they had called off the ceremony as the local administration refused permission for it. Mathura police had imposed section 144 immediately after the announcement by the Mahasabha, with the SSP appealing to people to work with police in maintaining law and order. The administration had also established communication with members of the minority community to instil confidence. BJP leader Raghuraj Singh, who holds the rank of a state minister, supported Maurya’s statement in Aligarh and said, “This is in our agenda. There is nothing to be surprised about. We will forcefully take back the possession of our god’s land illegally occupied by others.” He added that Mathura is holy for the Hindu community and "BJP is ready to sacrifice anything for it". In its November 9, 2019 verdict on the Ram Janambhoomi case, the Supreme Court had said that the "Ayodhya verdict is not a precedent to correct alleged historic wrongs by previous rulers". In paragraph 652 of the verdict, the apex court said: "(We) cannot entertain claims that stem from the actions of Mughal rulers against Hindu places of worship in a court of law today. For any person who seeks solace or recourse against the actions of any number of ancient rulers, the law is not the answer. Our history is replete with actions that have been judged to be morally incorrect and even today are liable to trigger vociferous ideological debate". The court upheld the Places of Worship (special provisions) Act which said that the religious character of a place of worship “existing on the 15th day of August, 1947 shall continue to be the same as it existed on that day.” The Supreme Court also noted: "Human history is testament to the rise and fall of rulers and regimes. The law cannot be used as a device to reach back in time and provide a legal remedy to every person who disagrees with the course which history has taken. The courts of today cannot take cognisance of historical rights and wrongs unless it is shown that their legal consequences are enforceable in the present." Controversy over the Krishna temple was sparked off last year after a Lucknow lawyer and five others filed an appeal in the Mathura district court claiming that the mosque there is exactly where Lord Krishna was born. As of now, a local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking "removal" of the 17th century mosque. Recently, the All India Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, a 60-year-old body of over 90 temple priests from across India, said that this issue is being raked up unnecessarily and that all concerned parties should be all the more careful as assembly polls are just around the corner in UP. Reacting to Maurya's tweet, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, "No rath yatra or new mantra is going to help the BJP in the upcoming polls."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/move-on-for-construction-of-krishna-janambhoomi-temple-in-mathura-maurya/articleshow/88037423.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Abhijith Ajayan, son of Ajayan and Shubha, is the deceased. His body was found hanging in the living room of his house on Tuesday afternoon. The police said that Abhijith died sometime between 9.30 am and 12 noon. His father is an NRI working in a Gulf country. He lived with his mother Shubha and elder brother Ananthu. On Tuesday morning, Shubha and Ananthu went to the city in connection with admission procedures of Ananthu, who is all set to pursue higher studies after recently completing higher secondary education. They found him dead when they returned home around 12.15 pm. The police said that the front door of the house remained open when Shubha and Ananthu returned. However, they do not suspect that someone else might have visited the house and harmed him as there was no such evidence in the scene. “There was not any kind of evidence that indicates intrusion. Moreover, Shubha's parents lived very nearby and if anyone came and tried to harm him they would hear the commotion,” an officer who is part of the investigation said. Shubha told the police that the boy was apparently happy when she left home in the morning. In fact, he had even asked her to buy a parcel of his favourite chicken dish when she would return. The police have recovered his phone, which would be sent to cyber experts for scientific examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/15-year-old-boy-found-hanging/articleshow/88016336.cms||---

The students will participate in four competitions, quiz, shloka recitation, extempore, and a treasure hunt, based on the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. Moreover, the organisers will also conduct online classes prior to the competition to coach students on the topics of Bhagavad Gita. The competition, to be held on January 9, 2022, is an initiative of senior IIT Kanpur professor Lila Purushottam Das, an expert in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics, who is also the director of Bhagavad Gita Pathshala. ISKCON holds the contest to help children understand and learn the teachings of Gita so that they imbibe high moral values and develop a good character that helps them in their lives, said an official. The need to hold such competitions was felt to impart cultural and value education to students. In an appeal to the secondary education department for maximum participation, ISKCON said Bhagavad Gita is a life manual that teaches the art of leading a happy and successful life by harmonizing personal, social, professional, and spiritual lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-school-kids-to-participate-in-gita-competition/articleshow/88038754.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Saraspur had its citizens’ forum||Ahmedabad: Back in 2010, much before the state urban development department passed a resolution for the formation of ward committees, Saraspur ward in the walled city area had its own ‘Saraspur Gram Sabha’ (SGS), an informal ward committee of 11 citizens, which also included councillors and the local MLA. The SGS’s tag line said ‘Delhi-Gandhinagar Ma Aapni Sarkar, Aapda Gaam Ma, Aapdej Sarkar’ which loosely translates to Delhi and Gandhinagar may have our elected representatives, but in our village (area) we are our own government’. “This committee was dismantled in 2012, after elected councillors saw a number of citizens in our ward reaching out to the SGS for solving their civic issues,” said Alpesh Bhavsar, a Saraspur resident and member of SGS. During its two year stint, SGS managed to get four borewells dug, help prioritize laying of two drainage lines and ensuring regular cleaning of the area. SGS had representatives from all castes including dalits and even a nominee from the minority community. The SGS committee would meet residents of the area every month to draw up a priority list, which would then be given to the area councillor for perusal. Bhavsar remembers how during their last public meeting they honoured women and men from 18 community pols of Saraspur who had prepared ‘prasadam’ and other items during the Jagannath Yatra and had risen to fame. “It was after this function that the group was dismantled,” says Bhavsar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saraspur-had-its-citizens-forum/articleshow/88038832.cms||---

The incident came to light after the girl came forward to file a complaint with the police after the accused allegedly harassed her. Police said the man was in a relationship with the victim since she was 16 years and married her in September 2020. She became pregnant and delivered a baby. With the baby being two-and-a-half-months-old, the girl filed a police complaint saying the accused had harassed her and left. Police said the girl’s family was aware of the relationship as she had stayed with her parents when she was pregnant. AWPS South registered a case against the man under sections of IPC, Pocso Act and Prohibition of Child Marriage Act for kidnapping, rape and child marriage. The accused has since been absconding and efforts are on to nab him. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-25-booked-for-impregnating-17-year-old-girl/articleshow/88038156.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Offer Rs 300 incentive to ryots, we will lift 25 lakh tonnes: Millers||HYDERABAD: In the midst of chaos and controversy surrounding paddy procurement in the state, rice millers have made an offer to farmers and the state government. They said they were willing to lift 25 lakh tonnes if the state government paid Rs 300-Rs 400 as an incentive per quintal to the farmers, while they will purchase paddy from the farmers at Rs 1,500 a quintal. The millers said rice could be exported to other countries and Telangana could become competitive over the years. “This is a win-win situation for both farmers and the government because the farmers will be getting Rs 1,800 per quintal (Rs 1,500 plus Rs 300 incentive), which is close to the minimum support price. Exporters can transport rice to countries like South Africa,” said Gampa Nagender, Telangana State Rice Millers Association (TSRMA) president. Another step required, they suggest, is incentivising the transportation charges required to shift rice from the state to ports in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh’s Kakinada. “The transport charge for each quintal is more than Rs 100. In fact, the export capacity can be expanded to 40 lakh tonnes from 25 lakh tonnes in the coming months,” said Vaddi Mohan Reddy, general secretary, TSRMA. There are over 1,500 rice mills in the state, with approximately 900 of them catering to parboiled rice. The rice millers are also considering holding a meeting this week to discuss various options for resolving the situation and coming up with alternate plans. Another idea is that the Centre provides an auction mechanism for exporters, similar to what is done in Punjab. To solve the surplus paddy produced in the northern state, a GO was issued for the auction of procured rice in six districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/offer-rs-300-incentive-to-ryots-we-will-lift-25l-tonnes-millers/articleshow/88038160.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Agra||UP: Dalit girl, 14, ‘kidnapped’ and ‘raped’ for resisting prostitution||AGRA: A Dalit girl, 14, was allegedly kidnapped from Mathura’s Kosi Kalan area and taken to Delhi, where she was repeatedly raped by a man after she resisted his attempts to push her into prostitution. An FIR was registered in the matter last week by the girl’s mother, who told TOI that her daughter was rescued from a petrol pump in Delhi a few days after she filed the complaint. "My daughter told me that the man had planned to sell her for Rs 3 lakh to a brothel," she said. The girl's statement was recorded before a magistrate on Tuesday. No arrest has been made so far but the investigation is on. The survivor’s mother alleged that the girl was kidnapped by their neighbour and two locals. She thereafter approached the police to register an FIR against four suspects, which included the neighbour's sister, who the mother claimed aided the other three accused.  The four were booked under sections 363 (kidnapping), 366 (abducting or inducing a woman to compel her to marry), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC at the Kosi Kalan police station. Circle officer Varun Kumar said that after the girl's statement was recorded, the police added section 376 (rape) of the IPC, relevant sections of the SC/ST Act, and charges under POCSO to the FIR. He said that a medical examination had been conducted. This is the second incident of rape reported at the Kosi Kalan police station in the past two weeks. Last month, a 21-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a youth in a moving car on National Highway-2, which connects Agra and Delhi. She was returning home with the man and his driver after appearing for the UP police SI recruitment exam in Agra. Both the accused were arrested by the police and remanded to judicial custody.

---||Agra||No jab, no home delivery of LPG in Agra dist, or fuel at pumps||AGRA: Petrol pumps in Agra district will from now on ask for proof of Covid vaccination before selling fuel to customers. In case a driver is not vaccinated, volunteers at the petrol pump will request them to get the jab and warn that fuel won't be sold to them in future. Besides, gas agencies will not provide home delivery of LPG cylinders to unvaccinated consumers. There are 1,01,281 registered domestic LPG connections in Agra district and over 20 lakh registered vehicles. District magistrate Prabhu N Singh said, “The initiative has been taken after a discussion with petrol pump and gas agency owners. It is aimed at increasing vaccination coverage. With Covid restrictions being eased, people ignore the importance of vaccination in fighting the infection. The Omicron variant of Covid is emerging as a new threat. We need to ensure 100% vaccination. Therefore, some strict measures need to be taken.” Singh added: "All petrol pump owners will be appointing a volunteer to check Covid-19 vaccination status of people coming to the outlets. Customers can show a picture of their Covid certificate. A text message as proof of vaccination will also be accepted. Service to the vaccinated people will be given on priority basis. Home delivery of LPG cylinders will also stop for the unvaccinated. They will have to pick up their cylinders from depots on their own.” According to the health department data, out of 31.20 lakh people above 18 years of age in Agra district, 11,50,415 had received both doses of the vaccine till November 29 while over 25 lakh had received just the first dose. This is not the first time that restrictions have been put on unvaccinated people in UP. Last week, Aligarh district administration made it mandatory for people to get vaccinated with at least one dose to receive subsidised ration under the public distribution scheme (PDS). Earlier, liquor sellers in Saifai sub-division of Etawah district had placed posters outside shops that read: ‘Alcohol will only be sold to those with Covid vaccination certificates’. Last month, the Madhya Pradesh government had announced subsidised ration will not be provided to those without proof of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-jab-no-home-delivery-of-lpg-in-agra-dist-or-fuel-at-pumps/articleshow/88037435.cms||Deepak Lavania

Barely two months after the reopening of the museum, art gallery and the zoo, the authorities have recorded a collection of around Rs 35 lakhs. The daily collection from museum and zoo is nowhere near what it recorded before the onset of the pandemic, however the authorities are optimistic. “More than the revenue, it is good to see people coming back to public spots because it is a stress buster. Even during lockdown, we have worked hard to maintain the garden, the museum surroundings and zoo premises. Despite adverse weather conditions, people are coming to the zoo and museum and selfie spots have emerged in various places around the garden,” said Abu S, director of museum and zoo. A few months ago, fresh sand was scattered around the band stand. Wooden stumps and barks of trees were redone and polished to be set up as art installations on the museum premises. In October, the daily collection from the art gallery, the museum and the zoo had picked up from Rs 64,310 to Rs 16,9075 in less than a week. In November, the collection has more or less been steady between Rs 90,000 - Rs 1 lakh and there were a few days when it crossed Rs 2.5 lakhs and Rs 3 lakh. Group visits from educational institutions had been a major source of revenue for museums and zoos. Owing to Covid, such visits from schools and other states have been completely halted. The officials said that in the coming weeks, it will soon pick up. The renovated natural history museum which was reopened to the public in January 2021 is drawing attention from visitors. The museum was equipped with attractive and informative display systems and the project was completed at a cost of Rs 6 crore. The museum underwent a complete renovation for the first time after it started functioning in 1964. Exhibits related to 4,000 animal species have been arranged in two floors spread over 30,000 sq.ft. 1,800 exhibits have been readied in eight different galleries. 3D models of 19 extinct animals, galleries distinguishing animals based on species and geographic location are key attractions at the new museum. Skeletons of elephants, blue whales, stuffed birds have also been arranged at the museum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/normalcy-finds-its-way-back-to-zoo-museum/articleshow/88016348.cms||---

The letter ahead of polls assumes significance since reservation for Nishads is still awaited even after several meetings between Nishad Party chief and BJP brass, including Union home minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, since June. Besides, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), which is also wooing Nishads, has publicly blamed Nishad Party chief for not doing much to secure reservation for them. VIP, which is already part of the state government in Bihar, has become active in UP ahead of the 2022 assembly elections and is demanding reservation for Nishads. The letter also highlights the problems faced by Nishads in getting the SC certificate from tehsil and district offices as well as benefits of welfare schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fulfil-quota-promise-nishad-party-to-cm/articleshow/88038757.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

This means NMC has been repairing around 27 potholes every day since the last 56 months. TOI has been regularly reporting about the deteriorating condition of tar roads across the city. Statistics obtained from NMC’s public works department reveal that roads under Laxmi Nagar zone were in pathetic condition. The hotmix department repaired 7,746 potholes from April 1, 2017, to November 28, 2021, in this zone. Similarly, NMC claims to have repaired over 5,700 potholes in Mangalwari zone. The department has also repaired over 5,000 potholes on various roads each under Ashi Nagar and Dharampeth zones. Citizens expressed concern over NMC repairing so many potholes and still the condition of roads not improving. “NMC should feel ashamed as roads in Nagpur are ridden with potholes. This exposes that the roads are not on the priority list of elected members of NMC,” said civic activist and secretary of Parivartan-The Citizens Forum Dinesh Naidu. He pointed out that once the city was known in the country for its roads but today the situation is totally different, with most roads in a bad shape. The elected representatives are busy taking credit for cement roads, flyovers and Metro Rail, but nobody is showing concern for the pathetic condition of roads, he said. Echoing Naidu, a miffed motorist Piyush Janbandhu said government agencies like NMC, NIT, NHAI and state PWD cannot shy away from their responsibility of maintaining city roads and keeping these free of potholes. He also pointed out shoddy pothole repair works on many roads and cited the example of a stretch in front of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Apartment. “Due to shoddy repair works, potholes are still there,” he claimed. Traffic cops identify 75 bad roads City traffic police had also approached NMC and handed over a list of 75 roads across the city which were in bad shape. “Of the 75 roads, some stretches are located out of corporation limits and concerned government agencies had been informed to repair the bad roads,” said a senior inspector from the traffic police branch. As per the data by traffic police, the highest number of bad roads were under Sadar and Sitabuldi traffic zones with 13 and 12 different stretches. Similarly, 9 road patches under Indora zone too were in bad shape, traffic report revealed. Kamptee and Sonegaon traffic zones too had identified seven bad stretches each in their zones. There were six bad stretches under MIDC, Sakkardara and Lakadganj traffic zones, while Cotton Market and Ajni zones had identified five bad stretches which need corrective measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-fixed-over-49000-potholes-in-4-8-years-but-cratered-roads-endure/articleshow/88037455.cms||---

A government spokesman said Covid-19 situation was being monitored and the objective of the drive was to enable early detection, followed by early treatment. The ACS reiterated that soon after the new variant of SARS CoV2, B.1.1.529 (Omicron), was declared as a ‘variant of concern’ by the World Health Organisation, the UP government initiated prompt action by putting health teams in all the 75 districts on alert. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed for intensified surveillance with focus on airports, railway stations and bus stands to ensure that normalcy prevails in the state. Prasad said over 73,000 surveillance committees would pay house visits and identify patients with illness. “While the current situation does not warrant panic or worry, the government has put over 73,000 surveillance committees on alert to ensure thorough screening and timely identification, isolation and treatment of people showing mild symptoms,” he added. To undertake genome sequencing of Covid-19 variants, the state government has directed officials to ramp up facilities at BSL-4 labs. The departments concerned have been asked to carry out extensive cleanliness, sanitization and fogging drives to prevent the spread of other diseases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/omicron-up-launches-6-day-focused-covid-testing-drive/articleshow/88038769.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Lucknow||Indonesia Ramlila artists Muslims, revere Ram: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||AYODHYA: Talking about the universal appeal of Lord Ram, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said, “Ramlila artists from Indonesia who performed during Deepotsav were all Muslims. A country with the world’s largest Muslim population still has a close relationship with Ram. Indonesians may have changed their way of worship, but they believe Ram was their ancestor. And it’s a moment of pride that the capital of Suryavansh, Ayodhya, is touching new heights of development.” The chief minister was speaking on Wednesday at the concluding ceremony of Vishnu Shanti Mahayagya for progress and peace of the nation, organized by Maharishi Ved Vigyan Vidyapeeth in the temple town. He said, Lord Ram is an incarnation of Vishnu and all Indians take pride in the tradition of Ayodhya, which is the nerve centre of Suryavansh. “Every one wants to be associated with this tradition and Ramlilas from many countries performed during Deepotsav at Ayodhya,” he said. BJP's Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi, who also participated in the rituals, said the historic development of Ayodhya will realize the vision of Ram Rajya. Later, CM Yogi shared his statement on Koo social media platform, where he wrote “Lord Rama never committed or tolerated injustice. And we will not commit any irreligious act or tolerate such acts. Previous governments pretended to be secular and turned away from India and Indianness. And it was Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who dared to put India's point before the world. His work is commendable.” In another post on Koo, he said, “When there was a false propaganda about the Vedas, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi boldly presented the real teachings of Vedas, episodes of Ramayana and quotes from Mahabharata on global forums.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lord-ram-has-universal-appeal-ramlila-artists-from-indonesia-were-all-muslim-yogi/articleshow/88038778.cms||---

According to the data released by the Union finance ministry, the state’s GST collection grew 26% against November 2020 when the GST mop-up was Rs 7,566 crore. Well-placed sources attribute the surge in tax collection to buoyant demand and the festive season’s shopping during Diwali. “There was a huge pent-up demand in the market during the festive season and it led to a boost in consumption due to which the tax mop-up increased,” a source said. Gujarat’s GST mop-up, in fact, is the second highest in India, with the highest being in Maharashtra at Rs 18,656 crore. Karnataka with its mop-up of Rs 9,048 crore lags behind Gujarat in the overall tax collection. “By and large, all industries are working at full capacity and the industrial output was good,” said Hemant Shah, president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI). “Moreover, the overall consumption went up in the wake of the festive season, driven by the pent-up demand.” Shah added: “That apart, the steep hike in raw material prices also contributed to the increased tax realization on items.” In fact, in a single month, the GST mop-up in Gujarat went up by 12.6% against October’s collection of Rs 8,497 crore. The gross GST revenue collected in November across the country stood at Rs 1.31 lakh crore. The Centre released Rs 17,000 crore to the states/UTs towards GST compensation on November 3. Gujarat, however, is yet to receive compensation to the tune of Rs 3,145 crore, according to the latest data tabled by the Union finance ministry in the Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/states-gst-collection-at-record-high-of-rs-9569cr/articleshow/88037484.cms||Niyati Parikh

The accused was later remanded to judicial custody after being produced before a local court. According to the FIR, the accused, who was the head of the Physics department, had asked the male student to visit his on-campus residence at around 5:30 pm on Tuesday to clear doubts about the course material. Afterward, he locked the door from inside and sexually assaulted him, it was alleged. The student informed his friend and an uncle about the incident. Later, he lodged an FIR against the professor. Superintendent of police (city), M P Singh, said that the accused was booked under section 377 (unnatural offences) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC at the Vrindavan police station. The chancellor of the university said that the faculty member has been suspended and an inquiry has been initiated. He said, “Further action will be taken based on the investigation report.” He added that the suspect had joined the varsity around two months ago.

---||Kozhikode||Periya: CBI arrests five CPM men||Kozhikode: CBI team, probing the Periya double murder case, arrested five CPM activists, including a party branch secretary, on Wednesday in connection with the killing of two Youth Congress activists Kripesh and Sarath Lal at Kalliyot in Kasaragod on Feb 17, 2019. The arrested were identified as Surendran alias Vishnu Sura (47), Shastha Madhu (40), Regi Varghese (44), Hariprasad (31) and CPM Echiladukkam branch secretary Raju. They will be produced before the CBI court in Ernakulam on Thursday. They were arrested by a CBI team, led by deputy SP TP Aananthakrishnan, after interrogation at CBI camp house in Kasaragod (PWD rest house) on Wednesday afternoon. CBI officers said they were arrested on charges of conspiracy for murder, facilitation of murder through supply of arms, providing information about the movement of victims to assaulters, provision of vehicles, etc. Officers said that Surendran was part of the main team behind the attack. Sources said more arrests will be recorded in the coming days. The arrests, which came exactly one year after the SC upheld the HC order to hand over the case to the agency, has come as a setback for LDF government as it had vehemently opposed handing over the case to the agency by taking it all the way to the apex court and spending crores of rupees as legal fees. On Dec 1, 2020, SC rejected Kerala government’s appeal against the order of HC’s division bench that upheld the single bench order (dated Oct 2019) in favour of handing over the probe to CBI. Crime branch, which had investigated the case earlier, had filed a chargesheet on May 20, 2019 against 14 accused, including the prime accused A Peethambaram who was CPM’s Periya local committee member. Of the 14 persons arrested by CB, 10 were local CPM leaders or workers. With Wednesday’s arrest, the number of persons arrested rose to 19. According to the CB chargesheet, the Youth Congress workers were returning home from a temple committee meeting when they were waylaid and attacked by a gang of eight. CB had found that the killings were a ‘reprisal’ for the alleged attack on Peethambaram at Kalliyot. Kripesh’s father Krishnan expressed his satisfaction over the CBI probe and said that there would be more arrests in the case. “There are CPM leaders who facilitated the killings and others who financed the crime. The government went all the way to the Supreme Court to protect those top leaders in the district who were involved in the matter. We hope the agency will arrest them,” he said. Meanwhile KPCC chief K Sudhakaran said the accused involved in the case could be nabbed because the court had struck down the attempts by the government to destroy evidence and prevent a probe by the agency. “Otherwise all these accused would have escaped. The arrests are a living proof of the difference in investigation by Kerala police and CBI,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/periya-cbi-arrests-five-cpm-men/articleshow/88038177.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

By around 6pm, the intensity of the downpour increased significantly and the heavy rains continued till way into the night. Two new marks were set on the day. The Pashan observatory of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) registered a whopping 76.5mm rain from 8.30am to 11.30pm, making Wednesday the wettest December day for the city since 1996. The previous highest rainfall was 53.1mm on December 13, 2014. The city also saw its day-time temperature dropping to 19.4°C (Shivajinagar), the lowest for any December day since 1996. Night temperature at 17.3°C was, however, almost 4°C above normal. The day temperature at Lohegaon was 20.7°C. Apart from Pashan, the Shivajinagar observatory registered 33.8mm rainfall and Lohegaon 27mm between 8.30am and 8.30pm. The downpour, which IMD officials attributed to the influence of a heavy cloud cover over Madhya Maharashtra, resulted in waterlogging on roads and traffic snarls, particularly in the late evening hours. The IMD said the rains will taper down from Thursday and very light to light rain has been forecast for December 3 and 4. “Apart from moderate rain in the rural and urban parts of Pune district, heavy rain was recorded in some areas of the ghat section as well,” said a Met official. All talukas in rural Pune too reported fairly good rainfall. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecast at IMD Pune, said a system presently prevails over the Central Andaman Sea. “It has a west-northwest movement and is expected to pass through north Odisha and the coastal area of Andhra Pradesh in the next two days,” he said. “Also, there is an upper air circulation over the South East Arabian Sea and from there a trough line extends to the Kutch region in Gujarat. Because of these weather conditions, the Madhya Maharashtra region, which includes Pune and the Konkan region, is getting rain. The rain intensity will reduce significantly on December 3 and 4,” Kashyapi said. The city is expected to get very light to light rainfall and witness partly cloudy conditions for the next three days, Kashyapi said. “Due these conditions, the day temperature is expected to remain below the normal range. Usually, day temperatures hover between 28-29°C but will now be lower by 4-5°C,” he added. A senior Met official said December usually sees no rain. “It depends on the weather system that keeps changing due to varied reasons. We have recorded rainfall in December in the past as well, but not so frequently,” the official said. Similar weather conditions were recorded in all observatories of Madhya Maharashtra. Day-time temperature has reduced in the range of 2-9°C. In Western Maharashtra, most parts of Kolhapur and Satara districts received heavy rainfall as the weather remained gloomy with strong winds. In Kolhapur, the day began with drizzle and by evening it started pouring heavily. As per the IMD, Satara district received 1mm rainfall, Kolhapur got 0.3mm and Sangli 0.2mm rainfall till Wednesday morning 8am. The IMD has issued an advisory to the farmers to keep their farm produce and cattle safe as there are chances of light to medium rain till December 5 in parts of Kolhapur district along with winds blowing up to 30 to 40km/hr. Pesticides should be sprayed in farms after ensuring there will be no rainfall. Tomato, onion, red chilli, among other crops are likely to be affected.

---||Business||Exports up 27%, but trade deficit reaches record high||NEW DELHI: India’s trade deficit surged to a record high of $23.3 billion in November as imports of crude oil, coal and gold shot up, negating the near 27% jump recorded in exports. Preliminary data released by the commerce department on Wednesday estimated exports at $29.9 billion in November, led by a 145% jump in the shipments of oil products, which touched $3.8 billion, in the wake of soaring global prices. At over $8 billion, engineering goods were the top item in India’s export basket. Gems and jewellery and pharma were the two sectors in the top 10 category that saw a fall in exports during the month. But the export performance was overshadowed by a 57% surge in imports, which reached $53 billion in November. While oil imports soared over 132% to $14.7 billion, coal imports surged 136% to $3.6 billion. Like oil, coal prices have increased in recent months due to shortage in China. While gold saw a comparatively slower growth of 40%, the value of yellow metal shipped into the country to the legal channels was pegged at $4.2 billion. Against an export target of $400 billion for the current financial year, the cumulative value during AprilNovember was estimated at $262 billion. This means that exports of $34.5 billion will be needed every month till March. Economists, however, warned of a possible adverse impact of the Omicron variant on the overall global economy in the coming weeks, although the last wave had not significantly impacted business and trade. Exporters have been complaining of disruptions due to shortage of containers and a surge in freight rates in recent months with links to certain markets, such as CIS countries, significantly impacted for exporters in certain parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/exports-up-27-but-trade-deficit-reaches-record-high/articleshow/88039850.cms||---

After criticisms by opposition parties and protests by independent green collectives and the public against the KRail project, LDF launched a counter campaign to garner public support for the project. “Speedy transportation facilities are essential for the development of the state. It’s unwise to oppose a project like this which the developed countries had set up several decades ago,” Vijayaraghavan told reporters at a meet-the-press programme. He echoed chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that the K-Rail project was a green project, and it would cause no environmental damage. “In fact, people in the state are not against the project. They want it. It is Congress and BJP trying to thwart the project for political reasons,” he said. UDF’s ‘blind resistance’ to SilverLine project proved who are against the state’s development, said toVijayaraghavan. “In the past, they used to say that the Left parties were against computer, tractor, etc. Now they are against K-Rail. The Left parties are always for speed and development,” he said. Ramesh Chennithala must reply whether the former UDF government were after kickbacks when they planned a bigger and faster rail connectivity during the Oommen Chandy rule, he said. The LDF government would not back out from its decision to implement the SilverLine project, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/oppn-against-devpt-says-vijayaraghavan/articleshow/88038228.cms||---

Lakhiraj Singh, 15, a student of class X, was entering his classroom at around 8.30 am when he spotted the big cat. Even as he tried to run away, the feline caught hold of his right arm and clawed his back, leaving him bleeding profusely. A few teachers and other students meanwhile raised an alarm on hearing Singh’s cries for help.  Amidst the din, the leopard ran off and hid in a classroom. Forest officials were called in and an operation was mounted to evacuate the big cat. The rescue operation, which started around 10 am, lasted for over 9 hours, and the big cat was eventually evacuated with assistance from personnel of an NGO, Wildlife SOS, at 7.30 pm. Speaking about the terrifying experience, Lakhiraj Singh said, “When the leopard caught hold of my right hand, I tried to shake it off and somehow managed to free myself but it then clawed my back, which led to a lot of bleeding.” Speaking to TOI, principal of the inter college, Yogesh Yadav said, “We immediately sent the other students home and closed the main door of the college premises. The injured student was taken to a government hospital where he was administered treatment.” He added that around 50 students were present at the time of the incident that took place almost half-an-hour before the morning assembly. Aligarh district forest officer, Diwakar Kumar Vashisth, said that they monitored the movement of the leopard through CCTV cameras installed in the premises and closed all escape routes to ensure the animal did not escape. On being queried the possible location from where the big cat had come, he said, “It is difficult to pinpoint the exact place, but chances are that it came from Sankra Ganga ghat, about 20km away.” Watch UP: Leopard enters Aligarh school premises, attacks student||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/leopard-walks-into-inter-college-in-aligarh-attacks-student/articleshow/88037509.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued a notice to the prosecution and asked it to file a reply to the bail plea, while listing the matter for further hearing on February 11 next year. Imam has challenged the trial court’s October 22 order by which his bail plea was dismissed. His plea pointed out that all the co-accused, who were arrested for allegedly causing the violence, have been granted bail in the case, while he was still incarcerated for over 20 months now. “Even after admitting that the evidence relied upon by the prosecution is ‘sketchy’ and all the co-accused... having been enlarged on bail, the applicant was not granted bail by the (trial) court,” the plea said. Imam added that he has no connection to any of the events mentioned in the FIR and alleged that he had been arrested by the investigating agency as part of a targeted campaign to have multiple FIRs and investigations against him at the same time. “Till date, the prosecution has not been able to furnish the requisite sanction mandated under Section 196 CrPC to prosecute the applicant (Imam) for the offences punishable under Section 124A (sedition) of IPC in the present FIR,” his counsel contended. The trial court had denied him bail saying free speech cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/respond-to-bail-plea-by-sharjeel-hc-tells-police/articleshow/88038812.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rate of commercial LPG cylinder up by Rs 101, hoteliers ‘hit hard’||MUMBAI: While the price of a 14.2kg domestic LPG cylinder in Mumbai remained unchanged for the second time in a row, that of a 19kg commercial LPG cylinder was hiked by Rs 101 in the city on Wednesday. This has hit the hotel industry “badly” as it is already trying to overcome losses incurred during the pandemic and now this is the second hike for commercial LPG cylinders in a month. The last hike was on November 1 when the price increased by Rs 266 and it retailed at Rs 1,950 per cylinder. On Wednesday, the price rose further to Rs 2,051 per cylinder, sources said. Hoteliers representing AHAR said after the lockdown was lifted, they have just been able to keep their heads above the water, but spiralling input costs were making things difficult. The hike in the rate of commercial LPG cylinder was back-breaking as the costs have gone up by Rs 600-700 per cylinder in a span of 3-4 months, they said. Taking into consideration the daily average consumption of commercial LPG for a restaurant, which varies from 2-5 gas cylinders depending on the size of the outlet, it was a huge cost. This, coupled with an increase in petrol prices, has pulled down their profit margins drastically, they said. The hoteliers further said, “We can’t immediately pass on this to our customers through a price hike because losses suffered during the pandemic have made them price wary and we don’t want to lose our customers. We appeal to the central and state government to control such a sharp rise in prices which is a cause of grave concern for our survival.” The price of domestic LPG cylinder remained unchanged at Rs 899.50 a cylinder in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rate-of-comm-lpg-cylinder-up-by-rs-101-hoteliers-hit-hard/articleshow/88038837.cms||Somit Sen
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: 1,938 companies closed since Covid hit||AHMEDABAD: Battling acute liquidity crisis and facing a decline in demand, several companies were forced to either cut production or shut down operations permanently. About 1,938 companies downed shutters across Gujarat since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic — from April 2020 till November 29, 2021, according to the data tabled in the Parliament by the Union corporate affairs ministry. These include 353 companies in 2020-21 and about 1,585 from April to November 29, 2021. Industry players attribute these shutdowns to cash crunch faced by smaller companies and micro, small and medium enterprises. Industry sources confirmed that many companies in the travel and tourism sector in addition to MSMEs in some sectors were hit by the pandemic and forced to shut shop. Pathik Patwari, senior vice-president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI), said: “Liquidity crunch had a grave impact on a lot of industries, particularly small businesses which do not have deep pockets.” Patwari added: “Moreover, when the government came out with the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme, it provided a window of 30% working capital credit to companies that had bank borrowings.” He went on to say: “Several small businesses that do not have banking exposure were not under the ambit of this benefit. Covid-19 dealt a severe blow to these companies.” According to the GCCI data, engineering, textile, and travel and tourism sector companies were among the worst affected and faced severe cash-flow problems. Retailers suffered as their online counterparts ate into their business, suggest industry bodies. In fact, industry players foresee the numbers growing by the end of the financial year 2021-22. Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council, said: “With rising raw material costs and dwindling demand, operational costs and overheads were a concern for several companies.” Thaker added: “The moratorium provided by banks gave industries only a small window but these were deferred payments and not waivers.” He went on to say: “Many small companies which could not meet these piling costs were compelled to shut shop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1938-cos-closed-since-covid-hit/articleshow/88037540.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Agra||Move on for construction of Krishna Janambhoomi temple in Mathura: Maurya||Agra: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted on Wednesday that preparations were on for the construction of the Krishna Janambhoomi temple in Mathura. “Ayodhya, Kashi bhavya mandir nirman jari hai… Mathura ki tayyari hai… (Foundations of a grand temple in Ayodhya and Kashi have begun, now preparations are being made for Mathura),” he pinned the tweet, which was liked by over 15K people but also criticised by many as it immediately triggered a political row.  Maurya then wrote: "#Jai_Sri Ram, # Jai_Shiv_Shambhu, #Jai _Sri_Radhe_Krishna". The tweet by the senior BJP leader came a few hours after right-wing group Hindu Mahasabha, which had announced plans to install statues of Lord Krishna at the Shahi Idgah on December 6, called off their proposed program. President of the organisation Rajyashree Chaudhuri tweeted a video claiming that they had called off the ceremony as the local administration refused permission for it. Mathura police had imposed section 144 immediately after the announcement by the Mahasabha, with the SSP appealing to people to work with police in maintaining law and order. The administration had also established communication with members of the minority community to instil confidence. BJP leader Raghuraj Singh, who holds the rank of a state minister, supported Maurya’s statement in Aligarh and said, “This is in our agenda. There is nothing to be surprised about. We will forcefully take back the possession of our god’s land illegally occupied by others.” He added that Mathura is holy for the Hindu community and "BJP is ready to sacrifice anything for it". In its November 9, 2019 verdict on the Ram Janambhoomi case, the Supreme Court had said that the "Ayodhya verdict is not a precedent to correct alleged historic wrongs by previous rulers". In paragraph 652 of the verdict, the apex court said: "(We) cannot entertain claims that stem from the actions of Mughal rulers against Hindu places of worship in a court of law today. For any person who seeks solace or recourse against the actions of any number of ancient rulers, the law is not the answer. Our history is replete with actions that have been judged to be morally incorrect and even today are liable to trigger vociferous ideological debate". The court upheld the Places of Worship (special provisions) Act which said that the religious character of a place of worship “existing on the 15th day of August, 1947 shall continue to be the same as it existed on that day.” The Supreme Court also noted: "Human history is testament to the rise and fall of rulers and regimes. The law cannot be used as a device to reach back in time and provide a legal remedy to every person who disagrees with the course which history has taken. The courts of today cannot take cognisance of historical rights and wrongs unless it is shown that their legal consequences are enforceable in the present." Controversy over the Krishna temple was sparked off last year after a Lucknow lawyer and five others filed an appeal in the Mathura district court claiming that the mosque there is exactly where Lord Krishna was born. As of now, a local court is hearing a bunch of petitions seeking "removal" of the 17th century mosque. Recently, the All India Teerth Purohit Mahasabha, a 60-year-old body of over 90 temple priests from across India, said that this issue is being raked up unnecessarily and that all concerned parties should be all the more careful as assembly polls are just around the corner in UP. Reacting to Maurya's tweet, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said, "No rath yatra or new mantra is going to help the BJP in the upcoming polls."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/move-on-for-construction-of-krishna-janambhoomi-temple-in-mathura-maurya/articleshow/88037543.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

One death of an outside resident was recorded in the entire month on November 13. No resident of the district has died since August 12. The recoveries, 157, were a bit less than new cases during the month.Cases in the district have been declining from July onwards.An analysis by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on 54 new patients recorded from November 1 to 14 in the city showed 39 cases had breakthrough infections.

Only one of the 34 patients needed oxygen support.NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the analysis was done on the instructions of municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B. “We wanted to see if cases would go up post Diwali as large social gatherings were expected. There were occasional spurts when cases jumped more than 10 in the city or entire district. The analysis concluded that vaccination is effective,” he said.Dr Chilkar added that another inference drawn from the study was that if fully vaccinated persons don’t follow Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB), they are likely to test positive. “But the severity of disease and chance of hospitalization would be less, the study showed. A fully vaccinated patient above 70 years of age needed non-invasive ventilator but recovered,” he said.As per the data, the unvaccinated included 8 persons in the age group 31-60 and one in 71-75 year range. The fully vaccinated included around 3 to 4 in all age groups from 21-75 years except 41-45 years, which had 7 patients.As per NMC’s another data compiled between August 25 and November 5, total 357 persons tested positive. Of these, 178 were fully vaccinated, 121 had received at least one dose while 58 were unvaccinated.As on date, the city has achieved 97% vaccination, meaning over 18 lakh people have received at least the first dose. Since August 25, the NMC has been placing all new positive cases in institutional quarantine. This has probably led to a drop in test positivity rate to 0.14% in the district.October had recorded 154 cases which was marginally more than of August’s 145, the lowest after April 2020.No Covid death of a district resident has taken place since August 12. Nagpur rural has not recorded a Covid fatality at least since July 30 until the Gadchiroli woman’s death being officially recorded here. Between August 12 and November 30, the three Covid deaths recorded in Nagpur are of outside district patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nov-saw-34-breakthrough-infections-in-city-only-one-needed-o2-support/articleshow/88036651.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Various dioceses have been following different modes of celebrating the mass in SMC, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in certain dioceses and facing the altar in certain other dioceses. Most churches in the SMC have formally switched to the uniform Mass code as directed by the Church synod, except for Ernakulam Angamaly archdiocese, Irinjalakuda diocese and Faridabad diocese, where the bishops have issued exemptions. Almaya Munnettam’s call for protest comes in the backdrop of a press release from the Church that it is expecting an explanation from the oriental congregation about the validity of the dispensations given by certain archdioceses. “We are concerned about the moves to sabotage the dispensation order, which had the blessings of Pope Francis and Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, prefect of the oriental congregation,” said advocate Binu John, the general convener of Almaya Munnettam.  The media commission of the Church had on Monday issued a statement saying that the exemptions under 1538 of the canon law were temporary and regional. It said that these dioceses would also start conducting the Mass in the same way as all other dioceses in the coming days. Later, the Church issued another statement in which it said that hopefully the oriental congregation would be giving a clarity on the validity of dispensations given in certain dioceses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/standoff-between-laity-body-church-continues/articleshow/88038235.cms||---

As per the cabinet decision, the basic pay of the junior time scale officer (entry level) in the KAS would be Rs 81,800. Along with it, they would also be provided a 10% grade pay, dearness allowance and house rent allowance. During training period, the KAS officers would be offered a salary equivalent to their basic pay as a consolidated payment. Officers who have entered the KAS from other services will be offered either Rs 81,800 or the last pay that they had drawn in their previous service, whichever is higher, during their training period. The KAS officials will have a training period of 18 months, which includes a pre-service training of one year and a six-month training for completing their probation. Railway overbridges: The cabinet on Wednesday decided to enter into a tripartite agreement with the Union ministry of road, transport and highways and the ministry of railways for the construction of rail underpasses and over-bridges in the state. There are as many as 428 railway crossings in the state, of which 143 have heavy traffic through them. The agreement will be entered with the central ministries for constructing over-bridges and underpasses to reduce the number of these railway crossings. As part of the project, the public works department will make a list of the level crossings that are to be taken up on a priority basis and will hand-over the list to the Centre. New-aided college: The cabinet sanctioned setting up of a new aided college in Thodupuzha in Idukki. The college will come up under the Aikya Malayaraya Mahasabha and will have BA (economics), BSc (food sciences and quality control) courses to begin with. The college will be named Tribal Arts and Sciences College, Nadukani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cabinet-fixes-kas-salary-scale-basic-pay-at-rs-81800/articleshow/88038262.cms||---

He cheated her out of the money under the garb of providing medicine to treat her gynaecological illness. Filing a complaint with cybercrime police on Tuesday, Priti Mistry, a 36-year-old resident of Pushp Residency, said that the accused, who identified himself as Cedric Lawrence from Spain, sent her a friend’s request on an online platform on December 8, 2020. Lawrence allegedly claimed to be a gynaecologist working with a government hospital in Spain. “I believed him and discussed various gynaecological issues I was suffering from. Lawrence used to give me advice on how to deal with the issues,” she told police. Mistry also sent Lawrence her medical reports after which the Spaniard told her that he was sending her some medicines to cure her illness. On December 21, 2020, she got a call from a person, who introduced himself as an employee of a courier delivery firm, and told her that she would have to pay Rs 36,000 to claim the medicine parcel from Spain. “I told him that I would not receive the parcel. Lawrence then called and pleaded with me to accept the package. He told me that if the parcel is returned, he would lose his job with the hospital as he had sent the parcel without the nod of Spanish authorities,” she told cops. Mistry paid the money through online transaction and told the courier employee to send the parcel. “After a while, I got another call from the courier firm employee who told me to pay Rs 95,000 as they had found $15,000 in cash inside the parcel. I paid the money but again received a call from the courier firm. This time, they asked me to pay Rs 1.55 lakh to convert the dollars into Indian currency. I paid the money following which Lawrence and the delivery man went incommunicado,” she claimed. Mistry then filed a complaint of cheating, breach of trust and criminal conspiracy along with charges of information technology act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fake-spanish-gynaecologist-delivers-rs-3lakh-con-to-ahmedabad-woman/articleshow/88038848.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC issues new RT-PCR norms, subject to change if Maharashtra revises rule||MUMBAI: A day after restrictions were imposed by the Maharashtra government on international travellers coming in from countries 'at risk' of spreading the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the BMC has said the order shall become operational from midnight (23:59 hours) of December 2. In light of the Centre’s directions asking the state to “align” its guidelines with those from the Union health ministry, officials here hinted that there is a likelihood of thwe orders being revised before they come into force. BMC officials, however, said they will follow the present orders and insist on a negative RT-PCR till the time fresh orders are received. “…Many international passengers have already finalised their travel plans and are on the move and some might also be airborne and would not be aware of the recent guidelines issued by the government of Maharashtra. So to avoid any inconvenience a window of two days is proposed to be given to all passengers coming from countries at risk. The government of Maharashtra order therefore shall become operational from 23:59 of December 2," said the order signed by additional municipal commissioner projects P Velrasu. The countries which are in the At Risk category includes countries in Europe including UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Israel. BMC’s circular cited revised Central guidelines in view of the new variant of SARS COV-2 (B.1.1.529 Omicron) wherein passengers from at-risk nations have to undergo a self-paid Covid-19 test at the port of arrival. In case of passengers from other states, the BMC has said negative RT-PCR test results taken within 72 hours of departure will apply. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said there are three different timings mentioned on every report, namely when the sample was collected, when received and when reported. “The ‘reported on time’ which is mentioned on every Covid report is therefore considered when calculating the 72 hour time period,” he said. Earlier, the state order had asked for an RT-PCR done within 48 hours of arrival. In exceptional cases, testing may also be allowed on arrival at the airport in Mumbai. As per the Maharashtra government order, airlines can allow boarding by only international passengers who have filled in a self-declaration form on the Air Suvidha portal and have uploaded the negative RT-PCR test report. Passengers who are originating or transiting from at-risk countries have to be informed by the airlines that they will undergo post arrival testing, quarantine if they test negative, and follow stringent isolation protocols if testing positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-issues-new-rt-pcr-norms-subject-to-change-if-state-revises-rule/articleshow/88038242.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Pune||Country needs predictable strategy to deal with new variants: Dr Gagandeep Kang||PUNE: Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang on Wednesday stressed on the need to develop a predictable strategy for the country to deal with new variants in the wake of the Omicron variant, instead of formulating a separate approach for each event. While increased testing helped in detection, she said, it was important to be aware that any level of testing would not detect every single case. Hence, there was a need for preparedness to deal with the cases that might already be in the country or would come through despite the testing, she said, adding that there was no need to panic. With the country drawing out a plan to sequence all positives to track the new variant, Dr Kang said, “There is a need to have a consistent and clearly laid out strategy in place and we should use this opportunity to develop it.” She said the S gene dropout was a useful tool and states should ramp up the use of assays that include the S gene as a way of identifying the variant. Dr Kang said, “The country has drawn out rules for international travellers and there is a need to revisit mandatory quarantine if we have people willing to comply with more frequent visits, such as daily or alternate day rapid antigen tests. It is past time for us to develop policies that allow for surveillance and tracking in a sensible way without random changes. People who comply with requirements should be allowed to function as long as they are negative and isolated when positive.” “It was much too early to comment on any third wave when we have no known cases in the country yet,” she said. The preliminary data from South Africa indicated high transmissibility of this variant. Dr Kang said, “More data on transmission will be available in the coming weeks as we track the virus in Africa and other countries to which it has spread. In terms of immunity, a complete escape is unlikely given that the more transmissible viruses we have had previously have been covered by vaccines, and the Beta variant, which had the greatest immune escape, did not spread as well as other variants. We shall know more from laboratory experiments in the next few weeks” she said. The expert said there was not enough data on whether the current variant was more dangerous in the sense of either more severe disease or escape from immunity, or if vaccinated people would be severely affected. She said unvaccinated people were much more likely to be severely affected by any variant than vaccinated individuals. “What we should worry about the variant is its severity and vaccine escape. Transmissibility matters less if the disease is mild because we get mild viral infections all the time and can handle them quite easily,” she said. Dr Kang said with the country focused on increasing vaccination, it was imperative that all got their two doses, especially the elderly and those with comorbidities. “Then we should think about boosters for populations that need them and vaccinating adolescents and children,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/country-needs-predictable-strategy-to-deal-with-new-variants-dr-kang/articleshow/88038237.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra's GST mop-up drops by almost Rs 700 crore in 1 month||MUMBAI: Maharashtra’s GST collections, which had soared in the festive month of October, saw a dip of Rs 699 crore in November. The collections declined from Rs 19,355 crore in October to Rs 18, 656 crore in November, the latest data shows. However, the state’s GST collections in the eight months of the financial year from April to November are a steep 61.5% higher than they were last year. Collections during this period are Rs 1,20,752 crore in 2021 compared to Rs 74,665 crore in 2020. GST is a consumption-based tax and is an indicator of economic activity. Maharashtra’s GST collections are the highest in the country and it is the main revenue earner for the state government. Officials said that there are two reasons for the dip in GST collections in November. First, the purchases in the festive season of October were higher than in November. Secondly, GST filings are typically higher in October. “Many file GST returns on a quarterly basis. As a result, collections in April, July and October will be higher than the other months,” said a senior official. Indeed, collections for April were the highest so far this year, followed by collections in October. The GST collections for May, June, August and November were relatively lower. However GST collections for November 2021 are 32.5% higher than the corresponding month in 2020. The collections are Rs 16,428 crore this November compared to Rs 12,403 in November 2020. This is because last year’s lockdown was more stringent and the economic recovery was slower.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-gst-mop-up-drops-by-almost-rs-700cr-in-1-month/articleshow/88038847.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Kolkata||Police, cabbies face off over pollution certificate crackdown||Kolkata: The scaling up of the anti-pollution drive led to its first confrontation at Lenin Sarani on Tuesday evening with cab drivers launching a protest claiming police “excesses” in the name of checking. Kolkata Traffic Police, however, stated that anti-pollution raids will continue across the city, especially after 3,648 vehicles were found to be either flouting pollution norms or not even carrying the necessary papers in November. That is an average of 121 cases per day. The cab drivers — affiliated to CITU — claimed the cops had challaned one of their colleagues despite an “independent” test at a government-approved pollution testing centre “confirming” that the car was not polluting the environment. It took the OC of the anti-pollution cell of Kolkata Traffic Police to rush to the spot and explain the technicalities of why the driver was served notice. “The driver was not even prosecuted. He was merely asked to return a week later after rectifying the problem. The protest, thus, had no legal basis,” explained an officer. According to police sources, 810 notices were served (under sections 115(7) Central Motor Vehicles Rule) in November to vehicles emitting excessive smoke. Another 718 were fined Rs 1,000 (under sections 116(6)CMVR /190(2) Motor Vehicles Act) for failing during rechecking a week later or did not report for rechecking even after receiving the report. “A total of 2110 others were prosecuted for either failing to produce their pollution certificate (PUC) or not possessing a PUC at all. While 1,037 did not produce their PUC (under section 116 (6) of MV Act), 1,073 others were moving without their PUC (under section 115 (7) of CMVR),” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. The anti-pollution cell has also issued an SOP to the traffic guards to ensure there was uniformity during checks. “Intercept the diesel vehicle. Check the emission level with AVL smoke meter. If the emission level is found above permissible limit, serve a notice as per 115(7) CMVR. The vehicle will be asked to report for rechecking on the seventh day from the date the notice after rectification of its mechanical fault and after procuring a fresh pollution certificate at a pre-decided place. On the day of rechecking, if the vehicle is found to emit smoke beyond permissible limit or it does not turn up for the rechecking, the vehicle will be prosecuted under CMVR/190(2) MV Act, with a fine amounting to Rs 1,000,” the SOP states. Police have also issued the permissible limits for BS II and BS IV vehicles, the maximum pollutants in the city. For BS III, the allowed limit is 65 HSU. For BS IV, It is 50 HSU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-cabbies-face-off-over-pollution-certificate-crackdown/articleshow/88037568.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Sources from airlines expressed that it is because of the panic that many are cancelling or advancing their travel plans. The fear of the Omicron variant detected in South Africa has directly hit the aviation sector. “It is the reason that passenger traffic is reducing from the past two to three days at MIA. Our fingers are crossed as of now,” said an airline executive. Another executive from a low-cost airline added that the sudden reduction in passenger traffic is also due to confusion caused by rules framed by different states, and not due to the fear caused by the new variant of the virus. “Airlines have no clarity on travel to Maharashtra. Meanwhile, advance bookings too are getting cancelled,” the executive added. The reduction in passenger traffic will hit livelihoods that depend on air travellers, especially cab drivers at the airport. “I have observed that passenger numbers are coming down from the past three days. It had picked up from September, and there is again fear among flyers. Our livelihoods will be hit,” said Karunkar, a cab driver at MIA. Ayisha Shahzin, who works at Akbar Travels, Mangaluru, said that some of their customers have advanced their travel plans. “An NRI was supposed to return to Dubai on December 8, but due to fear of being stuck in Mangaluru and losing his job, he has advanced his travel plans to December 3. There are many like him,” she said. Those who are planning to come here for Christmas vacations are uncertain about their journey. “The Covid-19 pandemic has not allowed me to visit my family for the past three years. I had decided to come down this December, but again there are high chances of travel restrictions as well as quarantine on arrival. I will decide only after December 15,” said Lavita D’Souza, who works in Dubai. Vathika Pai, head of operations at Nirmala Travels, pointed out that the elderly, who are worried about the new variant of the virus, are cancelling bookings or rescheduling them. However, youngsters are continuing with their plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fear-of-omicron-reduces-passenger-traffic-at-mia/articleshow/88036655.cms||---

During the meeting, Jain gave directions to upgrade all the STPs to treat wastewater and other pollutants in the water flowing through the drains. Keeping in mind the time-bound cleaning of the Yamuna River, all the upgradation will have to be completed in a span of 12-15 months. The minister has also directed to use environment-friendly methods to upgrade these treatment plants to the latest standards without additional civil work, tree cutting and minimal effect to the neighbourhood.  Jain also instructed the officials to upgrade 20 biogas plants to handle sludge from STPs. These biogas plants will also handle septage from septic tanks, cow dung from dairies and municipal solid waste, especially from mandis and nearby societies. DJB plans to supply additional gas and power generated from these plants to electric vehicle stations and CNG stations to promote clean transport fuel. “This decision has been taken in order to clean the environment and produce biogas as much as possible so that it can be used to make clean fuels like bio-CNG and produce electricity.

While top companies such as Maruti, Hyundai and Honda remained under pressure, the situation in companies like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra has somewhat stabilised. On the other hand, two-wheeler players suffered due to weak demand, and companies such as Hero Moto (-43%) and Royal Enfield (-24%) saw their numbers come down sharply. With supplies facing a crunch amid heavy bookings and a backlog, car companies continued to report a decline in deliveries to their dealerships. Maruti Suzuki, the top carmaker in the country, reported a 19% decline in November on total deliveries of 1.1 lakh passenger vehicles against 1.3 lakh in same month last year. The company has said that severe semiconductor shortages are gradually being tackled, though a full recovery is still some time away. “The shortage of electronic components had a minor impact on the production of vehicles during the month under review. The shortage primarily affected the production of vehicles sold in domestic market. The company took all possible mea sures to minimise the impact,” Maruti said. Hyundai also continued to face difficulties in inputs and saw a 24% decline in deliveries. The company’s sales in November stood at close to 37,000 units, against about 49,000 units in comparable month last year. Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 7% growth in November volumes, led by demand for its models such as XUV700 and Thar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/input-shortages-hit-car-sales-bikes-slow-down/articleshow/88039886.cms||---

None of them has any symptoms as of now. They will be tested for Covid. If found positive, their samples will be sequenced to rule out the presence of Omicron at the NIV,” said medical expert Sanjeev Wavare, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s nodal officer for Covid-19. A total of eight international travellers from the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) have been tested for Covid-19 so far after they returned from some of the “at-risk” African and European countries. Of them, three travellers and one of their close contact have tested positive for Covid-19. The condition of the three travellers and one of their close contacts testing positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday and Wednesday after the former returned from “at-risk” African-European countries recently, was stable and they were recovering at home, officials said. Their positive throat/nasal swab samples had been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for genomic sequencing to rule out the presence of the infection from Omicron — the new variant of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Of the three positive returnees and one of their close contacts, one is from the PMC area and three are from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) area. “They have minor symptoms and have been isolated at home. They are recovering. Their reports of genomic sequencing are awaited. People need to understand that they are only positive for Covid-19 and not for Omicron yet,” state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-more-travellers-contacts-under-surveillance-in-pmr/articleshow/88038250.cms||Umesh Isalkar

This sudden move sent a shockwave through hundreds of workers who had been risking their lives since April 2020 when Covid had first struck the city, and the municipal corporation had sent an SOS seeking health workers. A large group gathered outside the Aarogya Bhavan at Geeta Mandir protesting against the municipal corporation’s “hasty decision”. “This is unjust. We have not been issued any notice. Most of us are BSc, MSc graduates and we had worked wholeheartedly during the pandemic, risking our lives as well as that of our families. This is not done,” said Mukesh Parmar who worked in AMC’s South Zone. These health workers were present at testing domes, providing medicines though mobile clinics and even visiting homes with Covid-affected patients and providing them free medicines and conducting RT-PCR tests. Owing to largescale protests, senior AMC officials claimed that the decision to continue with their services will be taken on Thursday by the AMC standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/over-1k-contractual-covid-warriors-face-termination-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88038860.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||CDFD scientists discover novel mechanism for cancer therapy||HYDERABAD: The Centre for DNA fingerprinting and diagnostics researchers has discovered a novel epigenetic (other than genetic) mechanism, which enhances understanding of replication stress-mediated genomic instability — a hallmark of cancer cells. Genomic instability is a characteristic of most cancers resulting from changes, defects or mutations in genes and epigenetic alteration. This knowledge could be implemented clinically in cancer therapeutics. A scientists’ team led by Dr Devyani Haldar at the Laboratory of Chromatin Biology and Epigenetics, CDFD, has uncovered a novel epigenetic mechanism for preserving genomic stability in a yeast, identified as schizosacharomyces pombe. The research has been published in the scientific journal eLife. The team made the discovery while working towards understanding functions of proteins involved in regulating important cellular processes, including maintenance of the stability of DNA and ageing. It has been working on functions of chromatin modifications and modifiers in DNA metabolism, their regulation and role in maintaining genomic integrity, and implication in cancer progression for past one-and-a-half decade. Dr Haldar said: “DNA (hereditary material in humans and other organisms) determines who we are. The integrity of the DNA must be preserved carefully. DNA is doubled by a process called DNA replication before cells divide. The replisome (protein complex) which replicate the genome (DNA) encounters various obstacles such as proteins sitting on the DNA doing other work, complex secondary structures within the DNA that hinder DNA replication and cause replication stress, destabilizing the genome. Genomic instability is an increased tendency of DNA to change during cell division and is caused by defects such as damaged DNA, broken, missing, rearranged or extra chromosomes.” “A fairly recent addition to the ever evolving hallmarks of cancer is DNA replication stress as it is prevalent and drives cancer development. Studying genomic instability helps researchers understand how cancer forms. Understanding of these mechanisms will lead to new ways to diagnose, treat and prevent the disease,” Haldar said. Another researcher, Shalini Aricthota, a PhD student at CDFD, demonstrated that DDK a protein that phosphorylates its target proteins is a serine/threonine-protein kinase enzyme that is involved in the regulation of replication stress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cdfd-scientists-discover-novel-mechanism-for-cancer-therapy/articleshow/88038244.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Dehradun||After state’s IFS officers protest recent ‘arbitrary transfers’, 6 officers reinstated||Dehradun: After several of the state’s IFS officers approached the Uttarakhand IFS Association over the recent rejig, state secretary Vijay Kumar Yadav cancelled six of these transfer orders on Wednesday. These include the transfers of -- AK Gupta, Dharmesh Kumar Singh, D Thirugyansambadanam, Dharm Singh Meena, Dinkar Tiwari and Himanshu Bagdi. “The transfers for these officers have been cancelled and they will continue to serve at their current posts,” stated the order issued by secretary Yadav. This comes in the wake of Uttarakhand CM, Pushkar Singh Dhami, ordering transfers of 30 Indian Forest Service (IFS) officers -- including senior officials like head of forest force and chief wildlife warden -- over “illegalities” in the Corbett Tiger Reserve. According to the IFS officers, the reshuffle was “completely arbitrary”. They alleged that some of the positions out of the sanctioned 113 posts of IFS officers have been given to Provincial Forest Service (PFS) officers or ‘promotees’ (state-level forest staff who have risen through the ranks). IFS officers said they had been thrown into state deputation without their consent and PFS officers were entrusted important responsibilities. They had also alleged that promotees with ‘questionable’ professional track records have been given important postings. Meanwhile, several IFS officers have said they were contemplating approaching the Civil Services Board regarding the ‘arbitrary manner’ in which the transfers were done. Reacting to the episode, forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had told TOI, “The state can transfer officers at its will.

---||Jaipur||Delay in diversion of Sabarmati water to Rajasthan leaves 3 districts thirsty||JAIPUR: Pali MP PP Choudhary had raised a question in Parliament on Tuesday over delay in diversion of water from Sabarmati Basin to Jawai Dam leading to a severe water crisis in three districts. The project is meant to provide additional water to Jawai Dam through a series of small dams and tunnels. Choudhary sought the speaker’s attention on the issue which also involves Gujarat. The Sabarmati River Basin is spread in four districts in the state — Dungarpur, Pali, Sirohi and Udaipur — while the remaining part is in Gujarat. “The enormous water from the basin goes to the Arabian Sea in the absence of the implementation of the proposed diversion of additional water. This could provide drinking water in 700 villages and nine cities spread in Pali, Jalore and Sirohi,” said Choudhary. The district faces a shortage of water every second year when rainfall doesn’t cross the average mark. It is among those districts where water is provided through water trains. The dam which has a capacity of over 7000 million cubic feet and it has been filled to its full capacity only 5-6 times since its inception 30 years ago. “The average rainfall only ensures drinking water for the targeted population. The additional water through the Sabarmati Dam can meet the requirement of irrigation and industrial purposes and could help in reducing the migration of people by providing livelihood opportunities,” said a CAZRI scientist who has done a study on the region. Lawmakers are in constant pressure from farmers and the civil society members for ensuring proper supply of water throughout the year like the neighbouring districts such as Jodhpur, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh are receiving from Indira Gandhi Canal Project (IGCP). An MLA from Pali district requesting anonymity told TOI that the matter was in the hands of the central government to push Gujarat for releasing water. “We have been repeatedly using our contacts in Delhi for the same and the issue raised by the MP was also a result of the constant effort by us,” said an MLA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pali-mp-raises-issue-of-diversion-of-water-from-sabarmati-basin/articleshow/88038253.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand steps up random Covid testing, checking in view of Omicron threat||DEHRADUN: With rising cases of Covid-19 and new threat of the Omicron variant, Uttarakhand has stepped up testing ahead of the festive season, when tourists are expected to throng hill stations. Random testing has also been increased at the state borders. Officials said that from Thursday, Covid-19 curbs will also be implemented at six entry points to Nepal at the border in Pithoragarh and Champawat. Earlier in the week, the state had declared that random testing of tourists would resume, with chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami saying that 25,000 random tests will be carried out daily and that RT-PCR testing at border checkpoints will be started again. However, the daily testing target is yet to be met in the state. “From around 7,000 daily tests before, we have now doubled the number to 14,000 and we will continue to take up sample collection gradually,” director general (health) Dr Tripti Bahuguna said. She added that random tests are being carried out at all entry points to the state, including airports and railway stations. “Testing drives are also being carried out at schools and higher education institutes, so as to prevent these places from becoming hotspots,” she said. Meanwhile, Covid-19 testing will start at six of the seven Nepal-border checkpoints on Thursday. Pithoragarh district magistrate Ashish Chauhan said, “Those coming from Nepal through the five checkpoints in Pithoragarh district - Jhulaghat, Dauda, Jauljabi, Baluakot and Dharchula – will be allowed to pass only if they can produce vaccination certificates issued at least 15 days before. Those who are not vaccinated will not be allowed to cross the border.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-steps-up-random-covid-testing-checking-in-view-of-omicron-threat/articleshow/88036692.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Ahmedabad||Viral icon Jab-Man now protestors’ poster boy||AHMEDABAD: Jagdish Shah, 33, a contract health worker, was shocked to receive a message on his phone that his services will not be required by the AMC from December 1. Shah had become a viral star with his vaccination campaign — he urged people to get jabbed with vendor-like calls. Citizens loved him and the municipal commissioner praised him. On Tuesday, he and 1,109 contract health workers who had risked their lives during the pandemic were given the notice to leave by the AMC. They had served since April 2020. “I am shocked and heartbroken. What the civic body has done to all of us is unjust,” said Shah. He now appears on the posters of the sacked employees who are protesting outside the AMC’s Aarogya Bhavan. On September 17, Shah became an online sensation. That day he was seen in a video calling out to people like a street vendor, asking them to take the vaccine. “Chalo bhai vaccine, vaccine…corona vaccine, pahelo dose...bijo dose…badha lai gaya, tame rahi gaya...,” he proclaimed with energy. Roughly translated, his words mean: “Come on, vaccine, vaccine…get the corona vaccine… first dose, second dose…everyone has taken it…you have been left out.” Shah, who lost his father to Covid on December 4, 2020, had made it his life’s mission to do anything possible to persuade people to take the shots. “After my video went viral, some people started asking for selfies with me,” said Shah. “I obliged them only if they showed me their vaccine certificates. They laughed and presented their certificates.” Those who were unjabbed were not turned away. “I asked them to take a picture of me vaccinating them instead of taking a simple selfie!” Shah said. “My father was my icon. I saw him working very hard to provide for a joint family of about 30 members,” Shah said. “He passed away at the age of just 63. I couldn’t save him from this pandemic as vaccines had not arrived then.” Shah has a BA in economics. On September 17, the junior Shah was posted at the Paldi AMTS vaccination booth. He saw many commuters ignoring the health workers. “I talked to people and discovered that many had not taken even their first dose. That pained me,” Shah said. “I wondered how they can be so reckless about their own health. Besides, they were a risk to others too.” He added: “That is when I went on the road and started calling out to people like a vendor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/viral-icon-jab-man-now-protestors-poster-boy/articleshow/88038864.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Kolkata||From now, BEd students can take exams in Hindi||KOLKATA: The higher education has allowed students to write BEd answer scripts in Hindi from this academic session. In an order issued on Tuesday, the department has allowed the West Bengal Institute of Teachers’ Training, Education Planning and Administration to grant permission to Hindi speakers to write their answer scripts in Hindi if they wish to. A section in the department is of the opinion that the decision has been taken to support many Hindi-speaking population in the urban areas of the state. The university has more than 460-affiliated colleges providing the course and a big chunk of students pursuing the course are native Hindi speakers. The order of the government is not applicable to private institutes providing BEd courses. “This was a long-standing demand of a section of students and teachers that students should be allowed to write their papers in Hindi if they wish to. The government has finally given consent to all students studying in affiliated colleges of WBUTTEPA. The order will be implemented from this year itself,” said an official of the university. BEd — of Bachelor of Education — is a two-year degree course that is mandatory for those interested in pursuing career in teaching. It is now mandatory even for those teaching in government schools to complete their BEd to qualify to teach. All the major boards have made the course compulsory. “It is a very important degree course now, which is mandatory to get a job of a teacher. Every year, thousands of students apply for this course because unless they have this degree, they won’t be able to teach anywhere,” said a university official. Most students prefer to enrol in government colleges as the fee in private colleges to get a BEd degree runs into lakhs. “There are several native Hindi speakers settled in the urban areas of the state like Kolkata, Asansol and Kharagpur. This decision is a part of attempts to win over their support,” said a Trinamool leader who is a part of several committees on education. “BEd has become an important course now and writing exams in one’s own language increases the probability of scoring well. With several elections in the next few years, the government will recruit teachers so these students will be benefited too,” said an education department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-now-bed-students-can-take-exams-in-hindi/articleshow/88037585.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops plan raids to put brakes on illegal buses||KOLKATA: Last month, Kolkata Traffic Police has detected 240 public vehicles — more than two-thirds of them being private buses and minibuses — that have permits that are no longer valid or are being misused to ply in routes other than those they have been allowed to. Some others were plying without any fitness certificate (CF). Following these findings — several of them on EM Bypass — top cops have written to the state transport department secretary, urging his department to conduct surprise joint checks with them. According to DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha, all 25 traffic guards, along with the special raid section, have come across 151 cases where these vehicles were running “without permit or in contravention of the conditions of the permit”. “We have taken action against them under sections 66 (1) and 192A of the Motor Vehicles Act. Fitness certificates were missing in 89 cases. Action against them were taken under sections 56 and 192 of Motor Vehicles Act,” said Sinha. “There are multiple other things too that are under our scanner. This includes frequent overtaking of buses, rash driving and picking up passengers randomly,” said an officer. Each day, claimed cops, at least 45-60 such erring buses have been prosecuted. Bus owners claimed only a handful was indulging in malpractices. They stated that a few bus routes on the Bypass were the biggest headache. “The only issue is that papers were not renewed during the Covid times as RTO remained shut for a long time,” explained a bus owner whose bus plies on Bypass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-plan-raids-to-put-brakes-on-illegal-buses/articleshow/88037576.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||NE riots: Rs 5k fine on police over adjournments||New Delhi: A city court has imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the police for seeking adjournment repeatedly for filing supplementary charge sheets in a northeast Delhi riots case. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said the matter was pending consideration of cognisance since the last several dates due to similar submissions of the case’s investigating officer (IO). On September 22, 2021, the court noted that the IO was unable to answer its queries on the facts of the case. It said that the present FIR was registered on the complaint of Mohsin Ali wherein no date of occurrence of the offence has been mentioned by the complainant. However, the FIR mentioned the date of the offence as February 25, 2020, even though there is no mention in the entire chargesheet about any preliminary inquiry having been conducted by the SHO before registration of the FIR, the court said. IO, as well as Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), for the police, had sought time to make submissions on the queries. On October 21, once again, a request for passover was made on behalf of the SPP. The SPP had said that the date and time of occurrence of the incident as per the original complaint has been verified and mentioned by the IO in the first CD written by him in the case before registration of the FIR and he will place the relevant portion on record by way of a supplementary chargesheet. He had further submitted that there was some discrepancy in statements of the complainants/victims as to the dates of some of the incidents, which shall be rectified by the IO in the supplementary chargesheet to be filed by him within a week. On Tuesday, the court said that although a supplementary chargesheet in terms of previous order has already been filed by the IO, wherein it has been submitted that the police had telephonically enquired from the complainant about the date and time of the incident before registration of the FIR. However, no supporting statement has been annexed along with either of the two chargesheets. It was submitted by the public prosecutor that one more opportunity be given to the IO to file another supplementary chargesheet after the recording of the required statements. “Because the matter is pending consideration of cognisance since last several dates due to similar submissions of the IO, the request for adjournment is allowed subject to cost of Rs 5,000 to be deposited by the state in the Prime Minister National Relief Fund,” the judge said in an order on November 30. The court asked the lieutenant governor to order an appropriate inquiry to fix the responsibility for imposing the cost and recovery of the same from the concerned official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-rs-5k-fine-on-police-over-adjournments/articleshow/88038872.cms||Usha Das
---||Mangaluru||Norm of 2% random sampling of passengers upsets airlines||Mangaluru: A new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and new travel guidelines from state and Centre, have resulted in additional headaches for airline operators and staff. Guidelines for international arrivals from the ministry of health and family welfare, issued on Tuesday, have thrown airline staff in a tizzy. It puts them in the firing line, as they have to identify 2% of the total flight passengers, and escort them for testing at the passenger’s cost. The ministry guidelines state that travellers from countries, excluding those countries at risk, will be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days’ post arrival. A sub-section, 2% of the total flight passengers, shall undergo post-arrival testing, at random, at the airport on arrival. The 2% of such travellers in each flight shall be identified by the airlines, preferably from different countries. Such travellers shall be escorted by the concerned airlines or ministry of civil aviation, to the testing area on arrival. The cost of testing of such travellers shall be borne by the travellers identified for random testing themselves. Airline operators here are fuming, saying that why should they bear the responsibility of this rule? “Make RT-PCR testing compulsory for all or none, instead of such a rule. We will be at the receiving end of passengers’ wrath, who would have already undergone mandatory tests before boarding the flight. Moreover, passengers will definitely question what authority we have to select them for testing. What explanation are we supposed to give? The fact that the RT-PCR test will not be done free of cost will add to the pressure,’’ said an airline staff. Later at a meeting of district health officials, airport authorities and airline representatives on Wednesday evening, the airlines sought cooperation from all agencies in the airport, to make the process smooth and trouble-free for passengers, since the random sampling was mandated by the health ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/norm-of-2-random-sampling-of-passengers-upsets-airlines/articleshow/88036694.cms||Stanley Pinto
---||Mumbai||Omicron suspects in Mumbai rise to 5 as 3 flyers, 1 contact positive||MUMBAI/PUNE: Three international travellers returning from Mauritius and London tested positive for Covid-19 in the city on Wednesday. A contact of another returnee from South Africa isolated on Tuesday was also found to be positive. The four new detections have taken the number of Omicron variant suspects in the city to five, said civic officials.  All are asymptomatic. “None of them have any severe symptoms. But we are admitting them to Seven Hills Hospital as a precaution,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner. The sample of the 39-year-old South Africa returnee, who was the first to test positive on Tuesday, has been loaded for genome sequencing. Kakani said his reports are expected by Sunday or Monday. The samples of the remaining have been sent to Kasturba Hospital but are likely to be sequenced in the next batch, he added.  Among the other positives is a 21-year-old man who arrived from London on November 10. Another London returnee is a 25-year-old man. The third positive individual is a 47-year-old man who arrived from Mauritius on November 25. The BMC has been screening passengers who returned from “at-risk” countries between November 12 and 26. They include the European countries, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.  About the contact of the international flyer, Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said she is a 37-year-old. “She is asymptomatic too, but we are hospitalising her,” she said.  The state didn’t update if there were more positive travellers. Of the previous six cases, state surveillance officer Pradip Awate said none had any symptoms. “People need to understand they are only positive for Covid-19 and not for Omicron yet,” he said.  Travellers residing in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) are recovering at home, officials said. Their swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology for genomic sequencing on Wednesday. Two travellers from Pimpri-Chinchwad had returned from Nigeria and a PMC resident from Zambia. Meanwhile, Thane Municipal Corporation tracked seven passengers who returned from South Africa recently. Additional municipal commissioner-1 Sandeep Malvi said all seven tested negative.  Dilip Dhole, commissioner of Mira Bhayander Municipal Corporation, said they didn’t have any positive cases among international returnees as stated by the public health department. He said they tested nine who had returned from “at-risk” nations on November 28 and all their reports came negative.  In Kalyan-Dombivli, all six members of a family who recently returned from Nigeria tested negative.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala Administrative Service pay upsets IAS, IPS officers||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The all-India services officials (AIS), including IAS and IPS officials, have taken serious exception to the salary scale fixed by the government for the newly-formed Kerala Administrative Service (KAS), which has caused a huge disparity between the entry-level pay scales of AIS and KAS officers. As per the cabinet decision, the KAS officials would draw a basic pay which is at least Rs 25,000 less than their AIS counterparts. As per the scale fixed by the cabinet, the basic pay for the KAS service is equivalent to that of AIS officers, who have put in at least nine years in service and reached at the level of junior administrative grade (JAG) whose basic pay is Rs 78,800. An IAS officer at the entry level as junior scale officer draws a basic salary of Rs 56,100. A KAS officer at the entry level would draw a much higher basic pay at Rs 81,800 with a 10% grade pay and other allowances including dearness allowance, house rent allowances, etc. The cabinet took the decision overlooking the recommendations of the 11th Pay Commission in the state, which said that the pay scales should be fixed for the KAS without upsetting the administrative equations, and the scale of pay of KAS junior time scale should be fixed lower than that for AIS officers at the same level. “The huge disparity in the pay structure of AIS vis-a-vis KAS officers will be reflected in the pay matrix of the AIS officers in their first 10 years in service. As per the pay approved by the cabinet on Wednesday, the AIS officers would reach the pay grade of KAS officers only at their ninth year in service,” a senior IAS officer said on conditions of anonymity. The KAS was conceived as a feeder service for the IAS in the state cadre. Till the KAS was set up, there existed only deputy collectors as the direct feeder service for the IAS, which was limited to the revenue department stream. After putting in eight years of service as deputy collectors, they would become eligible for being conferred IAS. With the formation of KAS, the scope of entry to IAS after putting in eight years of service was increased to all the departments and also for the direct recruits. “With this kind of pay structure, the KAS officers would be posted in many of the posts below the IAS officers who would draw a much lower pay than the KAS officials. For example, the district collectors and district police chiefs are appointed usually in their fifth or sixth year in service. The pay for the new service would mean that their salaries would be much lower than their subordinate officials,” said another official. It is reliably learnt that the cabinet on Wednesday fixed a pay which was different from what was recommended by the finance department. It is learnt that the finance department had recommended a basic pay of Rs 63,700 for the KAS officers with a 12% dearness allowance and 10% house rent allowance, with a total pay coming to Rs 77,714. However, the personnel and administrative reforms department had submitted another package for the KAS, which was sanctioned by the cabinet, it is learnt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kas-pay-upsets-ias-ips-officers/articleshow/88038276.cms||KP Saikiran

Utter confusion prevailed outside these schools as parents, teachers and school staff were unaware of the late order. They then said timely decisions, especially when they impact the students, are necessary. A headmaster of a ZP primary school in Bhugaon said that they had cleaned up the premises, bought flowers and invited the sarpanch to welcome the students on their first day of school. “However, the order arrived very late at night. While we were able to reach out to some students, many still turned up at school despite the rain and had to be sent back,” he said. A ZP teacher from Ambegaon said the schools should have reopened on Wednesday.“Most students walk 1-2 km to reach the school. Since the order arrived late, we were unable to communicate it to all the parents because there is a severe network issue in the village. We have been going to their houses periodically to teach but it would have been much better if the schools had reopened. And if they were not going to reopen, then they must have given a clear notification early on so that we would not have wasted so much time and effort in cleaning up and decorating the school,” said the teacher. Mahendra Ganpule, spokesperson of the Headmasters’ Forum, said it was a waste of time. “The RT-PCR is compulsory for teachers and many would have undergone it just to realise that the schools are not reopening. They didn’t even have special camps for the RT-PCR tests for teachers. Many schools had prepared so much for the reopening and now everything has been wasted. Everybody’s time and efforts are important and the higher-ups must realise this.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/late-orders-on-reopening-date-lay-to-waste-efforts-in-rural-schools/articleshow/88038271.cms||Ardhra Nair

These jackets will be easier to use and will be fitted with cameras and telecast the footage of bombs being defused back to the headquarters. This will enable the senior officers to not only to monitor the work but also pass on necessary instructions. The new jackets are likely to arrive at Bhawani Bhawan this month and are being imported from a Swiss maker. Each jacket, claimed sources, is estimated to cost several lakhs. “We have the mandatory sanction from Nabanna and necessary finances have been approved to buy 10 new bomb-disposal jackets. The tender and procurement process has now been initiated,” said a senior officer. At present, the CID has 19 such jackets. Not only are they too heavy, they are also too clumsy and the personal defusing the bomb perspires a lot. There was a talk of modernizing the bomb squad after multiple deaths in the squad in the past decade during the process of disposal. It was often alleged by unit members that the heavy jacket impeded their work. On certain occasions, officers even went to the site without wearing the mandatory safety gadget. Sources said the present push for buying the modern-day jackets came after a 48-year-old CID assistant sub-inspector attached to the bomb squad was killed and his colleague seriously injured after a bomb they had been called to defuse fell from their hand and exploded in May earlier this year. The bomb had been seized from Gangajoara area by Narendrapur police. “We are hoping that some precious lives can be saved. If we find our men comfortable wearing these jackets, we will order some more,” stated a CID source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cid-orders-jackets-with-coolers-inbuilt-cams/articleshow/88037593.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
