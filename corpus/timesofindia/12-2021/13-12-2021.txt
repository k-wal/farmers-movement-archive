Police are trying to ascertain whether the recovered items also belonged to Maradona. As Sivasagar district police did not receive a prompt reaction from Dubai police, a suo motu case was registered against Wazid at Sivasagar police station. He was produced before the chief judicial magistrate court in Sivasagar on Sunday, which remanded him to four days’ police remand. The police had pleaded for a 10-day custody. “The suo motu case was registered on Sunday morning and subsequently he was produced in the court. The new recoveries from his possession were made on Saturday night, but the accused has not yet confessed that he stole the items from Dubai,” Sivasagar SP Rakesh Roushan told TOI. The accused is a resident of Sivasagar district in upper Assam. However, he was mostly residing at his in-laws’ home in Moranhat in nearby Charaideo district. “We are ascertaining whether the recovered items belong to the legendary footballer. But it is true that all the items have been stolen from Dubai. The rest of the things will come out in the course of investigation,” the Sivasagar police chief said. Though police on Saturday said Wazid was in Dubai for five years since 2016, police sources added that confusion persists whether he worked in Maradona’s home as a domestic help or was engaged as a security guard. “Nothing is clear in the accused’s version. The information available with us said he worked there as domestic help and the other input says he worked there as a security guard,” an investigating officer said. The officer said Wazid was not cooperating with the police ever since he was apprehended on Friday night. “Still, he has not confessed anything. Not even about the stolen Hublot watch,” he said. As part of the continuing operation after the recovery of the stolen Hublot watch, another search was conducted by Sivasagar police at Wazid’s in-laws’ residence at Khumtai in Moranhat. Two iPads, a jacket, a pair of track pants, a T-shirt, two pairs of shoes, a doll, two squash rackets, a watch, six lighters, a Vaseline and a cap have also been recovered by police during the search operation. The police said these articles have been seized observing all necessary legal formalities. It was Assam special DGP (Law and Order) GP Singh, who took to Twitter on Sunday morning to inform about more recoveries. According to Wazid’s family members in Sivasagar, he returned from Dubai around three months ago. They said he almost snapped relations with his parents after his marriage in 2005. “We were informed that he worked in Dubai. We never knew about the Maradona connection,” said one of his family members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/more-maradona-memorabilia-tumble-out-in-assam/articleshow/88244415.cms||Kangkan Kalita

It’s not known why he took the extreme step. According to cops, the 29-year-old Army officer from Priyadarshini Vihar in eastern Delhi was company commander of 23 RR’s Ramban detachment, Alpha Coy Mahubal. “As the death happened under mysterious circumstances, inquest proceedings were initiated at Khari police post to find out what led the military officer to shoot himself. No suicide or any other note was found,” a police officer said, informing that a case has been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-major-shoots-self-in-jks-ramban/articleshow/88244617.cms||---
---||Srinagar||J&K admin blocks youth meet at Mehbooba bungalow||SRINAGAR: The J&K administration on Sunday sealed all routes leading to PDP chief and ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti's Gupkar Road residence after citing Covid protocol to officially deny her permission to hold the party's youth convention on the sprawling lawns of the state-owned Fairview bungalow overlooking the Dal. Mehbooba, who had been asked to vacate the heritage property soon after the nullification of Article 370 took away J&K's special status, posted a video on PDP's official Twitter handle that shows her walking past rows of overturned plastic chairs and talking about how her attempt to connect with the youth had been "sabotaged". PDP spokesperson Najam-us-Saqib alleged that supporters headed to the PDP headquarters, to which the event was shifted at the last minute, were baton-charged by the police at Sonwar. He claimed there was no prior intimation from the administration about restrictions in holding the convention. The police said there was no question of allowing any public gathering in the high-security Gupkar Road neighbourhood. "PDP had scheduled a youth convention at Fairview, a government bungalow that is also the residence of Mehbooba Mufti. A gathering of at least 1,000 people was expected," an official said. "Given the prevalent Covid situation and larger security implications resulting from allowing such a large number of people and accompanying cars and vehicles into a high-security zone, it was not advisable to allow such a large flow of people and unauthorised vehicles." The official said the police had "credible inputs" about the possibility of vehicles loaded with IEDs being used to target civilians and high-security installations. "Gupkar Road houses buildings of various organisations, including security-sensitive establishments and intelligence agencies. No gatherings were allowed on the road earlier too." The Srinagar administration said it had advised PDP to officially apply for permission to hold the youth convention in an open area away from security-sensitive locations. Mehbooba, whose family has occupied Fairview since the time her late father Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was the CM, had been asked to vacate the heritage property soon after the nullification of Article 370 took away J&K's special status. She received a second eviction notice later, but has stayed put. National Conference vice-president and former CM Omar Abdullah, who used to live in another sprawling property in the same neighbourhood, vacated it last year and moved in with his father Farooq Abdullah. Mehbooba owns two houses, one in Srinagar and another at Bijjbehra in Anantnag district of south Kashmir, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/srinagar/jk-admin-blocks-youth-meet-at-mehbooba-bungalow/articleshow/88244672.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The slain terrorist was identified as Sameer Ahmad Tantray, a resident of Bargam in Awantipora. A police officer said JeM assigned him to its south Kashmir unit on November 2. In the police records, he was classified as a "C-category" terrorist. Sameer was gunned down after he opened fire on a joint police and Army team engaged in a cordon-and-search operation in Bargam, the officer said. Nearly 150 terrorists, including several Pakistani infiltrators and local commanders of various outfits, have been killed in J&K so far this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jem-recruit-killed-in-jk-gunfight-with-forces/articleshow/88244689.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||UK Covid alert level raised to 2nd highest tier amid Omicron surge||LONDON: Britain raised its Covid alert level on Sunday in response to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, as medical authorities warned that hospitalisations are likely to rise sharply over the coming weeks. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland recommended an increase to alert level 4 from level 3 on its 5-point scale, which means they judge transmission of the virus to be high. “Early evidence shows that Omicron is spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced,” they said. Britain on Sunday announced additional step to stop the spread of the Omicron, including the extension of booster jabs to people over 30. “The Omicron expected to be the dominant strain by mid-December,” said health secretary Sajid Javid. The government has set itself a target of giving everyone aged 18 and over a booster jab by the end of January. The over-30s can get a third dose from next week. On Sunday, government minister Nadim Zahawi said the first people with Omicron had been taken to hospital. In London, Omicron is now responsible for about a third of all Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, PM Boris Johnson could face more ire over a report he personally breached lockdown rules a year ago. Mirror reported that he hosted a Christmas quiz from his Downing Street residence on December 15, when UK was under a “no mixing” order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-covid-alert-level-raised-to-2nd-highest-tier-amid-omicron-surge/articleshow/88244780.cms||---

The milestone means the US death toll from this one virus now exceeds the entire population of North Dakota. Even with vaccines widely available, the country has lost more lives to the virus this year than in 2020 due to the more contagious Delta variant and people refusing to get inoculated. Since the start of the year, over 4,50,000 people in the US have died of Covid, or 57% of all US deaths from the illness since the pandemic started. The deaths this year were mostly in unvaccinated patients, experts say. It took 111 days for US deaths to jump from 600,000 to 700,000. The next 100,000 deaths took just 73 days. Meanwhile, the number of registered cases in Russia now exceeds 10 million, but the latest wave has lost momentum and the number of deaths is declining.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-virus-toll-tops-8l-as-delta-ravaged-in-2021-covid-cases-in-russia-hit-10m-mark/articleshow/88244942.cms||---

She was 80. Her son, Christopher Rice, wrote on social media that Anne Rice died of “complications resulting from a stroke”. “She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died,” Christopher Rice wrote on his mother’s Facebook page. “In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage,” he wrote. Rice was most widely known for the novel series “The Vampire Chronicles,” the first of which was “Interview With the Vampire,” published in 1976. It was adapted into a movie starring Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst and Antonio Banderas. Over the next five decades, Rice would write more than 30 books, over a dozen of which are part of the vampire series. Born Howard Allen Frances O’Brien in 1941, she was raised in New Orleans, where many of her novels were set. Raised in an Irish Catholic family, Rice wrote about her fluctuating spiritual journey, including the 2008 memoir “Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession.” But in 2010, she announced that she was no longer Christian, saying “I refuse to be anti-gay. I refuse to be anti-feminist. I refuse to be anti-artificial birth control.” Anne Rice will be interred in a private ceremony at the family mausoleum in New Orleans, Christopher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/anne-rice-who-spun-gothic-tales-of-vampires-passes-away-at-80/articleshow/88245012.cms||---
---||World||Israeli leader begins first-ever visit to UAE as Iran tensions rise||JERUSALEM: Israeli PM Naftali Bennett arrived in the UAE on Sunday and will meet its de facto ruler in the highest-level visit since the countries formalised relations last year. Bennett said he and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan would meet on Monday to discuss ways to bolster cooperation and strengthen economic and commercial ties. There was no comment from Abu Dhabi on the visit, which comes at a time of heightened regional tension as world powers try to revive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Israel has broached setting up joint defences with Gulf Arab states that share its concern over Iran’ activities. Yet the UAE has also reached out to its Iran, sending its NSA to meet President Raisi. Since August 2020, the UAE, followed by Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, have moved to normalise ties with Israel under the US-sponsored “Abraham Accords”. Bennett’s UAE trip is the first visit by an Israeli PM to any of those countries since the accords.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israeli-leader-begins-first-ever-visit-to-uae-as-iran-tensions-rise/articleshow/88245068.cms||---
---||World||Civilian deaths mounted as secret American unit pounded IS: Report||A single top-secret American strike cell launched tens of thousands of bombs and missiles against the Islamic State group in Syria, but in the process of hammering an enemy, the shadowy force sidestepped safeguards and repeatedly killed civilians, according to several current and former military and intelligence officials. The unit, called Talon Anvil, worked in three shifts around the clock between 2014 and 2019, pinpointing targets for the US’ air power to hit: convoys, car bombs, command centres and squads of enemy fighters. But people who worked with the strike cell say in the rush to destroy enemies, it circumvented rules imposed to protect non-combatants, and alarmed its partners in the military and the CIA by killing people who had no role in the conflict: farmers trying to harvest, children in the street, families fleeing fighting and villagers sheltering in buildings. Talon Anvil was small — at times fewer than 20 members — but it played an outsize role in the 1,12,000 bombs and missiles launched against the IS, in part because it embraced a loose interpretation of the military’s rules of engagement. “They were ruthlessly efficient,” said a former air force intelligence officer who worked on hundreds of Talon Anvil missions from 2016 to 2018. “But they also made a lot of bad strikes.” The military billed the air war against the IS as the most precise and humane in history, and said rules and oversight by top leaders kept civilian deaths to a minimum despite a ferocious pace of bombing. In reality, four current and former military officials say, the majority of strikes were ordered not by top leaders but by low-ranking commandos in Talon Anvil. NYT reported last month that a bombing run in 2019 killed dozens of women and kids, and that the aftermath was concealed from the public and military leaders. That strike was carried out by Talon Anvil. Every year that the strike cell operated, the civilian casualty rate in Syria increased significantly, according to Larry Lewis, a former Pentagon and state department adviser. When presented with the findings, several current and former special operations officers denied any widespread pattern of reckless airstrikes by the strike cell and disregard for limiting civilian casualties. Captain Bill Urban, a spokesman for the military’s central command, declined to comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/civilian-deaths-mounted-as-secret-american-unit-pounded-is-report/articleshow/88245101.cms||---
---||India||PM Modi’s Twitter account hacked with Bitcoin post, ‘promptly secured’||NEW DELHI: PM Modi’s personal Twitter account was hacked for a brief period during the early hours of Sunday, prompting the Centre’s cyber security wing CERT-In to order a high-level inquiry into the incident that follows a similar breach in September last year where an account linked to the PM’s personal website was compromised. The latest incident saw the hackers put out a tweet from the PM’s Twitter handle – that has over 73.4 million followers – claiming that India has “officially adopted bitcoin as legal tender”. Sharing a link and asking people to “hurry up”, the Tweet added, “The government has officially bought 500 BTC and is distributing them to all residents of the country”. No sooner had the hack been noticed than the government sprung into action, writing to Twitter about the incident and asking users to ignore the tweet. The first official info about the breach was sent out through the PM’s official Twitter account (@PMOIndia) at 03:18am: “The Twitter handle of PM @narendramodi was very briefly compromised. The matter was escalated to Twitter and the account has been immediately secured. In the brief period that the account was compromised, any Tweet shared must be ignored”. As chatter around the breach spread, the matter started trending on Twitter with the hashtags such as #hacked. When contacted, a spokesperson for Twitter said that the account was "secured" the moment they were made aware of the hack. "We have 24x7 open lines of communication with the PM’s Office and our teams took necessary steps to secure the compromised account as soon as we became aware of this activity. Our investigation has revealed that there are no signs of any other impacted accounts at this time." Twitter said that as per its internal investigations into the matter, “it appears that the account was not compromised due to any breach of Twitter’s systems”. However, top government functionaries have started an investigation into the breach, with the country’s cybersecurity nodal agency, CERT-In coming into the picture. Officials of the cyber security wing and other agencies have sought details from Twitter, while also investigating into the possible hacking syndicates and groups that operate as independent entities or emanate from countries inimical to India’s interests, sources told TOI. In the incident that occurred on September 3 last year, the verified Twitter account of Modi's personal website @narendramodi_in was hacked (also in the wee hours) as the gate-crashers sought funds in the name of Covid-19 relief efforts, though through bitcoins. "I appeal to you all to donate generously to PM National Relief Fund for Covid-19. Now India begins with cryptocurrency. Kindly donate bitcoins to (bitcoin wallet address)," the hackers tweeted from the verified handle at around 3.15am. The account though was restored within an hour and the malicious tweets deleted. The hackers – who had had identified themselves as ‘John Wick’ (a Hollywood vigilante action thriller franchise with actor Keanu Reeves playing the title role) – had later claimed in an email that they were based out of Korea and had hacked the PM's website account to "clear their name" from an earlier data breach incident. Twitter had said even then that the incident was not linked to any security compromise at its end, adding that there was no connection to a global celebrity hack in July last year. The July incidents had seen cyber attackers hack into the Twitter accounts of famous western personalities such as former US President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden as well as corporate such as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It was purportedly linked to a Bitcoin scam, and the incident had also seen CERT-In step in then as it sought explanations from the company on any possible attacks in India.

Inaugurating the 'Swarnim Vijay Parv' (Golden Jubilee celebration) at the India Gate lawns here to commemorate the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war, Singh said, “This war tells us that the partition of India on the basis of religion was a historic mistake. Pakistan was born in the name of one religion but it could not remain one.” At the event, a video message by Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, which was recorded a day before his death with 12 others in the Mi-17 V5 helicopter crash on December 8, was also played. “Apne senao par hei hame garv, aao milkar manaye Vijay Parv (We are proud of our armed forces, let's celebrate victory together),” said Gen Rawat in his message, paying glowing tributes to the Indian military personnel killed in the 1971 war with Pakistan. “After the defeat of 1971, it is continuously fighting a proxy war. Pakistan wants to disrupt peace in India by promoting terrorism and other anti-India activities. The Indian forces had foiled their plans in 1971 and work to eliminate terrorism from its root is also underway. We have won in a direct war and the victory will be ours in the indirect war as well,” Rajnath said. He said India contributed to the establishment of democracy in Bangladesh, which has progressed rapidly on the path of development over the last 50 years, in an inspiration for the rest of the world. Noting that Pakistan names its missiles after cruel invaders who attacked India like Ghauri, Ghaznavi and Abdali, he said the 1971 war was against not just the Pakistani army but also injustice and atrocities inflicted on the Bangladeshi people. “It was not just a victory of India over Pakistan, but also of justice over injustice…India has never attacked another country and never occupied a single inch of another country,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-won-direct-war-against-pak-will-win-indirect-war-too-rajnath-singh/articleshow/88245214.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Darul Uloom Deoband sniffs ‘western plot’ behind Saudi Arabia’s Tablighi Jamaat ban||AYODHYA: Days after Saudi Arabia banned the Islamist proselytising movement, Tablighi Jamaat, calling it the gateway of terrorism, top leaders of the Jamaat, the Shura and leading Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband – the ideological fountainhead of the Jamaat – have reacted with shock and anger, blaming “a western plot” to defame a “puritanical” outfit with global footprint. Majority sympathisers and followers of the Jamaat, headquartered at Delhi’s Nizamuddin West, said the Saudi decision was dictated by “an influential western power” that wants to cripple Riyadh’s centuries-old affiliation to the Muslim Ummah. Spokesperson of Tablighi Jamaat, Nizamuddin Markaz, Sameeruddin Qasmi, defended his members as purists, who reformed deviant Muslims and served as a bulwark against global terror. "It is an unfounded allegation against Tablighi Jamaat. We have no connection with terrorism. In fact, we stop, condemn and disown terrorism. We don't allow our members to speak against any religion, community or country and focus on five pillars of Islam. None of our men has ever been found involved in terrorist activity. The Saudi government has been misled," he said in a video message from London. Mohammad Miyan, member of the ‘Shura’, a prominent breakaway Tablighi faction, said, "Our Jamaats are working all over the world and even in Saudi Arabia. We are bringing Muslims to the path of the prophet. The Shura will not comment on the ban, but our Jamaats will continue to work fearlessly in Saudi Arabia." Darul Uloom Deoband has condemned the Saudi government. Taking Riyadh head-on for the first time, chief rector Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani warned Saudi Arabia to desist from wrongdoing and withdraw the ban as it would send a wrong message to Muslims across the world. Talking to TOI, prominent Muslim activist Zafar Sareshwala said, "I am surprised by the Saudi decision as the Tablighi Jamaat was an antidote to extremist ideas with its strong disapproval of jihadist ideology. Even Taliban have spoken out against the Jamaat. Calling it the gateway of terrorism is unbelievable and unacceptable." A senior faculty in Darul Uloom Nadwa, Maulana Fakhrul Hasan Khan, said, "We are receiving the news from the media. We will react conclusively after talking to our members in Saudi Arabia."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/darul-sniffs-western-plot-behind-saudis-jamaat-ban/articleshow/88245275.cms||Arshad Afzal Khan
---||India||India’s weekly Covid cases dip to lowest in 19 months||Despite a worldwide Omicron scare and a rising fourth wave of the coronavirus globally, the pandemic continues to recede in India. The country recorded an 8.7% decline in cases in the week ending Sunday, a higher rate of fall than in the previous week (3.3%). India recorded less than 56,000 fresh cases in the current week (December 6-12), the lowest weekly count in nearly 19 months since mid-May of last year. The country had logged 61,149 new Covid infections last week, with the slow rate of fall raising concern. This week, however, Covid numbers have fallen more sharply. Although the case count in several states has been gradually inching up in recent weeks, the decline in a number of big states more than made up for it. Kerala recorded the biggest decrease in absolute terms, with this week's tally of 28,684 cases being 3,528 less than the previous week's count (32,212). The state continued to account for a majority of cases reported in the country, nearly 58% in the current week. At the same time, Kerala's numbers fell by 11% during the week, a higher percentage fall than the national average. Other states and UTs that registered a big drop in Covid cases this week include Odisha (down 15.4%), J&K (16.6%), Bengal (10.4%) and Karnataka (6.5%). In Karnataka, the fall came after four straight weeks of rising cases. On the other hand, several states, particularly those in north, central and west India, have been recording a slow uptick in infections. However, in most of these states, the overall numbers aren't high yet. The exception this week was Maharashtra, where a three-week trend of declining cases was broken, with the state posting a slight spike of 3.5%. Maharashtra reported 5,105 new cases, up from 4,930 last week. Gujarat logged a 42.5% increase in cases. The state recorded 426 new infections as opposed to 299 in the previous seven weeks. Other states reporting a Covid uptick included Delhi (14% rise with 360 cases), Rajasthan (39%, 185 cases), Chhattisgarh (20%, 185 cases), Haryana (40%, 200 cases) and Madhya Pradesh (13.6%, 117 cases). Weekly cases in the twin southern states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana remained more or less flat. Andhra logged a 2.9% increase with 1,106 new cases while Telangana reported 1,329 cases, a rise of 1.2%. Meanwhile, India recorded 2,149 deaths during the week, a 55% dip from the previous week's toll of 4,746. That week's numbers were inflated due to Bihar adding nearly 2,200 old deaths to the toll. As in the last several weeks, Kerala continues to report a substantial number of old deaths. Of the 2,149 fatalities reported in the week, just 632 were recent deaths from Covid. The rest (1,517) were deaths from earlier periods added to the toll, mainly by Kerala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-weekly-covid-cases-dip-to-lowest-in-19-months/articleshow/88245476.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The access to 'positive blood samples' is considered important for development, upgradation and testing of Omicron as it is feared that the existing RT-PCR kits may not detect the mutant strain accurately, experts say. According to WHO, the S gene is not present in the Omicron variant. Existing RT-PCR tests may suggest the presence but not confirm the variant, for which genome sequencing may be further required. "Industry is waiting for the sample to upgrade and test for the strain. The private sector has never had access to the positive samples of any strain of Covid-19 during the past two years. Niti Aayog permitted only government laboratories/ bodies to have access. Industry was asked to send their developed products to ICMR for evaluation," an industry expert told TOI. There have been discussions held between the Centre and industry on a policy which could facilitate the sharing of samples for a faster development of indigenous diagnostic kits, as is the established norm in certain developed countries. Real-world samples and viral cultures are required to verify that test kits continually detect new variants. Pune-based National Institute of Virology has already initiated efforts to isolate and culture the Omicron strain derived from a patient sample. There is at least one domestic manufacturer that is ready with the product to be submitted to ICMR for evaluation, the expert noted. Domestic company Mylab announced that its kits detect coronavirus infection for 12 major variants. "Omicron variant would have no impact on the detection efficacy of our RT-PCR, rapid antigen, and self-testing kits," the company said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/test-kit-cos-seek-omicron-ve-samples/articleshow/88245534.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

All the cases were recorded in people who recently travelled overseas or came from abroad. Maharashtra reported its 18th case when a 40-year-old Nagpur man tested positive for Omicron, a first for the city. Health officials said he had Covid this April, but has not taken the vaccine since he left the country in June, before he could become eligible for the shot. He had travelled to Burkina Faso, a western African country that is not on the list of 'at-risk' destinations, and returned to Nagpur last Sunday via Delhi. State surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said 30 of his close contacts have been traced. All of them tested negative. In Chandigarh, a 20-year-old vaccinated man from Italy visiting his family tested positive for Omicron. He landed in India on November 22 and was found positive for Covid following a test on December 1. He was kept under institutional quarantine and his swab samples were sent for genome sequencing in Delhi. The report received on Saturday night confirmed the first case of the new variant north of Delhi. The traveller was asymptomatic and fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine in Italy. He was tested on Sunday and the report came negative. The patient's seven high-risk family contacts were put under isolation too. Andhra Pradesh recorded its first case of Omicron in a 34-year-old man from Vizianagaram who returned from Ireland via Mumbai on November 27 and initially tested negative. He was cleared to travel to Visakhapatnam, but after learning about his foreign travel history, a repeat test was done by officials in Vizianagaram on December 4. The second report was positive and genomic sequencing detected Omicron. "A third test on December 11 came negative," a health official said. At least 40 of his primary and secondary contacts were tested too. All samples returned negative. Kerala's first Omicron case was reported in Ernakulam in a man who came with his wife from the UK via Abu Dhabi on December 6. His test at Kochi airport was negative, but he showed symptoms later and took another test that returned positive. His wife and mother have tested Covid positive too. Karnataka reported its third patient with the Omicron variant - a 34-year-old man who returned from a business trip to South Africa over 10 days ago. The asymptomatic patient had at least 20 contacts. All of them tested negative. India's first two Omicron patients were reported from Karnataka - a 66-year-old foreigner and a 46-year-old doctor.

He will be “crowned” on Sunday at a temple in Bundi, a former princely state that merged with India in 1948. Brig Hada was decorated with the Shaurya Chakra for anti-terrorist operations in 1999 and the Vishisht Seva Medal for commendable work in the Siachen Glacier area in 2019. His achievements have been prolific — he has commanded the Siachen Brigade, was an NSG commander, had scaled Mt Everest and Mt Lhotse, and he has been a paratrooper and a combat underwater diver. The community decided to choose their king following an impasse over inheritance that kept the Hada Rajputs without a crown for almost 12 years. Ranjit Singh, the son and successor of the last Bundi king, was the maternal uncle of former Union minister and Congress functionary Jitendra Singh of Alwar. Singh is locked in court battles with Avinash Chander Chanana over ownership of the erstwhile royal family’s properties. Property disputes involving Ranjit Singh’s relatives kept the king’s title in abeyance all these years. Parleys with the erstwhile Kota royals, considered Bundi’s big brother, too failed to break the deadlock. The community constituted a "Paag committee" to search for a suitable successor among its members. "Paag" is the turban tied to the successor upon a family head’s demise. "We invited nominations through a social campaign, saying the Bundi Hada community’s ‘Paag’ must get a worthy head. After several meetings and deliberations, a couple of names were shortlisted, which included Shivendra Singh Kapren and Brig Hada," said Arihant Singh, the Paag committee spokesperson. We announced the name (Brig Hada) on December 4," Singh said. The Paag committee, however, clarified that the new king wouldn’t "lay any claim on the former Bundi royal families’ properties". Brig Hada explained the relevance of the title: "It is ceremonial and titular. The person donning the Paag of Bundi is head of the Hada Chauhan clan and ex officio head of all Kshatriyas of Bundi." He referred to a Kerala high court ruling of 2013 that "there was nothing unconstitutional in using royal titles because the 26th amendment in 1971 scrapped the ex-kings and their successors’ rights and privileges, not titles". The primary purpose of having a king, according to Brig Hada, is to "keep the community united and help preserve our history and culture by keeping the tradition alive".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bundi-rajputs-choose-brigadier-as-their-king/articleshow/88215695.cms||Bhanu Pratap Singh

While India has detected 38 Omicron cases so far, it is predicted to replace Delta as the dominant variant in the months to come. Leading virologists argue that even as evidence is collected on need for boosters, the government must prepare to roll it out for the susceptible population. They also said that full vaccination must be accelerated using all means. Booster dose makes a lot of sense and the time for the government to "act is now", Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI. "Why are we being stingy about a dose of vaccine?" he said. "Two shots are for priming the immune system, and that priming effect is likely to wane in six months to a year," he said, adding a booster will increase the immune response exponentially. Echoing Dr John, eminent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, also the former head of the advisory group to the Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortia (Insacog), said that immunocompromised must get boosters on priority. "If they have got two doses, they must get a third dose," he said. But, boosti-ng somebody with a third dose of the same vaccine they have been immunised with previously may not do much good, he said. Upto 90% of the vaccine rollout in India has been with Covishield. "A third dose of Covishield may not do much good as the background vector immunity will not allow the virus to infect very well and raise the spike immunity," he said. In his opinion, mRNA vaccines (developed by Moderna and Pfizer), are good booster candidates. "ZyCov D can be made available as a booster. Even Covaxin can be used as a booster for people who got Covishield and vice Versa," said Dr Jameel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/time-for-govt-to-act-is-now-virologists-on-booster-dose/articleshow/88245561.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A Covid-19 patient may have been simultaneously infected by one of the seasonal coronaviruses like HCoV-229E, which is one of the viruses that cause common cold. The genetic exchanges between the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) that causes Covid-19 and a seasonal coronavirus causing common cold may have given birth to Omicron, the only Covid-19 variant discovered so far with more than 50 mutations, the researchers said. To arrive at the hypothesis, the research team from "nference", a medical data research body based in the US, studied 54 lakh genom-es of 1,523 lineages of Covid-19. It has also found Omicron to be unique in its genetic makeup. "There is a need to understand the function of the Omicron insertion and whether human host cells are being exploited by the novel coronavirus as an 'evolutionary sandbox' for host-virus and inter-viral genomic interplay," the researchers stated in their report. "We compared the mutations of Omicron with prior variants of concern, variants of interest, and all 1,523 novel coronavirus lineages. Omicron's spike protein has 26 amino acid mutations (23 substitutions, two deletions, and one insertion) that are distinct compared to other variants of concern," the research states. The study noted that insertion mutation has not been previously observed in any novel coronavirus lineage other than Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-experts-in-us-canada-nail-mutant-strains-origins/articleshow/88245584.cms||Syed Akbar

Rajasthan, which suffered widespread blackouts due to fuel shortage at its power stations in recent months, has knocked at the Centre’s doors, saying the Chhattisgarh government is stalling plans to start two coal blocks and raise production from two other mines. After repeated requests to the Chhattisgarh forest department for clearance went unheeded, Rajasthan additional chief secretary Subodh Agarwal has sought the intervention of coal and power secretaries Anil Jain and Alok Kumar, respectively. In separate letters to Jain and Kumar, Agarwal has stressed the need for the Centre to weigh in on the Chhattisgarh government to take early action needed to start/raise production from the mines to ensure Rajasthan’s energy security. Agarwal’s letter follows chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s missive to his Chhattisgarh counterpart and party colleague Bhupesh Baghel in October last year. “I would like to apprise you that Rajasthan has invested more than Rs 40,000 crore in thermal power stations installed in the state. These coal blocks fulfil the majority of coal requirements of current as well as upcoming RRVUNL (genco) power stations and are essential to ensure (Rajasthan’s) fuel security … ,” Gehlot had told Baghel in a letter in October last year. The blocks in question are, Parsa, Parsa East, Kanta Basan and Kante Extension in Sarguja district of Chhattisgarh. Three of these blocks were allotted in 2015 to Rajasthan for fuelling 4,340 MW generation capacity. Located in the Hasdeo Arand forest area, the blocks and mines have been in the eye of protests by tribals who in October opposed mining in the area. Agarwal says the Chhattisgarh forest department is yet to give the necessary permission to start the Parsa block — with an estimated production capacity of 5 million tonnes per annum — even after the Centre and forests ministry according Stage-II forest clearance on October 21. For the Kanta East and Kanta Basan mines, Agarwal says the state administration is yet to make the necessary amendment in forest clearance for handing over 1,136 hectares of land approved by the Union green ministry. The additional land is estimated to raise production from the two mines by 40% to 21 million tonnes a year from 15 million tonnes. For the Kante Extension block with an estimated production of nine million tonne a year, Agarwal says the Centre needs to get the Sarjuguda district magistrate to hold public hearings needed for clearance. Rajasthan witnessed blackouts in September and October due to coal shortages. Distribution utilities were compelled to increase power tariffs by 33 paisa per unit for the next three months as the cost of sourcing additional coal from the market and power from the exchanges rose on account of countrywide spike in demand and drop in production. Rajasthan already has one of the most expensive electricity tariffs in the country and the state is facing challenges to keep its power affordable for its tourism sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-shortage-triggers-power-tussle-between-2-congress-states/articleshow/88245765.cms||Sanjay Dutta
---||India||Oppn states giving 'selective' nod for CBI probe: Centre||NEW DELHI: States that have withdrawn their general consent to the CBI to probe corruption cases are selectively giving consent in cases that they want to be investigated by the agency, minister of state in the Prime Minister's Office Jitendra Singh said at the CBI's investiture ceremony on Sunday. Till now, eight opposition-ruled states have withdrawn consent to the CBI in the last few years, alleging vendetta by the central government. Expressing concern over certain states withdrawing their general consent to the CBI to investigate cases, but nevertheless holding on the prerogative to give selective consent where it suits them, Singh called for wider introspection by the polity, the society and the nation at large on whether this was the kind of propriety which was to be followed. He emphasised that these state governments have to come clear and say whether they trust the CBI or not, or they trust it selectively. The minister called upon these state governments to rethink on the decision of withdrawal of general consent and reminded that many cases were also referred to the agency by the states under public pressure, which indicate that people have greater trust in the CBI. Similarly, complex and urgent cases are also assigned to the CBI by the judiciary on many occasions, he added. According to the CBI's statement, Singh asserted that the Narendra Modi government was committed to uphold, preserve and strengthen the independence and autonomy of the agency and all such other investigating institutions. "Irrespective of ideological beliefs, it is the collective responsibility of all to strengthen institutions like CBI, as these institutions also contribute to strengthening the nation's resolve to achieve the ultimate goal of incorruptibility in society," the agency quoted Singh. Singh awarded 47 CBI officials with the police medals for meritorious service. The gold medal for the Best Investigating Officer was awarded to DySP Seema Pahuja. Speaking on the occasion, agency director Subodh Jaiswal said that CBI had identified 75 practices, which needed to be discouraged to enhance efficiency of the agency. CBI had over the years been able to achieve nearly 70% conviction rate, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oppn-states-giving-selective-nod-for-cbi-probe-centre/articleshow/88245846.cms||Raj Shekhar

She had been haplessly looking for her mother. Officials searched for the cub's mother, but there was no trace of her. Since then, forest officials have raised her on their own. Now, the two-and-a-half-year-old tigress has become friendly at the Rani Bagh rescue centre in Nainital and is like a pet for the staff who raised her lovingly and with immense care. She was briefly moved to Nainital Zoo in 2020 to fraternise her with other tigers but was attacked by one of the tigresses. Shikha was then sent back to the rescue centre. "Tigresses like Sikha, who have a jolly, friendly nature, aren't accepted by other big cats in the wild, and may be harmed by them. Looking for easy prey, they turn to human habitats. While we do release animals back to the habitats they were rescued from after treatment, that is not the case with Shikha. She was rescued as a cub and her habitat was burned down. The rescue centre is the only home she knows. At Rani Bagh, she is happy and never misses an opportunity to play with the staff," divisional forest officer Biju Lal said. Lal believes Shikha may have to stay there for good. Dr Himanshu Pangti, who treated the tigress at the centre, told TOI that Shikha was wild and aggressive when she was rescued. But soon she became friendly with the staff who were taking care of her, almost as if they were her family. Shikha loves spending time with her caretakers. She cooperates when medical tests are done, and gladly allows vaccine jabs, say officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tigress-saved-from-burning-forest-turns-into-friendly-pet/articleshow/88245848.cms||---

He's a 34-year-old Bengalurean who returned from a business trip from South Africa over 10 days ago. The man, who is isolated at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute, had at least 20 contacts — five primary and 15 secondary — that have been traced and tested negative. Health minister K Sudhakar confirmed this in a tweet. BBMP special commissioner (health) Dr KV Trilok Chandra told TOI: "He arrived on the midnight of November 29-30. He is asymptomatic and being treated at Bowring hospital. All 20 contacts, including his family members, have tested negative." The new patient, officials said, had tested negative on arrival. "However, he developed a sore throat the next day at home. He was tested for the second time and found to be Covid-19 positive," an official said. His swab sample was immediately sent for genomic sequencing and the result came in late Saturday, another official added. Five of over 5K passengers tested +veIndia's first two Omicron variant patients — a 66-year-old foreign national and a 46-year-old doctor from Bengaluru — were reported from Karnataka. The government drew flak over the foreign national leaving the country after procuring a negative certificate from a private laboratory. Karnataka has been screening all international passengers from ‘at risk' countries and a special officer for surveillance has been appointed. Of over 5,000 international passengers from at risk countries who arrived at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) between December 1 and 10, only five tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/man-who-returned-from-sa-is-ktakas-3rd-omicron-patient/articleshow/88245861.cms||---

In a match of fluctuating fortunes, Aryan, who turns 20 in a few days’ time, held his nerve to retain his IGU All-India Amateur Golf Championship title, defeating Yuvraj Singh, at the Poona Club golf course in Pune.In a humdinger of a 36-hole final in the 120th edition of the match play event, Mysuru’s Aryan scored a come-from-behind victory on the 37th hole. The last amateur to win back-to-back titles was Bengaluru’s S Chikkarangappa, over a decade ago.“Really elated. Nothing like defending a title. This is the first time I am defending a title and am feeling really good about it,” Aryan told TOI. That double actually didn’t look like it would come about, with Aryan staring down the barrel (1-down) while standing on the 18th tee for the second time on the day (the 36th hole). But just like he did against Pranav Mardikar in the last-eight stage, Aryan proved he is a big-match player by coming up with the goods when it really mattered.He reached the green in two on the par-5 and sank a brilliant left-to-right curler from 25 feet for an eagle and pushed the issue into a playoff. He reached the green with his second shot, a rescue from 240 yards, to set up an eagle putt, which he duly converted and celebrated with a fist pump.“Either I show up now or I walk home a runner-up,” Aryan said about his thoughts when he was on the 18th tee box (36th hole). “It was more like a fight for life and I fought hard,” added the Mysuru teenager. On the playoff hole, a par-4, he reached the green and two-putted for a par. Yuvraj, the Western India Amateur champion and one of the most consistent golfers this season, three-putted for a bogey, missing a five-footer to let Aryan walk away with his second straight all-India title.NECK AND NECK BATTLEEarlier, it looked like anybody’s conTest. In a tight match, the lead kept changing hands and neither allowed the other to run away with the title. “Kudos to Yuvraj, he played really well and didn’t make it easy and a small fault of his in the playoff allowed me to clinch the title,” Aryan said. “No better way to finish the season, that too winning the All-India.”Result (final): Aryan Roopa Anand (Kar) bt Yuvraj Singh (Pun) on the 37th hole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/aryan-crowned-all-india-champ/articleshow/88245866.cms||---

The association will hold a press meet on Monday — first day of the Belagavi legislative session — to give details.“We are so disheartened by the government’s indifference that we have no other option but to resort to agitation. It is about a month since we approached the governor, following a petition to the prime minister, yet there is no sign of the administration showing any intent to resolve the issue,” said association president D Kempanna.The association, which has over 1 lakh contractors as members and 51 organisations under its umbrella, had written to Modi complaining that several ministers cutting across departments of PWD, irrigation and urban development are seeking bribe to award contracts, and the kickback amount has risen to 40%. They said these departments have collective dues of about Rs 20,000 crore.The members alleged that the government’s move to entrust Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited to execute contracts is the main cause of corruption and demanded effective policies to check it and an independent judicial probe into the allegations. However, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai asked the chief secretary to investigate and submit a report. “We have zero tolerance towards corruption, but the contractors haven’t substantiated their allegations. We will commission a full-fledged probe if needed,” he had said, adding the government was open to meaningful discussion about all issues in the assembly session.Chief secretary P Ravi Kumar, who entrusted preliminary investigation to UDD additional chief secretary Rakesh Singh, said he received the first of two reports. “The CM will take a call about commissioning a judicial probe,” Ravi Kumar said.However, PWD minister CC Patil suspected politics behind the claims. “I asked for evidence when the contractors met me several times, but they’ve failed to provide it. While we know political elements are behind this and will deliberately raise the issue during the assembly session, the government is ready to face it,” said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/contractors-threaten-stir-over-kickbacks/articleshow/88245867.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||New-age tech to track govt contract vendors||BENGALURU: Amid the kickbacks controversy, the government has decided to use new-age technology to ensure transparency in the tendering process. This is to track every authenticated vendor/contractor before allocating new projects. Over the years, incomplete or pending public projects have resulted in several private firms being blacklisted from applying for government tenders. Yet, the same companies shift their base to other states to apply afresh for new projects and continue to misuse public funds without adequate expertise or track record, sources say. Using crypto technology, the Centre for Smart Governance has developed a vendor blockchain that will keep a chronological record of every vendor/contractor who has registered on the Karnataka e-procurement portal or in any other state, and intends to bid for a project. From providing technological infrastructure to drug procurement and from building roads to constructing dams and laying pipelines, every contractor will be brought on board the blockchain so as to ensure there is transparency when a particular tender is being called for. “When a vendor/contractor is registered on the blockchain, it will be verified and authenticated by the department which has used its services. It will have the vendor’s history and also provide requisite inputs like turnover, capacity and capabilities, which another department is looking for,” said a CSG employee working on the project. Additional chief secretary (e-governance) Rajeev Chawla said: “Authenticating the credentials of vendors during tender evaluation is a complex and time-consuming exercise. We’ve been working on the idea of simplifying this process. Thankfully, emerging technologies like blockchain have opened up opportunities for us to do it.” The government plans to complete the repository of vendors registered on the e-procurement portal after securing their consent. “Once the vendor agrees to be part of the blockchain, all his records will be available to tender-inviting parties. It will also help the vendor prove his antecedents without having to run from pillar to post for a physical completion certificate and letter of recommendation from his previous employer,” said the official. The CSG will try to get on board other state governments and tender-inviting agencies across the country, so that more stakeholders will utilise the blockchain. The government subsidiary has set a deadline of December-end for onboarding the e-procurement portal and the tender process of inviting departments registered with the website, apart from starting to rope in private companies free of cost.“Once the mechanism starts to gain traction, we’ll consider a minimal registration charge to ensure that the model is self-sustained,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/new-age-tech-to-track-govt-contract-vendors/articleshow/88245868.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The request came close on the heels of Group Captain Varun Singh, lone survivor of the IAF chopper crash that claimed the lives of CDS Gen Bipin Rawat, his wife and others, being admitted there for treatment. While sources said the likelihood of the cadaver being used for Singh’s treatment is high, they refused to give details about the recipient and donor as rules prevent them from doing so. “This is the first time a request for cadaver skin came from Command Hospital. The skin bank could provide 1,000sqcm of fully processed skin. If they need more, we can fetch it from skin banks in Mumbai or Chennai,” a source at Victoria Hospital said. Since its inception in March 2016, the skin bank has seen 132 cadaver skin donations, which helped 120 patients suffering from over 30% to 40% burns. The bank was set up as a joint initiative of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Rotary Bangalore Midtown and Ashirvad Pipes. The skin of any deceased person aged above 18 will be intact for six hours after death. During this time, it can be harvested. While there is a popular misconception that skin donation leads to disfigurement of the cadaver, skin bank staff say only skin from the thigh and back is harvested, processed and stored at sub-zero temperature. “From one cadaver, not more than 1,000-1,500sqcm of skin is taken. Hence, to help a person with more than 40% burns, skin from nearly four donors is required,” a doctor said. While cadaver skin grafting on a burns patient does not guarantee survival, it could enable the chances depending on the extent of burns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/command-hospital-gets-cadaver-from-skin-bank/articleshow/88245869.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The 18-year-old took to reading during lockdown and book exchange has become her favourite December activity now. “I was the first to share the book-exchange message this time on social media and I can’t wait to get more books. I have, in fact, added a line asking people to share their preferred genre of books,” she said. What looked like a random social media message has turned into a favourite festive tradition for many city youngsters. Adding to this are book clubs and book lovers, who are back with initiatives that are all about sharing joy. For instance, Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore, a city-based book club, kickstarted its Secret Santa for the year on Twitter. It’s like a normal Secret Santa, but with books. Participants need to fill up a form with all the particulars (including favourite genre) and they will be matched with their Santa via email. The result? On Christmas and New Year, they will receive a book they love from their Santa. Abhiram R, 31, and his friend Radhika Chauhan started the book club in February 2017. Their Secret Santa initiative began in 2019 and it has since grown from a small community of 30-35 people on Facebook to more than 150 people from across the country. According to Abhiram, Secret Santa was started as something for people to bond over. “I knew that everyone would enjoy it, participating in the act of sending and receiving books. The fact that they’re all relatively strangers is a bonus. A real Secret Santa,” he told TOI. The book club, with 2,100 members on Facebook, has monthly gatherings as well. Priyank Nadiger, a business analyst, said he first participated in a Secret Santa organised by a book club in Hyderabad last year. “I got two books and I sent out two as well. It was wonderful to receive gifts. Any positive action in this situation is welcome,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/spreading-the-christmas-cheer-one-book-at-a-time/articleshow/88245870.cms||Farheen Hussain

While CET and NEET counselling for engineering and medical seats, respectively, used to be held parallelly every year, it has not been so this time, leaving the decision-making process extremely tough for students and robbing them of chances of a better seat. Every year, after the first round of engineering counselling, counselling for NEET is held. So students who get medical seats give up their engineering ones, which get back into the seat pool and become available for the second round of engineering counselling. However, this year, with NEET counselling delayed owing to a Supreme Court case, medical students who have written CET are holding on to their seats. “Usually, by the second round of counselling, a few thousands of seats in good colleges come back into the pool and we get a chance at a better college. However, that is not happening this time and we’re losing out on precious seats,” said a student.  Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) has sought the government’s permission to hold a casual vacancy round in January, where these students will get a chance to pick the vacant seats. However, Visvesvaraya Technological University has already released the academic schedule for first year, with classes starting on December 13. Also, students argue that another round as late as in January will not help. “We cannot afford to wait till January to join a college. Two months of classes will be over by then. VTU is already in a hurry to finish portions on time and said there will be 10 hours of daily classes apart from Saturdays. Professional courses are not easy and children can't afford to lose so many classes. We’ll have to give up the chance of a better seat, better placement and better future because of this confusion,” said a parent. Another parent said the seat will come back to the pool if there is an extended round. “...But who’ll wait till then for the seats? None would want to take a chance and will seal seats now. Good seats will go to less meritorious students,” he said. Terming it unfortunate, another student said the government isn’t doing anything to help students. Various agencies – Medical Counselling Committee, Karnataka Examination Authority and Visvesvaraya Technological University – should have worked together,” said a student. A former KEA official said it is up to VTU to now provide bridge courses and extra classes for students who join in late. “The higher education department can also make a change in rules by allowing students to take a transfer between colleges after the extended round. This will benefit students. A little coordination is all that is required,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/neet-counselling-delay-cet-aspirants-missing-out-on-seats/articleshow/88245872.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

It will be an autonomous degree-giving institution which can award doctorates and honorary doctorates, an official said. In September, higher education minister CN Ashwath Narayan had announced that the government would give administrative, academic and financial autonomy to UVCE by accepting Prof S Sadagopan committee report’s recommendations. Bangalore University vice-chancellor Prof Venugopal KR, who was UVCE principal for 15 years, said he’s happy the institution will be autonomous. He said UVCE has been working on developing its academic standards and has also invested in infrastructural development. “We have started BTech in machine learning and artificial learning. We are also offering M-Arch in sustainable architecture and M-Tech in cybersecurity and Internet of Things,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/uvce-set-to-become-autonomous-on-lines-of-iits/articleshow/88245874.cms||---

One of the highlights of the implementation of NEP in Karnataka is the open elective programmes that students are allowed to choose from disciplines other than those they are majoring in. That is, a BSc student can opt for a programme in arts and commerce and vice-versa. This is a feature that is expected to benefit students. While many autonomous colleges have created a good pool of open elective programmes for students to choose from, some others are fumbling in rolling out the initiative. “In many colleges, students are asked to take a subject by lecturers themselves. In one of the popular women colleges in the city, students are asked not to take certain subjects because of shortage of lecturers,” said Apoorva CM, vice-president, All-India Democratic Students Organisation. The problem, a lecturer explained, was with the workload of teachers. If the workload of any department reduces, there is a threat of transfer. Colleges, therefore, try to distribute students in such a way that all teachers get enough workload. “Many students come from rural areas and are unaware of the rights NEP gives them. They may not know which subjects benefit them and are just arm-twisted to take those that colleges will find easy,” another lecturer said. The number of choices in many colleges, especially single discipline colleges — the ones that have only one section— is low. “Government colleges will have limitations in the number of teachers and courses available. Colleges can collaborate and work together to offer these courses. They can tie up with neighbourhood colleges and send students for specific programmes they are looking at. There could be hurdles, but that should not deter us from implementing NEP,” said MK Shridhar, who was part of the NEP drafting panel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/some-colleges-are-forcing-to-choose-courses-students/articleshow/88245875.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Both victims — Narayanaswamy, 38, and Kavya, 28 — were residents of Byagadadenahalli. Police, who set up multiple teams to probe the double murder, suspect Kavya’s husband. Kavya was married to Muthuraj, who lived in a nearby village. The incident took place around 7pm when Kavya’s mother and daughter went for evening walk. “There’s evidence of forced entry and initial findings from the crime scene suggest the victims tried to dress hurriedly; innerwear was found next to their bodies,” a police officer said. Cops suspect Muthuraj, who believed his wife was in a relationship with Narayanaswamy, had learnt the duo would be together on Saturday evening. “He may have taken help from some people for the murder,” the officer said. Kavya’s parents’ house is located on a busy road and neighbours had seen some people fleeing the area in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ex-gp-prez-woman-stabbed-to-death/articleshow/88245876.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Six lakes in Bengaluru will get a new life by December-end||BENGALURU: Rejuvenation work on six lakes coming under BBMP — costing over Rs 16 crore — is likely to be completed by the end of this month. The work mostly includes deepening of lakes, creating diversion drains, forming bund, fencing, inlet and outlet work, and pathway formation. The maximum amount — Rs 4.5 crore — is being spent on Doddakallasandra lake, followed by Gubbala lake (Rs 3.6 crore) and Chunchaghatta lake (Rs 2.7 crore). Rejuvenation of three other lakes — Yelenahalli, Konappana Agrahara and Chikkabasti— costs Rs 1.8 crore each. Lake expert V Ramprasadsaid: “Deepening of a lake means to take it back to its original water-holding capacity. They can’t deepen the lake further than its original capacity. This work is important as lakes are seen as flood-mitigation zones and play a key role when the city receives heavy rain.” There are 202 lakes under BBMP. Of these, 183 are live lakes and 19 categorised as disused or dead. Eighty-five of the 183 live lakes have been developed with the help of grants from the government and BBMP. Development work is in progress on 35 lakes and tenders are yet to be called for 63. BBMP special commissioner (lakes) Shankar Reddy B said: “The process of rejuvenation of any lake starts with a survey to mark encroachments and then storm-water drains. Once the problem of encroachment, SWDs and sewage entering the lake is managed, the process becomes easy.” Over Rs 317 crore has been allocated under the CM Nava Nagarothana grants in the past two years, of which Rs 33 crore has been used by BBMP to develop 13 STPs (sewage treatment plants) near the lakes to maintain water balance during non-rainy seasons. Vijay Kumar, BBMP superintendent engineer for lakes, said, “Small works will be over by the end of this month. The pathway work was delayed by rain. That too shall be done by December-end.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/six-lakes-will-get-a-new-life-by-dec-end/articleshow/88245877.cms||Mrinalini Bhat
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: ‘Woman’ not election reservation category, but a gender, says HC||BENGALURU: If a municipal body ward is reserved for a woman candidate under two different categories in successive elections, it doesn’t amount to repetition of reservation, the high court has ruled. “Woman is not a category, but a gender. The category is either ‘general’ or ‘BCA’. In earlier elections what was reserved for ward number 19 was general (woman). Now it is BCA (woman). If woman is not a category, the categories that are reserved then and now are ‘general’ and ‘BCA (woman)’, which are altogether different,” Justice M Nagaprasanna noted while dismissing a petition filed by Abdulla Khan and five others. The petitioners, who are residents of Sira in Tumakuru district and wanted to contest polls to Sira City Municipal Council, claimed that in the 2013 election, ward number 19 was reserved for general (woman) category, while in 2021, it was assigned to BCA (woman), thus repeating reservation which is not permissible. However, Justice Nagaprasanna, after going through the guidelines issued under Karnataka Municipalities Act, noted that clause 10 clearly stipulates that while distributing seats, the reservation notified in earlier elections should not be repeated in subsequent ones “as far as practicable”. Originally, ward number 19 was reserved for a general (woman) candidate in 2007. In 2013, the reservation was repeated as per an order passed by the Supreme Court since the state government couldn’t frame any reservation policy. In 2018, the reservation was continued and the matter was again taken to the high court. In all, between 2013 and November 25, 2021, there were four notifications (both draft and final) issued and they were all quashed by the high court. Ultimately, on November 25, a notification was issued reserving the seat in favour of BCA (woman), which the petitioners challenged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-not-election-reservation-category-but-a-gender-says-hc/articleshow/88245878.cms||---

Teja’s mortal remains were received at Air Force Station, Yelahanka, on Saturday and kept overnight at IAF Command Hospital before being transported to his village in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh at 5.30am on Sunday. “On behalf of the chief of army staff and other senior officers, including the southern command chief and general officer commanding, Karnataka and Kerala sub-area, wreaths were laid. The convoy under the command of Col Shekar Attri of Parachute Regiment Training Centre moved to Chittoor at 5.30am for the final journey of L/Nk Teja, where his mortal remains will be laid to rest,” a defence ministry official said. Later in the day, a huge crowd gathered at the Andhra Pradesh border to pay respects and moved along with the convoy. Born in 1994 to a humble family, Teja was keen on joining the army at a young age. He joined in June 2013 as a soldier with the Army Service Corps (ASC) where he got basic military training. He was absorbed as PT instructor after completing advance physical training course from Army Institute of Physical Training (AIPT) in Pune. “After extensive contribution to ASC, Teja decided to fulfill his dream of serving in the Parachute regiment and opted for the elite special forces unit. After completing the gruelling training-cum-selection procedure, he adorned the Maroon beret & Balidan Badge in May 2019,” the official said. As reported by TOI earlier, Teja was exposed to counter-insurgency areas of Manipur and Assam and was also posted in extreme high-altitude regions of Arunachal Pradesh during Operation Snow Leopard. “He proved to be an asset for 11 PARA Special Forces and, acknowledging his motivation, grit and determination, he was recommended by his superiors to be personal security officer to the CDS . He joined that position in August 2020. Soon, he was sent to accompany CDS Rawat to Wellington. As his peers would say, Teja had an enthusiasm which was contagious,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/last-respects-paid-to-chopper-crash-victim/articleshow/88245879.cms||---

While Leemon Ravi, 39, a resident of Jayanagar, named four former employees in his complaint, police said they have sought additional documents to ascertain if there is prima facie evidence to suggest the quartet’s involvement. Ravi told police he owns Golden Era Royal Group and the four suspects worked on a project called Uthhan — Empowering Artisans, an initiative where profit from artefact sales goes directly to artisans without involvement of middlemen. His company obtained the artisan database and tied up with the government. He was supposed to sell the products of artisans and transfer the profit directly to them. Ravi alleged the four ex-employees stole the data and then quit the company. “Later, they started their own firm and enrolled the same artisans,” he said. “...We came to know that somebody was approaching our artisans and requesting them to sell their products. We traced their office and realised they had stolen our database. We asked them (verbally and through email) to return our database and compensate our losses. But they did not cooperate and are continuing their business illegally,” Ravi said in his complaint. South CEN Crime police registered a case of data theft, cheating and criminal conspiracy against all the suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bizman-accuses-his-ex-staff-of-data-theft/articleshow/88245881.cms||---

The ruling DMK has convened a meeting of its district secretaries, MPs and MLAs on Saturday, December 18 in Chennai. It has urged all the functionaries to attend the meeting, without fail, a statement issued by party general secretary S Durai Murugan said. While the party has not indicated any agenda for the high-level meeting next week, a senior DMK leader said the urban local body polls would be top of the agenda for the party. “We had a meeting earlier and our leader (M K Stalin) has asked the party functionaries to work hard and ensure 100% victory for the ruling party in the urban local body polls,” the senior leader said. Meanwhile, the principal opposition party AIADMK is busy with its internal party elections and hence yet to begin preparations for the urban local body elections. “Over the next two days, Monday and Tuesday, the party district secretaries will be busy appointing electoral officers to oversee party elections at the level of panchayat unions and municipalities,” an AIADMK insider said. DMK’s ally Congress has already received nominations from aspirants keen to contest the urban local body polls. Actor Kamal Haasan’s MNM has appointed a state-level committee and in-charges for each parliament seat in the state to coordinate and prepare the party for the ensuing elections.

The auto, two mobiles and gold weighing 46 grams — all worth around Rs 3 lakh — were seized from Shivakumar, Darshan, Nagendra and Dodda Veeregowda. Byatarayanapura police haven’t released other details about the four, including their age and place they belong to. The victim was a Girinagar resident, also named Shivakumar. He was riding back home around 11pm and stopped at PES College, where the quartet requested him to drop them off at Laggere. The miscreants later threatened the driver at knifepoint and snatched Rs 9,000 and two mobiles from him. One of the gang members started to drive the auto as the others dragged the victim to the back seat. “Shivakumar noticed some policemen near Nayandahalli junction and screamed for help. The miscreants pushed him out of the auto and sped away,” an officer said.

These pockets have come under the mandatory vaccine rules after The Nilgiris and Virudhunagar districts.  About 365 liquor outlets falling under the administrative jurisdiction of Tasmac in Tiruvallur will be covered. Of these, around 100 within Greater Chennai Corporation limits are also in the limits of Tasmac’s Tiruvallur administration. Such Covid rules for liquor outlets have come into effect in the northern districts for the first time.  A communique from the Tasmac district manager to employees in Tiruvallur discourages them from selling liquor without the production of vaccine certificates. Moreover, a board must be erected before the outlets about the ‘no vaccine, no liquor’ rule, it added. It further said that the development followed the directions of the Tiruvallur district administration.  According to sources in Tasmac, areas such as Porur, Mogappair, Ambattur, Madhavaram and Thiruvottiyur will also be covered. However, the challenge is that there is no facility to verify the authenticity of the certificates. “How will we verify the authenticity of the certificates that is produced by the customer in the absence of any mechanism or guidelines? If we refuse liquor to those not furnishing the vaccine certificates, it will lead only to verbal duel,” a salesman at a Tasmac outlet said. When contacted, officials in the Tiruvallur collectorate said the district administration had not given any specific directions, but Tasmac is following the instructions of the Directorate of Public Health (DPH).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/get-vaccinated-if-you-want-to-buy-booze-in-tn/articleshow/88245887.cms||---

Books by renowned publishers like Penguin, Pearson, Oxford University Press, Orient Blackswan, Elsevier, McGraw-Hill and also local players like Kalyani Publishers will be translated and jointly published by original publishers and textbook corporation under the Muthamizh Arignar Translation Project. Senior professors and translators from colleges and universities have been roped in for the translation project. “In the first phase, we will bring out 50 textbooks in Tamil by June 2022. Another 50 textbooks will be translated in the next phase,” said T Sankara Saravanan, deputy director (translations), Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation. The objective is to make these books available in Tamil to rural students. The international and national publishers' catalogue will mention these books also available in Tamil. “It will ensure that these books stay in print for many years. The publishers also benefit as they will get a new market,” he said. The Tamil books will be made available to the college and university libraries after publication. The higher education department has given a letter stating it will purchase 150 copies of each translated book to distribute to colleges. Individual students and faculty members can also buy these books from the textbook corporation after they are released. T Udhayachandran, who is currently secretary to the chief minister, conceived the translation project in 2017 when he was secretary in the school education department. Academic circles are aware that students have lost the habit of reading during the Covid-19 pandemic over the past two years. To encourage them to read, the textbook corporation will publish small story books with 8-12 pages for various age groups under Ilanthalir Ilakkiya Thittam. “We have divided the children into categories based on their age — 3 years to 5 years, 6 years to 8years and 9 years to 13 years. We have identified children writers in Tamil and given them 50 different topics. Already 50 stories are ready with us now. These story books will be sent to all school libraries,” said Appanasamy M, advisor (publication) Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation. Besides these two projects, famous Tamil books will be translated into English and other Dravidian languages and books from other languages also will be translated to Tamil under the “Thisaithorum Dravidam” project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/170-books-on-engg-medicine-law-agri-to-be-translated-into-tamil/articleshow/88245888.cms||A Ragu Raman

Rawat was on a visit to Defence Services Staff College, Wellington (Nilgiri Hills) to address the faculty and student officers of the Staff Course when the accident took place. The CB-CID sleuths will probe the matter further. Two days back, YouTuber Maridhas was arrested by cyber crime police in Madurai over a controversial tweet he had posted on the Coonoor chopper crash. In the tweet, which he later deleted, Maridhas asked if Tamil Nadu was "turning into a Kashmir" under the current rule. In the tweet, seeming to insinuate foul play in Wednesday's tragedy, he claimed that there were chances of a conspiracy to be formed when people disloyal to the country were to come together and said separatist forces had to be stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fake-news-cases-filed-against-2-pak-twitter-handles/articleshow/88245889.cms||---

But the number of new cases, which increased marginally earlier this month, has been on the decline the entire week. On Sunday, a total of 674 people tested positive across the state. None has been infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19 so far in TN. A brisk recovery rate of more than 98% has helped in further reduction of active cases to 7,723. It was above 8,000 last week. The two disease hotspots -- Chennai (116 new cases) and Coimbatore (102) -- have a test positivity rate (TRP) of 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. This is slightly higher than the state's average figure of 0.7%.

---||Chennai||Chennai: CBI files case against senior NHAI official||CHENNAI: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed a case against a senior National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) official in Tamil Nadu for engaging in a criminal conspiracy with two private contractors -- KNR Constructions and Gayathri-SPL. M Muthudayar, who worked as the project director at NHAI's project implementation unit in Karaikudi, allowed the contractors to claim contingency charges in all the bills without any proof. The accused had cheated the government for nearly four years and caused a loss worth 1.38 crore to the exchequer, according to a First Information Report (FIR) filed by the CBI, Madurai, on December 9 (Thursday). In 2014, NHAI under phase III of the National Highway Development Project (NHDP) awarded the contract work for improvement and augmentation of Thanjavur-Pudukottai section of National Highway 226 to Gayathri-SPL (a joint venture). The estimated cost of this highway project was Rs.158 crore. The contractor was given the task of two-laning the 52-km stretch with paved shoulders and shifting of electric poles en route. The central agency's Anti-Corruption Bureau in Madurai received reliable information from one its local sources that every time bills were submitted to Muthudayar for approval, the contractor claimed 5% of the bill amount as contingency charges.But no supporting documents or justification was made during such claims. Muthudayar had abused his official powers to clear bills thereby making an excess payment worth 62.5 lakh to Gayatri-SPL, according to the FIR. Similarly, Muthudayar did not collect any documents from KNR Constructions, which was awarded the contract for four-laning the Madurai-Ramanathapuram section of National Highway 49. NHAI was made to spend 76.39 lakh in excess.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cbi-files-case-against-senior-nhai-official/articleshow/88245892.cms||---

---||Chennai||Pondicherry halt Tamil Nadu’s winning run||Chennai: Tamil Nadu’s run of three back-to-back victories in the Vijay Hazare Trophy came to a halt when they lost to Pondicherry by 1 run under the VJD method in a rain-affected clash at Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Pondicherry No. 7 Fabid Ahmed’s allround show --- 87* with the bat and 2-22 with the ball --- helped Pondicherry notch up the win. Pondy scored 225-9 and then restricted Tamil Nadu to 204-9 in 44 overs, one shy of the target following a rain intervention. For Tamil Nadu, Washington Sundar starred with the ball – taking 5 for 48. It was the maiden List A meeting between the two sides.Chasing 226, Tamil Nadu remained in the hunt thanks to Dinesh Karthik (65, 7x4, 1x6) and N Jagadeesan (64, 4x4) who added 90 runs for the fourth wicket. Tamil Nadu’s charge was halted by rain for about 10 minutes in the 32nd over and their target was revised to 206 in 44 overs.The subsequent phase saw Tamil Nadu lose the plot as Pondicherry bowlers kept picking wickets at regular intervals. The dismissals of Karthik, Jagadeesan, M Shahrukh Khan (8) and J Kousik (1) pegged Tamil Nadu’s scoring rate and they needed 9 runs off the final over. Pondicherry medium-pacer Sagar Trivedi (1-17) gave away 7 runs as M Mohammed (17) and M Siddharth (4 n.o.) faltered in the final phase of the clash. Apart from Fabid and Sagar, slow-ball bowlers --- Bharat Sharma (2-33), Sagar Udeshi (1-55), Pavan Deshpande (1-27) --- and medium-pacer Subodh Bhati (1-44) too contributed with the ball for Pondicherry. “It was a memorable win for us. Fabid’s innings made all the difference in the first half. In the second half, each one of our bowlers chipped in with wickets and it was a total team effort,” Pondicherry skipper Rohit Damodaran told TOI. The contest, first reduced to 49-overs-a-side due to damp pitch, saw Pondicherry struggling at 83 for 7 in the 23rd over. Fabid’s mature knock, after arriving with his side on 74 for 5, turned the match on its head. Despite losing partners in the initial phase of his 84-ball innings, Fabid found an able ally in No. 11 Bharath Bhushan Sharma (22 n.o., 2x4). The two added 78 runs for their unfinished 10th wicket stand that saw Pondicherry finish with a fighting total. Fabid’s innings contained seven fours and four sixes. Brief scores: Pondicherry 225-9 in 49 overs (Fabid Ahmed 87 n.o.; Washington Sundar 5-48). Tamil Nadu 204-9 in 44 overs (N Jagadeesan 64, Dinesh Karthik 65, Fabid 2-22). Pondicherry won by 1 run using the VJD method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pondicherry-halt-tamil-nadus-winning-run/articleshow/88245896.cms||Prasad RS

Though a policeman managed to reach the scene, the rowdy escaped after threatening him with the same weapon. Police later identified him as Murugan, 24, one of the accused in the murder of history sheeter Mylapore Shivakumar. Murugan is involved in several attempt-to-murder cases, besides assault and robbery cases. After a passerby alerted the police control room about a man creating nuisance and threatening people, Nungambakkam police sent a patrol vehicle to the spot. Head constable Dinesh, who found him drunk, saw him holding a broken beer bottle. Murugan’s threats were peppered with expletives as he was seen confronting both men and women, demanding money. While some of them ignored him, a few women ran away in fear of being confronted by him. Witnesses later told police that even though Murugan saw the head constable in uniform, he continued to threaten people and demand money from them. When the constable confronted him, he turned towards him and issued him a terse warning not to interfere, before moving away. Since the man was holding a sharp weapon and tried to attack him, the head constable moved away. Murugan then escaped from the scene but issued life threats to the cop, asking him not to follow him. A hunt is on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rowdy-out-on-bail-threatens-residents-cop-and-escapes/articleshow/88245898.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: 250 houses along Chembarambakkam reservoir’s channels get eviction notices||CHENNAI: The PWD has issued eviction notices to owners of 250 houses built on three branch channels of Chembarambakkam reservoir in Mangadu village after it was found that blocking of the channels resulted in flooding during the rain. A senior PWD official said the 7-km-long Thanthikal, the main channel, and three branch channels were created 50 years ago for irrigation. Subsequently, with the irrigation area reduced, they began to be used as storm water drains through which surplus water from the reservoir went into the Adyar river. Nearly two decades ago, several houses came up on the branch channels, most of them concrete structures and a few with the terraces covered with tin sheets. “We have identified encroachments on all the three branch channels. Normally, when an eviction notice is issued, the time given to the violator is 21 days. When the encroachment is identified on a water body, as per the Disaster Management Act of 2005 the days given for eviction will be less than three weeks,” the official said. Srinivasa Nagar, Janani Nagar, Selva Ganapathy Nagar, Appavu Nagar, Om Sakthi Nagar and Ambal Balaji Nagar in Mangadu are the residential colonies that have encroached upon the channels, with new layouts created. Some of the residents told PWD officials that they had bought the plots from the local politicians. Now, the residents are in trouble as they had bought the land without verifying its classification, said the official. Last month, when heavy rain lashed the city and its suburbs, almost all these areas were inundated. When the revenue department authorities wanted to visit the areas and evacuate the residents, they had to travel by boat. Even till last week, a sheet of water was found on many roads in these residential areas, said the official. Now, with the help of district administration, the PWD authorities are hoping to evict the people .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/250-houses-along-reservoirs-channels-get-eviction-notices/articleshow/88245899.cms||P Oppili
---||Chennai||Chennai: Postmortem of man who died in custody ordered||CHENNAI: The Madras high court has ordered postmortem of a murder accused who allegedly died in police custody in the presence of a doctor of his wife’s choice. Justice T V Thamilselvi passed the order on a plea moved by S Jansirani, wife of M Srinivasan who was arrested in connection with a murder and lodged in Puzhal central prison. According to the petitioner, she met her husband in prison around 2.30pm on December 9. At 5pm, she was informed by officials that her husband was admitted to Stanley Government Hospital but she was not told the reason. Subsequently, she approached the hospital where a doctor said her husband had died. However, she noticed so many external injuries on the body and suspecting that he had died unnaturally when in custody, she approached the judicial magistrate concerned for a postmortem by a team of doctors including one of her choice. When the magistrate suggested she file an appropriate plea, the petitioner moved the high court. When the plea came up for hearing, R Sankarasubbu, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the petitioner suspected her husband died in judicial custody and that a postmortem should be conducted by a doctor of her choice. Opposing it, additional public prosecutor A Damodaran submitted that postmortem can only be done by a government doctor in the presence of a doctor of the petitioner’s choice. The court then directed a postmortem conducted in the presence of Dr Bekal, head of the forensic Department at Meenakshi Medical College, Kancheepuram, in Stanley government hospital. If postmortem has been performed, a re-postmortem is ordered, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/postmortem-of-man-who-died-in-custody-ordered/articleshow/88245900.cms||---

The detritus would be segregated and sent to recycling centres. The clean-up drive was organized by the Greater Chennai Corporation’s solid waste management contractor, Urbaser Sumeet. Mehmood Sait, the chief operating officer of the company, said after the rain, more than 270 tonnes of plastic and debris had washed ashore near Broken Bridge in the city. “It was segregated and cleared by us but we wanted to create awareness on the segregation of waste and the importance of keeping the beaches clean. So we decided on this drive,” he said. Students from corporation school and city colleges, conservancy staff of the GCC, residents in and around Besant Nagar, corporates and activists took part in the clean-up drive. Gagandeep Singh Bedi, commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation, said only if people and the civic body come together, public places, water bodies and beaches can be kept clean. “We found a lot of shoes, plastic bottles, clothes and plastic waste on the beach. We need to be aware of the roles beaches play in climate conservaion and ensure we keep all waterbodies clean,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/60-tonnes-of-waste-removed-from-besant-nagar-beach/articleshow/88245902.cms||---

The start of negotiations for purchase of old buildings, demolishing them, removing the rubble through the narrow, circuitous lanes in congested localities, rehabilitating the displaced while keeping the intrinsic culture and tradition of Kashi undisturbed, seemed like an improbable job at hand. Recalling the journey, divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board, Deepak Agrawal, said, "Our first test was to ensure that the culture and religious traditions remain undisturbed, as expansion had to take place in a populated area with commercial activities."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/2700-sq-ft-to-5l-sq-ft-how-shrine-area-was-expanded/articleshow/88245923.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Business||Axis, Swift tie up to digitise trade banking||Mumbai: Axis Bank is integrating different digitisation initiatives by government bodies and service providers to extend an end-to-end service to business clients. The bank’s B2B (business-to-business) digitisation efforts are being supported by Swift — a cooperative of global banks that acts as an intermediary between banks and sets standards. “Retail was always a digital story. In businesses, we have seen two years of digitisation take place in two months after the pandemic. The pace of digitisation and adoption has been phenomenal,” said Axis Bank deputy MD Rajiv Anand. He said that even before the pandemic, regulators have been pushing for ease of doing business with the EDPMS/IDPMS (import/export data processing and monitoring system). Among the host of corporate services that are going paperless is the bank guarantee, which is a joint effort with Swift. “At present, a bank guarantee takes two to three weeks to get fully executed from the time it was initiated to stamping and onward submission to the beneficiary. We have partnered with Stock Holding Corporation of India, which in turn has partnered 22 states, for e-stamping of documents. Now with digital, the process can take place in a few minutes,” said Kiran Shetty, Swift’s CEO and regional head for India and South Asia. “We are working with new digital services from providers like Swift to provide a comprehensive solution to clients. We also use the services for improving internal checks as well. For instance, we can check invoices with the GST network. It is about stitching all these services together to provide a better user experience,” said Anand. Besides digitising bank guarantees, Swift is helping the private lender digitise application forms for payment through Asian Clearing Union and other legal forms, which are required under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. Swift is also working with the bank to test out the new environment for cross-border payments (ISO 20022). The new environment is an open standard and allows banks to automate the processes in cross-border transactions and provides them rich data in a structured form that can be fed directly into the bank’s systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-swift-tie-up-to-digitise-trade-banking/articleshow/88244851.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||‘If promoters have skin in the game, cos do well’||Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Finance have done well even as non-banking financial companies were having a rough ride even before Covid. Their borrowers have been repaying and the companies’ loans have grown despite an initial blip amid the pandemic. In an interview with TOI, Bajaj Finserv chairman & MD Sanjiv Bajaj speaks of what sets the company apart... What were the learnings from the pandemic? The pandemic was an event that could not have been anticipated. What we learnt is that the more agile your business, the quicker it can be to adapt. Second, businesses that follow a high level of prudence and did not take on significant risk, either financial or business, ended up sailing through. Third, we realised the need for additional capacity as a financial services business. Fortunately, we did a capital raise in November 2019 and had a significant amount of capital. While we were always digital, the lockdown enabled us to create the next set of capabilities and digitise the physical channel. The lockdown allowed us to undertake zero-base budgeting on our end-to-end processes and eliminate unrequired layers. We realised that while agents are adopting digital, people were still worried about venturing out of their homes. We created a software tool, Smart Assist to help agents and customers with their engagement for life products. It looks like stress in loans is not as bad as feared. Was it customer segment, choice of portfolio or economic recovery? It is a combination of those factors and the fact that our loans are not just a one-off transaction. We are selling on average three and a half products per customer. The customer comes back to us for different loans, digital wallets or insurance products. When there is a relationship, they are least likely to default. The moratorium gave breathing space to SME (small & medium enterprise) customers and liquidity facilities helped. We actively told borrowers of the benefits the government and the RBI were offering. The two- and three-wheeler loan portfolios did face challenges as these are at the lower end of the market and were affected by the lockdown. We had a weekly risk modelling review and made provisions. The RBI has indicated that large cos would be regulated. There is also a suggestion that very large NBFCs should become banks. What are your plans? It is correct that when you get to our size there should be much higher supervision from the regulator. We take that in a positive spirit as it gives us confidence that somebody else is keeping an eye on you. If there are any blind spots that we missed, we get to know from the regulator and we very proactively go and address it instead of defending that. I think regulation will get pretty close to that of banks. One thing I tend to lament is that in times of tight liquidity, we should have a backstop facility available that is similar to banks. We on our own are maintaining a portion of our borrowing in liquid assets. There are multiple pros and cons to becoming a bank. I’m happy with the RBI announcement that as a promoter you can hold 26%. I believe any business does well in the long term if the promoter has skin in the game. Whether we qualify for a banking licence or not, that is not clear. More guidelines will come out later. The question is: In a world where financial services are getting disintegrated, should you be an integrated entity like a bank? Because once you become a bank you cannot reverse the process. You cannot unbind yourself. We will evaluate this again based on what regulation allows us to do. There are several startups and even banks who are disrupting retail lending by automating it... Our advantage over startups is that we have a lakh retail stores that we work with. Competitive strength is the effective combination of physical strength with the capabilities of the digital platform that we are building. That gives us unlimited capacity. We got into the digital part early, we are completely cloud-enabled. We have created Finserv Markets, where banks, NBFCs, insurance companies and car companies can put up their products for customers, and Finserv Health, which is a digital play where we are bringing participants on a solution platform. Many lenders are now chasing the same segment that you are in. What is your strategic advantage? There’s so much opportunity in our country that penetration of these products and services is so low that there is no reason why you should not have 10 other companies. I believe the digital model we have built is unique. The late Nanoo Pamnani (former chairman), our CEOs and I have built a culture that thrives on experimentation and innovation. We encourage people to move across jobs and business functions, we go through an institutional process where we do a rolling five-year strategy plan every year. We convert ideas into projects. This culture plays an important role as a moat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/if-promoters-have-skin-in-the-game-cos-do-well/articleshow/88244828.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Nashik||DCB suggests tax hike to run its sewage treatment plant||Nashik: The cash strapped Deolali Cantonment Board (DCB), which is finding it difficult to even pay the salaries to its employees, is now facing a financial burden of running the sewage treatment plant set up at a cost of around Rs 60 crore in August last year. While the sewage treatment plant and underground sewerage scheme have helped in eliminating the open gutters in the cantonment town, some of the Deolali camp residents have vehemently opposed the board’s proposal to hike the tax to meet the maintenance cost of the plant. The board has proposed a tax hike of Rs 150 per month for the residents and Rs 250 for commercial establishments, effective from April 1. The senior officials of the cantonment board said that the underground drainage system and the sewage treatment plant have not only helped in removing the open gutters but have even prevented the pollution of the Darna river. The cantonment board officials said that though the sewage treatment plant and underground drainage system have been installed from the government funds, maintenance is the board's responsibility. Rahul Gajbhiye, the CEO of the cantonment board, said they are trying to resolve the issue by convincing the residents for implementing the tax hike. Other board officials also said that the board is not in the capacity of meeting the expenses of the sewage treatment plant as it is struggling to even pay monthly salaries to its employees at its different branches, schools, hospital, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dcb-suggests-tax-hike-to-run-its-sewage-treatment-plant/articleshow/88243188.cms||Santosh Sonawane

As part of the initiative, ABTO has given the responsibility to Amene Shirazi Nejad, a research scholar of Buddhist studies at Delhi University, to build tourism relations between Iran and India. The Buddhist darshan yatra is expected to create employment opportunities for the locals besides boosting tourism. On Sunday, the concluding day of the ABTO’s three-day conference on ‘2,566 years of Buddhism: Its relevance today’, participants discussed the measures for tourism promotion and creation of employment opportunities. ABTO founder secretary general Kaulesh Kumar said, “It was decided that ABTO will start a monthly online course on Buddhist tourism for free. Apart from those related to tourism industry, others can also join the course and explore employment opportunities in tourism sector.” He added, “ABTO will write to the Union tourism ministry requesting it to increase the number of iconic cities from 10 to at least 100.

Now, a few HR professionals are trying to help qualified women return to the job market, offering them counselling, training and placements. Chennai-based indePenn Connections, a HR startup from IIT Madras Research Park, was incorporated in December 2019 by Rajani Seshadri and Rani Muralidharan. By the time it started operations in May 2020, the pandemic was already raging in India. "The pandemic and the lockdown changed the dynamics of women wanting to return to work," says Seshadri. "On one hand, they were left with more responsibilities of online schooling, husbands working from home, elder care and domestic chores. On the other hand, it opened up opportunities for remote work since, in some instances, the husband lost his job and her income became a necessity rather than a luxury." Over the past 18 months, indePenn has "opened the eyes" of more than 500 women to the possibilities of a second career. "Approximately 200 women have attended our online group learning programmes and nearly 100 have gone back to work, many of them from technology, finance, HR, education and marketing backgrounds," says Seshadri. While 60% are from IT Services and technology, there is a lot of buzz around Digital Marketing as well. The pandemic has presented some opportunities too. Says Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president, Avtar Group: "Post-Covid, the situation has become more heartening in terms of women’s careers. The boom in IT hiring witnessed between July and September of this year, with the same candidate receiving multiple offers, leading to intense ghosting by selected candidates, also fuelled the need by companies to engage second career women." According to Rajesh, in the period between July and September 2021, Avtar, which facilitated re-entry of around 75,000 women in the past 15 years, received about 4,250 applications from second career women on its portal myAvtar.com. Around 60% of these women had breaks ranging from three to eight years. "About 25% of the applicants were women with breaks less than one year; 15% were early career women whose breaks were of less than two years. Another silver lining is that employers, who would earlier hesitate to invest in returning women due to concerns that ranged from ‘fitment’ to questioning their commitment to their careers, are now launching programmes for this segment, says Seshadri. There is still a gap in what is offered and what’s needed, yet this is a good beginning in the post-Covid era.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/helping-women-get-back-on-career-path-after-two-trying-years/articleshow/88243610.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Prakash Shah, chairman of the trade promotion and business development committee of BCCI, had written to Vikram K Doraiswami, Indian high commissioner in Dhaka, as there are reports that business visa is not entertained at Benapole-Petrapole border since December 8. Shah pleaded the envoy to allow the business delegates with business visa to come through the Petrapole-Benapole border. A source said the Bangladeshi participants are mostly traders who deal in garments, including Jamdani sari. The BCCI official pointed out that some of the Bangladeshi traders, who had been granted business visa, had been asked to take the air rout, but it might be difficult for them fly to the city before December 17. An official said that the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) under the commerce ministry of Bangladesh had written to the Indian high commission to facilitate the Bangladesh delegates in the trade fair as they are co-exhibitors of the EPB in the trade fair. However, Indian high commission officials refused to comment on the matter. An immigration official said the matter is likely to be resolved soon. FRRO K T Bhutia, too, refused to comment. The trade fair is scheduled to be held from December 17 to January 2 at Science City. Bangladesh is the partner country this time to celebrate 50 years of Indo-Bangla friendship. There are 14 other countries and 21 state governments which are going to participate in the trade fair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bangla-delegates-to-trade-fair-face-petrapole-visa-firewall/articleshow/88244490.cms||---

The accused were identified as Vinay Kumar alias Pandu, Abubakar, Venkata Subbaiah, Isaac Waman Jor Sheikh, Mohammad Ishaan, and Bonta Nitin. Addressing a press conference, Guntur Urban superintendent of police A Arif Hafeez said local police received credible information on Sunday that the gang members were shifting ganja from one vehicle to another. Cops reached the spot but by that time, the accused had started to flee from the scene. Cops said they managed to intercept one of the cars and arrested three people while two others fled from the spot. Cops said the accused procured the ganja from the Agency area in Vizag and were planning to sell it to states like Karnataka and Kerala with the help of Abubakar, a dealer based in Mangaluru. Hafeez said 50 kilograms of ganja, 100 bottles of liquid ganja, five cell phones and a car were seized. A case was registered under relevant sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Cops said further investigation is on to nab the other accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/interstate-ganja-smuggling-gang-busted/articleshow/88243834.cms||---
---||Business||Seafood high on export menu||Chennai: Braving the choppy waters the sector faced globally, seafood exporters in Tamil Nadu had a decent haul in the first seven months of this fiscal. They earned $758 million in exports, nearly 80% of the $973 million export target set for 2021-22 by the Centre. This despite the Covid-inflicted troubles that had hit production, the steep increase in freight cost, the non-availability of refrigerated containers on time due to cartelisation by shipping lines, not to mention China conducting nucleic tests on seafood imports from India. It’s a labour-intensive industry, employing mostly women – the 40-odd seafood exporters in Tamil Nadu employ more than 30,000 people. But despite a 1,076km coastline, Tamil Nadu accounts for a mere 15% of the total $7.8 billion Indian seafood exports targeted for this fiscal. "The new DMK-led government in Tamil Nadu is proactive. It has identified seafood exports as one of the ‘champion’ sectors for boosting exports and helping the state achieve its $1 trillion economy target by 2030. We made a detailed presentation to finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan. He and fisheries minister Anitha Radhakrishnan have promised all support for us," says K V V Mohanan, Tamil Nadu president of the Indian Seafood Exporters’ Association. Tamil Nadu’s 15% share of seafood exports includes transfers from Andhra Pradesh through the Chennai port. Aquaculture (mostly shrimp) contributes almost 70% of the export kitty, with capture fisheries accounting for the rest. Aquaculture production in TN has been dropping for the last few years, while other states such as Andhra Pradesh have upped output. The hatcheries sector, which originated in Chennai, has fallen victim to extortion by anti-socials with political support. As a result, the industry went virtually into hibernation over the past 10 years in the state, the industry delegation told the ministers. "This government is keen to develop the marine seafood industry. I have asked the associations for hatcheries and aquaculture farmers to come forward and draw an action plan along with the exporters to enable the industry to tap its vast potential. As such, the problems for the industry are not with the government, but with local miscreants turned extortionists," says Elias Sait, secretary general, Indian Seafood Exporters’ Association. He cites a recent case, where a seafood exporter received all necessary approvals in one month from this government to establish a factory near Arambakkam, close to the TN-AP border to process fish. But a few miscreants created a furore and the exporter is now forced to approach a court, despite local officials coming out in his support, to begin operations. Seafood exports can surge if Tamil Nadu can add another 8,000 acres for aquaculture in the next three years, allotting land to poorer sections, especially the fishermen community, say industry experts. The government should also help them get loans and offer subsidies to help them adopt the latest techniques in aquaculture. This can boost shrimp production to 50,000 tonnes per annum, from last year’s 20,000 tonnes.  "Andhra Pradesh (Seemandhra) has effectively put to use almost 95% of land identified as suitable for aquaculture. In Tamil Nadu, a mere 16% of the available land is being used. The potential for growth is huge," says Mohanan. Industry experts say that marine product exports from Tamil Nadu can touch rs 15,000 crore and more in the next five years from the Rs 9,000 crore expected this year. "But we are facing problems on twin fronts. High diesel prices, despite state government subsidy, have limited the number of boats venturing into sea and continuing depletion of marine resources has cut the catch by half," says D B Ravi Reddy, treasurer, Seafood Exporters Association of India. He says indiscriminate fishing, which hauls in juvenile fish too, has contributed to the depletion of the catch. The cost of power to run cold storages in Tamil Nadu is also five times more than in some other coastal states. The industry has to overcome this ‘double whammy’ to sustain exports at existing levels. It has urged the state to introduce aquaculture parks, offer latest tuna fishing technology and encourage cage culture and sea ranching to replenish the catch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/seafood-high-on-export-menu/articleshow/88243711.cms||D Govardan
---||Business||Rest insured, he is a star in his own right||Chennai: At 12:30pm every day, all meetings withVenkatasamy Jagannathan come to a pause for a few minutes. That’s when the chairman and founder of India’s largest medical insurance company Star Health samples the lunch served to his staff. "Providing tasty and quality lunch to colleagues is the most important thing for me," he says. Born at Nagampatti, in the then Tirunelveli district in an agrarian family, Jagannathan went to Caldwell Higher Secondary School in Tuticorin and later to MDT Hindu College. Education brought him to Chennai for his bachelors in economics at the Government Arts College and later took him to Annamalai University for post-graduation. "I scored a second rank there," he recalls. He joined Hercules Insurance as a trainee officer in 1969 for a monthly pay of Rs 450. "I completed the two-year training in six months," he says. Nationalisation of insurance companies had Hercules merging with United India. As a student of insurance in United India, Jagannathan rose up the ranks to be the CMD, a post he held till his retirement from the company in 2004. "Then I wanted to start something on my own. I identified medical insurance as a big opportunity for two reasons: corporatisation of medical care and a huge middle class which will need quality care at affordable cost," he said. Just around the time the ETA group was scouting for business opportunities. And Star was born in May 2006, partly with his retirement corpus and the rest funded by his partner. Being a standalone health insurer gave it sharp focus on business and in-house claims settlement without any third party administrators. "I didn’t want to read the pulse of my client from a third party; instead I wanted to get the reading first hand. It helped us negotiate better with hospitals and also gave me better control on claims," he said. Early on, it was all about building confidence among the public. Star signed up for government health insurance first for Andhra Pradesh and next Tamil Nadu. "When people saw governments trusting Star, the mind battle was won," he says. Business flew high, investors flocked and the fairy tale continued. The company launched medical cover for those who suffered heart attacks, for cancer care and for senior citizens. "We grew at 36% last year and my hope is to grow faster than the industry," he said. The real vault came when Star completed its public float earlier this month and the insurer was valued at $7 billion or Rs 50,000 crore. However, the share sale price and the concerns over Omicron have resulted in a tepid response from investors. The shares were listed last Friday and closed at Rs 907, above the issue price of Rs 900 apiece. In a year, nearly seven million get medical insurance cover from Star. "Rising healthcare costs makes medical insurance imperative," says the 77-year-old chairman. Star today has 750 branches, 250 one-man offices, 14,000 employees and five lakh agents. For Jagannathan, free time is movie time. "I watch movies at home whenever I find time." Future plans? "I will be with Star as long as the management wants me. I think I have some years left," he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rest-insured-he-is-a-star-in-his-own-right/articleshow/88243658.cms||Rajesh Chandramouli

But, rain in November has hit the chilli produce hard and the market is receiving low-quality chilli. The market gets chilli from Haveri, Gadag, Ballari, Dharwad, Raichur, Bagalkot, and in the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana every year. But heavy rain in these areas in November has affected arrivals to the market. Normally, the market is witnesses heavy rush in November – December. But this time, the chilli reaching the market is of low quality and the volume is also less. The rain has cased fungus to grow on the chilli. The Byadagi chilli, famous for their bright red colour, have turned pale due to fungus, adding to the farmers worries of getting a decent price for their produce. Byadagi chilli market is famous for Dabbi and Kaddi varieties of chillies, which are in huge demand as oleoresin oil is extracted from them and exported. While the Kaddi variety is gnarled thin and long with not many seeds, Dabbi is small and plump with more seeds. The plump variety is used by the lipstick industry. But this season the market has been receiving low quality chilli and with poor colour, making the extraction of oleoresin oil a big challenge to industries. “Due to excessive rain across the chilli-growing area, farmers, traders, labourers, commission agents and thousands of people depending on the Byadagi chilli market are in a critical situation. The heavy rain destroyed chilli crop drastically and now fungus has hit the available produce. The chilli has turned white. Such low-quality produce never gets a good price. The state and Union governments should extend help to chilli growers,” urged Sureshgouda Patil, president of Treaders Union, Byadagi Chilli Market, and former MLA. Anil Kumar, a trader in Byadagi market, said, “We were expecting more quantity of chill than the previous season, but heavy rainfall has affected quality and quantity also. We are hoping, we get good quality chilli in the next couple of weeks.” “The rain has hit Byadagi chilli hard, but the season is only starting. We hope quality chilli becomes available from several parts in the coming weeks,” said shared Adappa, secretary of Byadagi APMC.

Making the announcement after flagging off two vans during the inauguration ceremony of ‘Eat Right Carnival’ at Gomti Riverfront on Sunday, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma said, “During the carnival, food vendors and people will be informed about healthy food. Mobile food testing vans will help traders as well as common people in checking adulteration.” “Earlier, food test reports at authorised labs used to take 2-3 weeks, but now results will be made available the same day,” said Sharma. The seven-day carnival will host zumba and yoga classes daily in the morning and a cultural show in the evening. During the day, several programmes to make people aware of food safety, health, right diet and hygiene will be organised. Several stalls related to food, clothes and items of general use will be set up. The carnival is open to all and the entry is free. Mobile food testing vans are being run by the food and drug safety department and will be stationed at the carnival for seven days before being deployed in prominent markets on rotation basis. Minister for water resources, Mahendra Singh, said: “Our government cares for the people and has launched this carnival to help people adopt healthy lifestyle. Mobile food testing vans will be available in every city of UP by 2024.” Law minister Brajesh Pathak said the BJP government was the first to think about street vendors and to organise this carnival. “Eating right food is one of our rights and this carnival is meant for it,” he added. Food carts equipped with a stove, fire extinguisher, solar panels and containers were also distributed among street vendors. BOX 2,000 participate in 5km walkathon A 5km walkathon was organised from Gomti Riverfront as part of the carnival on Sunday morning. The event was flagged off by Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia in which over 2,000 people, mainly students and NCC cadets, participated. Bands of UP homeguard, police and Seema Suraksha Bal played music while escorting participants. Due to mismanagement of traffic by the police, vehicles were allowed to move on the walkathon route which resulted in chaos for some time. Homeguards personnel streamlined the traffic by restricting vehicular movement to a single lane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/eat-right-carnival-opens-with-food-yoga-health-tips-on-platter/articleshow/88245073.cms||---

Officials said they are targeting the month-end for completion of all works currently in progress at various locations in the city. While Mumbai is known to have had 15 milestones, five of these have gone missing. The BMC is replacing them with similar black basalt milestones. A major challenge is ensuring underground cables are not damaged while digging for the restoration of the milestones, said officials. Milestones were missing at Kalbadevi road, Dr Mascarenhas road, Mazgaon, near Lady Jamshetji road, as well as Kathuria Marg junction in Mahim West. The milestones, which once marked distance, will now mark the history of the city. QR codes will be placed beside each of the stone markers, which people can scan for information on the history of the milestones. The zero milestone, which is at St Thomas’ Cathedral, will have an information plaque with a map of all the other mileposts in Mumbai, along with details about them. The milestones fan out across the north of the city from St Thomas’ Cathedral and were originally about 3-4ft in height but their bottom halves are now buried under our ever-thickening pavements. Rahul Chemburkar, conservation architect from Vaastu Vidhaan Projects, whose firm is working with the BMC on the project, said, "It is difficult to set a final date by when works will be completed but we are targeting to finish by the month-end. We are trying to depict the era which the milestones originally belonged to, for instance, by making use of cobblestones around them, and inscribing ‘Mumbai milestone’ on a granite strip around it. There is also a plaque planned, which will have QR codes that can be scanned. The final aim of restoration is to knit all of these markers into a heritage circuit.” Sanjay Sawant from the BMC’s heritage cell department confirmed that works on restoration of the milestone are in full swing and should be completed shortly. “Works on restoration of all the milestones were taken up together. One of the milestones originally meant to be at Lower Parel had been shifted into Badhwar Park in the Machchhimar Nagar area of Colaba. We brought it back and reinstalled it," said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-restoration-of-british-era-milestones-nearly-done/articleshow/88245696.cms||Richa Pinto

Measures suggested by the government to prevent spread of the virus, such as wearing mask and maintaining social distancing have gone for a toss in the city. Even NITI Aayog member V K Paul, who is part of the Centre’s core team for Covid-19, has raised concern over the decline in use of masks in the country. Taking reference from the data of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which stated that mask use has dropped below 60% in India at present, Paul cautioned that the country has come to the “danger zone”. Even in Bihar, including Patna, use of masks has declined drastically. Hardly 10% to 20% of people can be seen wearing masks at railway stations, bus stands, vegetable markets and other public places. Former IMA president Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said Covid protocols are not all followed by people in Bihar. “People have become fearless and the kind of behaviour they are showcasing, it will result in a big trouble by February,” Dr Rajiv said, adding ensuring implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour is no more a priority even for the administration. “People have become careless because of no punitive action. Those not wearing masks at public places should be penalised. Along with prohibition, the government should also focus on strict implementation of Covid guidelines,” he said. Nodal incharge for Covid-19 at AIIMS-Patna, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the careless behaviour of people would cost the entire state. “People are actually not anticipating the threat. People had forgotten Covid-appropriate behaviour after the first wave and the result was there for everyone to see as the second wave of pandemic wreaked havoc in the state.” State chief secretary Tripurari Sharan said the government has been trying to implement Covid guidelines and issuing necessary directives in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-warn-people-against-violating-covid-19-guidelines/articleshow/88243311.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Police sources said poll rivalry was the prime reason for the killings. The dead ward member was identified as Sanjay Verma (48), who was elected from ward number nine of Jamalpur panchayat under the Naubatpur police station area. He was shot dead near his house in Lodipur village around 11pm. Police said Verma was shot twice in the head and one empty cartridge of 7.65mm was recovered from spot. At Bajitpur village in Barh, newly-elected Purvi Pandarak panchayat mukhiya Gorelal Yadav alias Priyaranjan (45), ASI Rajesh Kumar (47) posted in Pandarak police station and one Lalbabu Das (50) were attacked by two motorcycle-borne criminals near the gate of a marriage hall around 11.15pm. Police said the three, who had received bullet injuries, were rushed to Barh sub-divisional hospital. They were later shifted to a private hospital in Agamkuan where the mukhiya and the ASI died. Das died around 1pm on Sunday. Yadav hailed from Gopkitta and Das from Mamrakhabad villages under the Pandarak police station area and the ASI was from Nawada district. SHO of Barh police station Sanjeet Kumar said the three had come to the marriage hall to attend wedding of a trader’s daughter. “The ASI and the mukhiya were standing next to each other at the gate of the wedding venue. Das was also standing nearby when two bike-borne criminals opened fire. They wanted to kill the mukhiya, but the ASI and Das also got shot,” he said. The SHO added 13 to 15 rounds were fired by the criminals. “People chased the shooters, forcing them to escape by leaving their bike. The criminals wanted to kill mukhiya over a political rivalry,” he added. Meanwhile, SHO of Naubatpur police station Samrat Deepak Kumar said Verma was returning home on foot after attending a marriage function when he was shot dead near his house by the criminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mukhiya-cop-among-4-killed-by-criminals/articleshow/88243384.cms||Debashish Karmakar

The body of the tigress was found in a farmland near Chakarsan village under the Manpur police station area within Manguraha forest range in VTR, Bettiah. The forest department team took the body of the tigress into custody. The autopsy was performed in the presence of VTR director-cum-conservator of forest Hemkant Rai, other forest officials of Gobardhana, Raghia forest ranges and SHO of Manpur police station Vikash Tiwari at Manguraha forest headquarters on Sunday. Rai said prima facie, it appears that the tigress died about two days ago. “No wound or injury marks were visible on the body of the tigress. The carcass was recovered and sent for autopsy on Sunday and all the body parts were intact. The tigress had given birth to two cubs,” he said. The death of the tigress was reported to the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)-Delhi and Regional Office Guwahati on Sunday. Later, the body was disposed of as per NTCA protocol. Viscera will be sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) at Bareilly and Wildlife Institute of India (WWI) at Dehradun for forensic tests. Locals have raised suspicions that the tigress might have died by consuming poisonous food or due to snakebite. The VTR officials, however, are tightlipped about the cause of death. According to sources, the tigress strayed off from the forest and entered Chakarsan village, where her body was found. The incident came to light on Saturday evening when some villagers was passing by a farmland. They smelled the foul stench coming from the isolated farm and found the dead tigress. Forest range officer Sunil Pathak was informed by villagers on Saturday evening. As per official figures, the population of tigers in VTR is in the range of 28-37 with a density of 2.5 tigers per 100km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/10-year-old-tigress-found-dead-in-vtr/articleshow/88243429.cms||Tirthraj Kushwaha

The positive cases were detected from 4,316 samples tested in the last 24 hours. The new cases have been reported from Gotri, Atladara, Bhayli, Tandalja, Siyabaug, Jetalpur, Fatehpura, Ramdevnagar, Manjalpur, Gorwa and Makarpura areas of the city. The west zone of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), from where seven patients have tested positive, has registered the maximum new cases followed by two each in east, north and south zones of VMC. Vadodara rural has seen addition of one new case. Doctors in the city said that Covid-19 cases are rising because of the festive season and vacation period apart from the ongoing marriage season where get-togethers are increasing. “Unlike March-April, when people were religiously following Covid-19 protocols, wearing proper masks, following social distancing norms and proper use of sanitizers, now get-togethers are happening without Covid-19 protocols,” said Dr Hiten Kareliya, infectious disease specialist. “People have also started taking flu symptoms like cough-cold lightly. Chances of Covid-19 are high when people are already having congestion in the throat and lungs because of cough and cold,” he said. Dr Niraj Chawda, MD, Nand Hospital said, “Though the symptoms of the new Covid cases are not serious or require hospitalization, people need to be very careful in following the mask, sanitization and social distancing. Also, it’s too early to say if the symptoms are mild or severe but people should not let their guards down. Vaccination is the key to avoiding severe symptoms.” With the addition of 14 new cases, Vadodara district’s total number of Covid-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic has touched 72,425. As per the health bulletin shared by the VMC, the city and the district have not registered any Covid related death in the last 24 hours and the official death stands at 623. With four patients discharged from hospitals, the total number of recoveries stands at 71,718. Currently, there are 84 active cases in the city and district of which the condition of 81 patients is said to be stable while three patients are being treated with oxygen support.

The BEEP, a bilateral cooperation project between the Union Ministry of Power and the Swiss government, is being implemented by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in coordination with APSECM. The BEEP is conducting training on Eco-Niwas Samhitha to around 13,000 engineers and employees in housing and village/ward secretariat departments in a phased manner. In view of the forthcoming national seminar on energy conservation building code - residential buildings’, special chief secretary for housing department Ajay Jain conducted a review with officials. He said that the state government is committed to implement global energy efficiency measures in 28.3 lakh houses with the support of Indo-Swiss BEEP. “Utilising the energy efficiency building designs in construction of houses is only an option, but not mandatory for the beneficiaries. The energy efficient designs are expected to help to save 20 per cent energy in houses,” said Ajay Jain. As per the estimates, about Rs 33,000 crore will be spent on the creation of permanent infrastructure in YSR Jagananna Colonies that includes roads, drains, water supply, electrification, underground internet cabling, etc. The electrification works alone need about Rs 7,080 crore. Ajay Jain discussed the Indo Swiss programme with the managing director, housing, Narayan Bharat Gupta, and special secretary, Rahul Pandey. Jain said that the state government has taken up construction of 15.6 lakh houses in the first phase with an estimated cost of Rs 28,000 crore. “Works have begun on 10.72 lakh houses in 10,055 layouts. In order to promote construction, 245 godowns will be set up at major housing layouts to make materials easily available for the beneficiaries. Already 11 godowns have been set up across the state,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/infra-worth-rs-33k-crore-to-come-up-in-housing-layouts/articleshow/88243816.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Tetrapod seawall project registers little progress||KOCHI: The tendering of tetrapod seawall project at Chellanam has reached nowhere as the decision to award the contract to Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), the only eligible bidder, is pending.  The estimated cost proposed by ULCCS in its bid was 13% higher than the tender estimate and the government is yet to approve it. The delay in awarding the contract would delay the works, which is expected to be completed before the monsoon. Residents said that if the seawall is not constructed at least in those places which are most vulnerable to sea erosion before the monsoon, the sea will wreak havoc along the coast. Earlier there were reports that ULCCS would bag the multi-crore project as the only other bidder, Thrissur District Labour Contract Cooperative Society (TDLCCS), got disqualified as they did not meet the eligibility criteria. Sources with Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC), which floated the tender, said that the estimated project cost proposed by ULCCS was around Rs 30 crore higher than the KIIDC’s tender estimate of Rs 254.2 crore. Amid the protests by the residents and allegations of delay in implementing a comprehensive solution to the sea erosion issues at Chellanam coastal village, KIIDC floated the tenders for the reformation of damaged sunken seawall using tetrapods by the end of October. In the first phase of the project, seawall will be constructed at a length of around 7km in between CP stones 986 and CP 1026 at a cost of Rs 254 crore under KIIFB funding. “Though irrigation minister Roshy Augustine said that the work would begin soon, even the tendering is not completed. In the past too government made several promises and launched many projects to stop sea erosion but nothing has fructified so far. Many houses near to the sea will not survive another monsoon,” said Care Chellanam coordinator Jinson Veluthamannungal. Meanwhile, the high court has issued an interim order making Ernakulam District Legal Services Authority a party in PIL filed by Chellanam residents seeking permanent solution to sea erosion woes. This is to monitor the developments of various measures taken by the irrigation department at Chellanam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tetrapod-seawall-project-registers-little-progress/articleshow/88244499.cms||---

The counting of votes will start at 8 am on Tuesday. All the six constituencies are sitting seats of the ruling TRS. The Congress in Khammam and a TRS rebel in Karimnagar have claimed to have got votes of TRS elected representatives too. If the ruling party wins, its tally of total 34 members in the 40-member legislative council will remain intact and the upper house in the state will continue to be without much opposition as is the case with the state assembly. Among others who won on other parties’ and union tickets are two from the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), two from PR Teachers Union, one from Congress and an independent, who are members of the council. Though backward classes welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar has exuded confidence that the TRS will win both the MLC seats under local authorities’ constituency quota in Karimnagar, victory celebrations by former mayor Sardar Ravinder Singh who resigned from TRS and contested as an independent has raised the curiosity of the people over who will win. Ravinder was backed by the BJP. The saffron party did not enter the electoral fray directly. On the other hand, reports of cross-voting in Khammam too has made the contest interesting there. Congress Khammam town president Mohammed Javed told TOI that the votes of CPI and CPM were split between the Congress and TRS, while TDP votes were polled in favour of the Congress. “Our strategy worked out well and we are confident that a large number of disgruntled TRS voters too gave their vote to the Congress. It should not come as a shock even if the Congress pulls off a victory in Khammam MLC seat under local authorities constituency quota,” he said. However, transport minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar has said that the TRS will win the seat with comfortable majority. The Congress is expecting to get a decent number of votes in Medak with TPCC working president T Jayaprakash Reddy having announced that he would resign from his party post and continue as a party member and MLA if his wife Nirmala Reddy, who is in the electoral fray, fails to poll at least 230 votes. Of the total 12 MLC seats for which poll notification was issued, six were elected unopposed. Polling was held to six MLC constituencies including one seat each in Medak, Adilabad, Nalgonda and Khammam and two in Karimnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/congress-pins-hopes-on-cross-voting-in-mlc-polls/articleshow/88245087.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Business||Watsa’s Fairfax keen to hold on to stake in CSB||MUMBAI: Promoters of CSB Bank, the Fairfax Group owned by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa, would like to hold onto their 51% stake in the bank for as long as possible and increase it if allowed, the bank’s CEO said. The RBI last month relaxed shareholding norms for private banks by doing away with intermediate milestones and increasing the maximum long-term shareholding to 26% from 15%. “Originally, the stipulation was that promoters cannot dilute below 51% for the first five years. The second time there was a requirement that the stake needs to be diluted to 40% by the year 2024 and 30% in 10 years and 15% after 15 years. The new rules allow promoters to hold 26% forever and the in-between milestones have been removed,” said CSB Bank’s MD & CEO, CVR Rajendran. Rajendran said that the bank’s shareholders were long-term investors and willing to put in additional funds. The 100-year-old bank has begun reinventing itself as a new-generation bank after the takeover by the current management. The Kerala-headquartered bank has had to deal with staff unrest over wage revision. Rajendran said that while the unions have stuck to their demands, they have not accepted any of the conditions put forward by the bank management. However, a significant proportion of the transactions have now migrated to digital channels. Rajendran said that the currently the bank has a relatively small balance sheet and can target only small and medium corporates. “When it comes to large corporates, we will not get a seat on the consortium table so we do not focus on these accounts as a policy. We are finding good demand for mid corporates and small & medium enterprises,” he said. He added that in theory, the bank can go up to Rs 400 crore per corporate but prefers to restrict the initial lending to Rs 100 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/watsas-fairfax-keen-to-hold-on-to-stake-in-csb/articleshow/88244847.cms||Mayur Shetty

In 2020, nearly two-thirds of online sales were paid in cash, up from nearly half three years ago. This is mainly because e-tailers expanded into the country’s rural areas (untapped customers), nearly 90% of the new buyers pay through the ‘cash on delivery’ (COD) mode, according to a study by CMS Infosystem, one of the largest cash handlers for banks in India. “Indians prefer to buy online, but when it comes to payment, they prefer to pay in cash,” said Rajiv Kaul, executive vice-chairman, CMS Infosystem. “Between 2015 and 2020, the market has more than quadrupled in terms of dollar value owing to the prevalence of shopping at online giants. COD is the most used payment method for e-commerce transactions in India.” In 2020, along with e-commerce retailers’ expansion into tier-2 to -4 cities, COD constituted more than 65% of all e-commerce payments, indicating the significance of cash for payments in this sector, according to the study. “COD payments become more prevalent as we move from metropolitan regions to semi-urban to rural areas of India. In the metro areas, approximately 50% of all online transactions are paid through the COD mode, while in tier-2 regions the corresponding figure is approximately 70% and reaches a peak of 90% in tier-4 regions.” Two factors lead to this spike in COD mode of payment. First, people in the rural areas are yet to adopt the popular non-cash payment systems like cards, digital payments and internet banking. Second, these customers want to see the product they are buying before they make the payment, industry veterans said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/90-of-rural-indias-e-comm-orders-paid-in-cash-study/articleshow/88244840.cms||Partha Sinha

While RIL teamed up with stressed asset buyer Assets Care & Reconstruction Enterprise for the Sintex bid, the other three parties have made solo offers. The four proposals will be evaluated by the resolution professional handling the Sintex bankruptcy matter and then will be placed before the creditors’ committee for further consideration, the Gujarat-based company said in a regulatory filing. Sintex owes about Rs 8,000 crore to financial and operational creditors. Sintex is the second company under the Indian bankruptcy code for which RIL has shown interest. It had previously bought Alok Industries in partnership with JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company. Welspun has bid for multiple assets under the Indian bankruptcy code but met with no success so far. For Sintex, Welspun has routed its bid through Easygo Textiles. The proposed deal will help Welpsun in its backward integration strategy, said a person familiar with its plans. Previously, Welspun had offered a little less than Rs 2,000 crore to Sintex’s creditors but the proposal didn’t enthuse them. Sintex, incorporated in 1931, has a market cap of Rs 594 crore. It reported a loss of Rs 1,306 crore on sales of Rs 1,696 crore in fiscal 2021. GHCL’s move for Sintex comes after it inked a deal to sell its home textile business in Gujarat to Indo Count Industries for Rs 576 crore. While Bengaluru-based Dinesh Kumar Himatsingka has routed the Sintex bid in his personal capacity along with his son Shrikant and Himatsingka Ventures. Sintex was admitted into the bankruptcy process by the National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad on April 6 this year on a plea by Invesco Asset Management over a Rs 15-crore default in payment of principal and interest of non-convertible bonds in September 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ril-welspun-among-bidders-for-bankrupt-textile-co-sintex/articleshow/88244799.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said the isolation centre would be operational by December 15 for which a team has already been deployed to sanitize the entire premises. Dr Vibha told this newspaper on Sunday that doctors, nursing, paramedics and housekeeping staff deployed by Care India will provide free 24x7 service at the centre. “Required medicines will be provided for the treatment of patients having mild symptoms of Covid-19,” she said, adding that the centre will also provide oxygen supply to all the 110 beds. “We are more prepared this time than the second Covid wave. Patients who do not have enough facilities at home can take shelter in the isolation centre as well,” Dr Vibha said. Amid the rising cases of Covid-19, the district has also ramped up the testing, vaccination (above 18 years of age) and contact tracing of those infected with this disease. According to the district health officials, of the 40 active cases 39 are from urban areas and only one is from rural. Most cases in urban areas are from Rajbanshi Nagar. “Covid-19 testing and contact tracing have been intensified lately as five mobile teams have been reactivated to collect sample from households. Besides, 52 Covid testing centers are operational in Patna,” she said, adding that mask checking will begin in market places and public transportation from Monday to ensure that people follow the Covid-19 protocols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/covid-isolation-centre-to-be-ready-by-dec-15/articleshow/88243304.cms||Faryal Rumi

The 75x42 feet mega screen was inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar in September last year. However, screening of movies could not be started due to Covid pandemic. A PSCL official said two Hindi movies were screened earlier this week as trial run. A maximum of 1,000 people can view movies and other shows at a time on the mega screen. The screen, installed with an expenditure of Rs 11 crore, is inflatable. It is raised through a truss by filling it with air before every act. Kishor said educational and cultural films would be screened on the giant screen. He added the seating capacity would be increased if required. Harshita, public relations officer (PRO) of PSCL, said the mega screen was country’s largest outdoor screen, where people can watch free movies and other events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mega-screen-launched-at-gandhi-maidan/articleshow/88243351.cms||---

Singh has been quoted as saying that the UPA, right from the start, believed that competitive bidding was the best mode of auctioning contracts, but faced a challenge in getting it through Parliament and enlisting the support of states on it. He adds that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had itself said that 2G auctions could not be done through competitive bidding as it would result in high prices being paid. According to the former PM, coal-producing states, most of them BJP-ruled, opposed competitive bidding in coal and a law could only be made by 2012, by when the UPA government had been painted as riddled with scams. He said that IAC agitation manipulated the CAG reports, and that he always believed that motives of both were suspect. It is believed that the reports submitted by then CAG Vinod Rai and the IAC agitation tarred the UPA government and Congress paid a heavy price politically, as BJP, led by Modi, used the atmosphere to rally voters across the country in 2014 polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/manmohan-feels-anna-stir-manipulated-cag-reports/articleshow/88245957.cms||---

A mega cleanliness drive between Godowlia and Maidagin crossings as part of BJP’s eight-day special sanitation campaign in Varanasi came to an end on Sunday. The party leaders are charting a plan to deliver ‘prasad’ at the doorsteps of eight lakh homes. Led by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh, ministers, party office bearers, leaders, workers and volunteers washed the road from Maidagin crossing. Varanasi Municipal Corporation’s staff also sanitized the areas along the road. Chugh said, “The sanitation drive was aimed at preparing the city for the opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dham by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Party workers washed the road as seers, religious and spiritual leaders would arrive for the expansion of the Kashi Vishwanath temple over 250 years after its construction by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar.” State co-in-charge of party, Sunil Oza said the entire world is eager to witness the historic occasion of the opening of KVD. UP urban development minister Ashutosh Tandon said the cleanliness drive launched by PM in 2014 has become a mass movement. BJP national secretary Rituraj Sinha, Kashi region president Mahesh Chand Srivastava, ministers Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal and Navratan Rathi also took part in the drive. Srivastava said after KVD’s opening, 15,000 BJP workers will start distribution of prasad. We plan to distribute prasad to eight lakh households in the district from Monday evening, said Srivastava highlighting other religious and cultural activities organized by party in past 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bjps-spl-sanitation-drive-to-beautify-kashi-concludes/articleshow/88244043.cms||---

Rane was in Kolhapur city to preside over a function organised to grant cheques of up to Rs 5 lakh to the depositors of banks in trouble due to financial indiscipline. When asked about the performance of the Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, Rane said: “The government has no time to listen to the grievances of farmers and students. It lacks a development vision. The head of the government is inactive and, therefore, the administrative machinery has become directionless. There is no control on the administration. In the last two years, the state has gone back 10 years.” Rane also attacked Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut who had said that if late Gopinath Munde were alive, the political scenario would have been different. Raut had said that Munde tried to keep Sena and BJP together. “Raut should worry about his party. Many are leaving his party. His party is on verge of extinction. He should focus on that instead of criticising others,” Rane said. Raut had also appreciated NCP chief Sharad Pawar saying that Pawar made a prediction 25 years ago that BJP will destroy social fabric of India, and Sena had realised it two years ago. This had prompted his party to break the alliance with the BJP. Rane said Raut should first decide who is his leader — Uddhav Thackeray or Sharad Pawar. “Is Raut loyal to Sena or NCP?” asked Rane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rane-head-of-state-inactive-administration-directionless/articleshow/88243712.cms||---

The NMC officials said that they will start 24x7 vaccination from next week to help the beneficiaries who work during the day and do not get time for vaccination. The 24x7 vaccination drive will be started immediately from Monday at New Bytco hospital and Indira Gandhi hospital in the first phase. The NMC officials said, “We already have staff working 24x7 at these two hospitals. The drive will particularly help the working class as they can get inoculated anytime they want.” Over 1.50 lakh beneficiaries in the city are yet to get even the first dose of the vaccine. Hence, the civic body aims to inoculate the maximum beneficiaries with at least the first dose at the earliest. At present, around 12.20 lakh beneficiaries have received the first dose, while 7.98 lakh beneficiaries have received the second shot. It means, around 89.50% of the beneficiaries have received the first dose, while 58% of the beneficiaries got the second dose. So far, Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V vaccines are available across the district. Now, the ZyCoV-D vaccine will also be available soon, which would be a needle-free vaccine. The Nashik Municipal Corporation is expected to get the vials of these vaccines within a week. This vaccine will be administered to the beneficiaries above 18 years, who are yet to take even a first shot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-start-24x7-vax-drive-at-4-centres/articleshow/88243207.cms||Tushar Pawar

The proposed set of changes was presented in the special committee of the city corporation the previous week. It is expected to be presented in the corporation council soon. Kovalam-Vizhinjam area development scheme had earlier been varied in 2010. It covers a total area of 1907.50 ha. The scheme map was originally sanctioned in 1978 as part of controlling the developments in and around Kovalam and Vizhinjam areas and to preserve the natural environment and to regulate development in an orderly manner. The coverage, height restrictions, plot size have been modified as per the new set of variations. The town planning department has also proposed taking away all the architectural controls prevalent in 2010 regulations. While the coverage for buildings under public and semi-public use was limited to 40% and height below 9 metres as per the old plan, the height and coverage will be determined as per the building rules in force, the proposal says. Multiplex complexes have been added to the zoning regulations under `uses restricted by chief town planner’. As for buildings under tourism development, the coverage was limited to 30% and the height of the building was below 9 metres. This provision has been taken off and proposed variation says that coverage and height restrictions in the 2010 regulations have been modified and it will be governed by Kerala municipality building rules. Hotels, resorts, cottages, homestays, hostels, boarding houses, convention centres, and commercial buildings are included under uses permitted. New relaxations have also been proposed for residential buildings. Residential buildings up to 300 sq.m and commercial buildings upto 150 sq.m are permitted in both the zones as per compliance with the paddy and wetland act of the state, the proposal says. Architectural controls such as control of building height, need to use local, indigenous construction materials, conditions regarding exterior colour and colour continuity have also been taken off in the proposed set of variations. The state government had issued a draft notification in 2018 to introduce variation in the general town planning scheme for Trivandrum city as part of making zoning regulations compatible with present development requirements. As per the notification, single family residential buildings with floor area upto 300 sq.m were included under permitted uses in green strips or areas reserved for agriculture. The condition was that the areas shall be substantially built up with lawful residential buildings and satisfying certain conditions. With no objections being received within the stipulated time period, the government issued the final notification in 2019. The corporation council had in 2020 approved the decision regarding relaxation of zoning regulations in green strips for single family residential buildings of floor area upto 300 sq.m.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/major-relaxations-proposed-in-development-scheme/articleshow/88244508.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Late on Saturday night, a 21-year-old youth from the Bhuyewadi village was gored by a bison. The bison, which had strayed away from the jungles in Panhala, had reached the Panchganga ghat area. The animal had retreated, but at Bhuyewadi, it got spooked by a crowd and tried to escape. In the process, it impaled the youth with its horn. According to experts, bison are inherently shy and do not attack on their own. In most of the fatal attacks in the recent past, it has been observed that the animals got frightened by the crowd. In most cases, while trying to escape, the animals, which can weight up to a tonne, trampled people. Samrat Kerkar, a wild life expert, said, “Most of the times, it is the crowd’s mistake. People chase the animals instead of leaving them alone to return to their natural habitat. The incidents shows that when the bison is chased, and if animal can’t find a way out due to the presence of a water body, a trench or any other obstacle, it turns back suddenly and can hit anything or anyone that comes in its way.” Meanwhile, the bison involved in the Saturday night’s incident remained untraced on Sunday. The forest department deployed about 90 personnel to check for the animal and make people aware of its presence. Sunil Nikam, the regional forest officer, said, “We suspect the bison may have returned to its habitat. It had come from the jungles in Panhala. We will, however, continue to track it. The villagers have been told to immediately call us if they spot the bison.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-district-5-killed-in-bison-attacks-in-4-years/articleshow/88243714.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Mahim man questions being tagged as ‘Omicron suspect’||Mumbai: Tagged as an Omicron suspect and “forced” to get hospitalised, a 32-year-old Mahim man has questioned mandatory isolation of overseas travellers in the city. Though he has no symptoms, is fully vaccinated and has tested negative twice in subsequent Covid tests, the man says he is forced to spend time in a hospital away from family. A software firm employee, he is currently admitted in a Covid ward for Omicron suspects at Bombay Hospital. After arriving from Sydney via Delhi on December 3, the man says he was going on with his life till he received a call from the BMC on December 10, asking him to get tested. The man says his negative test reports from Sydney and his vaccination certificate were checked at the Mumbai airport, but no tests were done at the airport since Australia is not on the list of ‘at-risk’ countries.  Civic staff contacted him amid field surveillance of foreign returnees. “Though BMC wanted to test me a week after my return, I fully cooperated and underwent the test,” he told TOI. His positive results arrived the same evening (Dec 10), following which he got calls from the local ward office to get hospitalised at SevenHills or Bombay Hospital. “Despite having no symptoms and enough space to isolate at home, I was almost threatened to get hospitalised,” said the father of a four-year-old. “I admitted myself at Bombay Hospital on Saturday by paying a deposit of Rs 1 lakh (hospitalisation in SevenHills is free),” he said. However, a second Covid test he had independently ordered from a private laboratory returned negative on Saturday. A third test carried out at Bombay Hospital also came negative on Sunday.  The man says he is scheduled to return to Sydney on Jan 17. “I wanted to consult a few doctors for a neurological condition, but I am stuck here.”  Dr Gautam Bhansali of Bombay Hospital said they have contacted BMC about the case. “We are following norms of hospitalising for a week and testing again on the eighth day,” he said. “If the genome sequencing reports clear him of Omicron prior to that, we will discharge him,” Bhansali said. A civic official said 34 such travellers have been tested and found positive. “They are all under institutional isolation,” the official said. “We have considered one such case and allowed the patient to go home and quarantine,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mahim-man-questions-being-tagged-as-omicron-suspect/articleshow/88245698.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Hyderabad||Farmers raise issue of monkey menace, officials insist on growing alternate crops||HYDERABAD: Blame it on monkeys, farmers are refusing to go for alternate crops even as officials are finding it hard to convince the farmers against cultivating paddy. Farmers claim simians do not touch paddy while they pillage on other crops, leaving them in severe losses. Officials, on the other hand, are telling the farmers to forget about the monkey menace and focus on growing alternate crops. “We have got enough water because of the lake and we can cultivate paddy in the 200 acres,” farmers at Dharur mandal told officials who visited them. When the farmers said monkeys were a big problem in the area and that only paddy would be safe from them, Vikarabad district collector K Nikhila said: “Leave the problem of monkeys to us. We will solve the matter. Cultivate paddy just for your consumption of rice. For the alternate crops that we are suggesting, we will also provide marketing facilities,” she assured farmers. Collectors in the districts are literally on a mission mode to tell farmers that they should not cultivate paddy. For those farmers who are still not convinced and would rather cultivate paddy, they are being given a piece of advice. “Only if you have an agreement with a rice mill for buying paddy, cultivate it, otherwise go in for alternate crops,” officials in Kamareddy told farmers. It was also explained to them for one acre of paddy that they cultivate, they can instead cultivate alternate crops equivalent to four acres in that area as per the water consumption. In Kamareddy, farmers are being encouraged to cultivate vegetables to get better revenue. Farmer Anji Reddy is cited as an example by Yadadri Bhuvanagiri by district collector Pamela Satpathy to cultivate alternate crops. The farmer of Saigudem in Alair mandal is cultivating horsegram in 12 acres and mustard in another seven aces. Agriculture officials have been asked to organise visits by other farmers to the farmland of Anji Reddy to understand cultivation of alternate crops from him. With agriculture officers holding meetings with farmers, some farmers in Siddipet informed collector M Hanumantha Rao that they had decided to go in for alternate crops as being suggested. The farmers of Singayapalli in Wargal mandal said after soil test was done and the available marketing opportunities explored, they would cultivate vegetables or any other crops and move away from paddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-raise-issue-of-monkey-menace-officials-insist-on-growing-alternate-crops/articleshow/88245100.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi: Courting trouble... how endless wait for forensic reports is delaying justice||NEW DELHI: Many cases pending in courts have been stalled by unavailability of forensic reports, with the judiciary noting that those dating from 2015 have been hampered by this. TOI assessed over 100 district court orders issued in the last two months instructing the directors of the regional laboratories as well as the Central Forensic Science Laboratory to expedite the reports. The courts have been pulling up the laboratories regularly in this regard. According to information on the website of FSL, Delhi, 13,780 cases were received in 2018, and 12,476 disposed of, leaving 5,641 cases unresolved. Karnataka High Court said on January 27 that extension of judicial custody merely on the ground that FSL had failed to furnish forensic reports on time was violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. Criminal lawyers also feel delays of this sort affect everyone — the prosecution, accused and victim — and denies the right to speedy justice. As advocate Arpit Bhargava said, “The accused languish in jails because the courts are unable to form a proper opinion in their cases. This leads to human rights violations. Justice is delayed because courts can’t progress with the case.” In one case, a Delhi court noted that the prosecution witnesses had to be sent back unexamined because the Forensic Science Laboratory, Rohini, hadn’t filed its reports. In another, it wondered why a chargesheet had been filed without the expert forensic opinion. In a 2019 attempt-to-murder case, the court asked FSL to hurry the result because the accused had been in judicial custody for a long time. In the attempt-to-murder case of 2019, where the FSL result was pending for over two years, the court directed the SHO and IO to appear in person and apprise it about the forensic report. It also directed the FSL director to personally look into the matter and inform the court about it. In a case registered under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, FSL informed the court that the details of the samples weren’t traceable in the laboratory, and despite directing the lab director on October 4, to submit the report by November 26, it still wasn’t done. Two years ago, in another NDPS case, the court had to repeatedly request FSL to submit the results, being finally forced to direct police in March this year to collect the voice sample of the accused and have the report filed by May. On September 18, the court noted that the Supreme Court had directed the completion of the trial by the end of June 2022. FSL was asked to submit the report on voice sample by October 11 but the IO told the court that day that it would be ready only by October-end. Yet, even till November 22, it wasn’t available. There are numerous other examples. Noting that there was no FSL report available in the judicial file for a 2016 acid attack case, a Delhi court said that case disposal within the 'five plus zero' policy period wasn’t possible because of this delay. 'Five plus zero' is an initiative of states to ensure that cases pending for over five years are taken up on a priority basis to bring down the number of such cases to zero. The court, on November 24, said, “The disposal of the case within the policy period is not possible on account of delay in putting the report in the courts.” The court suggested several ways to improve the situation. “Steps are also required to be taken by the office of the commissioner of police in respect of getting the reports from FSL, Rohini, well in time during the investigation so that IO may get the benefit of report/opinion of the expert in investigation and submit his final investigation report on the basis of said opinion,” it said. It added that the police chief should allow evidence and exhibits to be examined in other recognised laboratories if the Rohini facility was overburdened. The Central Bureau of Investigation’s laboratory is no better. During a recent hearing in a bribery case, the director of Central Forensic Science Laboratory informed the court that the report was delayed due to staff shortage. After noting the director’s plea that the technicians were handling many high-profile cases from across India, and that 302 cases were pending with the CFSL, some since 2015, the court said on November 8 that shortage of staff was no justification for a delay in submitting expert opinion reports that had a direct bearing on the trials. “The agency is expected to take up the matter of shortage of staff with the authorities concerned and this cannot be a ready-made excuse or justification, whenever called upon by the courts to show cause for the enormous delay on its part,” the court said. An official of FSL, Rohini, argued that trials weren’t being delayed entirely because of pending FSL results. Admitting that there were court orders noting the delays, the official said, “There are various reasons such as the FIR being registered long back and the case not being investigated within the time frame or forensic samples not being submitted to the labs on time. The lieutenant governor’s office is monitoring the progress of this lab and the LG holds weekly meetings. We are submitting results and have helped the courts progress in trials.” The official also claimed that technology and new facilities are being inducted. “We comply with international test standards,” said the official. “Test results nail criminals and absolve the innocent, so we cannot work in a mechanical way or in a hurry. Technology to analyse animal DNA has been newly set up and on the directions of Delhi High Court, we have also set up a narco analysis facility.” The official pleaded that with manpower being a drawback, the lab sometimes had to take up a case on priority even if it meant delaying other cold cases. Sources told TOI that human resources had been augmented in several regional labs. “Currently, there are six units working at FSL, Rohini. We now expect an increase in test analysis outcomes,” a source confided. Criminal lawyers aren’t happy about these delays. Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa said late submission of FSL reports could prove fatal for the prosecution. “The samples frequently become contaminated or ruined over time. There should be a time limit for conducting the forensic tests and receipt of reports for every sample sent to the laboratories,” said Pahwa. “If there is deliberate delay, appropriate legal action should be taken against the laboratory or the scientific officer involved.” Citing an example of a forgery, where only a forensic examination could establish whether the offences occurred under sections 467 and 468 of the Indian Penal Code or the less stringent Section 471, advocate Vijay Aggarwal said, “So, unless this fact is determined, the trial cannot begin.” He added that such delays resulted in the accused either languishing in jail or remaining an undertrial for long periods. “Administrative difficulties of the state arising from inadequate infrastructure cannot deprive the accused of their rights as held by the Supreme Court in theBhagwan Singh vs Commissioner of Police case,” said Aggarwal. Advocate M R Shamshad too categorised staffing problems in the labs as an obstruction by the state in the criminal justice system. “Laws have been amended to acknowledge the scientific temper and information technology at the institutional level. If FSLs don't have the required personnel it is nothing, it is nothing but an obstruction of justice by the state,” declared Shamshad. “Judges can’t wait forever and citizens cannot be subjected to harassment only because the state has failed in discharging its duty by not enabling FSLs to work efficiently.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/courting-trouble-how-endless-wait-for-forensic-reports-is-delaying-justice/articleshow/88244533.cms||Usha Das
---||Nashik||A year after NMC got MRI machine, new Bytco hospital to operate it||Nashik: To facilitate the residents with cheaper MRI tests, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had procured an MRI machine for Rs 12 crore a year back. But the machine is still not operational even after a year. Therefore, the new Bytco hospital of the NMC has decided to start functioning the machine soon. The NMC had procured the MRI machine as MRI tests are costlier at private hospitals. The civic body officials said that they could not operate the MRI machine for the last one year due to Covid-19 and also the lack of operators for the machines. “We have already appointed radiologists and other skilled persons to operate the MRI machines at the NMC-managed hospital. We have plans to make the MRI machines operational within a week or two,” said the officials. The CT Scan machine that was procured with the MRI machine is already operational for the last six months, but there was an issue regarding the rates. Later, the civic administration revised the rates for both, CT scans and MRI services. The private hospitals charge Rs 2,500 for a CT scan of the brain, which will be available for Rs 800 at the new Bytco hospital. Other CT scans and MRI services will be available at a lesser rate as compared to the private hospitals across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/a-year-after-nmc-got-mri-machine-new-bytco-hospital-to-operate-it/articleshow/88243223.cms||Tushar Pawar

Police said that the victim did not leave any suicide note and personal problems could be the reason behind the extreme step. The deceased was identified as K Raj Kumar. According to police, Raj Kumar, a bachelor and a native of Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh, had been working as a cardiologist at a private hospital in Ameerpet. Raj was staying alone in a rented house at BK Guda in SR Nagar. On Friday morning, Raj called up a friend and spoke to him at length saying that he was not feeling good mentally. Some time after Raju disconnected the call, his friend tried contacting him again, but Raj did not answer the phone calls, SR Nagar inspector K Saidulu said. The friend alerted Raj’s colleague Srikanth and the latter rushed to the doctor’s house. “Raj was found lying unconscious with an intravenous drip connected to his arm. He was immediately rushed to hospital, where he succumbed while undergoing treatment. Family members did not give any specific reasons for the suicide. We suspect that some personal problems could be the reason,” SR Nagar inspector K Saidulu said. Based on the complaint of Raj’s father K Subba Rao, a case was registered under Section 174 of the CrPC and the body was shifted for a post-mortem examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cardiologist-commits-suicide/articleshow/88245102.cms||---

According to reliable sources, the tourism department has not received bids for maintenance contracts for the 15 resorts owned by AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC). The tourism department wanted to reopen the resorts which were closed following the outbreak of Covid-19. The department had invited tenders to award maintenance contracts for 34 resorts in different districts. The tourism department expected good response from hoteliers and contractors as the majority of the tourists places had started witnessing good footfall since the easing of Covid-19 restrictions. The department wanted to attract more tourists by reopening the resorts and hotels in tourist centres. Surprisingly, the department did not receive a single bid in at least 15 locations. While the bids were received for 18 resorts maintenance, the APTDC has withdrawn the one notification. “The revenues of the corporation depend on the reopening of the resorts. We are studying the reasons for no response for 15 locations and take corrective measures, if required,” said a senior official. Interestingly, the maintenance contract of Yatri Nivas in Araku, the biggest tourist attraction in the state, too, has not received bids. As many as five restaurants in Araku Yatri Nivas were put on the auction block. Similarly, the APTDC resorts in Amaravati (temple town) and hill temple Kotappakonda in Guntur district too have not received any bids. “We will invite the tenders again and ensure that all the resorts are opened by January,” said tourism development minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao. The resorts in small towns such as Madakasira in Kurnool district, Chandavaram in Prakasam district, Kasumuru, Kotha Koduru and Isukapalli in Nellore district, Adapur in Kadapa, Makthyala in Krishna district were also up for grabs. Sources said that the department is expecting response for restaurants located along the river banks such as Amaravarati, Makhtyala and pilgrim centre at Kotappakonda without making amendments to the tender notification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/15-govt-tourist-resorts-see-no-bidder-for-maintenance/articleshow/88243716.cms||Samdani MN

During the questioning, Shilpa told police that since 2018 she has been organizing kitty parties at her villa and started accepting money from interested investors, who attended those parties for handsome interest. “Shilpa claimed to have taken money from about 12 to 13 people, amounting to about Rs 20 crore,” an investigator said. Offering 10 to 12% monthly interest on the principal to investors, the socialite in turn lent the amount to others, who promised to offer her slightly more interest. “Shilpa claims that those who took money from her, failed to repay in time and in turn she could not pay the interest to people who lent her. For majority of the transactions, there were no written agreements. some have post-dated cheques issued by her,” the investigator said. Police would produce her before court on Monday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/not-cheated-only-delayed-payments-claims-shilpa/articleshow/88245110.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Paid Rs 35L to each corporator to get my party’s mayor: Kore||Kolhapur: Vinay Kore, former minister and sitting MLA of the Panhala assembly constituency, made a shocking revelation that he had paid Rs 35 lakh to each of the corporators to get a mayor from his Jansurajya Shakti party. Kore had formed the party in 2004. It had contested the KMC election with NCP’s support in 2005, but had fallen short of majority. Kore, who runs several cooperatives, recently played an instrumental role in making sure the MLC election went off smoothly. Satej Patil of Congress won unopposed after Kore convinced BJP’s Amal Mahadik to withdraw. When asked whether such a compromise undermines the democratic process, he said, “In a democracy, elections should be held, but their sanctity is equally important. In elections with limited voters, such as this MLC election, polls should be unopposed. However, here, the sanctity of the process was being destroyed,” he said alluding to several alleged “internal dealings”. “Why should I blame others? I can talk from my experience. I paid Rs 35 lakh each to the corporators to get a mayor of my party in the KMC. I felt good while committing the act. However, the act led to people hating political platforms. People started to look at me differently. I made a mistake, I accept it. To prevent people from losing respect for politics, I decided to adopt a way of consensus, which made the MLC election unopposed,” he added Given the rivalry between Satej Patil and Mahadik, this was a difficult task, said Kore. He said his genuine and wholehearted efforts paid off. Kore was once at the centre of KMC politics. His party’s success in winning four seats in the 2009 assembly elections had increased his aspirations and getting a mayor of his party in the KMC was one of those. He, however, said that he was swayed by emotions while paying huge sums to the corporators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/paid-rs-35l-to-each-corporator-to-get-my-partys-mayor-kore/articleshow/88243720.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Handicapped man alleges assault by Bandra-Worli Sea Link toll workers||MUMBAI: Two men employed at the toll collection booth on Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL) were booked for allegedly abusing, humiliating, and assaulting a 42-year-old handicapped motorist, after the victim refused to pay the toll and showed his Government Identity card. The government resolutions (GR) show exemption for motorists who are over 85 per cent handicapped. When the victim, Ramdas Khot, failed to cross the toll, he approached the Bandra police for help and a first information report was filed. The victim underwent a medical examination to check for any, internal injuries. The Bandra police booked the two accused under the Indian Penal Code and Disability act that amounts to five years imprisonment if found guilty. The police are yet to arrest the two accused. The incident occurred at around 2.45 pm on the Southbound on BWSL when Khot, an assistant secretary with Prahar Janshakti Party (PJP) at Mantralaya, was stopped by the toll collection staff and diverted other motorists from entering the lane, and allegedly abused and blew punches on his face and head. “Since Friday, I have not stepped out of my house as the incident left me traumatised. This was the first time I witnessed such an incident on the BWSL in the last four years ever since I started driving to Mantralaya for work. Despite showing the necessary documents, the toll guys thrashed me. When I showed them the government ID, they abused me saying ‘tum logon ko masti chaddi hai’,” Khot told TOI. Meanwhile, authorities with the Mumbai Entrypoint Toll (MEP) said the staff at the toll post in fact requested him to get a fastag from NHAI that offered waivers to handicapped motorists but MSRDC notification under which the toll was operated did not suggest any waiver to 80% handicapped motorists. “Our staff was on the defensive when he manhandled a few after refusing the payment. The video is enough to show how the staff behaved with him. We also went to the police to file an FIR but they suggested we register an NC,” authorities pointed out. No arrests have been made as police are probing into the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/handicapped-man-alleges-assault-by-bandra-worli-sea-link-toll-workers-in-mumbai/articleshow/88245710.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

The four-day special camp will start from Monday at the respective ward offices. On Monday, the camp will be held at Gandhi Maidan Ward, on Tuesday at Shivaji Market Ward, on Wednesday at Rajarampuri Ward and at Tararani Ward it will be held on Thursday. The property owners are asked to bring the property documents between 10 am to 4 pm. If the documents are clear, then the department officials will send teams to assess the property size and fix the tax amount. Several properties and open plots owned privately are yet to be listed for property tax. The owners are demanding to get it listed for their benefit as it will help them seek loans or carry out transactions. The KMC will benefit from the revenue that will be generated after the properties are brought under the tax net. According to the officials, more than 20% of properties in the city are untaxed. These include the new and old properties. Many tend to avoid listing the property to evade the tax. The corporators have demanded to expand the property tax net without increasing the property tax. Currently, around 1.35 lakh properties are charged for property tax and KMC collects over Rs 35 crore to Rs 40 crore every year from the property tax. Earlier attempts were made to survey the properties and bring them under the property tax net, however, amid corruption allegations the task given to a private firm remained incomplete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/drive-to-bring-untaxed-properties-under-tax-net/articleshow/88243742.cms||---

The event was organised by the Adarsh Saineek Foundation, which was set up by ex-army men of the Deolali Camp. Subodh Mishra, who was an aeronautical engineer in the Indian Navy, expressed grief in the death of the CDS and the others. He said everyone in the country should unite and show support and respect to the soldiers of the defence forces. Mishra also talked about how planes and choppers flying VIPs are inspected extensively before the take-off, the turn-around in case planes or choppers have to land in between the journey and after landing protocol. He said nothing is ever taken for granted in the armed forces and when such VIPs are flying all the necessary measures are taken. The best pilot is given the task of flying the chopper. It was very unfortunate that the CDS, his wife and 11 others died in the crash. Another retired army personnel Naik Deepchand — who was with the 1889 Missile Regiment Kargil and lost his two legs and a hand while unloading ammunition in Rajasthan where he was deployed during Operation Parakram — recalled his two meetings with General Bipin Rawat in 2018 during Divyang Saineek programme in Pune and the Kargil Vijay Diwas in 2019. “General Rawat had taken a special liking towards me. He used to call me ‘missile man’. When he saw me attending the 20th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas in Kargil, he was surprised to see me and asked how I managed to attend the programme at a height of 17,000 feet,” he said.

Earlier this month, the department issued a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for scrapping diesel or petrol vehicles that are more than 15 years old by its enforcement branch. Taking cognisance of the increasing vehicular pollution and the poor air quality in Delhi, there is an urgent need for a standing order regarding scrapping and phasing out of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) from the city roads, according to an order issued by the transport department. The National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) direction for action against old vehicles will be applicable to all categories of vehicles, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, four-wheelers, light and heavy vehicles, irrespective of whether commercial or otherwise, the order said. It added that the need of the hour is to maintain ambient air quality standards and tackle the rising air pollution caused by ELVs. It has been decided that vehicles that are more than 15 years old will be removed first if found plying on Delhi roads. The SOP says such vehicles will be impounded by the enforcement teams and handed over to an authorised scrapper of the transport department in accordance with the policy guidelines. The authorised scrapper will tow the impounded vehicle from the place of seizure to the scrapping unit. If a dispute arises while impounding such vehicles, the enforcement team will not get involved in a conflict and will contact the local police for help, it says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fix-fair-market-value-for-old-vehicles-govt-to-scrappers/articleshow/88244582.cms||---

Krishna Lanka CI Satyanandam and other officials are conducting searches at railway tracks and railway bridges where the gang members usually take shelter. City police are using night vision drones to scan the outskirts in bid to nab the offenders. On the other hand, Patamata, Ibrahimpatnam, Penamaluru, and Kankipadu police have started a special drive to inspect the security system at residential apartments. Police found that 80 per cent of the apartments and residential complexes don't have either electronic security system or CCTV. Kasi Viswanath, CI, Kankipadu police station said: "Apartment culture is rising and there is no contact between the neighbours. Apartment committees are focused on beautification works and ignoring installing CCTV cameras which are a must now. Residential associations should deploy a professional security agency and install security systems to prevent thefts. We are educating the people on this." A series of thefts on city outskirts have been worrying the residents. Gang struck houses at Poranki, Guntupalli, and Tadepalli . The gang members are living in the forest area near Dahod city which is close to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh borders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-launch-spl-operation-to-arrest-notorious-chaddi-gang/articleshow/88243765.cms||Venu Lanka

Bhuse said the society and the country could quickly get back to normalcy and take strides in all-round development because of the efforts of the farmers and public servants. Bhuse, who represents the Malegaon (outer) assembly constituency, laid the foundation for three hospitals in Malegaon and honoured the Covid warriors at a programme in the town. Addressing gatherings at the different locations, Bhuse said: “At a time when people were trying their best to get medical help for their own relatives, there were doctors, medical equipment suppliers and police personnel who were doing their job — though their own dear ones were in need of Covid treatment.” Bhuse pointed out that many such public servants lost their loved ones to the virus, but they continued to work to ensure the infection stayed under control. “Even today, the danger of infection is very high. People should not take the situation lightly. They must follow all Covid norms and strengthen the hands of the administration and the government in the fight against Covid,” the minister said. He laid the foundation for a 100-bed Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) on the premises of the existing hospital at Mausam Bridge. It will be constructed at a cost of Rs 33.77 crore under the National Health Mission (NHM). The 15-bed hospital at Ramzanpura will be constructed at a cost of Rs 4 .15 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram. And the 100-bed modular hospital at Malegaon Camp, area near Rawalgaon Naka, will be constructed at a cost of Rs 4.50 crore through CSR funds of the American India Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/agri-minister-praises-public-servants-farmers-for-role-in-covid-management/articleshow/88243803.cms||---

Advocates Ezhil Caroline, Geetha and Ishwarya of Madras high court and Ann Nirmala Carr from Lady Doak College were among the jury panelists. A total of 10 cases, all of which involved crimes against dalit women including rape, harassment and assault were taken up. The victims and family members shared their ordeals which revealed how in many cases, SC/SCT Act or proper sections were not invoked. Dalit women were not given proper protection by the police despite facing threats. “What the victims shared shows the failure of the entire justice system. Already, only 5% of women come forward to file FIR in rape cases in India, according to Amnesty International. It takes a lot for a dalit woman to come forward in case of rape but even then, the accused is not arrested. Proper sections are not included even in a rape case,” said A Kathir, executive director of Evidence. Instances pointing to the practice of untouchability or discrimination leading to violence and attacks were shared at the hearing.The panelists urged the victims and their family members to have self-confidence to fight the legal battle. They said that if those affected follow up continuously, they can find success and that the community /must also be strengthened.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lapses-in-violence-cases-against-dalit-women/articleshow/88245136.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He subsequently gagged the woman using a sari, took her to a secluded place and raped her. Thereafter, he pushed her to a stone causing head injury. Two other women who witnessed the incident informed villagers about it. The victim who sustained severe injuries was rushed to the hospital, but she died on February 1.In 1996, the II additional sessions court at Tirunelveli convicted and sentenced the accused to life imprisonment for offence under Section 302 (murder) of IPC and 10 years imprisonment for offence under Section 376 (rape) of IPC, which were to run concurrently. Challenging it, the accused preferred an appeal before HC in 2018.A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said the two woman witnesses accompanying the victim had spoken about the act of the accused to point the needle of suspicion at him. The judges said the place of occurrence was a forest area near a dam where there is no human habitat. The judges said with all tell-tale evidence of sexual violence, the medical evidence like the accident register, wound certificate and postmortem report without any doubt indicates that the accused had raped the woman, ultimately causing her death due to intensive injury on her private parts and head. Hence, the judges upheld the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial court and dismissed the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-life-term-for-man-in-rape-murder-case/articleshow/88245138.cms||---

Living four kilometres away from Charminar near Jama Masjid, the Arabs in Barkas are largely those migrated from Hadhramaut in Yemen to join the Nizam’s army and administration. Today, they keep their culture alive by being a closely knit community. “Right from marriages to funerals and other events, community living is a way of live for Arabs. Even in our food, we all eat in one huge plate. Mandi, a rice delicacy like Biryani, is a classic example of how Arab eat,” said Mohsin Qureshi, who has his family living in Barkas for generations now. With men wearing lungi and amama and women donning hijabs, the Arabs have a distinct identity of their which they are proud of. Traditionally, Arabs were into fruit and dairy business. Many Arab families were known to grow their own fruits in their courtyards and auction their produce to the retailers. However, the community has now evolved with the younger generation pursuing higher education and getting into businesses such as real estate, construction, medicine among others. To promote the Arabic culture, many have also started authentic Arabic restaurants that serve delicacies such as Mandi, Aseed, Haris among others. With Mandi slowly gaining popularity in the city, it is the larger Arab population that continues to add its unique flavor in not just the cuisine but also the Hyderabadi culture. “Barkas is home to a lot of Arabic restaurants that have now spawned to even other parts of the city. The commercial area of Barkas is a reflection of the Arab community living in the area,” said Ali Bin Abdulrahman Bahazeq, who is born and brought up in Barkas and now runs his own business in the neighbourhood. The Arab population is also popular for their traditional medicine for jaundice, which is a concoction of herbs. It is offered free of cost in Barkas by the ‘Jaundice Medicine Barkas’, a non-profit organisation. They have emphasised on teaching the Arabic language to the younger generation and offer prayers in their native language.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/close-knit-arab-community-made-hyderabad-home-since-17th-century/articleshow/88245143.cms||Preeti Biswas

The ruling DMK has convened a meeting of its district secretaries, MPs and MLAs on Saturday, December 18 in Chennai. It has urged all the functionaries to attend the meeting, without fail, a statement issued by party general secretary S Durai Murugan said. While the party has not indicated any agenda for the high-level meeting next week, a senior DMK leader said the urban local body polls would be top of the agenda for the party. “We had a meeting earlier and our leader (M K Stalin) has asked the party functionaries to work hard and ensure 100% victory for the ruling party in the urban local body polls,” the senior leader said. Meanwhile, the principal opposition party AIADMK is busy with its internal party elections and hence yet to begin preparations for the urban local body elections. “Over the next two days, Monday and Tuesday, the party district secretaries will be busy appointing electoral officers to oversee party elections at the level of panchayat unions and municipalities,” an AIADMK insider said. DMK’s ally Congress has already received nominations from aspirants keen to contest the urban local body polls. Actor Kamal Haasan’s MNM has appointed a state-level committee and in-charges for each parliament seat in the state to coordinate and prepare the party for the ensuing elections.

---||Madurai||HC upholds youth’s acquittal in rape and murder of girl||Madurai: Madras high court has upheld a trial court order acquitting a youth accused of rape and murder of a minor girl in Dindigul district in April 2019. The prosecution case was that the 12-year-old girl was at her house on April 16 when her parents left for work. Around 5pm when the mother returned, she found her daughter lying in the bedroom with bleeding injuries.A live electrical wire was inserted into her nose and mouth. She immediately turned off the switch and lifted her daughter only to realize that she was dead. Based on a complaint, police registered a case under Section 174 of Cr PC. During investigation, police found that the perpetrator of the crime was a 17-year-old boy living next to the victim’s house. The case was altered to Section 302 of IPC and under sections of Pocso Act. The juvenile in conflict with law was secured on April 27, produced before the juvenile justice board and sent to observation home.During September 2020, the Dindigul fast track mahila court on appreciation of evidence held that the charges were not proved beyond doubt and acquitted the accused. Challenging this, the state as well as the victim’s father had filed appeals before HC Madurai bench, saying the trial court failed to consider the overwhelming evidence against the accused placed before it.A division bench of Justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that the statement of a witness who saw the youth coming out of the victim’s house and the evidence recovered from his house are highly doubtful. The trial court has rightly found that these discrepancies do not conclusively prove the guilt of the accused, and therefore he is entitled for benefit of doubt. The judges said that on re-appreciation of the evidence, the court has no other reasonable alternate view than that taken by the trial court. Hence, they dismissed the appeals and confirmed the trial court’s order of acquittal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-upholds-youths-acquittal-in-rape-and-murder-of-girl/articleshow/88245145.cms||---

The Pradhan Mantri Kusum Yojana (Component A) has been launched by the central government with the objective to increase the income of farmers by using barren and non-agricultural land. Through this scheme, the farmers will get an opportunity to earn money by selling the electricity generated in the solar energy project to MSEDCL or by leasing the land for the solar project. Under this scheme 0.5 to 2 (Megawatts) (MW) solar power projects can be raised in a decentralized manner. The farmers of the farmers’ cooperative societies, gram panchayat, Farmers Producers ‘Associations (FPOs) and the Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) can develop solar power projects and use the power for their consumption or even sell the power to the MSEDCL. The farmers can also choose to develop the solar power project through the developers if they are unable to do so due to financial constraints. For this, an agreement will be signed between the developer and the farmers in which the farmers will get the rent for their land. The MSEDCL said solar power will be purchased by the MSEDCL at Rs 3.10 per unit for the next 25 years from the date of commencement of the scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/63-farmers-apply-to-use-land-for-solar-power/articleshow/88243814.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The government had put the works on the Rs 900-crore project on hold about two-and-a-half years ago and there is no clarity whether to continue the old contract or go for new tenders.  The UGD project was launched in 2016 after the Centre gave a grant of Rs 540 crore under Capital City Development Scheme. The state government and the GMC had agreed to share the remaining burden of the project. The then TDP government directed the Shapoorji Pallonji group which bagged the contract to complete the work within 24 months of commencement as it wanted to inaugurate the project before the last general elections. Notwithstanding the pressure from the state government, the contractor could not complete even 50 per cent of the total project before 2019 elections. Launching of works in all the five zones created for UGD had almost simultaneously left the entire road infrastructure in the city in chaotic condition. As per the tender agreement, the contractor had to reconstruct the CC roads dug and cut to lay the UGD pipelines, while the GMC had agreed to construct the BT and gravel roads. However, no agency had taken the responsibility to reconstruct the roads leaving the city roads pothole-ridden. Suspecting foul play in the award of the contract, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government suspended the works soon after taking over the reins of the state in 2019. After receiving the report from the high-level committee which probed into the violations in the award of the tenders, chief minister directed the municipal administration department to renew the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gmc-clueless-on-fate-of-ugd-project/articleshow/88243809.cms||Samdani MN

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: In Brahmin push, Akhilesh Yadav inducts Hari Shankar Tiwari’s kin into party||LUCKNOW: Adding to Samajwadi Party’s efforts to strengthen its position among Brahmins in Purvanchal region, two sitting MLAs, a former chairman of the legislative council and a host of other senior leaders joined SP in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav in Lucknow on Sunday. The list includes sitting BSP MLA from Chillupar seat in Gorakhpur, Vinay Shankar Tiwari and his brother Kushal Tiwari, a former MP from Sant Kabir Nagar. Vinay is the son of former cabinet minister Hari Shankar Tiwari who had attained the image of a strongman in the 70s and 80s and went on to become a minister in several state governments. Others who joined SP were BJP MLA from Khalilabad, Digvijay Narayan alias Jai Chaubey, former legislative council chairman Ganesh Shankar Pandey, who is also a kin of Tiwari, Santosh Tiwari of BSP from Karnailganj and other leaders mostly from Brahmin community and from Purvanchal. Within the SP ranks, the development is being viewed as yet another major attempt of Akhilesh Yadav to strengthen his party’s position in Purvanchal region. Earlier jailed don Mukhtar Ansari’s brother Sibgatullah Ansari joined the SP and recently former BJP ally Om Prakash Rajbhar of Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party had announced it would contest 2022 assembly polls as an alliance partner of SP. Both Anasaris and OP Rajbhar have clout in Purvanchal. Welcoming the leaders, Akhilesh said: “I am happy that such a big and influential family has come with us and now there is no competition for Samajwadi Party.” He also welcomed Payal Kinnar’s return to SP and assured all help to her community. Akhilesh accused the government of taking up projects and schemes on the basis of caste and religion. “It looks like this government has adopted the divide and rule policy of the British. While the British ruled by dividing, the BJP is ruling by spreading fear. The people have now understood this, and the people in the 2022 elections will teach them (BJP) a lesson." Vinay Shankar Tiwari, who was expelled from the BSP recently, described Akhilesh as a popular leader and said that under BJP government, democracy has been overshadowed by autocracy. “The government has divided the people and instilled hatred,” he maintained. Tiwari said the government had set up big hoardings advertising its achievements but the ground reality was completely different. “Brahmins have been completely deprived of justice in this regime,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/in-brahmin-push-akhilesh-inducts-hari-shankar-tiwaris-kin-into-party/articleshow/88245147.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

The FIR registered by Sakinaka police late on Saturday night named Sabre Alam and four others, all activists of the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen. The case was registered against them under various sections of the IPC, including 188 (disobeying the order promulgated by public servant), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and provisions of the Disaster Management Act, the official said. Mumbai police had imposed section 144 of CrPc over the weekend prohibiting gathering of more than four persons in view of the new Omicron variant cases coming to the fore. The rally, held in Chandivli ahead of civic polls in Mumbai and other cities, was attended by thousands, including AIMIM activists who travelled from Aurangabad led by party MP Imtiaz Jaleel to demand quota for Muslims. Meanwhile, state Congress working president Arif Naseem Khan slammed Owaisi and Jaleel for allegedly “working for the BJP whenever elections are close.”  Hitting back, Khan on Sunday said that Owaisi and his party have exposed themselves by “riding a car with petrol supplied by the BJP”. “This vehicle called Owaisi moves only when an election is near. Now that BMC elections are near, they have begun working for the BJP,” said Khan. Khan said that it was the Congress-NCP government which gave 5% reservation to Muslims. “After the BJP came to power in 2014, it denied Muslims reservation. When we fought for its restoration in assembly, MIM’s two MLAs (Imtiaz Jaleel and Waris Pathan) were silent. They remember reservation only when an election nears,” he said. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fir-against-organisers-of-owaisis-mumbai-rally-for-defying-police-order/articleshow/88245734.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin

The move is being seen as party’s attempt to undercut the electoral threat posed by the recent alliance between Om Prakash Rajbhar led Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) and Samajwadi Party. BJP also inducted Rajbhar leaders from SP and SBSP in a bid to send out a message to the two opposition parties in the run up to 2022 polls. The prominent ones to join the BJP included two time SP MLA from Zahoorabad assembly seat in Ghazipur Kalicharan Rajbhar and SBSP’s Lucknow district president Babban Rajbhar. Babban had separated from his parent party to form his own outfit Maharaja Suheldev Sena. The outfit merged with the BJP. The inductions were done in the presence of cabinet minister Anil Rajbhar and BJP Rajya Sabha MP Sakaldeep Rajbhar. Former UP BJP chief and chairperson of party’s induction committee, Laxmi Kant Bajpai said that the Rajbhar community has always stood for the glory of ‘Hindutva’. “But a few people have joined hands with the forces who are supporters of the Ghazi Salar Masud,” he said, in an apparent reference to the SBSP chief’s alliance with the SP. The development came on a day when the SP inducted BJP MLA from Khalilabad in Sant Kabir Nagar, Digvijay Narayan aka Jay Chaubey. He is the second BJP MLA after Rakesh Rathore of Sitapur to join the SP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-rallies-rajbhar-leaders-says-community-always-stood-for-glory-of-hindutva/articleshow/88245151.cms||---

However, on Sunday, the joint commissioner of HR and CE in Madurai, S Kumaradurai, said in a statement that the compulsory vaccinated status for entry into Meenakshi temple was being withdrawn for administrative reasons.  “Temples are places that are going to see large crowds in the month of margazhi, hence it is here that vaccination certificate is a must,’’ said T Rajaram of Simmakkal. It was not known if the order was applicable to all the temples in the region. While vaccination is being made mandatory, the monitoring of masking was almost nil at public places, and shops. “Sanitizers have disappeared and so have thermal scanning and monitoring of masks,’’ said R Sendarmarai, a resident of K K Nagar. Sales of masks have also dropped drastically, say chemists, who pointed out that they were not even selling hundred masks a week now. They had sold 100 boxes a week during the peak of the second wave.Auto drivers, bus drivers and conductors are among those found not wearing masks in public transport facilities. “I am vaccinated, so I don’t think I need a mask any longer,’’ said Ravikumar, an auto driver at Gomathypuram. Simultaneously, large gatherings are once again seen at weddings and other functions, with photographers demanding that people down their masks during photoshoots. “Such actions have to be avoided and sensitization sessions conducted for photographers on how to shoot with safety norms, covering smaller crowds,’’ said Kumaravel of Vilangudi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/vax-certificate-must-in-madurai-from-today-temple-backtracks/articleshow/88245150.cms||---

While it receives nearly 50 to 100 tonnes of flowers of different varieties during the peak season, it dips to less than 50 tonnes during the winter season. Only less than a tonne of jasmines came to the market on Sunday, compared to about two tonnes a few weeks back. The flower was selling at Rs 2,000 on December 5 and fluctuated between Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 during the week.Madurai Meenakshi Flower Market Association president S Ramachandran said that rain and the onset of winter season resulted in the climate becoming very cold, affecting the formation of flower buds of not just jasmine, but also flowers like chrysanthemum, pitchi, and sampangi which the market receives in large quantities. The prices would remain high for the next two days and is expected to come down during the month of Margazhi when the demand would decrease, he said P Ganapathy, a traditional jasmine farmer of Koodakoil in Madurai, said that during the peak season from March to August they get about 150kg per day per acre. “We get flowers for a week and then we have to maintain the crop for a week, and it starts flowering again throughout the peak season,” he said. However, during the winter season, they got only about one kilogram per acre. “Even if we fertilize the crop and apply pesticides, only the leaves would develop, not flowers, during the winter,” he said.Traders made good sales on Sunday, selling jasmines in strands of 100 buds which cost as much as Rs 50 or even Rs 60.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/jasmine-sells-at-record-rs-4k/kg/articleshow/88245149.cms||---

He also avenged the murder of his uncle that took place in 2009 and gunned down the killer in June this year. Taj, cops said, kept a record of his enemies’ bails and parole and killed them as soon as they came out. Cops suspect he was planning to kill two others by following the same modus operandi. DCP Jasmeet Singh said that Taj had been hiding in Lucknow and Behraich in UP for the last six months. “The process for declaring him a proclaimed offender by court in both the cases was in advanced stage,” he added. Police had initiated a drive to catch absconders during which Taj figured prominently on their list. Inspector Shiv Kumar’s team received information about movements of this absconding criminal, after which a team was formed to nab him. During surveillance on his associates, it was found that Taj was hiding in the areas of Lucknow and Behraich so traps were laid on the instance of informers. After two months of chase, the team got to know that Taj would go to Lucknow from Behraich. He was spotted near Jarwal bus stand on Lucknow-Behraich road and nabbed. During questioning Taj said that last February, he and his associates had attacked a man named Saurabh to avenge the killing of his brother, which took place in Rajouri Garden in 2009. Saruabh had just been allowed a bail from the high court in a case. In another case, Vinod Bhati, a property dealer of Raghubir Nagar area was shot dead by Taj and his associates in his office in Raghubir Nagar on June 25 this year. Bhati had earlier killed Riyaz, Taj's uncle, in the year 2019 in Delhi. Bhati had come out of jail on bail in that case in April and was soon targeted by Taj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/contract-killer-on-the-run-after-two-murders-in-city-arrested/articleshow/88244613.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Fake degrees scams busted in Rajkot||RAJKOT: Two rackets of making and selling fake educational degree certificates and markets were busted in Rajkot with the police arresting three persons including a woman. The degree certificates were made for students who were aspiring to go to Canada for further studies or immigrate. The special operations group (SOG) sources said that over a dozen bogus MBA certificates were seized from the accused during the raid that was conducted by the cops a fortnight ago. The cops said that further investigations may lead to more arrests in the case. The SOG sleuths had nabbed Paras Khajuria near his house on Vidyanagar Road after they received a tip-off that he was selling bogus degree certificates. When his two-wheeler was checked, the investigators found 11 degree certificates of MBA and marksheets. The degrees were from Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University in Agra and Allahabad University. “We sent the degrees to the respective universities to ascertain if they were genuine. On Saturday, we got the reply from the universities that the degree certificates were fake following which we arrested Khajuria,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Manoharsinh Jadeja. Khajuria is a visa agent and helps aspiring students to immigrate to Canada. Apart from providing service to genuine clients, Khajuria used to look for the aspirants who wanted to immigrate but didn’t have an MBA degree that helps in getting more points for permanent residence (PR) in Canada. He was engaged in the racket of making bogus degrees for the last six years. When asked how he managed to get fake degrees, Khajuria said that Darshan Kotak, a resident of Ahmedabad, used to send him the degrees,” Jadeja added. Khajuria used to charge anywhere between Rs 70,000 to Rs one lakh per degree from the aspirants. He used to keep half the money and send the rest to Kotak who too has been booked by the police for fraud. Police also booked Vaibhav Patadia, Apurva Patel and Viral Goradia in whose names the seized certificates were issued. Khajuria has been sent to one day of police custody by the court. Vaibhav, who was looking to get more points in PR, too has been arrested. In a separate case of bogus certificates, a 35-year-old woman too has been arrested from the city. Dharmishta Makadia, a resident of Sadhu Vasvani Road, was making fake MBA degrees for the last one year. Police seized five bogus degrees and seven photocopies from her. “The fake degrees were in the name of William Carey University based in Meghalaya. She used to charge Rs 70,000 per degree certificate,” Jadeja said. Police said was earlier booked in Maharashtra too for the similar crime. Makadia told the investigators that a Delhi-based man Prakash Yadav, who was her Facebook friend, used to send her fake degrees. She claimed that Yadav gave her the idea of how to execute the racket. Police also booked Malti Trivedi and Maulik Jasani, in whose names the bogus certificates seized from Makadia, were issued. She has been remanded to one day of police custody by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/fake-degrees-marksheets-scams-busted-in-rajkot/articleshow/88244241.cms||---

A man transporting the liquor was also arrested. The police said that the liquor stock belonged to Jaiswal brothers, who have been in the bootlegging business for a long time. Cops suspect that the stock was smuggled in for distribution during the upcoming district panchayat polls as one of Jaisawal brothers has also filled the nomination form for the village panchayat election. Police officials said that they kept a vigil on the highway after receiving a tip-off that a vehicle carrying liquor stock would pass from Kapurai Crossroads. “We intercepted a tempo, driven by Ishaq Muda, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, when it was heading towards Dabhoi Road. When the vehicle was checked, we found thousands of liquor bottles,” a police official said. The cops seized 10,632 small liquor bottles worth Rs 14.76 lakh from the tempo along with the mobile phone and the vehicle. Muda told the police that he got the consignment from Idrish alias Guddu, a citizen of Madhya Pradesh. “The stock was to be delivered to Rakesh Jaiswal and Hitesh Jaiswal in Ratanpur village. We have booked the duo under the Prohibition Act,” the police added. Rakesh and Hitesh, who have been booked and arrested in the past for committing similar offences, are yet to be nabbed. “We searched their home in Ratanpur village but they are on the run. Once they are nabbed, we will be able to ascertain the purpose of bringing in so much liquor,” said C K Raulji, police sub-inspector, taluka police station.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Crimes by rogues in own forces keep cops on toes||KOLKATA: From decommissioning police personnel for assaulting locals and suspected criminals to suspending those following the allegations of molestation and extortion — cops had to act against rogues in their own forces in recent months. The incident on Saturday morning was a reminder of the same as an assistant sub-inspector and a civic volunteer of Bidhannagar Traffic Police had allegedly tormented a woman, who sought help from them. “When the woman approached us for help, she was in trauma and had trouble to trust us while narrating the incident, where two cops had molested her on a bike a few minutes ago. But we immediately took her to the spot of the crime and identified the place. We also took her to Bidhannagar North police station, under which falls the place of the incident,” said an officer of Kasba police station. The accused cops were arrested and decommissioned with immediately effect following an initial probe. The incident took place at a time when cops are conducting a sensitization programme to curb molestation and misbehaviour against women. However, the incident also brought into focus the issue of late night transport, especially when the city has started operating like pre-Covid times. “The transport scene at late night is pathetic. If one cannot book an app-cab, there is no other option to return home,” said Tanima Mondal, a commuter. She had a similar experience last week when she was stuck at Minto Park for several minutes around 11pm. However, she was lucky to have got a cab to reach her Behala home. Bidhannagar MLA Sujit Bose said, “This incident highlights that none is above the law. Strict action will be taken against the two, if found guilty.” Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar also demanded an action against the culprits. “The protector has become a tormentor here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crimes-by-rogues-in-own-forces-keep-cops-on-toes/articleshow/88244615.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||India||Oust Hindutvawadis, bring rule of Hindus, says Rahul Gandhi||JAIPUR: Remove "Hindutvawadis" from power and "bring the rule of Hindus", Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said at a party rally in Jaipur on Sunday, stressing that the two are separate sets-a supporter of Hindutva chooses "satta-graha" to grab authority, while the Hindu searches for truth through satyagraha. He said that Hindutvawadis, not Hindus, were ruling the country since 2014 and 4-5 capitalists controlled the nation's wealth, all government institutions were answerable to "one organisation" and RSS men were ministers' OSDs. "We have to remove these Hindutvawadis and bring the rule of Hindus. Who is a Hindu? He who loves all, embraces all and who fears none and respects all religions." He referred to Mahatma Gandhi as Hindu and Nathuram Godse as Hindutvawadi to highlight his point that a "Hindutvawadi spends his entire life striving for power...his path is not satyagraha, but satta(power)-graha". Calling India a country of Hindus, he said: "You and I are Hindu, but not Hindutvawadi." He blamed the "Hindutvawadi" for doing a handful of capitalists' bidding and letting the country's inflation rise uncontrollably. He read out a list of grocery and fuel prices comparing these with rates in 2014 to underline the rising inflation under the Modi government. "Earlier, the unorganised sector's share was 52%, now it is 20% and 90% of the corporate profit goes to 20 companies." Addressing the rally, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said PM wants to sell public resources that Congress governments built over 70 years to his "crony capitalists". Congress president Sonia Gandhi was present at the meeting, but didn't speak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oust-hindutvawadis-bring-rule-of-hindus-says-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/88245988.cms||Bhanu Pratap Singh

However, with a section of MSRTC employees still protesting, the ST bus services remained paralyzed across the district. Due to this, hundreds of candidates gathered along the highway trying to get any mode of transportation available for them. This affected the flow of traffic at the Dwarka junction of the city, as well as, on the flyover over the Mumbai Agra highway. While the arrival of the candidates on Saturday did not come to anyone's notice, the rush of these candidates to catch any available means of transport to reach back home to Dhule and Mumbai caught the attention of the authorities. With the unavailability of the State Transport buses, the candidates started making a rush at Dwarka and other places along the highway to get cabs towards Dhule and Jalgaon. Some candidates were seen even stopping the trucks on the flyover to return to their destinations. Rohan Ahire, a candidate from Dongar Gaon in Deola taluka said that he preferred a truck over a cab as the fare would be less, and his journey would be more comfortable in the truck than in the cab, in which the passengers were nearly crammed. However, the presence of a huge number of candidates on the flyover raised concern among as many accidents have been reported on the elevated corridor due to the speeding vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/absence-of-st-bus-service-causes-rush-at-dwarka-junction/articleshow/88243850.cms||---

The team from National Institute of Technology (NIT), Trichy, headed by professor Baskar has submitted a report to the district collector and NHAI officials. It was mentioned during the initial investigation itself that technical snag in the hydraulic jack caused the mishap which could have been due to various factors. Further, negligence of contractors was also noted as there was no engineer present at the spot and the workers did not have the required knowledge regarding safety aspects of using the hydraulic jack. Several suggestions and recommendations for ensuring better safety have also been put forth in the report submitted, which is expected to be taken forward as the work on the flyover continues. The 7.3-km-long flyover where the accident took place is part of the Rs 1,200crore Madurai - Natham four-lane highway undertaken by NHAI. Construction of the flyover at Rs 694 crore began in November 2018. On August 28, a guest worker, Akash Singh, 24, had died after the flyover arm collapsed. A case was registered against at least three people, including the project in-charge of JMC Projects, a project engineer, and an in-charge of hydraulic machines contractor, Shellmech.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/faulty-hydraulic-jack-behind-flyover-collapse/articleshow/88245153.cms||---

---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath kicks off free ration scheme in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday mounted a searing attack on previous state governments, accusing them of clandestinely channelizing food grains to the ‘khadyan’ (ration) mafia, who would then smuggle the consignments abroad. The CM made the sharp attack during the launch of a campaign for free distribution of food grains to 15crore poor till March next year. Asserting that foodgrain distribution scheme was being implemented in a transparent manner, Yogi said, diversion and under-weighing of grains were rampant in the previous regime. He categorically raked up the of 2005 foodgrain scam in the previous SP rule to send out a stern message to the Akhilesh Yadav-led political outfit, which has been putting up an aggressive front in the run-up to state polls. “Yeh silsila lagataar chalta raha (This went on for years),” Yogi said, stressing that hunger deaths were reported during 2015-16 when SP was in power. He said, it was after BJP assumed power in 2017 that the state government streamlined food grain distribution to ration card holders. He also slammed Opposition leaders for deliberately misleading the poor on Covid-19 vaccination. “Opposition leaders knew that if all poor took vaccines, they would end up in a political exile,” he said. Reiterating that his government was prepared to counter the possible third Corona wave, Yogi said, the campaign is in addition to upgraded medical facilities, free vaccination and aggressive testing to counter the pandemic. This comes in addition to foodgrain distribution done by the Centre under its flagship PM Gareen Kalyan Anna Yojana, which also entails distribution of 5kg foodgrain to the poor. “The joint campaign of the Centre and the state government reflects benefits accrued from the double-engine government,” Yogi said. The campaign was seen as BJP’s fresh attempt to reach out to the poor hitherto hit by economic slowdown and reverse migration of labourers during the first wave. The PMGKAY, which was rolled out between April to November last year, had benefited 80 crore people every month. The UP government too joined the Centre in wheeling out food grains to the poor in April, May and June. During the second wave, the Centre carried out campaigns from May to October. The UP government too chipped in to provide food grains in June, July and August. The Centre later extended the scheme till March next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-kicks-of-free-ration-scheme-launches-food-mafia-jibe-at-samajwadi-party/articleshow/88245154.cms||Pankaj Shah

This was done to double the farmers income — a promise made by the BJP before 2017elections — the minister added. “Nearly 18 projects, including the Saryu Canal National Project, Arjun Sahayak Canal Project, and Bansagar Project, that were pending for years have been completed and made operational in the past four and a half years of our government which will facilitate the irrigation of additional 20 lakh hectares of land, benefiting more than 50 lakh farmers of the state,” Singh said. The Saryu Canal Project was envisaged in 1971-72, while work started on it in 1978. Initially when the project was launched in 1978 to expand irrigation capacity in Bahraich and Gonda districts, it was called Ghaghra Canal. However, in 1982-83, the scope of the project was expanded with the inclusion of nine districts of the trans-Ghaghra-Rapti-Rohini region of Purvanchal, and it was renamed the Saryu Project. The minister said the previous UP governments neglected major agricultural projects which would have solved many of the problems of farmers decades ago. The governments did not even bother to allocate sufficient funds for the irrigation projects so that they could be completed on time. The BJP government after assuming office in 2017, provided sufficient funds and expedited work on the project. “A total of Rs 5,189 crore was spent on this project from 1978 to 2017, whereas from 2017 till now, a total of Rs 4,613 crore has been spent by the government. Over 14 lakh hectares of land can be irrigated by this project, which will benefit about 30 lakh farmers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/18-pending-irrigation-projects-completed-under-yogi-rule-min/articleshow/88245158.cms||---

A KMC medical officer, who runs a health clinic in Tollygunge, said that they are able to offer routine health check-up, conduct pathological tests and take up immunization programmes after a long time since the queue for Covid vaccination is on the wane. All KMC-run health centres had been mobilised for the vaccination drives. “Even a month ago, we would cater to the vaccination needs of over 100 citizens a day at an urban health clinic. Now the number has gone down to 50. So, we can assign our doctors and paramedical staff to look after other medical and immunization needs of the citizens,” said a KMC health department official. In Kolkata, 36.6 lakh people have been completely vaccinated while 49.1 lakh people have received their first dose. Since December 1, the total vaccine turnout has reduced to less than 17,000 per day. On Sunday, very few people turned up in the KMC health clinics for vaccination.

In all, funds amounting to Rs 5 crore were distributed to the depositors who had applied to the corporation for relief. The funds were given to the depositors by Union minister of state for health and family Bharati Pawar at an event organised in the city on Sunday. The event was a part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s programme of presenting cheques to five beneficiaries at the Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi as a token. The PM’s programme was broadcast live. Pawar said the Government of India was very sensitive to the demands of the people and, therefore, after 27 years, the decision to increase the sum insured through the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation was taken. The MP added that the new norms ensure that the refund process is carried out in maximum 90 days. This means, people do not have to wait for decades to get their hard-earned money back, she said. “Through the amendments, PM Modi has provided a relief to investors as well as the bankers,” Pawar said. The MP noted there were more than 10,000 depositors of the two private cooperative banks in the district who were stuck in financial problems. She appealed to the bank authorities to the reach out to the depositors so that they van get their funds. She also urged the bankers to have efficient and Marathi-speaking officials in the rural areas so that not only the bankers would understand what the people want, but can also help people understand the government schemes. Divesh Dinkar, the general manager of the Bank of Maharashtra, which had organised the programme in Nashik, appealed to the people to take benefit of the government schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/289-depositors-of-private-co-op-banks-get-back-funds/articleshow/88243295.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Justice Subramonium Prasad said the menace had assumed alarming proportions in the recent years, which had a deadly impact on the society as a whole. The high court dismissed the bail application of a man, accused of supplying drugs to the peddlers for distribution to consumers. “The effects of drugs on society have been enunciated in several judgments. It has been observed that organised activities of the underworld and the clandestine smuggling of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and illegal trafficking in such drugs and substances is resulting in drug addiction among sizeable section of the public, particularly the adolescents and students of both sexes…(sic),” the court said in an order on December 6. It further noted that the investigation was at a nascent stage and it had come on record that the man was allegedly involved in another offence under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and, therefore, he was likely to commit another offence while on bail.

Those who razed my mosque have hurt the very foundation of India and rule of law. Did anyone from SP, BSP or Congress say anything? They have shut their eyes, because it was my mosque, not theirs," said Owaisi, while addressing a gathering at GIC ground here on Sunday. He reiterated his party would field candidates in 100 seats and form alliances with smaller parties in the run-up to assembly elections early next year. He also targeted Samajwadi Party for again keeping mum after death of four Muslims during anti-CAA protests in Kidwai Nagar, Unnao and Kasganj. “Also, Akhilesh did nothing for SP’s tallest Muslim leader, Azam Khan, who is languishing in jail,” he said.Owaisi further said, despite Muslims forming 19% of the population in Uttar Pradesh, they don’t have a leader. “No Muslim ever became even deputy CM. Muslims have to fight for their share and a leadership has to be created. No political party is concerned about Muslims and the community is not a prisoner of any party. They can make their own decisions, but need to unite and show the power of their votes in the elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/babri-my-masjid-why-sp-bsp-cong-silent-over-demolition-asks-owaisi/articleshow/88245170.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: To save wildlife, Thane h’way may be elevated at two spots||Thane: It’s a plan to protect wildlife while upgrading urban infrastructure. Two stretches of an arterial state highway at Thane are slated to be elevated to pre-empt wildlife from being run over on Ghodbunder Road while allowing free vehicular passage on the stretch. Wildlife, especially leopards, are known to frequent the stretch that skirts the eastern fringe of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, said officials. The state’s road agency, MSRDC, has plans to elevate the existing Ghodbunder Road at two stretches -- between Gaimukh and Fountain Hotel -- and have underpasses at the two stretches. The busy road will be aligned to a freewayproposed to come up nearby. Ghodbunder Road links Thane to Mumbai’s western suburbs, at Borivli. The changes that would have to be made to the proposed freeway could then further escalate its initial cost. Currently, the estimated cost of constructing the freeway is Rs 1,200 crore, said senior MSRDC officials. Experts said that the stretch of Ghodbunder Road that lies beyond Thane city, especially near Chena creek and beyond, is frequented by wild cats in search of watering holes. While local forest officials said there have been no wildlife casualties here in the recent past, experts said it is necessary to elevate the road, considering that the state has lost 67 leopards in road mishaps between January last year and this May. The issue of constructing the passage was discussed recently at a meeting when the need to raise the road to avoid man-wildlife conflict was felt. An expert panel from the state wildlife department is now likely to survey Ghodbunder road to recommend the spots to MSRDC, officials said. An official who was present at the meeting said that the plan is that the existing four lane Ghodbunder road will be elevated at two spots and will be aligned with the proposed 4.6km proposed freeway through ramps. The stretch beneath the elevated stretch could then be left untouched for wild animals to move freely below. “While one of the stretches near Fountain hotel has already been identified, the other near the Gaimukh-end will be identified by an expert team from the state wildlife board after which MSRDC will revise the drawing plan for the elevated road,” said an official. “The idea is to ensure that wildlife, especially leopards, get their right of way and don’t interfere with heavy traffic son the stretch.” Shiv Sena parliamentarian Rajan Vichare, who was part of the meeting, said that he has been pushing for speedy implementation of the elevated road that will not just help wildlife but also benefit motorists. “The project has been languishing for the past several years. I have asked the wildlife department and MSRDC to hasten up surveys and ensure the freeway is constructed soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-save-wildlife-thane-hway-may-be-elevated-at-two-spots/articleshow/88245756.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) chief Kailas Jadhav and district collector Suraj Mandhare have both have given their consent to start the schools provided the schools adhere to all Covid norms including sanitisation of classrooms, vaccination of teachers and non-teaching staff, parental consent etc. When it was pointed out that deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray would take a decision on reopening of school on December 15 — in the wake of Omicron cases being detected in Maharashtra — collector Mandhare said that there was no formal order to that effect yet. He said the administration would abide by the order when it comes. Meanwhile, more than 1,300 schools in the rural areas have expressed their readiness to start in-person classes claiming that they have the infrastructure ready and have even got parental consent to start the schools. “Schools will be starting only in villages that have not had any Covid case in at least the past 20 days. What number of schools that actually start functioning on Monday remains to be seen. It may be noted that they can start any time after December 13,” Rajeev Mhaskar, the education officer of Nashik Zilla Parishad, said. Within the NMC limits too, all 91 schools of the civic body are set to start classes. Of the 869 teachers, 859 have been fully vaccinated and arrangements have been made to ensure the children maintain safe physical distance from each, said Sunita Dhangar, the NMC education officer. Similarly, out of the 302 private schools, 285 have announced that they will start functioning from the day one. They have reported vaccination of 4,270 out of 4,273 teachers. Both the NMC and the private schools have been linked with health centres and private hospitals for any medical help required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nearly-1700-schools-in-nashik-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/88243318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Pawan said he made an alliance with BJP on condition that Amaravati should be the capital of Andhra Pradesh. “YSRC has 22 MPs and still they are not able to raise the Vizag steel plant issue. With only one MLA I am able to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and request him to reconsider the decision on disinvestment of Vizag steel plant which is emotionally connected to the people of north coastal Andhra Pradesh,” Pawan said.  Pawan said he is happy with Amith Shah’s statement at Tirupati supporting Amaravati as the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

---||Delhi||Passage on women in CBSE question paper sparks row||NEW DELHI: A Class X English question paper of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) where comprehension passages spoke of “emancipation of the wife” destroying parents’ authority over children and how a wife’s authority depended on the “formal obedience” she gave to the husband, has created an uproar on social media. Congress functionary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday tweeted an image of the question paper and wrote, “Unbelievable! Are we really teaching children this drivel?” Unbelievable! Are we really teaching children this drivel?Clearly the BJP Government endorses these retrograde vi… https://t.co/XXvw82Z7YX— Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) 1639320049000The passage in question spoke of how, a century ago, a wife’s subordination to the husband – “the master of the house” – would teach “children and servants” their place. “What people were slow to observe was that the emancipation of the wife destroyed the parent’s authority over the children. The mother did not exemplify the obedience upon which she still tried to insist. There was more room now for disagreement between the parents, enabling the child to appeal from one to another, eventually ignoring both. In bringing the man down from his pedestal the wife and mother deprived herself, in fact, of the means of discipline”, a section of the passage read. The four options given to students to choose an appropriate title for the passage included options like “Who is responsible for indiscipline among children, Collapse of discipline at home, Place of children and servants at home and Child Psychology.” Several schools that TOI spoke to, however, said that they had not received this particular question paper set. A senior CBSE official said, “A passage in one set of the English paper of CBSE Class X first term examination held yesterday has received mixed reactions from a few parents and students stating that “it seems to support regressive notions on family and allegedly promotes gender stereotyping”. The matter will be referred to subject experts for considered views as per the pre set procedures of the board.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/passage-on-women-in-cbse-question-paper-sparks-row/articleshow/88244653.cms||---
---||Delhi||Several PhD aspirants from marginalised sections given low scores, claims JNUSU||New Delhi: Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union has claimed that several PhD aspirants from marginalised sections have been awarded low scores in their viva voce. Some students also claimed that the interview panels were formed arbitrarily and despite presenting their research proposals, they were awarded low scores that fell short of the required cutoff. Umesh Yadav, a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) scholar who had applied for PhD in economics, said, “For JRF scholars, the interview marks have a 100% weightage as they are exempt from the written examination. This means they are left completely at the mercy of the interview panels. For viva voce, formation of these panels took place arbitrarily and a majority of the faculty members were sidelined in the process. This amounts to discrimination.” Many professors claimed that the ratio of seats via-a-via students who were called for the interview was very high this year. Professor Moushumi Basu said, “In many instances, for a vacancy of seven seats, over 100 students were called for the viva voce each day. Considering this was happening online, there were technical issues too. How is it possible to judge a person within this short period? There was no concept of ratio. Some students complained that they were uncomfortable. The time for interviews was much less than earlier.” “In some cases, it was also seen that students had not gone through the profiles of the centres properly as their research proposals did not match with what was being offered,” added Basu. Meanwhile, a senior official of the JNU administration said the claims raised by students were baseless. “Everything was conducted according to the procedure. The students are demanding the presence of observers, but the fact remains that observers have always been there. This is the norm, especially for women candidates and those from the reserved categories. All the reserved seats will be filled by those from the reserved categories itself, so where is the discrimination? Until the final data comes, it is wrong to make such claims,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/several-phd-aspirants-from-marginalised-sections-given-low-scores-claims-jnusu/articleshow/88244651.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Governor Arif Mohammed Khan junks Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s claims on VC postings||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has rejected all the claims made by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the appointment of the vice-chancellors of Kannur and Kalady Sanskrit Universities. While replying to the chief minister, the governor said he had pointed out that the reappointment and giving extension are two different things for the appointment of Kannur vice-chancellor. “It is against the norms and a reappointment cannot be made for a vice-chancellor. But the advocate general had come to me with the legal opinion, which I never had asked for. So that means that he was acting under somebody’s instruction. But I had to sign in the file since I was not ready to go for a confrontation with the government,” said Khan. On the appointment of the vice-chancellor of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, the governor said he was given only one name by the search committee and that was the reason why he had returned the file to the state government. He also alleged that the government did not get time even after 13 months to fix the salary of the vice-chancellor of the Sree Narayanaguru Open University. The governor said he was not ready to reply to the chief minister through the media and hence he was not going into much details about the issues again. “I have stood for rules and norms. However, I am not able to perform my duties due to the pressure from the government. I have signed in the files under pressure. But I cannot do it any longer,” he added. Earlier in the day, Khan said he was ready to review his decision only if the government could guarantee that there would be no political interventions in the universities. He said all the files pertaining to the universities are being redirected to the chief minister since he no longer remains the chancellor. The chancellor post is not a constitutional one and it is only a responsibility given to the governor as per the law enacted by the state government. Hence the state government can take back this responsibility through an ordinance, he added. “You have the power to amend the Act. I have already said this. The assembly is not in session, so bring an ordinance and I will sign it immediately. I have been watching with great pain for the last two-and-a-half years. If you want the vice-chancellors to do your bidding, do it yourself. Don’t use me,” said the governor. He said he did not want to be in confrontation with his government and that was the reason he approved many of the decisions even though it was against his “better judgment”. “If I do not sign in those files, then I will be called as a ‘resident’,” said the governor. On the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor, the governor said it was against his better judgment and he went out of his way to avoid a fight with the government. He let the government have its say in the reappointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor so as not to provoke the government. “If I had put my foot down, they would have called me a ‘resident’. I did not want to be in a state of perpetual fight with the government. I tried to accommodate them, but have also told them not to go beyond a point. Now they have gone beyond the limit,” he said. In the case of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, he said he was given only one name. “There were seven applicants, all of them highly qualified. But I was given just one name. I then asked what happened to the other six and I was told they were all incompetent. I was in effect being told that highly-qualified teachers produced by our system were not good,” said the governor. “The universities need functional autonomy and there should not be any political interference. With the present set up it is not possible and hence I have communicated everything clearly to the state government in the letter written to the chief minister,” the governor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/guv-junks-cms-claims-on-vc-postings/articleshow/88244669.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Driver leaves auto, booked like quarantine-flouting international flier!||AHMEDABAD: An abandoned autorickshaw may spread the Covid-19 infection — much like international travellers from at-risk countries do by sneaking out of quarantine! At least that is what cops in the city seem to believe because they have booked the driver of an autorickshaw under the charges usually reserved for foreign fliers caught breaching the quarantine rules. On the night of December 8, a team of the railway police found an autorickshaw parked outside the entry gate of the Kalupur station. The driver was missing. The cops searched frantically for the driver, who returned to the spot after about 15 minutes. He had been away to answer the call of nature. But cops made the determination that he had been utterly negligent in leaving his autorickshaw abandoned in the times of the corona pandemic. The cops decided that he must be booked for disobeying a notification issued by the city police commissioner. During the police procedure, the cops called in two panch witnesses to file a rock-solid case against the driver, Imrankhan Khokhar, 32, a resident of Kalupur. An FIR was duly filed against him. The FIR registered with the railway police says: “We were enforcing the social distancing rule in accordance with the police commissioner’s notification.” The FIR adds: “We found that the accused had left his autorickshaw outside the railway station and thereby had showed negligence which could affect people’s health.” Khokhar has been charged under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 188 for disregarding orders issued by a government authority. This is the same section that has been slapped on about nine persons who have returned from countries deemed high risk in relation to the Omicron variant of coronavirus. They were caught flouting the rule to stay in isolation for 14 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/driver-leaves-auto-booked-like-quarantine-flouting-intl-flier/articleshow/88243917.cms||---

The minimum temperature could touch 16°C even as the chilly northwesterly winds are finally flowing into the region. The mercury could slide further to 15°C by Wednesday, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 18.2°C on Sunday, three degrees above normal. Snowfall across Jammu and Kashmir has triggered icy winds that have started travelling southeastwards. It could take a few days more for the chill to reach and settle down across north India, before it reaches Bengal, said weathermen. “It will travel across Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar-Jharkhand before reaching the state. We expect the mercury to drop to 15°C by the middle of the week,” said RMC director G K Das. The gap between the maximum and minimum temperatures will now start widening, he added. On Monday, the maximum temperature could slide up to 26°C. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 25.3°C on Sunday. Last week, the city received sporadic drizzles, which got heavier even as a thick cloud cover persisted. The unseasonal rain and clouds delayed a mercury slide, which is now imminent, said the Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/receding-cloud-cover-may-bring-temp-down-today/articleshow/88244656.cms||---

The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has submitted a detail project report (DPR) to the state finance department for its nod on demolishing the damaged portion of the bridge and reconstructing it in next few years. Almost 70% of the 60-year-old bridge is damaged and will have to be dismantled while the rest 30% of the structure will be repaired and strengthened, according to the KMDA officials. Officials said that the bridge, having incurred internal structural damages due to excessive corrosion, is beyond repairs. The KMDA repaired the bridge on a temporary basis recently till the new reconstructed bridge comes up in the next few years. “The bridge has undergone short-term repairs so that the structure can be kept for next few years. We have mooted the reconstruction of the bridge at the same location. The project DPR, which has been placed before the state government, is likely to be cleared soon, after which the KMDA will float tenders to appoint an agency for the reconstruction of the bridge,” said an official. The reconstruction of the bridge is necessary as the existing structure may not be able to take the extra load of vehicles for long. “The objective of the short-term repairs is to strengthen the bridge for the next few years till long term measures are taken up,” said a bridge expert. Last year, the authorities had assessed the structural condition of the bridge and found internal damages with heavy corrosion on the piers. As for other bridges in the city, the KMDA has already taken up the repair work of Baghajatin ROB on EM Bypass and is preparing DPRs for repairing Aurobindo setu and Sealdah bridge. The bearings of Aurobindu setu need to be replaced while Sealdah bridge will undergo overall strengthening work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-seeks-fin-dept-nod-for-kalighat-bridge-reconstruction/articleshow/88244654.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Kerala’s recycling capacity of hazardous waste also dropped from 9.64% to 2.38% between 2016-17 and 2019-20 although the hazardous waste generation in the state increased by over 700% in the same period, the figures show.  The figures for efficiency of the waste collection show that Kerala recorded 19% and 25% for 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively. Going by the figures, Kerala is the only state which has recorded way below 50% efficiency in waste collection in the country.  The table does not provide information on Bihar and Gujarat, however, a majority of states have recorded efficiency of above 80%. Even with regard to the treatment of waste generated in the state, Kerala records 52% for 2019-20.  The data presented in Parliament has been sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board. The pitiably low percentage of collection efficiency as shown in figures could also be a result of poor data management in the state.  Annual reports of CPCB over the years have often showed a repetitive remark for Kerala; information not received.  However, even a project document prepared by the Suchitwa Mission, the nodal agency for waste management for a World Bank sponsored solid waste management project, reaffirms the pathetic figures of Kerala at the national level.  The main objective touted under Kerala solid waste management project is to increase the institutional capacity of local bodies. The project is being pushed mainly with the contention that local bodies had failed in waste management. The document prepared by Suchitwa Mission for the solid waste management project lists down lapses on the part of local bodies.  The service delivery gap assessment carried out as part of the project pinpointed various glitches in the existing system. It noted that the majority of urban local bodies did not comply with solid waste management rules by not providing door-to-door collection services and processing of biodegradable waste at the city and regional level.  It also noted that compliance by bulk generators to process biodegradable waste within the premises is low and that local bodies did not provide door-to-door collection service for hotels and restaurants. It pointed out that urban local bodies failed in setting up biodegradable waste treatment facilities which resulted in biodegradable waste being disposed off in open spaces, water bodies, dumpsites, etc. causing problems of health & environment, the document notes.  Another contention against the need for waste collection is the stress on source-level waste management. By 2021, 84,531 biogas plants, 3.14 lakh composting plants , 2003 community composting units, and 98 community biogas plants have been installed in the state in the last four years. However, no real-time monitoring report is available on the present functionality of these units. As for Trivandrum corporation, a good percentage of units have gone out of use due to lack of maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kerala-on-bottom-rung-in-trash-pickup/articleshow/88244662.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Cops scuffled with the agitators and resorted to lathi-charge to lift the roadblock. According to police sources, Mainuddin Khan (19), a local criminal, had been arrested on December 6 from a hideout near Titagarh Tata Gate area for being involved in the robbery at a local school. He had been remanded in judicial custody for 14 days after being produced in a Barrackpore court. Khan was lodged in Barrackpore sub-jail, where he reportedly fell ill seriously. He was shifted to Dum Dum central jail and admitted to the jail hospital, where he died late on Saturday night. On being informed about his death, his relatives and neighbours gathered in front of the Titagarh police station and launched an agitation, alleging that Khan had been beaten to death. “After arresting him, cops assaulted him severely in the prison. Even after taking him to Dum Dum central jail, cops thrashed him, which claimed his life,” said Simran Khatun, sister of the victim. However, cops have denied the allegation. “A medical test was conducted on him before he had been produced in the court and kept in jail custody.

---||Lucknow||PM Narendra Modi has achieved what couldn’t be accomplished in a thousand years: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||VARANASI: Kashi is witness to an unprecedented creation of history. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has achieved what could not be accomplished in a thousand years. He has paved the way for rejuvenation of Indian pride which was waiting for almost four hundred years.  Kashi Vishwanath Dham is an example of his determination. Centuries will now bow down to this achievement and religious faith is swelling with pride. The wheel of history is in the golden era of good fortune. Manikarnika's Ganga, entangled in Shiva's hair, has found the dham of her adoration. The dream of Queen Ahilyabai Holkar's eyes has found shelter in the words of a karmayogi. A golden ark of history has been built in Kashi in the form of Kashi Vishwanath Dham which will continue to illuminate this dham of religion and faith with its radiance and energy for millennia to come. On KVT's HistoryFor a thousand years, the Kashi Vishwanath temple endured the cruelty and destruction by foreign invaders. Today, that injustice has been undone. This is the great wheel of time. Who would have thought that four hundred years ago the Kashi Vishwanath temple complex, which had become a victim of Aurangzeb's cruelty, was torn apart and thereafter 250 hundred years ago the Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore had laid the foundation to revive the temple. On the same foundation, PM Modi would raise the golden palace of the faith of lakhs and crores of Shiva devotees. They say greatness is an idea. One thought creates history. The Vision Behind KV DhamThe grand Kashi Vishwanath Dham, which has been recreated today, was one such idea that grew in the mind of Prime Minister Modi. The ancient splendor of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, has become even more luminous and glorious in the light of this modern new construction. On the occasion of 150 years of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, the Prime Minister dreamed of Kashi Vishwanath Dham Yojana to fulfill Gandhiji's dream. His resolve was to renovate the pagodas and spaces around the temple, connect Baba Vishwanath with the Ganges and restore the Ananda Kanan form of the oldest living city in the world. This resolution is being fulfilled today in all its divinity and grandeur. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the one who connected this great pilgrimage with its historical, religious and cultural aura with the Mokshadayini Ganga through the Kashi Vishwanath Dham. It is the vision of Modi ji that the premise of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, which was not even 5000 square feet, now has increased to 5 lakh 27 thousand 730 square feet under the Kashi Vishwanath Expansion and Beautification Project. The thought process behind this dream project of PM Modi is unprecedented. The devotees coming to witness it, will get to know the entire history of Varanasi, the city of Shiva along with Kashi Vishwanath Dham. For this great purpose, a great campaign was being run to get the information mentioned in the Upanishads, Vedas and Puranas translated into Hindi and get them printed on the walls of the Dham. Knowing the history of this city which rests on the trident of Shiva is like drinking the nectar of knowledge. This hypothesis was also not untouched from the point of view of the PM. The ChallengesWe had herculean challenges in front of us when it came to the rejuvenation project of Kashi Vishwanath. Baba's temple was in a stifling atmosphere. It had to expand. The owners of the buildings and properties around the temple were to be identified and convinced to participate in this Mahayagya. Along with purchasing the properties, the shopkeepers, dharamshalas, monasteries and other campuses associated with them were to be rehabilitated and provided an alternative means of livelihood. Regional protests, picketing demonstrations, agitations, and residents/business of unauthorized occupants and local problems of the public were to be resolved.  The settlement of all this as well as the construction of the Dham in the stipulated time was a big challenge. Only Baba Vishwanath's blessings could have helped in completing this. For the construction of this ambitious Dham, the survey done by the architects required more than three hundred properties to be removed around the temple for the desired area. We identified three hundred properties for this purpose and bought 320 houses at a price above the market price as the objective of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham was to give architectural shape by integrating the features in the geographical area. With this vision, the ancient temples under the scheme were renovated by developing mythological, religious, spiritual, cultural and architectural aesthetics. Seven special stones including red sandstone of Makrana, Chunar have been used in the Dham. The major attractions within this complex include the expansion of the main temple complex of 2,100 square feet to 29,000 square feet along with Bhogshala, Passenger Facilitation Center, Spiritual Library, Mumukshu Bhavan, Vedic Center, Multipurpose Hall, City Museum, Varanasi Gallery etc. in full grandeur. A Dream Come TrueStarting from the reconstruction of this Dham in March 2018, today this holy journey has reached its final stage.

The milk union wants to start selling Kutch’s salt along with milk. The dairy union will start research to see the viability of selling Kutch’s salt under the brand name of Amul after a feasibility study in Kutch and neighbouring Surendranagar district which count for 76 % of India’s total salt production. Gujarat’s total salt production stands at 2.20 crore tonnes per annum. “We are mulling this idea of salt. We want to procure salt, process it and sell it. We will appoint a consultant to find out whether this idea is viable and based on that report, I will put the proposal in GCMMF’s board for marketing,” said Sarhad Dairy’s chairman Valamji Humbal, who is also vice chairman of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul. The dairy union, which is a member of GCMMF, wants to form salt cooperative societies on the lines of village level milk societies that form the backbone of Gujarat’s vast dairy sector. “If it materializes, it can also help agariyas (saltpan workers)earn more just like our milk producers. We want to get an estimate of investment in machinery and purchasing of land and if all the research indicates that this project is viable, we will kick start the project,” he said. Simultaneously, the milk union also wants to diversify in juice production. In October 2020, it had appointed a consultant to submit a report on producing fruit juice and market it under the brand name Amul. The dairy is planning to make kesar mango, pomegranate and date juice. “For fruit juice, we had a couple of meetings with GCMMF but because of Covid-19 induced pandemic, the project could not take off. We are trying to eliminate middlemen wherever possible to increase farmers’ income. The juice project should now take off,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/sarhad-dairy-to-milk-salt-pans-in-kutch/articleshow/88244274.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The police said that the two trustees and employees of the institute will be questioned together to ascertain if they have stated facts. “All the four including Sanjeev Shah, Preeti Nair, Vaishnavi Taparia and the institute’s mentor have been asked to come together for the questioning. We will verify all the facts and corroborate their statements,” said a crime branch official. Shah, Nair and Taparia have already been questioned once after they were booked for covering up the 18-year-old girl’s alleged rape that happened in October. The Navsari girl committed suicide inside a train on November 4 at Valsad. “If their replies are not satisfactory, they may be placed under arrest. The trustees had read the girl’s diary wherein she had mentioned that she was raped. But they didn’t inform the police and even the girl’s parents. Had they taken some step, the girl’s life could have been saved,” the official added. The girl had been pursuing a two-year course at the institute and often travelled for work by auto. She had mentioned in her diary that an autorickshaw driver and his aide gang-raped her in Vaccine Institute Ground on October 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/oasis-trustees-employees-to-be-questioned-again/articleshow/88243894.cms||---

The city corporation has decided to fence a nearly 3 km stretch of the riverbank and also plant saplings there. The district administration had directed the city corporation to prevent people from dumping debris on the riverbank and riverbed. Accordingly, fences with barbed wires tied to concrete beams have been made, to prevent trucks from dumping debris on the riverbank. Signboards have been put up, warning penal action against those who dump debris from construction sites and other places, on the banks of the Phalguni River. It may be recalled that TOI had highlighted the alleged reclamation of riverbed in its columns in September. Despite awareness and warnings on part of the authorities on the issue, dumping of debris into the Phalguni riverbed was continuing on the stretch between Bagrakuloor and Kuloor. Nearly two acres of riverbed was already converted into a landfill by miscreants, by dumping debris, plastic and other waste. The MCC also lodged an FIR in this regard at Kavoor police station. Recently, the city corporation commenced the fencing work, and it has plans to plant nearly 3,500 saplings by the side of the riverbank. People from the locality had complained to the district administration and MCC, when unknown persons started dumping debris on the riverbank. Following this, deputy commissioner K V Rajendra and MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar, along with officials, visited the spot and took initiatives to prevent the encroachments. MCC commissioner Akshy Sridhar said the fence will prevent trucks from entering the riverbanks and dumping debris. Meanwhile, land on the riverbank will be levelled, and saplings will be planted with the help of the forest department. Saplings will be planted soon after the fence is erected, he added. The DC said that CCTV cameras will be installed soon, to prevent illegal activities on the riverbank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/fence-being-erected-to-prevent-encroachment-of-phalguni-riverbank/articleshow/88243945.cms||---

In one case, a family that lost a loved one in a motor accident was awarded a compensation of Rs1.08 crore. In another instance before the Esplanade court, a Rs 450-crore dispute was also settled in a case filed under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act. Hitendra Wani, senior civil judge and secretary at the district legal services authority (DLSA), Mumbai, said, “A total of 69,774 cases were kept before the National Lok Adalat, out of which more than 7,445 cases were settled.” The judge added that this time, motor accident compensation cases, recovery claims of banks, criminal compoundable cases, marital disputes, lawsuits filed by electricity companies, financial institutions, as well as telecom companies, along with recovery cases by traffic police, were placed before the Lok Adalat. A particularly unique aspect this time round was that at the city civil and sessions court, all Lok Adalat panels comprised women judges, advocates and staff members. “Disposal of record-breaking cases in the National Lok Adalat proved that women are naturally good at resolving disputes,” said Urmila Joshi-Phalke, principal judge and chairman of Mumbai DLSA. Ten matters involving parties spread across different parts of the world were settled through e-Lok Adalat. The e- Lok Adalat ensures that parties can settle their disputes without coming to court. Among the matters was a dispute between a sister and her brothers over a city flat. “In this matter, two parties attended court through video conferencing from USA and Switzerland,” DLSA said. At the motor accident claims tribunal, 439 disputes were settled, helping secure total compensation of Rs16.72 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lok-adalat-makes-record-recovery-of-rs-699cr-in-city/articleshow/88245775.cms||---

Rules say there must be compensatory afforestation of 10 times the number of trees cut, forest department officials said. “We should be planting 3.6 lakh saplings as per the rules. The NHAI (national highways authority of India) has already allotted funds for the purchase of the saplings. We are now looking for land outside our jurisdiction. It is important to maintain greenery,” said Anil Kumar Patel, Bijnor divisional forest officer (DFO). DFO M Semmaran, who was recently transferred from Bijnor to Kanpur zoo, said, "In Bijnor district, around 15,500 trees were felled along both sides of NH 119 (Delhi-Pauri), 16,000 on NH 74 (Haridwar-Nainital), 4,310 on Bijnor-Nagina Road in the past year and a half. Besides, 4,000 more trees are to be cut on NH 119; and the process to get permission for the same is underway.” Expressing concern, officials of the forest department claimed that the natural habitat of birds were destroyed during the NH widening work, and may also have serious health issues and other repercussions for locals. Former DFO Salil Shukla said, "Unfortunately, we are destroying trees on which our survival depends. The loss of so many trees can cause desertification, soil erosion, growing of fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and a host of issues for the local population. Deforestation may pose a serious threat to the existence of several species of birds." Research scholar at Gurukula Kangri University in Haridwar and president of a biodiversity club in Bijnor, Mayank Malik, said, "Birds have different ways of building nests. Rapid deforestation poses a direct challenge to their survival. Reduction in bird habitats may increase the chances of territorial fights among species. Ultimately, if they fail to find a satisfactory environment, their number will gradually dwindle leading to extinction."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/36k-trees-cut-for-road-widening-in-bijnor-in-1-yr-but-no-land-for-compensatory-afforestation/articleshow/88243952.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Delhi||Students pitch start-up ideas on business blaster programme||New Delhi: The Delhi government’s “Business Blasters” programme aired its third episode on Sunday, with students pitching start-up ideas ranging from developing water soluble plastic, low-cost computers to advertising solutions for small vendors. Over 100 experiments later, to develop the biodegradable substitute to plastic, students will now be taking it to the market after receiving an investment of Rs 1.5 lakh, officials said. With a focus on protecting the environment for the future, the project called “Biothene,” presented by student Mohd Wasim, along with his teammates, aims to reduce pollution from plastic. “With rigorous research and our collective vision, we created a plastic that is water soluble, decomposable and safe if ingested by land or aquatic animals. We believe that the judges had some pertinent questions that will help us refine our product,” said Wasim. A group of 15 year olds also received a seed investment of Rs 75,000 for their project “Tech up”, which aims to make low-cost and high-performing computers available. “We are building these PCs using simple technological hacks and managed to scale it using the seed money from the government. With this additional investment, I am sure we will be able to scale it further,” said Ansh Verma, a student of School of Excellence, Dwarka. A group of four girls from a Delhi government school also received a cumulative investment of Rs 70,000 for their project “Gr8”, which involves designing advertisements for vendors and shopkeepers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/students-pitch-start-up-ideas-on-business-blaster-programme/articleshow/88244709.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

BJP state president K Surendran said on Sunday that higher education minister R Bindu should also be immediately ousted from the ministry, in connection with the ‘re-appointment of vice-chancellor of Kannur university Gopinath Ravindran’ by allegedly violating the university statute. Surendran said that with the governor asking the chief minister to take over the post of the chancellor of the universities in state, the chief minister has become a laughing stock. He said that the governor has expressed concerns of the people of the state. He added that never in the history of the state had a governor expressed his distrust of the government and it is because the chief minister had no objective answers to the points raised by the governor. Demanding the immediate cancellation of all political and backdoor appointments in Kerala, Surendran claimed that all charges are directly aimed at the CM. The head of the state has raised serious charges against the CM of the state. Each line in the governor’s letter says that the CM has no right to continue in the post, and if there is any righteousness left in the CM, he would have resigned by now, Surendran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-for-judicial-probe-in-univ-appointments/articleshow/88244676.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Environment minister Gopal Rai calls meet to assess bad-air situation in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Environment minister Gopal Rai will conduct a meeting with various departments on Monday to review the capital’s air quality. Besides, the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) will meet in the next few days as the Supreme Court has given it a week’s time on easing anti-pollution curbs. A Delhi government official said, “The minister will hold a meeting with senior officials of the environment department, municipal corporations, Delhi Fire Service, PWD, DSIIDC and others.” After recording the cleanest October, Delhi saw its worst November air since Central Pollution Control Board started measuring Air Quality Index (AQI) in 2015. This November witnessed 11 “severe” air quality days. However, the pollution levels remained high in the first week of December and one “severe” air quality day and four “very poor” air quality days were recorded. Air quality improved in the second week of December and there have been mostly “poor” days. Considering this, the environment department and CAQM may give some relaxations in the restrictions. Supreme Court had asked CAQM on Friday to examine pleas for lifting the construction ban and relaxing restrictions on industrial units in Delhi-NCR within a week. Delhi government on December 2 had ordered the closure of schools, colleges, skill development and training institutes and libraries (except where exams were being conducted) till further orders. Construction activities were banned following a Supreme Court order. On December 7, CAQM had ordered immediate closure of NCR industries not running on cleaner fuels despite the availability of gas infrastructure and supply. The entry of trucks carrying non-essential items, except CNG or electric ones, was also banned in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-calls-meet-to-assess-bad-air-situation/articleshow/88244687.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||How you exercise is key to cardiac health: Experts||HYDERABAD: With many young, active and fit individuals suffering cardiac events during or after a strenuous exercise, the general notion that exercising makes people healthy is under scrutiny. While the chances of a cardiac arrest due to exercising with caution are much less when compared to a cardiac event due to not exercising and leading an unhealthy lifestyle, experts sound caution while exercising. The most important thing while doing heavy strenuous exercise like weights and running on a treadmill is that the heart rate or pulse rate needs to be monitored. “In case of low impact exercises like walking, swimming, etc., monitoring heart rate is not a must, but when doing high intensity workouts even a completely healthy person needs to monitor these levels,” Dr Rajasekhar Varada, senior consultant cardiologist, Yashoda Hospitals, said. “The ideal is around 70% of the highest heart rate that a person can go. The highest level is calculated as 220 minus the age of the person. So, for a 60-year-old, the highest level that they can go up to is 160 and ideally it should be around 100 only. In case of interval training, even healthy people should do it under the guidance of a professional,” he said. The reason to be cautious with interval training is that it raises the heart rate to a high level for brief periods and then brings it down to a low level. For a majority of fit youngsters, who have suffered a cardiac arrest during or immediately after exercise, there is an underlying heart condition called hypertrophied cardiomyopathy. Exercising is not the only thing. “Stress is driving more people to alcohol and drugs. Hormone changes due to this are directly linked to heart disorders,” said Dr M Sai Sudhakar, chief interventional cardiologist, Global Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/how-you-exercise-is-key-to-cardiac-health-experts/articleshow/88244775.cms||Amrita Didyala

The startup Mangala Resource Management Private Limited (MRMPL) claimed that their DPR not only offers carrying out door-to-door waste collection, but will also manage waste scientifically at the landfill in Pachanady. The startup will carry out the whole process at the same cost that the MCC is paying Antony Waste Handling Cell Private Limited (AWHCPL) currently, for collection and transportation of waste. The city corporation had approved a DPR prepared by an agency in September, to invite tenders for the SWM, once the existing contract of AWHCPL ends. However, deputy commissioner K V Rajendra directed the startup to submit a DPR. Swami Ekagamyananda of Ramakrishna Math told TOI that the math founded Mangala Resource Management (MRM) three years ago, and has been successfully managing waste at Uppinangady, 41 villages in Udupi and several mega industries and institutions. “As per a DPR approved by the MCC in September, the city corporation will have an additional burden of Rs 38 crore to purchase vehicles, and the city corporation will also have to spend about Rs 55 crore per annum as recurring cost. We have proposed in our DPR, that we will collect segregated waste from the source, transport it to the landfill, and also process it at the same cost,” he said. “We will buy the required vehicles on our own. As per our calculations, Rs 10 crore is sufficient to procure vehicles. We are ready to process an average of 250 tonnes, including wet and dry waste collected from the city per day. Only about 5% of the waste may go to the landfill site, and the remaining waste will be processed by us,” he said, adding that the city corporation will have to provide land and develop infrastructure to process the waste at Pachanady. “At present, the city corporation is paying Rs 3,750 per tonne for collection and transportation of waste. We are offering that waste will be collected, transported and processed at the same cost, and there will be no escalation of charges annually. Instead of escalation, our DPR also offers 5% -10% reduction in the payment every year. In the long run, we will be able to carry out the whole process without seeking payment from MCC, and gradually after many years, the city corporation will earn a profit from SWM,” he said, adding that the DPR submitted by the MRMPL is expected to be discussed at a council meeting after the MLC polls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dpr-by-startup-offers-cost-effective-swm-in-city/articleshow/88243957.cms||---

The ministry of environment of forests and climate change, National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), and Wildlife Institute of India (WII) have said the census should be completed by January to release the final report in July next year. The Karnataka forest department is geared up for the tiger census and is expecting a considerable improvement in the state’s tiger population, he said. “All training programmes have been conducted and there will be 152 transect lines and the survey will be conducted in the eight ranges of Mangaluru region. Special focus will be given to Belthangady, Subrahmanya, Uppinangady and Sullia range that have high forest areas,” Dinesh Kumar said. “We are suspecting the movement of at least two tigers in the border regions of the district. There have been some signs of tiger visit but no sightings recorded so far. The movement is suspected in the boundary of Kudremukh National Park and Pushpagiri Wildlife Area and could be once a year. A camera trap or photo capture method will be used to record the number of tigers. At every location, two cameras will be fitted. Generally in tiger reserves, monitoring is done annually,” he said adding the survey will be conducted as per the directions of the government. “We are regularly monitoring the reserve forest areas and places where tiger movement is suspected. The survey as part of the tiger census is likely to be held in the third week of December,” Dinesh Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dakshina-kannada-gears-up-for-tiger-census/articleshow/88243980.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Work to develop the facility, located around 20km away from the Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, has been on since last year. According to officials, the centre, which houses over 200 crocodiles, will not only help conserve the reptiles but also boost tourism. The project also aims at generating revenue. Surai range falls in the Terai-East forest division in Kumaon, with Khakra nullah passing through the range. Since crocodiles’ numbers have gone up in this forest range, a proposal for a safari was prepared last year. Ranger of the Surai forests, Sudhir Kumar, said that in 2020, the initiative came after at least 200 '12-foot mugger' crocodiles, India’s most common species, were spotted in Khakra nullah, projecting it as a natural habitat for the reptiles of this species. "A 1k-m stretch of the nullah has been identified for safari. There is ample fencing. Also, walls were erected on both sides so that crocodiles could not harm tourists and the latter, too, kept off the reptiles. A track has been constructed on both sides for tourists. Electric vehicles will be provided if the safari gets a good footfall.” “Surai range is spread over 22,000 hectares and has rich flora and fauna. The centre is located at the Jamaur-Bhilaiya road, around 4km from Khudaganj area. It is a nice idea to have a crocodile safari in a remote area like Khatima. It would give Khatima a chance to shine on the tourism map of India,” said Ravindra Dhami, a social activist from Khatima. He added that crocodiles caught during the rainy season will be kept in the centre, avoiding any conflict.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-gets-its-first-crocodile-conservation-centre-in-us-nagar/articleshow/88243978.cms||Aakash Ahuja

Additional Sessions Judge Arun Sukhija sentenced Munni Devi and Sudhir Kumar to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on each. The judge noted in an order on November 29 that courts are expected to operate the system so as to impose such sentence that reflects the conscience of the society and the sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. According to the prosecution, on December 13, 2017, the girl’s father had filed a missing complaint. Her body was found on the roof of Gazipur Dairy farm with her neck slit. The police said the mother of the child confessed her guilt, stating that she, along with her lover, murdered the daughter as she had seen both of them in an objectionable position. While convicting both in April this year, the court said a holistic appreciation of all the evidence could lead to no other conclusion except “murder” and that too at the hands of both accused persons who committed the barbaric act jointly with the common intention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/woman-lover-get-life-term-for-killing-her-daughter/articleshow/88244712.cms||---

---||Nagpur||A kanyadan that waits to cross the border||Nagpur: After a four year wait, Vandana Keswani finally got married on Monday even as she missed her parents, who saw the ceremony through a video call. Kalpana Motwani, also a Pakistani bride in India, on the other hand put on hold her wedding that was slated on last Saturday. Both Vandana and Kalpana are Pakistani citizens from Sukkur and Ghotki towns of Sindh province, respectively, getting married to Indian grooms. Vandana’s parents have a visa, but cannot cross over as the borders have not been reopened. The wait may be longer for Kalpana as her parents’ visa application itself has been rejected. TOI had reported Vandana’s case on November 8. She was engaged to Anil Jhamnani of Nagpur four years ago, but could not get visa to come down to Nagpur and get married. The engagement is said to have happened over a video call. She crossed over through Wagah border on November 3 leaving behind her parents. The parents stayed back as the crossover date coincided with their other daughter’s marriage back in Pakistan. Now even as her parents have a visa, they remain on the other side. Post Covid crossings happen on the Wagah-Attari border only on fixed dates. No dates have been announced for the next crossover yet. “With the current visa, we can fly down to India via Dubai or Sri Lanka, but that required Rs5 lakh for the entire family. We cannot afford that much,” says Vandana’s father Arjandas Keswani, who works as a commission agent in Sukkur. “We could have got a special permission to cross. A request was sent through e-mail to the Indian high commission, but there was no response,” he says. “My family had come to Pakistan in 2009. I stayed in Nagpur with my relatives to continue education as the rest left due to family reasons in 2018. Now even though my marriage has been fixed, my parents did not get a visa to join me,” says Kalpana narrating her story. Her marriage was fixed last Saturday, with an Indian groom now living in Australia. Kalpana has applied for an Indian citizenship too. “My parents had applied for a visa in October, but just as the wedding date was coming close we got the news that it was rejected. I was totally dejected. How can I marry without my parents coming down,” says Kalpana. “I haven’t met my parents after they left for Pakistan in 2018. It would be indeed an emotional turmoil to get married without them,” she says. Rajesh Jhambia of Sindh-Hindi Panchayat says he had requested the Indian high commission in Pakistan to issue a visa to Kalpana’s parents. However, the papers were sent back as it is. The high commission should consider such cases on humanitarian grounds, he said. Kalpana’s father Washdev Motwani says they left India because their business here could not be established well, and they started afresh in Pakistan. “We have no choice but to wait,” said a dejected Washdev.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/a-kanyadan-that-waits-to-cross-the-border/articleshow/88263760.cms||Shishir Arya

Cops served a notice under section 91 of the CrPC to the shops to submit records and GST documents, which many don't have. The closure of the notorious market that saw cars -- from the most expensive to the cheapest -- being brought in from Delhi, NCR and many other parts of the country came shortly after the arrest of two kingpins of the illegal trade, Haji Galla and Haji Iqbal. The market has over 300 shops and employs over 1,000 people. Traders told TOI on Sunday that all of them were asked to keep stores shut until further orders. “We have identified 100 shops in the market that are involved in the illegal trade. We will not let them access any goods until they submit stock details,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Meerut Prabhakar Chaudhary. The directions were given verbally by the station house officer (SHO) of Sadar Bazaar, said traders. To maintain peace and order after the announcement, which caused wide discontent, over 200 policemen conducted a flag march in the market in the afternoon. “We will talk to the police on Monday. Traders shouldn’t be harassed like this. Many of them are genuine and have all GST and stock details. Few are into illegal trading and the crackdown should only be limited to them,” said Pandit Ashu Sharma, an office-bearer of the Paschim Uttar Pradesh Vyapar Mandal. Some traders are worried about producing documents they say are hard to collect. “The police are asking us to show documents that most of us don’t have. It's essentially asking us to shut shop,” said a trader who didn’t wish to be named. “This will only increase crime in the city as all those employed here will now be jobless.” The Sotiganj market became infamous in the 1990s for trading scrap illegally stolen from dismantled cars, at that time mostly from the NCR region. Operations expanded later. Police have intensified their crackdown on the market over the past three months. The two top kingpins of the illegal trade, Galla and Iqbal, were arrested and their properties attached. The market has ballooned in size over the past few years. Those who own big shops have become owners of multiple properties across the nation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/sotiganj-top-stolen-cars-market-in-up-shut-by-cops/articleshow/88244005.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ludhiana||Gadvasu hospitals’ staff strike hits veterinary care||Ludhiana: Veterinary care has been affected, with the employees of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (Gadvasu) hospitals on strike since 12 days in support of their demands to implement revised UGC pay-scales as per 7th Pay Commission and withdraw the decision of delinking of teachers’ grades from UGC pay scales.The employees went on protest on December 1, when all the services, including the emergency, were closed, giving a tough time to farmers and others visiting the hospitals for treatment of their cattle and pets. Amarjeet Singh Batth, a resident of Major Jagir Singh Road, said, “My pet’s wounds had to be bandaged. As the Gadvasu hospital is shut, I had to take it to a private vet, who charged a high fee. Besides the private vet had to reinvestigate the case as the history card was with the Gadvasu hospital.”One of the PhD scholars at Gadvasu hospitals, who are available from 9am to 5pm, said, “Since December 2, we have been dealing only with emergency cases, wherein people come with complaints of liver and kidney disorders among pets. We have been receiving about 10 such cases every day. We are not treating other cases like skin disorders, vaccination and bandaging. Before the strike, we used to attend over 150 cases in the OPD.”Ashwani Kumar, a member of Gadvasu Teachers’ Association, said, “These are referral hospitals for tertiary care of animals. We are providing emergency services. Teachers are being forced to take to the roads to get their basic dues. We hope the Punjab government will fulfil its promise. It is difficult to understand the inordinate delay on the part of the government, as revised UGC pay-scales have long been implemented all over the country, except Punjab, Chandigarh and Himachal Pradesh. The government should take notice of the long struggle of the teachers and help them get their dues.”Meanwhile, Punjab Corona Lab Union at Gadvasu, resumed its protest against the Punjab government on Sunday, which affected testing of Covid samples. They are seeking regularization of services. Almost 27 staff members are working in Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL), the services of which are outsourced. One of the officials said, “We want regularization of staff members’ services. In our last meeting with officials in Amritsar on December 8, we were assured that we will be given preference while recruiting for labs that are going to open in civil hospitals of 20 districts. The government officials had asked us about our strength and estimated salary budget. Requesting us to call off the strike, they had said we would be employed under the National Health Mission.”The VRDL staff, who are on a chain hunger strike, handed over a memorandum to a Congress functionary, Bharat Prashar.Yet to decide on examsWith research and extension services closed, the university has till now not decided on conducting the final exams of students, which are usually held in December.The matter of teachers’ strike was taken up with the board of management in the last meeting and now we are waiting for the state government’s notification. Exams have been postponed by 10 days, said Inderjeet Singh, Gadvasu VC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/gadvasu-hospitals-staff-strike-hits-veterinary-care/articleshow/88244713.cms||Mehak Jain
---||Ludhiana||Century-old structure: Is it a bridge too far?||Ludhiana: After repeatedly failing to hire a contractor to reconstruct the century-old bridge near Chand Cinema, the civic body has floated tenders for the seventh time and decided to consult officials from PWD (B&R) for gaining success. It has been learnt that lower estimates for this project is the main reason behind the failure, as contractors are not ready to take up work at low rates. One of the officials claimed that they had calculated the cost to be Rs 7 crore, but it was cut down to Rs 5.84 crore. He said the contractors were not ready to work at this cost because at least 14 wells almost 30-foot-deep are to be constructed. He said it was difficult to get contractors at this rate, and they had requested the senior authorities in Chandigarh to revise the estimates, but they asked to get it done through the agency that had prepared the project design. When the agency refused to revise the estimates as per the demands of the contractors, the officials thought of involving the PWD. Superintending engineer of MC’s bridges and road department Tirath Bansal said, “We have taken a chance one more time by again floating tenders and will consult the PWD officials on Tuesday.” A resident of Salem Tabri, Richa Sharma, said, “We are suffering a lot. Only two-wheelers can pass through this bridge and for four-wheelers, there is another bridge at a distance, but it creates hurdles in smooth flow of traffic. There should be a direct bridge so that commuters are not hassled.” A poll issue Since this bridge could not be reconstructed in the past five years, it can become a major political issue in North constituency. On Tuesday, activist Kumar Gaurav will stage a protest against area MLA Rakesh Pandey and MC officials for their failure, and the Akali Dal and the BJP will also take up this issue. Project fileIn 2011, the flyover was declared unsafe for commuters as it was over 100 years old and bricks under it had started falling. The civic body decided to close it for heavy traffic in 2018 when some portion of Gill Chowk flyover got damaged. Several attempts made to reconstruct this flyover yielded no results. In the past four years, the officials kept on delaying the project, citing shortage of funds. And now when tenders are being floated, they are still clueless whether the project will see the light of the day or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/century-old-structure-is-it-a-bridge-too-far/articleshow/88244706.cms||---

On regaining senses, the girl sent her GPS location to her family while informing them about her kidnapping. Police raided the house on being informed by the girl’s family and rescued her safely. The accused and his three friends, two of whom are minors, had fled but were caught by police. The 16-year-old girl, a resident of Mati, is doing an animation course. The girl’s mother told police that her daughter had come in contact with a teenager on Instagram and he had asked her to meet him at Motijheel but she refused. The boy, accompanied by two teenage girls, came to meet the girl at her residence and left after staying there for some time, the girl’s mother said. On Friday evening, the girl had gone to the computer institute to attend classes and got suspicious when she noticed a white car without a number plate following her. After some time, the car stopped in front of her and its occupants dragged her inside, gave her some injection and sped away. On regaining consciousness, she found herself locked in a room. She first sent her GPS location to her mother through WhatsApp and then called her informing what had happened and that she was in trouble. Her family, relatives and police tracked her location to a house in Mathura Nagar, Rawatpur, and rescued her safely. The two teenage girls and a boy, Saurabh Sharma alias Ramji, were later detained by police. On the complaint of the girl’s family, police have registered an FIR against the accused under the relevant IPC sections and recorded the statement of the girl. “The detained girls will be questioned after recording their statements on Monday,” said ACP Nazirabad Santosh Kumar Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/teen-girl-kidnapped-sends-gps-location-to-mom-rescued-by-cops/articleshow/88244708.cms||---

The forum had already issued an ultimatum to the state government with a charter of demands. Since last month, the doctors have been protesting against the delay in implementation of resolutions that have been passed by the state government. The forum has alleged that even as all resolutions have been passed, officials of the state finance and health ministries are not implementing them. The protesting doctors have alleged that the bureaucrats are running parallel administration in the state government. The doctors are pressing for their demands which include implementation of seventh pay commission, provident fund and career advancement scheme benefits, providing of transport allowance, gratuity, medical reimbursement and non-practicing allowance among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/government-doctors-to-go-on-strike-from-today/articleshow/88243908.cms||---

According to police, the accused had stolen fuel worth Rs 1 crore from various government pipelines in the last two years. They are likely to be slapped with Gangster Act and National Security Act (NSA), police said. SSP Saharanpur, Akash Tomar, said that the fuel theft incident took place in the city in January and September this year. “As per our records, the arrested accused have over 12 cases of oil theft in Kurukshetra-Roorkee-Nazibabad pipeline of Indian Oil Corporation Limited. They used to sell the petrol in the open market,” the SSP added. The arrested suspects have been identified as Shubham Kumar, Gurmeet Singh, Sandeep Singh, Ajay Singh, Ajit, Udit, Shubham Singh and Bhupendra. They belong to Haridwar, Shamli, Baghpat, Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur and have been booked under IPC sections 424, 307 and 15/16 of the Petroleum Act. The SSP further said that one of the arrested suspects is an owner of a petrol pump in Muzaffarnagar district who had the licence to sell biodiesel, but he used to sell both diesel and petrol. “The man's licence to sell biodiesel expired months ago. He told us that he had a tie-up with people in the district administration who were allowing him to sell petrol and diesel. We have written to the administration and police to identify the other accused and take appropriate action,” the SSP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thieves-who-stole-rs-1cr-worth-of-fuel-from-govt-pipeline-finally-caught-after-2-yr-chase-may-be-charged-under-nsa/articleshow/88244026.cms||Ishita Mishra

The event was a part of the Delhi government’s campaign “Yudh Pradushan Ke Virudhh.” From jotting down messages pertaining to road safety and the environment, playing carom by the sidewalk, attending yoga sessions and participating in painting competitions, the visitors, including several school-going children, could choose from a host of options. The Zumba session was a major crowd-puller with septuagenarians participating with as much gusto as youngsters. Grooving to the tunes while sitting on a chair next to the stage, 72-year-old Neelima Sehgal, a resident of Alaknanda, said, “I have always loved dancing. This is a great event. Such events make us feel active and energetic.” For many, it was also a welcome change to see the street brimming with children cycling, playing cricket and badminton instead of cars lined up there. Stating that the event was a “great initiative,” Kalkaji resident Yogesh Singh said, “Having a Raahgiri Day in the neighbourhood is a great incentive as all these years we could never go to Connaught Place due to time constraints and distance. So, this time we were really prepared to attend it. Healthy mornings should become a habit, but due to our busy lifestyles we often miss out on it. This event has been a good start and a great motivation.” Saurabh Bharadwaj, Greater Kailash MLA and Atishi, Kalkaji MLA, were both present on the occasion. “The response to this event has been great and people are being motivated to cycle. The importance of physical exercise is also being spread. People from all age groups participated today and we will do more such programmes,” said Bharadwaj. Atishi said, “Often, when we talk about pollution and steps to curb it, it sounds like a burden and a sacrifice. But Raahgiri has shown that it can be fun through community events. Both the young and those young-at-heart have turned out here in large numbers today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/raahgiri-day-in-south-delhi-drives-home-fun-filled-clean-air-message/articleshow/88244719.cms||---

---||Kochi||Kerala: Senior doctors in govt MCHs to strike work today||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government medical college hospitals in the state will witness a total strike on Monday as house surgeons and senior doctors have pledged their support to the striking PG medicos. The house surgeons have called for a 24-hour boycott of work on Monday. However, the stand-off between the postgraduate medicos and the state government is continuing as the government is not willing for talks unless the medicos end their strike. The medicos have reiterated that unless their demands are met, they will not call off the strike. With 2,000 odd PG medicos on strike, the functioning of the government medical college hospitals has been severely hit and surgeries in many hospitals are being postponed. With the junior doctors not coming to work, the senior doctors and the house surgeons are bearing the brunt with heavy workload. As a result the senior doctors and house surgeons have pledged their support to the striking medicos and have urged the state government to settle the strike at the earliest. “For the past 10 days the postgraduate medical students have been on strike and this has put the house surgeons under tremendous stress. We are being taxed for the absence of the PGs in the hospital duty. We are not ready to take this workload and hence we have decided to boycott hospital duties for 24 hours from 8am on Monday. But this strike will not affect the emergency wings,” said Dr Ashin Anand, state president of Kerala House Surgeons Association. “Moreover, a female house surgeon was attacked in Alappuzha medical college hospital while on duty. Such incidents are happening when the doctors are working under tremendous stress with lack of manpower. The government is doing nothing to provide protection for us,” said Dr Nila K S, state secretary of house surgeons association. Meanwhile, the associations of senior doctors like Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA) and Kerala Government Postgraduate Medical Teachers Association (KGPMTA) have also pledged their support to the striking medicos. “It is a fact that the functioning of the hospitals has been severely affected with the strike of the PG medicos. However, the health department is putting the entire burden of work on the senior doctors who are forced to take duty for extra hours at a stretch, which is humanly impossible. The senior doctors are being posted in the casualty, labour room and all other duties which the PG medicos were doing all these days,” said Dr R C Sreekumar of KGMCTA. The KGMCTA in Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital has decided to boycott the OP, IP, and elective surgeries on Monday as mark of support to the striking post graduate medicos, said Dr Sreekumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/senior-doctors-in-govt-mchs-to-strike-work-today/articleshow/88246642.cms||---

Zafar Mahal, a pavilion at Red Fort constructed in 1842 during Bahadur Shah II’s reign and named after him, is in a dilapidated condition today, with many portions completely damaged. The ASI-protected structure stands in the middle of a water tank and, according to one conservator, has been severely hit by the heavy rains this year. A faulty drainage system hasn’t helped, as the structure has absorbed water from the tank that surrounds it. There was a time when the pavilion and the tank were among the central pieces of the heritage site, according to historian Rana Safvi. “Zafar Mahal was once known as Jal Mahal. Its tank was a major part of Nahr-e-Bahisht, or the stream of paradise, which was designed to flow into the row of palace buildings during Red Fort’s glorious days in the Mughal era. The water from the Sawan Bhadon pavilion would come through the water shoots and fall in this tank,” Safvi told TOI. The structure, Safvi said, was situated in the Hayat Bakhsh Garden, or ‘life-giving garden’, which bore flowering and fruit trees and was a place for the emperor to rest. “Originally, a red sandstone bridge led to the pavilion, but it was probably lost at some point in time,” she added. Safvi, who had visited Red Fort last week, said the current condition of Zafar Mahal is “extremely distressing”. “I hope conservation work takes place as soon as possible,” she added. Abu Sufiyan, who runs Purani Dilli Walo Ki Baatein, a digital platform that promotes the history, culture and cuisine of Old Delhi, said it was “disappointing” to see the progress of restoration and repairs at Red Fort, one of the most important heritage sites in the country. “To be sure, those conserving it have worked on maintenance, light show and beautification, but the pace at which these works are being carried out is really slow,” Sufiyan said. Asked if Zafar Mahal’s restoration was part of the preservation works that were initiated at Red Fort in 2019, an ASI conservator said there were three categories of plans. “There was a hydraulic project which focused on the fountains around Zafar Mahal and other historic structures at Red Fort. That was completed. After the damage from the extended monsoon to Zafar Mahal, a budget estimate was done and tender will be floated for its structural repair and conservation. The work on the tank, whose drains are in urgent need of repair, will begin immediately. The budget estimate and tender are already in place for that,” he said. Another conservator said several conservation works of various structures on Red Fort precincts had been stalled in the past two years during the pandemic and Zafar Mahal’s restoration and repair had suffered as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/drowning-glory-zafar-mahal-atred-fort-in-dire-need-of-repairs/articleshow/88244729.cms||Zumbish

It has rained in the evening, for the past three weeks in the region. People are apprehensive about the situation in December too, with the met department predicting more rain. Those who had postponed weddings and waited for a better opportunity too have been disappointed. Sachin, who works in Israel, waited for a year to tie the knot with Arpita. “During our wedding ceremonies, including the reception, it rained heavily, and all our plans went down the drain. We had made temporary arrangements in case it rained, like tents, but it didn’t help. The guests got drenched,” said Sachin, whose wedding reception was held at an open ground near Ullal. A wedding planner said a wedding ceremony held on Tuesday night on an open ground had to be stopped midway, as there was heavy rain at night. Weddings which were usually held at home, are now being held in wedding halls. “We normally organise small functions like birthdays, roce and others at home. However, we have shifted this time to the nearby church hall. It is because we cannot predict the rain, and in case it rains, it takes away the the fun associated with the ceremony,” said a family from Kulashekar. Primus D’Souza, a caterer from Neermarga, said that those who have planned for outdoor weddings are re-thinking their plans. “Many have already shifted their ceremonies indoors. Some are uncertain about their plans, and don’t know whether it will rain or not on that particular day. “It’s not just couples and guests who are at the receiving end when it rains at outdoor events, but even decorators, photographers, caterers and sound and light providers. They incur heavy damage even if there are few spells of rain,” he said. A photographer said that a number of guests did not turn up for an event due to sudden showers last week, due to which the couple were disappointed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/unseasonal-rain-washes-out-weddings-along-coast/articleshow/88244021.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

To discuss environmental issues concerning Punjab, a special seminar under the banner of Punjab Vatavaran Chetna Lehar is being organized by various activists where leaders from different political parties are also being invited. To be held in the city on December 20, the event is expected to witness participation from key political leaders including state presidents of prominent political parties. The activists will ask party presidents whether they have any plans on environment or they will just offer free electricity and water supply to the voters.Kahan Singh Pannu, convener of Punjab Vatavaran Chetna Lehar and former chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board, said, “The basic idea is to convince the politicians to make plans for development while keeping the environment in mind. The development is important, but not at the cost of environment.” He said they would raise the problems and also give solutions to these problems so that proper mindset could be developed. Prominent environmentalist Balbir Singh Seechewal said, “We should at least try once by taking up the issue of environment and ask the leaders to adopt these issues in their manifesto. We are calling up all NGOs and social organizations for joining us in this noble cause. It is high time now that we move beyond free electricity and water supply. Rather, we should join hands to save natural resources which are on the verge of extinction.” Elaborating about this issue, Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja from Punjab Naroa Manch said, “It is high time now that we should ask from our leaders what they are going to do about environment, because we are not getting clean water, fresh air and even our soil has been damaged due to extensice use of fertilizers. We will ask the politicians whether they will give any plan of action for these things, because if we do not get pure air, we will die.” He said they will seek support from other residents as well.Meanwhile, city-based activist Jaskirat Singh said, “We are not talking about Ludhiana only, but the entire state. That is why, we are inviting state presidents of political parties. There is a need to raise voice for the right to breath fresh air, drink clean water and get better food.” He said people should ask politicians what they will do for environment, only then they will vote for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/green-activists-to-parties-give-guarantees-on-clean-air-water/articleshow/88244738.cms||---

Out of the 3,33,530 doses given between December 1-12, as many as 1,71,842 females and 1,61,540 males and 148 transgenders were administered the shots. Figures of the health department revealed that out of the 48,81,329 doses given so far in the district, 25,32,007 males, 23,47,212 females and 2,110 transgenders were covered under the vaccination drive. Statistics revealed by the health department on Sunday claimed that women recipients have maintained their lead in vaccination in the second week of this month after the initial hiccup and more women recipients of all age groups are arriving at vaccination centres in rural and urban areas to get vaccinated against Covid-19. Officials said that after registering leads in September, October and November, the women recipients were marginally trailing behind their male counterparts in the first week of this month, but they have now outnumbered men in terms of vaccination received. Records claim that out of 9,52,528 jabs administered to eligible recipients in November, as many as 5,00,968 females received the jabs, while the strength of male recipients who took the vaccine was 4,51,214. Similarly, out of the total 8,41,889 doses given in October, as many as 4,40,094 doses were given to women, while 4,01,428 doses were received by males. Moreover, in September, out of a total of 9,39,300 given doses given to eligible recipients, as many as 4,78,740 females and 4,60,002 males got vaccinated. Additional chief medical officer and district immunization officer (DIO ) Dr told TOI that women recipients are taking an active part in the vaccination campaign and as a result, more women beneficiaries were inoculated for the fourth consecutive month. ACMO, however, claimed that we have also focussed on administering the second jab to the eligible recipients of all age groups on the scheduled time and for that, health teams were working on a micro plan to cover the recipients under the fully vaccinated category. The district health authorities have set a target to administer doses to as many as 45,16,437 recipients of all age groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/covid-19-vaccination-women-recipients-continue-to-outnumber-men/articleshow/88244739.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Future perfect? Installation shows how your city may be transformed||NEW DELHI: What will a greener, cleaner and pollution-free Delhi look like? Now, there is a way that residents can find out by virtually seeing the “future city”. A group of non-government organisations working in the field of environment protection have come together to give Delhiites a glimpse into the future through an “augmented reality installation” placed near GTB Nagar Metro Station. The installation would be fully functional in the next few days. This first-of-its-kind concept is an eight-feet-tall structure made out of biodegradable material equipped with an LED screen in the middle on the footpath in front of a police booth. A camera grabs your image and virtually transports it into the same location with well-organised traffic, pedestrian space, cycle lanes, more trees, electric vehicles and their charging points and less pollution with clean blue skies. “The display offers to transport the audience in real-time to a mixed-reality future, one that is cleaner, healthier and pollution-free. The display will show a view of the same location, but with an augmented reality layer that showcases a sustainable version in the future,” said Rashmi Mishra, campaigner, air pollution and climate change, Jhatkaa.org. This organisation, along with Young Leaders for Active Citizenship and other groups, has started an online petition for this future city campaign, which involves bringing the public and the authorities on the same page to save the environment. “This initiative is good and I’m confident that it will create an impact on every person who experiences the future Delhi. We are hearing announcements from the authorities about electric vehicles, smog towers and other pollution combating methods, but it will be more impactful when one sees it through this installation,” said Gaurav Arora, a social media influencer. Appurva Chauhan, a mobility champion who assisted the team in transporting the modalities, said, “People will get to see a better version of the location where they are standing with a cleaner mode of transport. This will change their mindset and hopefully help us build a cleaner Delhi in the future.” The organisers said after Delhi, the installation would be set up at other locations across the country to showcase a particular city in the future. “It’s a very good initiative. As youth have come together for a future city campaign, their connection will make this popular. We all have to work in unity to make the environment pollution free,” said Yogesh Verma, chairman, Keshavpuram zone, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, who inaugurated the installation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/future-perfect-installation-shows-how-your-city-may-be-transformed/articleshow/88244742.cms||---

But, he’s still waiting to see when the cheaper alcohol actually shows up in shops, so he can finally stock up for the pre-Christmas party he throws each year. With Christmas and new year’s eve right around the corner, several citizens are now impatiently waiting for the promised cheaper imported liquor. But shops are yet to get bottles with the new MRP labels. The good news is, the new and cheaper stock should be on shelves of your local shop well before Christmas. Union representatives for shops and bars in the city said customers should be able to spot premium imported brands with reduced prices at shops in another five to six days. For smaller brands, the wait may be a little longer. This paper had earlier reported that with the reduction in tax, the price of a 1,000ml imported liquor bottle like Scotch whiskey, which ranges from Rs5,800 to Rs14,000, will drop by 35 to 40%. The reduction will apply to spirits only whiskey, rum, brandy, gin and vodka not beer and wine. In anticipation, Rajesh Diwan, a patron of a premium Andheri bar and an executive working with a BKC firm, has twice put off the annual office party he holds every December 8, on the eve of his birthday. Shop and bar owners say the delay has been due to slow movement of international cargo a result of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as delay in the process of revising MRP labels. Companies have already begun the process to get nod for new MRPs and new labels. December, January and March are high-consumption months due to Christmas, new year’s eve and Holi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/you-can-buy-cheaper-imported-liquor-in-time-for-xmas-nye-in-mumbai/articleshow/88245794.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

During the agitation, posters banning political activity had come up at a number of villages, especially in Jagraon’s Hathur and Kaunke Kalan. At a couple of hamlets, the publicity material of a political party painted on the walls was blackened.“Political activity was not allowed in villages during our agitation, but now that we have won the battle against black laws, we will question the political parties,” said 61-year-old Kulwant Singh, a farmer from Chakar village, who claims to have participated in the agitation since November 26 last year. He added that this time it was not going to be easy for the political parties that make promises and fail to fulfill them. In Chakar, a political party’s publicity material was blackened. Another farmer of the village, Balwinder Singh, said unemployment was a big issue. Citing an example, he said his son has studied up to Class XII, but could not get a job. In the neighbouring Hathur, posters on a building barring political activity that had come up during farmers’ agitation are no longer there. A villager said these were brought down as farmers had won the battle. Many villagers were seen discussing issues for the coming elections, including the road to Lakha village.“We are happy that we have been victorious in our fight against the black farm laws. With elections a few months away, political activity will pick up now. All we want from parties is better facilities, including roads,” said Malkit Singh of Hathur. His fellow villager Ranjit Singh said the condition of roads, including those to Chakar and Lakha, was dismal and better roads would remain a poll plank.In Kaune Kalan village, the poster banning a political party continues to stay. A villager, speculating that it might be taken down soon, asserted that it portrayed the anger of people against the political set-up and was a pressure tactic to push political parties to fight for repeal of “black laws”.A team of The Times of India found publicity material, including posters of political parties and candidates, in some villages. Chamkaur Singh, a farmer who supported the farm agitation, said with bar on political activity gone, the parties’ leaders and workers will start making rounds of villages and voters too were ready with their questions. He said they would ask them about the roadmap to redress their grievances and fulfill old promises.“The farm agitation has changed the outlook of people and made them confident about their ability to get results. The voters will seek answers now,” he added. Rural presenceThere are 14 Vidhan Sabha constituencies in Ludhiana, of which eight, including Samrala, Khanna, Sahnewal, Gill, Payal, Dakha, Raikot and Jagraon, have a significant number of voters from rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/farmers-stir-over-political-buzz-to-be-back-in-villages/articleshow/88244743.cms||Shariq Majeed

Earlier, Jayarajan had assumed duties as the district secretary when P Jayarajan was made the CPM candidate at Vadakara constituency during recent Lok Sabha elections. Jayarajan is also a member of the party state committee and a law graduate. The Kannur district meet of the party came to a conclusion on Sunday. Addressing the closing ceremony chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out against IUML for the objectionable remarks made at Waqf protection meet, the mass gathering held at Kozhikode beach a few days ago. Vijayan said that what was seen at Kozhikode beach was the culture of IUML. “You need to have the sense to realize who your mother and sister are. Good culture should begin from one’s family,” he said. While addressing Waqf protection rally on Thursday, IUML state secretary Abdurahiman Kallayi had made objectionable remarks referring to the marriage between PWD minister PA Mohamed Riyas and Veena T, the daughter of Vijayan. Without naming Riyas, he had had said that the former DYFI leader is a newly-wed man (Puthiyappla) in his place and asked, “Who is his wife. Is this a marriage? It is prostitution. One should have courage and guts to say that.” Vijayan said League leaders were enraged by his question; he had asked if the League was a political party or a religious outfit. “The government won’t misinterpret League’s meet and conclude that it is the sentiment of the entire Muslim community. If you check the LDF-UDF voting percentage in Malappuram, you will see that the League is losing ground,” he added. Meanwhile, the district meeting also elected the 50-member district committee and 11 among them were fresh faces. The meeting also elected the 12-member district secretariat. M Prakashan, M Surendran, Vatsan Panoli, N Chandran, Karayi Rajan, TA Madhusoodanan, TK Govindan, PV Gopinath, P Harindran, P Purushothaman and N Sukanya are the secretariat members.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Barricades and tents gone at Tikri, commuters back||NEW DELHI: Both sides of the carriageway at the Tikri border were opened to commuters on Sunday as police removed the multi-layered barricades after the departure of farmers who headed back home during the weekend. The lanes at the Singhu border are expected to be fully operational only by Monday evening. According to a senior officer, work to remove the roadblocks at Tikri started on Saturday morning. “There is no obstruction and the two sides of the road have been thrown open to traffic,” he said. In October, one carriageway at the Tikri border, which had been closed for 11 months, was reopened and divided into two small lanes — one for entry and the other for exit. Several commuters expressed relief at the opening of the lanes. Many of them are factory workers in Bahadurgarh and had to take a long route during the protests. “Now I can easily reach office on time and save 30 minutes,” a man who works in a footwear factory in Bahadurgarh said. Many shopkeepers whose business had suffered earlier expressed happiness too. Meanwhile, at the Singhu border, multiple security layers are in place. Police said the authorities are first removing the barricades and then using earth movers to remove the cemented boulders and containers. “We might be able to clear the barriers by Monday evening. Some protesters also remain at the site,” a senior officer said. Yudhvir Singh, a farmer leader from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, said “90% of the farmers have left the place”. Since November 26 last year, farmers, along with their tractor trolleys and other vehicles, had been camping at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders to protest against the agriculture laws. The year-long protests came to an end after the government passed a bill in Parliament to repeal the laws and agreed to set up a committee to consider their other demands, including minimum support price and withdrawal of police cases against protesters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/barricades-and-tents-gone-at-tikri-commuters-back/articleshow/88244752.cms||---

The court stated that all the members had the knowledge that the drugs had been concealed in the house and also cannabis plants were grown. The offence attracted Section 29 of the NDPS Act, the court held. Sessions judge B P Deshpande said the contention of the applicant for a separate trial cannot be considered. “There is more than prima facie material on record to show the conspiracy and conscious possession of the drugs as well as cannabis plants by the family members. A separate trial will prejudice the prosecution,” the court held.  Applicant’s counsel K Poulekar submitted that the house raid panchanama showed two houses and that there was no evidence to show conspiracy among all the accused. Public prosecutor claimed that all accused are members of one family residing in one house and therefore possession of drugs in the parts of the house as well as presence of cannabis plants in the compound shows conspiracy and consciousness of the family members.  During the raid last year, the sleuths found ganja and charas concealed in the house along with illegal cultivation of cannabis plants around it.  When the raiding party reached the house, the first accused started feeling uneasy and along with his wife, also an accused, were allowed to go to the hospital while the two other accused showed the police polythene bags containing over 2 kg of charas and over 1 kg ganja. They also found a cannabis plantation which they uprooted weighing 2.290 kg. The court stated that all the members had the knowledge that the drugs have been concealed in the house and also cannabis plants were grown.

---||Delhi||All civic staff to join stir by teachers, claims AAP||NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Dilip Pandey on Sunday said that all municipal employees are going to join an indefinite strike by teachers of municipal schools from Monday, against non-payment of salaries. He claimed that the BJP-led civic bodies of Delhi haven’t paid salaries despite funds being released by the AAP government. Pandey said over the last 14 days, more than 7,000 teachers from 714 municipal schools have gone on strike. “They have left online classes to strike for their livelihood, so that their kids can have at least one-time meal,” Pandey said at a press conference on Sunday. “BJP has not just attacked the livelihoods of 7,000 plus teachers with its dirty politics, but also endangered the future of lakhs of students studying in corporation schools,” Pandey said, adding that while the strike only consisted of the teachers, it has now been brought to the party’s notice that starting Monday, all municipal employees will join the strike for an indefinite duration. “Safai karamcharis, doctors, paramedic staff, horticulture employees will all join their forces with the teachers and amplify their voice together, in the hope to reach the ears of BJP leaders,” he said. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, meanwhile, said that Pandey has repeated the “same emotional words” that other members from AAP have been repeating for months. “Municipal employees very well know that their salaries are stuck because Delhi government is not releasing the increased municipal funds as recommended by 3rd, 4th & 5th Delhi finance commission,” he said. Kapoor said that the civic bodies salary bills and other expenses are at increased levels as per latest pay commission recommendation for 2021, but Delhi government continues to release the amount of funds as fixed in 2012-13, due to which the three municipal corporations are in extreme financial crisis. “AAP leaders every day say no municipal funds are pending towards municipal corporations, I challenge them to ask chief secretary of Delhi to issue a statement that no municipal funds are pending as per 3rd, 4th & 5th DFC’s increased recommendations,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-civic-staff-to-join-stir-by-teachers-claims-aap/articleshow/88244764.cms||---

This ecozone will encompass an urban forest housing native trees planted using the Japanese Miyawaki method, a pond, a butterfly garden with over 1,000 flowering plants, an astro-themed Nakshatra (constellation) garden and an amphitheatre. The park, which will add to the city’s green lungs, will be developed and maintained using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds by the Rotary Club of Bombay (RCB) for 10 years and at no cost to the university. The university has identified the land near the Marathi Bhasha Bhavan, where the pond is located, for the project. “Based on our initial assessment, we can plant over 4,000 native trees in the 10,000 square feet of urban forest that we plan to develop,” said Rotarian Rajesh Choudhary, member of the national environment initiative of Rotary India. The trees will be planted in the Miyawaki method, which is picking up in cities across the country. The technique of planting native species of trees closer to each other was pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. "This forest grows in a shorter span of time and will be self-sustaining within three years,” said university’s NSS student Gopal Raithatha, adding that they have identified 65 species of native trees for the forest. The trees will be bar-coded, which will help nature lovers to learn more about the species.  “We plan to rejuvenate the pond, rebuild the walls around it, and then start work on the forest and the gardens,” said Choudhary. The university already has an amphitheatre near the pond and it will be rebuilt. The project is a culmination of ideas from members of the university’s NSS unit. “We regularly hold tree plantation drives, but we wanted to take up a sustainable environment project for our campus. The park will be a contribution from the NSS unit to the university and to the city’s green space,” said Sudhir Puranik, university’s registrar and director of the NSS unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-biodiversity-park-on-cards-at-mu/articleshow/88245801.cms||Yogita Rao

"Hum 'ganna' ki baat karte hai woh 'Jinnah' ki baat karti hai (We talk about sugarcane, they talk about Jinnah). I feel bad to say that there are political parties in the country who compare the great Sardar Patel to Jinnah," he said. The BJP president alleged that all parties “promote dynastic politics, casteism and religious division,” adding that “only BJP works for the public and their welfare. We are not here to sit and rule but to use our power to strengthen this country.” Nadda said that now the country has started following “one legislation, one constitution and one principle”. He added, in Kashmir, BJP abolished Article 370, while triple talaq was made a criminal offence. The BJP president also alleged that the earlier governments in UP used to cheat farmers. “A small amount of loan was waived in the name of farmer loan waiver. PM Narendra Modi presented Kisan Samman Nidhi. The Yogi government in UP paid sugarcane farmers over Rs 11,000 crore to pay off loans during the Akhilesh government. Sugarcane mills were closed under Mayawati and the Akhilesh government and BJP restarted them,” he said. The BJP president attacked the SP and emphasised that there is no positive change in the party. “There is neither any leader nor policy nor intentions of the SP. Their only motive is the chair and they are now daydreaming,” he said. Meanwhile, addressing 28,000 booth presidents on Sunday afternoon, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said the BJP is capable of winning more than 325 assembly seats in the state if the party is strengthened at the booth level. He also accused opposition parties of dynastic politics. CM Yogi questioned where these parties were during the Covid pandemic. “The medical college in Etah was inaugurated by the PM a few days back. Under the leadership of our PM, we successfully fought against Covid, too."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/we-talk-about-ganna-they-compare-sardar-patel-to-jinnah-says-nadda/articleshow/88244079.cms||Deepak Lavania

Many have tweeted, urging Union minister of road transport & highways Nitin Gadkari for a permanent fix on the prominent national highway (NH) stretch that connects the port city and Bengaluru. Travellers say that the condition of the highway between Maranahalli and Sakleshpur is so pathetic, that it is difficult to travel even in AC buses on the stretch. Durga Ramdas Kateel @durgaramdas tweeted with photos: “This is the condition of #NH75 between Maranahalli to Sakleshpur. During night journey we won’t get sleep on these roads.

The directive from the home department to all the collectors was issued last Thursday in the wake of the SC making an observation recently that despite making various observations by the court regarding the use of firecrackers, the manufacture, sale and use of banned fireworks are continuing by violating the court order. “Even though they are banned, the manufacturing, selling and using of joined firecrackers have continued and the same is being used in blatant violation of the directives issued by this court. It is reported that even under the guise of ‘green crackers’, banned chemical firecrackers are being sold and there is a mislabelling on the boxes and even the QR codes provided on the boxes of ‘green crackers’, are alleged to be fake,” the court had observed. The state has a rich culture of using firecrackers for festivals like Diwali and Vishu and for other religious ceremonies like temple festivals and Theyyam of Northern Kerala. The court had earlier banned the manufacture, sale and use of firecrackers other than green firecrackers and those with reduced emission (improvised ones). The court had also banned the “joined firecrackers”, as such firecrackers cause huge air, noise and solid waste issues. The sale of the permitted firecrackers should be only through the licensed traders, and it should also be ensured that the licensed traders are selling only permitted firecrackers. The court had further specified that no e-commerce websites, including the e-commerce giants like the Amazon and the Flipkart, should accept orders and sell firecrackers, and those who sell them online should be hauled up and made liable to contempt of court. The court had specifically said that barium salts (that gives green colour to the fireworks) cannot be used in the firecrackers. Earlier, based on the court order, the state had issued an order on November 3 restricting the use of firecrackers from 7pm and 10pm on Diwali day. On the basis of the court order, the government would issue another order restricting the use of firecrackers for the upcoming Christmas and the New Year from 11.55pm to 12.30 am. The court had said the celebrations cannot be allowed at the cost of health, particularly that of senior citizens and children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-check-sale-of-banned-crackers/articleshow/88244822.cms||KP Saikiran

Now, a similar exercise will be undertaken to bring five jumbos from the southern state to Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Uttar Pradesh. These elephants will undertake forest patrolling and carry out rescue operations, especially in cases of man-animal conflict. A team of experts from PTR has reached Karnataka to select the elephants. The final date to transport the jumbos will be decided soon after getting necessary approvals from the Karnataka forest department. TOI has learnt that PTR’s deputy director Naveen Khandelwal along with senior veterinarian, Dr Daksh Gangwar, and other members of his team were in Nagarhole National Park in Kodagu district on Sunday and inspected nearly 12 camp elephants. They are expected to continue with the inspection of the elephants in a few other locations before making a final list of elephants. Dr Gangwar told TOI, “Our priority is to look for young elephants between eight and 20 years. We may consider a little older elephant also if it is suitable. They must be healthy without any chronic injury or disease like tuberculosis. We are also checking how the elephant responds to commands of its mahout, condition of its nails, etc. It is important to check minute details, including their blood samples.” Khandelwal told TOI, “We have visited four centres and we will explore some more before returning on Wednesday. So far, we have shortlisted seven elephants and we will select more before finalizing five of them.’” Thereafter , a proposal will be sent to Karnataka’s principal chief conservator of forests, who will give a final nod for handing over the elephants to PTR. This is expected by the end of January, said PTR’s deputy director. Once the approval is given, the elephants will be brought to Pilibhit, where they will be kept in isolation. Their mahouts from Karnataka will accompany the jumbos to PTR and stay till they accept commands in Hindi from local mahouts, Khandelwal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-dudhwa-ptr-to-get-five-elephants-from-ktaka/articleshow/88244097.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The leaders claimed that they are expecting at least 5 lakh gathering in that rally. This rally is also being considered important as it is being held before assembly elections and with large gathering at the spot, the SAD leadership will be able to showcase its strength. Also, there is a belief among party leaders that whenever the party had organised rally in Moga before elections, it has brought good results for the party. Sources claimed that leaders are being told to bring workers in buses as well as own cars, jeeps and other vehicles. There is rough estimate that every candidate from these constituencies will take at least 2,000 party workers along. Sources also said now party leaders are calling up the transporters for buses to Moga rally. One of the Akali leaders claimed now that they have no alliance with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) they cannot call upon any BJP leader from Centre otherwise it could have been at larger scale. Akali Dal district president Harbhajan Singh Dang said, “I am given the responsibility to provide tea at the rally from December 13, as some of the workers will reach there a day before. We have arranged for the buses on rent and Moga rally will be historic.” He said there are chances some leaders from other states would participate and even chances of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Mayawati coming to rally — by Monday he said they will have clear idea. Meanwhile, former Akali Dal MLA and candidate from east constituency Ranjit Dhillon said, “I have conducted meetings with workers at various levels in my constituency and all arrangements are done for the rally.” He said they will make the rally successful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/101st-year-celebrations-akali-leaders-to-gather-5-lakh-party-workers-for-moga-rally/articleshow/88244106.cms||---

These patients are usually unaware of heart issues and only when there is a sudden spurt of exercise, their body is unable to cope up with the stress. Doctors recommend regular health check ups after age of 40 to ensure such incidents do not happen and to keep stress levels in check. When not sleeping well (less than seven hours a day), it is best to avoid strenuous exercise the next day. Sudden cardiac arrest can occur at anytime in people with or without known cardiac disease. These account for about 60% of all cardiac deaths. “It is important to educate public about life saving Automated External Defibrillator (AED) use and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation to decrease morbidity and mortality due to cardiac arrest. AED’s must be placed at all strategic locations where there is lot of public activity with instructions in local language for use. They should also be placed at a central location in residential apartment complexes,” said Dr B Vijay Rao, faculty, American Heart Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cardiac-arrest-in-youth-genetic/articleshow/88244781.cms||---

Joseph K J who teaches at St Thomas High School, Neriya, said that the lockdown was the perfect opportunity for him to use the free time productively, and learn more about agriculture. “A lot of people had started cultivating vegetables and fruits during this period, but I wanted to do something different. About a decade ago, there were farmers who used to cultivate ginger, but since the region receives heavy rain, many gave up over the years,” he said. Explaining his agricultural journey, Joseph said, “I bought a four-acre property on lease, and spent nearly Rs 5 lakh to level the land, and make it suitable for growing ginger. This variety is mainly used for medicines. Since my parents are agriculturists, I sought their guidance. It was challenging, because ginger crop is prone to diseases. I used only neem oil and organic manure, and the crop will be harvested in January. In addition, since May, I have been able to harvest about 50 quintals of yam and three quintals of turmeric. Generally, each ginger plant has about 25-35 stems, but the plants grown at the farm have 50-70 stems,” Joseph said. He has also grown tapioca, taro and sambrani. “Since school has resumed, I am at the plantation between 5.30pm to 12 am and 5am to 8am. It has been a refreshing experience, and the horticulture officials have visited the farm and appreciated my initiative,” he said. He has put up a banner, explaining the health benefits of the plants cultivated by him. His wife Treesa, a school teacher, and children Anson, studying in class IV and Anshita, studying in class VII, help him at the farm. “Ginger is rarely cultivated in Belthangady. He has cultivated ginger scientifically, with good drainage and bed. The first crop looks good,” said senior assistant director, horticulture, Belthangady, Chandrashekar K S.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/lockdown-prompts-teacher-to-cultivate-organic-ginger/articleshow/88244108.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

While Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik and other party politicians said the people of the country were looking at Pawar to provide an alternative leadership in 2024 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pawar himself did not speak on the issue. “Many people in this country are still not able to live in dignity and the NCP workers should work towards that. The social situation in the country is changing and the party should lead by the ideals of social reformers like Babasaheb Ambedkar, Shahu Maharaj and Jyotiba Phule. The common man should be able to say that it is the NCP that works to resolve their problems,” said Pawar. The birthday celebrations were low-key with a rally at Nehru Science Centre. Initiatives like the launch of the party app and a government scheme for handicapped individuals were also accomplished on Sunday. Pawar said the NCP might be small but its uniqueness was that its workers were committed to take along all the deprived sections of society. Malik, the party state unit president, said there was an ideological battle on in the country. “And if there is anyone who can fight and win against the divisive forces, it is Pawar Saheb. He is the only person who can bring together leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal, Farooq Abdullah,” said Malik.

The elections to Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), which usually witness days of campaigning, canvassing and debates, were not conducted last year and their office bearers elected in 2019 are still continuing. While some pointed out that the elections could not be held due to the extraordinary circumstances, many others argued that it was important to maintain the democratic processes on campuses and give students a chance to get the first experience of electing their own representatives. In many cases, not all students are allowed to be back on the campus yet. However, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh said students who admitted last year had been returning and the union would submit a memorandum for holding elections once they were back. “We get to learn a lot through campus democracy by seeing and learning from each other by putting forth our political views. For JNUSU elections, presidential debates also take place. We hope that the university administration will cooperate and the elections can be held once everyone is back,” Ghosh said. Hoping that campuses will reopen soon, DUSU president Akshit Dahiya said, “We need to take a step forward now. Both contesting and polling are major aspects of a democratic process and this should continue. The university earlier assured us that polls could be conducted once campuses reopen.” Pointing out that elections have been held across the country during the pandemic, Lokesh Chugh of National Students’ Union of India wondered, “If other elections can be held in the middle of a crisis, what is the problem with students’ polls?” Students’ representation plays a vital role in negotiating with the government on issues concerning their rights, he said. Many senior teachers also underlined the need to devise strategies to hold student body elections. Tanvir Aeijaz, political science professor at Ramjas College, said, “It is definitely a setback for the students, especially at a time when there are so many burning issues like digital divide, accessibility of data and material, and implementation of National Education Policy (NEP). Students should have a robust system to raise these issues as tomorrow’s leaders are here itself.” JNU professor Moushumi Basu said, “While universities should open, we are also hearing about new virus strains. Slowly we need to think of devising new ways so that students are well represented as there are important issues like NEP that will have repercussions on them. It will be a problem if there is no students’ representation on such counts.” While DU officials could not be contacted, senior officials of the JNU administration said, “We are yet to conduct the admissions for the current batch. Unless students are back on the campus, one cannot think of elections. The issue will be taken up only after the campus reopens properly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-polls-on-covid-hit-campuses-most-univs-continue-with-2019-office-bearers/articleshow/88244787.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Age no hurdle for Pawar as he captains anti-BJP team||Mumbai: Neither age nor adversity can dim his grit and guffaw. Sharadrao Govindrao Pawar, who turned 81 on Sunday, continues to be a force to reckon with in politics, all set to take on the BJP in 2024.Pawar sat through the birthday bash followed by a music concert and quiet dinner at the Nehru Centre. He exchanged pleasantries and laughs with family and close friends, who describe him as a great raconteur. For Pawar, whose electoral innings date back to the 1960s, politics is serious business. In one fell swoop he stopped Maharashtra from falling into the BJP’s basket after the 2019 assembly polls. Pawar helps the MVA regime, which is still green behind the ears, streamline the administration amid Covid-19 and a state transport strike. Sources said combining tact with tenacity, Pawar keeps the MVA ministers on their toes, and if need be, offers valuable tips to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on policy issues. “It is Sharadraoji who keeps the wheels of the three-party juggernaut moving despite all odds,” said a Mantralay bureaucrat on Sunday. Analysts say Pawar has a daunting agenda ahead. The MVA needs to win the 2024 polls in order to gain a measure of political legitimacy before it offers itself as the bulwark of a non-BJP front under Pawar’s captaincy. Pawar’s political calculations depend chiefly on whether the Sena sticks by the MVA till it completes its term. Pawar will have to do a tightrope walk to win over key regional satraps, especially the UPA-wary Mamata Banerjee, if he wants the Congress to be on board the anti-BJP alliance. The Sena has of late been making overtures to both the Congress and Banerjee. “Pawarsaheb’s statesman-like persona and his long political innings will help him re-shape the politics of the country,” said senior NCP functionary Hemant Takle. The Baramati boy continues to soldier on — up and ready by 8am sharp to meet visitors, officials and party functionaries. Within Maharashtra he travels by road so that he can take a halt to have a word with employment guarantee scheme workers, students or farm labourers. Last week, he was shuttling between Nashik, where he participated in the annual Marathi literature festival, Mumbai and New Delhi, in a gap of three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-age-no-hurdle-for-pawar-as-he-captains-anti-bjp-team/articleshow/88245814.cms||Ambarish Mishra

Location head at Siemens Ltd, Goa, Mahendra Wani, said that widespread use of quality tools among companies in Goa will ultimately help them to manufacture quality products. Wani, who was speaking at the Quality Circle competition, said that firms need to encourage employees to solve problems pertaining to their own jobs. “Robust participation in quality circles indicates that there is a widespread use of quality tools among companies in Goa which will result in delivering quality products to the end user,” said Wani, who is the convener of CII’s panel on manufacturing. He encouraged private sector employees to continue their concerted efforts to improve quality and productivity in the industry. “Circles are formed of employees working together in an operation who meet at intervals to discuss problems of quality and to devise solutions for improvements. Employees who participate in Quality Circle usually receive training in formal problem-solving methods—such as brain-storming, Pareto principle and cause-and-effect diagrams—and are then encouraged to apply these methods either to specific or general company problems,” Wani said. IFB Industries, Alcon Cement Company and GMI Zarhak Moulders won the Quality Circle competition in the large, medium and small categories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cii-prods-goan-companies-to-promote-quality-control/articleshow/88245233.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad in top 3 districts for Covid testing in country||HYDERABAD: In the midst of worries over the upcoming surge of Covid-19 cases, and the Omicron threat, there is some good news. In terms of average monthly testing over the last six months, Hyderabad is among the top three districts in the country. Data available on testing patterns of more than 700 districts in the country over the last six months show that Hyderabad is the third district/city, with 2.57 lakh average monthly tests. Bengaluru urban is far ahead with over 15 lakh monthly average tests in the last six months. Thrissur stands second with 3.39 lakh tests. Surat (2.21lakh) and Patna (1.88lakh) come next. On the plus side, despite a large number of tests, Hyderabad’s positivity rate is very low, indicating a stable scenario in terms of virus propagation. Hyderabad has a positivity rate of 0.12%. The Union health and family welfare department has asked states to implement night curfews in districts with a high positivity rate. In the last six months, Telangana conducted 99.02 lakh tests. Between June-November, 15.47 lakh tests were performed in Hyderabad. Following Hyderabad, high numbers of monthly of average tests were observed in Warangal Urban (99,944), Karimnagar, (99,392). The number of tests per million (TPM) in the state was around 36 during the second wave, but it is presently around four. According to experts, if the positive rate is less than 1% the risk of spreading risk is nearly minimal, but extreme caution must be exercised. “If we do not follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance, outbreaks can escalate to a significant surge,” said Dr Kiran Madala, an Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-in-top-3-districts-for-covid-testing-in-country/articleshow/88244789.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communication), Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), said that the new signage will be LED backlit and would be at all the interchange and underground Metro stations for better visibility of symbols and words. All the elevated stations will have similar, but non-backlit signage. The signage would be in both English and Hindi. He said that the signage are being installed with a view to provide all key information at one single point with better visibility for the passengers. Dayal said that special kind of combined information signage would be installed at Delhi Metro’s Phase I and II stations, apart from all interchange stations across the network. “These specific signage are aimed at helping the passengers with all Delhi Metro-related information including ticketing, system map, first and last train timings, do’s and don’ts, helpline numbers, facilities for divyangjan, lost and found, other statutory information, etc.,” he said. “These are being installed near the ticketing areas of the Metro stations so that passengers and the general public have easy access to them and benefit in terms of planning their journey, along with knowing about general conduct in the Metro premises,” he said. “DMRC has already installed these signage at all the interchange Metro stations and remaining stations of Phase I and II will get these signage in a phased manner by March 2022,” Dayal said. “They are a step towards overall signage standardisation across the network, eliminating the number of signage in all shapes and sizes put up at various locations and giving a more aesthetic look to the ticketing area,” he said. The information displayed on them is divided into three portions. The left side frame will have common information for all stations, such as ticketing information and benefits of smart cards, time zone information (fare), refund rules for token and cards, and recharge of smart cards via digital means. The right side frame would also have common information for all stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-stop-for-all-info-you-need-metro-installing-new-age-signage-at-stations/articleshow/88244792.cms||---

According to Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (PANGOLIN) that assigns lineages under ‘Pango lineage’ system to various viruses including the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, the third outlier of Omicron was found from a sample collected from England on December 3. The new outlier of Omicron variant is temporarily named England/MILK-2D24AC9/2021. Dr Vinod Scaria of Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, confirmed the development by tweeting late on Sunday about the new outlier of Omicron lineage with some shared mutations. Omicron variant or B.1.1.529 split into two sub-lineages BA.1 and BA.2 earlier this month. These two variants have some shared mutations, besides some mutations that are unique to them. “A new diverse genome has appeared within the B.1.1.529 lineage that has all of the shared mutations of B.1.1.529, some of the mutations unique to BA.1 and some unique to BA.2 plus a few of its own,” PANGOLIN announced in its website. It added it seems likely the new Omicron outlier is an additional circulating member of B.1.1.529 diversity and recombination has occurred in its history. It also said it “may have mutated prior to emergence of BA.1 clade based on pattern of mutations.” It said, “as a single genome it doesn't yet require a lineage designation and at the moment it will be classified as a member of Omicron”. Experts say though Omicron has been spreading faster than previous variants, most cases are mild.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-now-has-three-sub-variants-say-experts/articleshow/88244816.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Hubballi||Activists cry foul as govt appoints non-IAS officer as KBJNL MD||Vijayapura: When chief minister Basavaraj Bommai announced the shifting of KBJNL office from Bengaluru to Almatti in September-end, the people of north Karnataka welcomed the move. Now, they are disappointed as the government has appointed a chief engineer as the managing director of KBJNL, unlike in the past, when IAS officers were made to helm the office. As per the latest appointment order, issued a month ago, the appointee is not even a KAS officer. Though the appointment is on “temporary basis”, status quo is maintained even after a month. Activists apprehend that the government’s move may cause a major setback when the Supreme Court is hearing the case on issuing a notification on the verdict of Justice Brijeshkumar Commission. Arvind Muchakhandi, secretary, Bagalkot Abhivruddhi Horata Samiti, said engineers, being technically good, may be experts in the field, “but they need administrative skills”. “When the MD is a lower-rank officer, higher-level bureaucrats in government treat them like their subordinates. The government had appointed lower-rank officers as the MD of KBJNL earlier too. But it replaced them with an IAS officer after public outcry. So we have to keep fighting to get the right officer to push the much-needed projects. Irony is that if the government appoints an IAS officer, they hardly visit Almatti and take transfer within 6-7 months to other departments. As KBJNL office is being shifted to Almatti, we doubt an IAS or KAS officer come and stay here,” he said. Muchakhandi recalled that the shifting of KBJNL office to Almatti was announced twice in the past. Another activist in Bagalkot district alleged that IAS and KAS officers, being confined to Bengaluru or any other city, don’t wish to be stationed in Almatti. “Probably elected representatives, bowing to the pressure of bureaucrats, not posting them here. But one should note that this move is against to the principle of decentralisation. Appointing engineers as the MD may cause setback for the state which is facing legal battle at the apex court,” he said. Supreme Court, which is hearing a case on issuing notification on the verdict of Justice Brijeshkumar Commission, has scheduled the next hearing on December 13. “An IAS officer is needed at this point to facilitate advocates representing the state at the apex court,” another activist G C Muttaladinni said. Irrigation minister Govind Karjol was unavailable for a comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/activists-cry-foul-as-govt-appoints-non-ias-officer-as-kbjnl-md/articleshow/88244391.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

In one of the incidents, the Thudiyalur all-woman police nabbed a Class XI boy student for impregnating his classmate. “Both of them were friends for the past five years and studying in the same private school. They were in the habit of visiting each other’s houses often. On July 25, the girl had gone to the boy’s house to get a school book. He was alone at home and he raped her. He later promised to marry her,” a police officer said. In August too, the officer said, the boy had raped the girl on several occasions when she visited him at his house. “When the girl started vomiting often, her mother took her to the ESI Hospital on Saturday and doctors found that the 16-year-old was pregnant for five months.” The girl lodged a complaint with the Thudiyalur all-woman police, who arrested the minor boy on Sunday. The Thudiyalur all-woman police also nabbed 40-year-old K Vellaisamy, a resident of Thikkupalayam near Periyanaickenpalayam, on the day for sodomizing a 16-year-old boy near Thadagam. An investigation officer said the boy was staying in a boys hostel. “When the boy was walking to his school from the hostel on Friday morning, goods autorickshaw driver Vellaisamy offered to drop him at the school. The boy got into the goods auto and Vellaisamy took him to a secluded place, where he showed the boy porn videos on his mobile phone and sexually assaulted him. Later, he dropped the victim near his school,” the officer said. The boy informed the schoolteacher and headmaster, who alerted the boy’s father. The boy lodged a complaint with the Thudiyalur all-woman police, who registered a case against Vellaisamy under Section 3 (a) read with 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual offences (Pocso) Act and arrested him on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/class-xi-boy-rapes-impregnates-16-year-old-classmate-arrested/articleshow/88244135.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Every year, labourers would arrive from Maharashtra to cut sugarcane in the Kalaburagi district, but this year there is a labour shortage, forcing sugarcane growers to rely on harvesting machines. Sugarcane is already in the harvesting stage, and growers are concerned that they will be late in cutting and supplying it to the sugar factory. Manual chopping will be delayed, and labourers demand high wages. Prashanth Kulali, a farmer in Kulali village, told TOI that he had grown sugarcane on his four-acre land last year. “Labourers had come on behalf of the factory, but they demanded money and other perks on a daily basis, which I provided. Otherwise, they would delay the work. Now, the administration of Renuka Sugar factory in Afzalpur taluk has sent the cutting machines to complete the chopping work and supply the produce to the factory as soon as possible. Sugarcane growers will not incur any losses as a result of machine cutting.” caption Neat and fast: Farmers in Kalaburagi district are increasingly preferring machine cutting of sugarcane to manual harvesting because the work is cost-effective, uncluttered, and saves time||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/as-labour-gets-costlier-farmers-turn-to-machines-to-cut-sugarcane/articleshow/88244168.cms||Mouneshwar Sonnad

Based on a tip that ganja plants were found at the waterbody, a police officer said, Sulur police sub-inspectors Navaneethakrishnan and Rajendraprasad and head constable Chandru had inspected the spot at Pappampatti on Saturday. “They found three ganja plants in the locality and one of them was nearly 5ft high. They uprooted the plants, doused them with petrol and set them on fire,” the officer said. Preliminary inquiry revealed some youths, who were employed with private firms, and local people were in the habit of using ganja. “We suspect that a few seeds might have fallen on the dried-up waterbody land a few months ago, when some youths were using the contraband. After the rain, the seeds sprouted and grew well. Since they were growing on the waterbody land, we cannot register a case against any person,” the officer said. He also requested the public to inform police about ganja peddlers and users.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cops-destroy-ganja-plants-in-waterbody/articleshow/88244120.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||New bacteria can up groundnut yield||RAJKOT: A novel bacteria discovered in Saurashtra University not only promises to increase the groundnut crop yield but also assures better quality crop. The findings by the department of animal biotechnology have been published in the reputed international scientific journal “Nature.’  Anand Agriculture University also suggests that the favourable bacteria prepared in laboratory can significantly reduce the use of chemical fertilizer in groundnut cultivation and also improve crop yield and soil condition. According to the researchers, the main work of this bio-fertilizer is to maintain soil condition and prevent land becoming barren in the long term. It works in the same way as cow dung in farming. The groundnut was chosen because it’s a mainstream crop of Saurashtra and the region is one of the highest producers of groundnut in the country. According to the paper, the rhizosphere, a narrow zone of soil near plant roots, is a hot spot for microbial activity. Rhizosphere microbiota directly or indirectly benefit plants by supplementing nutrients, producing beneficial chemicals or suppressing pathogens. Plants attract and modulate bacteria within the rhizosphere by releasing exudates. Plants also tend to select the rhizosphere microbiota based on their needs. Ramesh Kothari, professor of microbiology in SU and co-author of this paper, said, “Plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria like bacillus were enriched during the middle stages of crop development but there was a decline in PGP organisms in the matured crop stage. Overall, this study portrayed the changes in the rhizosphere microbiota of peanuts during different developmental stages of crop and may help to design stage specific bio-strategies such as bio-fertilizer to improve crop yield.” According to the paper, many studies have looked at the effects of soil type, geographic location, crop genotypes but very few have looked at the changes in microbiome across the crop development cycle. Ankit Hinsu, a student of the department who did this research in the laboratory said, “It’s good for soil if we can reduce the use of chemical fertilizer as much as possible and go towards organic farming. For that, it’s important to know which kind of bacteria to insert at what stage. As the plant grows, the bacteria that help plants changes. We prepared a mixture of important bacteria after checking their properties and based on this study, we suggested what quantity of bacteria can be mixed at what quantity at what stage to support the plant.” The sample of G-20 variety of peanut which is mostly grown in Saurashtra was used for study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/new-bacteria-can-up-groundnut-yield/articleshow/88244286.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Neither you need help from a computer nor are you in for a long search. All you have to do is to walk up to Vijay Rao and name the book. The 56-year-old, in a matter of seconds, will point towards a rack and tell where the book is kept. “I also remember if the book that the reader is looking for is available or out of stock. People ask me how I remember the names of so many books and their exact location in the library. I think my passion for work apart from the experience gained over the years may have honed my memory,” said Rao, who is tasked with cleaning the books and arranging them neatly in the racks every day. No wonder the readers get impressed with Rao as the Central Library is home to nearly three lakh books. And when Rao reveals that he is just 12th pass, many visitors don’t believe him. “I was very poor in academics. I pursued graduation but failed in the examinations. So, I quit and started doing odd jobs before I got placed in this library about 12 years ago,” Rao, a resident of Tarsali, recalled. Interestingly, when he was studying, Rao never read a single book but now he is a walking encyclopaedia of a variety of English, Hindi and Gujarati books. “I remember the books by their titles, author’s name, cover page photograph and even the rack number. The computerisation came just some years ago but I have developed this habit of remembering books which I still maintain,” Rao, who is fondly called a walking computer by his colleagues, added. “I was never interested in reading during my school years and I never thought I would be living and breathing among books. I have now developed a habit of reading and my favourite books are spiritual ones,” Rao told TOI. Central Library state librarian, J K Chaudhary said, “Rao has an amazing memory. He remembers the exact location of almost every book kept in our library and it is of immense help to our readers as well as employees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/meet-the-librarian-who-knows-bookshelves-like-back-of-his-hand/articleshow/88243938.cms||Tushar Tere

State director of civil aviation Suresh Shanbhogue told TOI that 75% of the work would be completed by March 2022, and at the same time, directorate general of civil aviation will start testing at the airport. During the testing period, the remaining 25% of the work will be completed. “As of now, the target is to inaugurate the airport on August 15 (2022),” he said. Recently, GGIAL invited applications to recruit airport rescue and fire fighters. The total cost of the project has gone up to Rs 2,615 crore because of delays due to judicial proceedings and the pandemic. He said that the aviation skill development centre is ready. The work on the runway and the air traffic control tower is going on simultaneously. Once the airport is commissioned, “the biggest aircraft” would be able to land here, he said. An official said that even after the infrastructure is ready, it takes around six months to secure all the necessary permissions and clearances from all the authorities to start operations. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to inaugurate the airport next year. GMR Airports Ltd, through its subsidiary GGIAL, is constructing the airport on the Mopa plateau in Pernem taluka. As per the concession agreement, GGIAL will have the right to operate the business for 40 years, extendable by another 20 years. The airport project will be completed in four phases. Construction of the second phase will commence only after 80% of the passenger traffic is handled. In 2018, the Centre had given an in-principle approval for the construction of an 8km-long highway from Dhargali to Varconda. The project’s pace has been stalled by court proceedings, including judicial stay orders due to environmental issues. On January 16, 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the project’s environmental clearance (EC) and allowed construction to resume.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/50-mopa-airport-work-done-additional-25-by-march-2022/articleshow/88245264.cms||---

The most recent solution discovered is to increase the number of bars in Haritha Tourism plazas run by the tourism department throughout the state. The state already has five bars operating in five of the 28 plazas. Currently, there are three bars in Haritha plazas in Hyderabad, one each in Nizamabad, Hanamkonda and Nagarjunasagar.  Officials intend to open 15 new bars in other locations as well. Pochampally, Basara, Vikarabad, Ramppa, Lakkavaram, Medaram, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Tadvai, Shamirpet, Kaleshwaram, Vemulawada, Keesaragutta, Pakala, Singuru are among them. The existing bars have made a substantial profit, with each generating more than Rs 25 lakh. Despite the fact that sales at wine shops and normal bars have declined throughout the pandemic, these businesses have done well. This has prompted officials to consider raising the number of bars in the Haritha Plazas as well. During last month’s auction, the state government expanded the number of liquor retailers. However, many people have discovered that the typical bar business is not very profitable. “Many have sold their establishments to others as operating costs have grown and guests have decreased since the outbreak,” a bar owner explained. They have petitioned the state government multiple times to be considerate of their cost structure. However, the case of bars running by tourism plaza is different from regular ones. The state government has seen liquor sales growing since the state formation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-to-open-15-new-bars-in-haritha-plazas/articleshow/88245243.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: No clarity yet on resumption of work on 19 govt hospitals||NEW DELHI: There is still a lack of clarity on whether Delhi government will be able to get exemption to restart work on 19 hospital projects being executed by PWD during the ongoing construction ban. Due to the alarming levels of air pollution, Supreme Court had on November 24 imposed a ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR. On December 3, the Supreme Court had provided exemption to seven Covid-19 hospitals under the government’s infrastructure escalation plan. It also expressed satisfaction over steps taken by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for enforcement of its order to tackle air pollution. In an order passed on December 10, the court asked CAQM to examine requests of various industries and organisations about relaxation of conditions to restart construction. The construction of the 19 new hospitals, including five new facilities with 4,479 beds and extension of existing units, comes under the purview of this order. CAQM had filed an affidavit on December 2 apprising the court about the measures taken by it, which included constitution of an enforcement task force to monitor compliance with its directions to control air pollution. Delhi government told Supreme Court that work was being done at the 19 hospital sites to improve the capital’s health infrastructure and asked to be spared from the restrictions. A PWD official involved in the hospital projects said, “Among the 19 projects, five are new hospitals being constructed at Jwalapuri, Madipur, Sirasur, Dwarka and Hastsal. These hospitals will have 690, 690, 1,168, 1,241 and 690 beds, respectively.” “The other projects are extensions or new blocks in already existing facilities, including Guru Gobind Singh Government Hospital, Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, Acharya Shree Bhikshu Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and Lok Nayak Hospital. The new block being constructed at Lok Nayak will have 1,570 beds. Some projects were heading towards completion when the construction ban was announced. I hope they get exemption from the ban like the seven Covid-19 hospitals,” added the official. Another senior PWD official said, “The agencies concerned will take up the issue of getting exemption for the 19 hospital projects with the CAQM.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-clarity-yet-on-resumption-of-work-on-19-govt-hosps/articleshow/88244820.cms||Zumbish

The rally will be attended by a large number of 1971 war veterans as well as other defence veterans, sources said. Given the high concentration of ex-servicemen in the state, a rally by the Congress leader appears to be an attempt to reach out to voters on a turf where BJP has made "nationalism" a key plank of its campaign.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-all-set-to-strike-nationalist-pitch-sound-poll-bugle-in-uttarakhand-on-dec-16/articleshow/88246041.cms||---

Last month, the fisheries department had detected over 20 high-speed boats from Karnataka fishing in the state’s territorial waters at Talpona in Canacona, and had seized fishing nets worth Rs 3 lakh. Coastal police functioning has been hit as their surveillance vessel has been non-operational for a year. Goa Kshatriya Pagi Samaj president Ashok Dhuri said that vessels from neighbouring states are often seen fishing illegally in Goan waters. “Local fishermen use small canoes, while high speed boats illegally fish here. Small canoes can’t stop those big vessels. There can be an accident. Locals need protection, but the surveillance boat of the coastal police is out of order,” Dhuri said. The bigger boats from other states indulge in bull fishing, while local fishermen use traditional fishing methods to earn their livelihood. Police inspector N Desai attached to Talpona coastal police said that the proposal for repairs of the boat has been sent to the government. However, to boost the security to the fishermen in the state’s territorial waters, the state government has sanctioned a Rs 5.25 crore interceptor vessel for the coastal police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/six-vessels-caught-fishing-in-prohibited-zone-off-talpona/articleshow/88245250.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

One can’t use it at all as it may cause health issue,” Zubair, one of residents told TOI. The matter was immediately brought to the notice of the concerned authorities but nothing has been done to address the problem. Another resident raised similar concerns, saying that residents of Noorkhan Bazaar in front of chaman are getting polluted water. “If the trend of negligence continues there could be a breakout of any disease in the locality.

When TOI contacted Khader Mohiuddin, general manager, HMWSS&SB clarified that there was no potable water supply in certain localities for 3-4 days. However, he assured that the issue will be addressed as early as possible on Monday. “Tomorrow is supply day and I will ask my staff to check and address the issue,’’ Khader Mohiuddin added.

---||Hyderabad||GHMC to resolve LB Nagar flooding issue with RCC stormwater drains||HYDERABAD: To resolve the waterlogging problems across LB Nagar circle, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is soon going to construct Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) stormwater drains along the path. The construction is set to take place at LB Nagar circle that comes under the East Zone of GHMC limits and aims to improve the overall drain network leading to the river Musi. The project, which has been pending since September 2017 and is estimated to be worth Rs 6 crore, recently got the approval of the GHMC’s standing committee. The proposal which had been gathering dust since 2017 received its demand back during the 2020 floods as the area became most affected by the heavy rainfall. Around 170 colonies in the area were flooded during the heavy rains, making LB Nagar one of the worst affected areas in the city. Even during July this year, LB Nagar saw a repeat of last year’s nightmare as existing drains overflowed into the houses situated in several colonies. Officials then conducted a detailed study on the existing stormwater drain network and came up with the measures required to improve the flow of water down into the river Musi. “That’s one of the main reasons for the estimated cost to implement the RCC drains has been revised from Rs 5.8 crore to Rs 6 crore,” a senior GHMC official said. LB Nagar does have a drain network of 40,137 metres and considering the damage caused by the October 2020 floods, officials chalked out plans for an additional drain network of 33,512 m. Officials said that the drain network would be linked from Nagole catchment area to the river Musi. The works are expected to be completed by summer next year. Officials said that the storm water drains, along with the government’s Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP), mitigate flood devastation in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-to-resolve-lb-nagar-flooding-issue-with-rcc-stormwater-drains/articleshow/88245262.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

At present, the 32km stretch is only seven metres wide. The plan is to expand the road width to 10 metres. An NH official said the stretch, which often sees heavy traffic, was an accident-prone area. “Many educational institutions and industrial units are coming up along Saravanampatti-Annur stretch. We have decided to expand the road width by 1.5 metres on each side of Saravanampatti-Annur-Puliyampatti stretch. There is no need to acquire land for the project. However, we have to fell a few hundred trees on both sides of the stretch. To compensate for it, we will plant trees along Avinashi Road, where we have enough space.” He said they had sent a detailed report to the Union road transport and highways ministry two months ago and the ministry had sanctioned Rs 100 crore for the project. “We are planning to start the work in March 2022. The work won’t affect the traffic on the stretch. We are not planning a median. After widening the road, fatal and non-fatal accidents on the stretch are likely to come down drastically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/road-from-saravanampatti-to-puliyampatti-to-be-widened/articleshow/88244147.cms||A Subburaj

State government sources have said that action under MESMA (Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act) could be taken. The striking employees said that they were in no mood to end the agitation. “They (state government) are now trying to infuse fear and force workers back to duty. So, they are talking about MESMA and are suspending and terminating staff. Until the demand of merger is met, the strike will not end.

The DTE could not take up the admission of NEET-based degree programme seats in Goa as it was waiting for the admission schedule for medicine and dentistry programmes from the central bodies. The schedule had been delayed as some aspects of the admission process for medicine and dentistry have been challenged and are being heard in the Supreme Court. This has also delayed the admission process for other NEET-based courses in Goa and the classes for programmes like nursing, homeopathy, ayurveda and five allied degree health programmes could not begin in Goa yet for the current academic year 2021-22, even as it is already the month of December. As the DTE was waiting to conduct the first round of admissions of NEET-based courses, the second admission rounds for engineering and pharmacy were also pending. Now, the directorate has announced that the first admission round for NEET-based programmes will take place on December 14 and 15. This round will be held for homeopathy, ayurveda, nursing and allied health programmes. This will be followed by the second admission round for pharmacy degree seats on December 16. On December 17, the second admission round for engineering programmes will finally be conducted and will continue on December 20 and 21. In the second half of day on December 17, engineering seats left vacant will be opened up for those who could not answer the Goa Common Entrance Test, but want to claim a seat. This relaxation is being given as nearly 50% engineering seats were seen going vacant in the state over the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/round-1-for-neet-based-courses-except-medicine-dentistry-from-tomorrow/articleshow/88245263.cms||---

Association president R Krishnaiah has said they were able to meet 16 Union ministers and 92 MPs in Delhi during the three-day agitation-tour of the association. “We have sought the support of various political parties to exert pressure on the Narendra Modi-led BJP government to take up enumeration of BCs too. Already, several political parties like TRS, YSRCP among others from various states have announced their support for the conduct of the BC census,” he said. Stating that the Association along with like-minded organisations and political parties which were in favour of BC census, would intensify its agitation in New Delhi, Krishnaiah said, adding it does not cost anything more for the central government to take up enumeration of BCs as part of its general census operations. “The government needs to only include a BC column on its census paper,” he said. In Telangana, there were only 21 BC MLAs from 119 assembly constituencies. The Andhra Pradesh assembly has 175 seats, but only 36 BC legislators. “BC population is over 55% in both states.

"The crux ofthe problem for tribespeople in Attapadi pertains to land.From cultivable lands we can derive our livelihood," said Thothi Mooppan, tribal chief of Gulikadavu hamlet in Agali grama panchayat of Attapadi. He said the tribespeople can grow traditional crops like millets or vegetables on their lands but successive governments have not taken a serious note of reviving traditional farming to address the livelihood concerns of the tribal communities. He said that 25,000 acres of land are with the tribespeople now in Attapadi, but in the name of previous generations in revenue records. These have to be officially come under the ownership of the legal heirs for them to avail benefits such as pension like the one under the PM’s Kisan scheme or farming assistance, including loans and subsidies for seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. He said out of the 25,000 acres, only 17,500 acres have been issued pattayam (title deeds). Chithraveni, a womanof Bhuthivazhi hamlet in Agali said she had approached officials for getting her land divided among her family members. In 2018, the principal secretary, wrote her saying that he has directed the director of scheduled tribes department to consider her request. But no action has been taken on the matter till now, Chithraveni said. Adivasi Bharat Mahasabha state convenor T R Chandran said that Attapadi Co-operative Farming Society was formed under the district collector to provide land to the tribespeople. The title deeds of the 2,700 acres of land under the society are in the names of tribal families but the society has not been able to provide livelihoods. “Though the pattayam have been issued in our names we have not been handed over the land. If we get the land we will be able to cultivate there traditional as well as commercial crops,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/traditional-farming-key-to-tackle-malnutrition/articleshow/88244857.cms||---

With such state of affairs, even residents are left wondering what made authorities give the city a garbage-free tag. A resident and a practising lawyer, Arvind Srivastva, told TOI, “I live in Subash Nagar colony of Shivalik Nagar, where garbage dots every nook and corner. There is no drainage system in the area and people are forced to live in extremely unhygienic conditions. The day the city was given the award, I went live to show the ground reality.” Shivalik Nagar municipal area, where mostly retired BHEL workers and other employees live, is emerging an industrial hub as SIDCUL, too, is nearby. Aman Kumar, another resident, said, “Garbage-free city is just an illusion. We want authorities to take steps for making the city clean.” When apprised about residents’ claims, office bearers of Shivalik Nagar municipal area claimed that they got the first rank because of good work. Rajeev Sharma, chairman, Shivalik Nagar municipal area, told TOI, “We did a lot of work to make the city clean. Door-to-door garbage collection is being done regularly and our sanitation workers are doing a great job.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tagged-garbage-free-shivalik-nagar-in-haridwar-presents-a-dirty-picture/articleshow/88244173.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Goa||Bhai was a true visionary who thought only about the country and his state, says Goa CM Pramod Sawant||As we commemorate the birth anniversary of Bhai today, the entire nation is overcome with emotion. Bhai was a larger-than-life figure, a guiding force for all of us. His life was spent serving the people of Goa and India, his track record worthy of being emulated. Graduating from IIT, with his roots firmly in RSS, Bhai along with senior functionaries like Shripad Naik, Laxmikant Parsekar, Rajendra Arlekar and others worked hard to grow BJP in Goa. From a party with just four seats in the 1990s to forming the government in 2000, Bhai was instrumental in bringing stability and continuity to Goa. In his long public service, he became the first IITian to serve as an MLA as well as the chief minister of a state. He worked to develop the state and empower its people, recognising early on the importance of infrastructure and human development, with his vision of a truly Golden Goa. Many of his pet welfare schemes and developmental projects, be it the Griha Aadhar scheme, DDSSY and the Atal Setu project, continue to enrich the lives of ordinary Goans. Bhai had a keen sense of identifying capable individuals and boldly backing his choice. In 2013, in Goa itself, Bhai backed Narendra Modi to become the head of the national election campaign and then PM of India. Later, Narendra Modi reposed his faith in him and insisted that he serve as the nation’s defence minister. Even in that capacity, he transformed the defence of the country, initiating the new, modern defence procurement procedure in 2016 as well as leading the Indian fightback against Pakistani insurgency in the form of the Uri surgical strikes. General Bipin Rawat was another individual in whom Manohar Bhai saw great promise and thus appointed him as Chief of Defence Staff after superseding three senior officers. He once famously retorted that if seniority were the only criteria for appointing a chief, even a computer could decide who would come next. These sharp and decisive insights always gave us a sense of reassurance that India had a guardian angel looking over our shoulders. Then, to prevent the likelihood of instability and maladministration in Goa, he came back to the state as the CM when many state leaders pleaded with him to return home. A true visionary who thought only about the country and his state, he continued to tirelessly work for Goa even when he had been diagnosed with terminal stage cancer. I am glad I had the privilege of having worked so closely with him and having shared such a deep, longstanding bond with him. He inspired me and was instrumental in my political journey. Even when I was a young man, Bhai was always by my side, helping me and guiding me. It was he who asked me to leave my government job to join public service. I am deeply humbled to be one of the few in whom Bhai had reposed faith. It was because of his trust and encouragement that despite being just a two-term MLA, I was appointed speaker of the House. Bhai asked me to never fear responsibility and to tackle my challenges head-on. I am bereft of words to be able to express my deep, undying gratitude and love for him. I will always feel his absence. A true, proud Goan and a model son of India, there can never be another like Manohar Bhai.

The patient had been on 10 litre of oxygen support waiting since August 2021. The idea of “breathing lung” is to run the lungs through a device that cools the organ while it breathes, nourishes it with a substrate enriched solution that has antibiotics which wipe out small traces of infection. Commenting on the procedure, Dr. Sandeep Attawar, program director – Lung Transplant program, KIMS Hospitals who performed the survey along with his team said, “Breathing lung procedure can helps in mitigating the ill effects of cold ischemia time and improves lung function thereby increasing the organ utilisation. This results in 30% more donor lung to be utilised by benefiting more recipients who are waiting for lung transplant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1st-breathing-lungtransplant-in-city/articleshow/88245277.cms||---

Even as the water overflowing from the duckbill spillway had been stopped, the 2.5m-long reptile accidentally fell in the deep basin and was stuck inside the concrete wall. The Selaulim dam officials immediately called forest department for the rescue. However, their efforts to lift the crocodile were in vain. Later, the dam officials called the Animal Rescue Squad, a voluntary organisation for the crocodile’s rescue. Squad in charge Charan Dessai and his team took three hours to lift the crocodile to safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/2-5m-crocodile-rescued-from-spillway-of-selaulim-dam/articleshow/88245342.cms||---

Some of the schools do not have power connection for supply of water. Around 20 schools with no scope of water facility depend on the water connections where there is power supply. The worst affected were the girls. The hostel inmates brought the matter to the notice of the civic officials, but they turned a blind eye to it.

Prebhudas, the Kottathara Government Tribal Speciality hospital superintendent and tribal health nodal officer.” Rejecting the repeated stand of health minister Veena George that there is nothing wrong in the transfer of Dr Prebhudas, the KGMOA statement here said, “It is mysterious that the transfer took place when the process for general transfer is going on. The transfer is against the rules and violates the government guidelines. Thus, it should be cancelled.” KGMOA district president Dr Mary Jyothi and secretary Dr M P Krishnakumar said, “Dr Prebhudas has made great contributions in the development of the medical system in Attapadi. He has worked for the upgradation of Kottathara Government Tribal Specialty Hospital at a critical time of tribal infant deaths.” The statement said that KGMOA had submitted proposals many times to solve the basic health problems of Attapadi.

---||Delhi||Delhi's IGI world’s fifth busiest airport due to revival of domestic travel||NEW DELHI: The Indira Gandhi International Airport has emerged as the world’s fifth busiest airport this month, thanks to the revival of domestic air travel, and despite postponement of regular international flights due to Omicron. The same reasons have made IndiGo — which flies six in every 10 domestic passengers — the eighth biggest airline in terms of seat deployment in December. And despite limited capacity and steep fares under the bubble system, India-UAE is currently the world’s fourth busiest country pair for international travel, according to UK-based air consultancy firm OAG. In terms of seat deployment by airlines this month, only four airports are ahead of IGI (33.5 lakh) — Atlanta (44 lakh), Dubai (35.4 lakh), Dallas Forth Worth (35.3 lakh) and Guangzhou (35.1 lakh). Hubs, such as London Heathrow, New York JFK, Paris CDG, Tokyo Haneda and Chicago O’Hare, are lower down this list of OAG. “Eight of the top 20 airports are in the US, reflecting the strength of the US domestic market,” OAG said. Omicron has forced a postponement of the resumption of scheduled international flights, which was supposed to happen from December 15. “Although data is awaited, so far what has been globally observed about Omicron is that it is not leading to major health scares. Hopefully, once that is established and is backed by data, regular international flights can restart with all required pandemic precautions and the aviation industry can come back from the brink of collapse,” said an airline official. OAG data shows IndiGo is the world’s eighth biggest airline this month, scheduled to operate nearly 50,000 flights. The top-four are the US biggies — American (1.7 lakh flights), Delta (1.26 lakh), United (1.27 lakh) and Southwest (99,757) — followed by two Chinese carriers — China Southern (65,837) and China Eastern (63,173). Irish ultra-low-cost Ryanair is at number seven with 63,000 flights followed by IndiGo at 47,947. According to the UK air consultancy, onlyIndiGo and Ryanair are operating slightly higher number of flights this month than they did in December 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/igi-worlds-fifth-busiest-airport-due-to-revival-of-domestic-travel/articleshow/88244868.cms||Saurabh Sinha

Punjab police are trying to locate the missing jawan. The missing jawan is B Sai Kiran Reddy.

---||Hyderabad||Residents ignoring HMWSSB plea on water scheme||HYDERABAD: New year may give a big shock to the domestic water domestic consumers who have not linked their 12-digit Aadhaar number with their consumer account number (CAN) that is registered with the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) before December 31 to avail the 20-KL free water supply scheme. HMWSSB is gearing up to issue inflated water bills between December 2020 and December 2021 for those who don’t link their Aadhaar to CAN. In fact, the TRS led government had announced a 20-KL free water supply scheme on December 1, 2020, to the domestic consumers, on the lines of Delhi. The water board, however, had extended the facility of Aadhaar link to the CANs, thrice in the span of one year, keeping in view the lukewarm response received from the consumers. Highly placed sources of HMWSSB confirmed with TOI that out of 12 lakh consumers, till now, 5.5 lakh consumers have linked Aadhaar to their CANs. “There is no other option, except to issue water bills for the 13 months, if the consumers ignored our plea,” according to an HMWSSB official. The board’s massive campaign on 20 KL free water supply scheme by Aadhaar link did not impress the consumers.  Interestingly, consumers of posh areas like Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Somajiguda, and Madhapur and Gachibowli, have not shown their willingness to avail the free water scheme. “Their perception is that while the state government has announced the 20 KL free water, then why HMWSSB is insisting on the Aadhaar link process. Few consumers have felt that we are paying monthly bills regularly from the maintenance charges, collecting from the flat owners of the apartments, every month. We will bear it as the water bill is getting a meagre amount,” said the water board official. In fact, most of the consumers who are staying in residential apartments said that though we have done Aadhaar link to avail the 20-KL free water, the problem has come with water meters installation. They felt that this was an additional burden for them, said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/residents-ignoring-hmwssb-plea-on-water-scheme/articleshow/88245288.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Nagpur||‘I am perfectly healthy, why keep me in hospital?’||Nagpur: The 40-year-old resting at a ward in AIIMS Nagpur shows up on a video call. The first known case of Omicron variant in Nagpur says, “This is just to show that I am perfectly healthy. I can do 50 push-ups right away. But please don’t disclose my identity. My elderly mother would be really tense on knowing this, and it would affect her health.” The man had travelled from Tenkodogo city in Burkina Faso, a West African country, to reach home at Nagpur via Addis Ababa and New Delhi. Before boarding the first flight he had tested negative and was carrying a RT-PCR report, he says. Narrating the story, the passenger says, “I reached the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou from Tenkodogo by road to catch a Ethiopian Airlines flight on December 3. The flight got delayed and I had to spend 24 hours in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in a hotel. Finally, I landed in New Delhi and then reached Nagpur on the afternoon of December 5. Here, the NMC team took the swab for RT-PCR test, and the next day I was informed of being Covid positive.” Earlier at Nagpur, in April, the man had tested Covid positive but was asymptomatic. After that he went to Burkina Faso sometime in June, says the man. He has not been vaccinated. “I missed the shot because while in India the three-month period after Covid had not ended. At that time I was below 40 years of age and vaccination for the age group had not started,” he says. Vaccination had begun in Burkina Faso but he had to reach India due to some urgency, he says. On Sunday, he came to know his Omicron positive status from a friend, who forwarded him a news clipping of a Nagpur man coming from West Africa testing positive for Omicron variant. “I called up the NMC doctor, who later confirmed it. It’s strange why they have kept me in the hospital. I am absolutely fine,” he says He assumes the infection may have happened somewhere in Ethiopia. “Had the flight not been delayed, I would have simply flown straight from Addis Ababa to Delhi.” During the flight there was no one sitting next to him in the entire journey, he says. He also questions the authorities over the entire system. “Why did they not test me at Delhi itself? At Nagpur, I was allowed to go home after the sample was taken. Should they not have the facility to hold passengers till the results come back? I went back home and stayed with my family. None of them are positive though,” he says. The patient is also miffed about the Rs800 charged for the tests, wondering why can’t the NMC bear the expenses. His other disappointment is about not being informed directly about his Omicron positive status. He also calls Omicron nothing but a ‘farce’. “The doctors say even they know that there is nothing wrong with me but I will have to stay at the hospital. I asked them to get my RT-PCR test done, which the doctors say will happen after 2-3 days,” he said. Back at Burikna Faso, life was normal, and so it appeared in Ethiopia too, he said. “The fuss was only in Nagpur,” he says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/i-am-perfectly-healthy-why-keep-me-in-hospital/articleshow/88244874.cms||Shishir Arya

A long queue of vehicles stretching up to 1-2km was seen on the Kincraig-Gandhi Chowk since morning. "We remained stuck in the traffic jam for nearly an hour before finally making it to our hotel," said Hari Om Shukla, a tourist from New Delhi. The situation was no better on Mall Road and Picture Palace, with commuters complaining that there were hardly any policemen regulating the traffic.  “There were a few policemen at Gandhi Chowk but they were unable to regulate the traffic, given the heavy rush. There were long queues of vehicles leading up to Gandhi Chowk,” said a shopkeeper. Residents said that there was more than a kilometre- long line of vehicles between Gandhi Chowk and Kincraig and the tourists as well as locals were stuck for a long time. Even on Motilal Nehru road, roadside parking of vehicles resulted in gridlocks.  “The major cause of traffic jams is roadside parking. This needs to be addressed through strict policing and by developing additional parking space in the town,” said Jagjeet Kukreja, secretary, Mussoorie traders’ association.  When queried about absence of adequate personnel to regulate traffic, station officer, Mussoorie, Girish Chandra Sharma, said,“The traffic chaos occurred due to weekend rush and wrong parking of vehicles along roadsides. We are short of staff as our officials have been deployed elsewhere. But from next week, we will get additional force and the problem will be resolved.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/weekend-tourist-rush-back-in-mussoorie-so-is-chaos/articleshow/88244216.cms||Anmol Jain

BKU Ekta Ugrahan supported the protest. On November 23, Punjab chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi had met labour unionists and accepted many of their demands. The blockade was from noon to 4pm, while the spots were Maanawala on the Amritsar-Delhi section, Dhilwan near Phillaur in Kapurthala district, Jethuke and Sangat in Bathinda district, Mansa, Sunam in Sangrur district, Gidderbaha in Muktsar district, Ajitwal in Moga district, and Jaito in Faridkot. The labour unions have threatened to intensify the protest if the government does not take action on their demands by December 15. Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union general secretary Lachman Sewewala and Mazdoor Mukti Morcha president Bhagwant Samao accused the Channi government of protecting the big landlords by withdrawing the letter for identifying those holding more land than legal. Sewewala said the way a deputy superintendent of police in CM's security had hit the protesters, it proved that "changing the CM had changed nothing". The government had agreed to give plots to the homeless and punish those delaying the handover. It had also agreed to restore the electricity connections of bill defaulters and offer loans of up to Rs 50,000 under a 25% labour quota in the primary agriculture co-operative societies, which give away subsidised pulses, sugar, and tea leaves apart from wheat to the holders of blue card. A panel under additional director general of police Ishwar Singh to probe cases of atrocities on Dalits and withdraw cases registered during stirs had agreed to give away a third of the shamlat land to them for a subsidised price and check dummy auctions. It was also to pay them ex-gratia of Rs 50,000 in case of a Covid death in family. The compensation for pest attack on cotton crop was fixed at 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-labour-unions-attack-punjab-govt/articleshow/88246058.cms||---

---||Dehradun||No MRI machine at Doon Hosp yet||Dehradun: Despite assurances received from Uttarakhand medical board, Government Doon Medical College and Hospital (GDMCH) is yet to get an MRI machine. Currently, any patient in need of an MRI diagnostic test is referred to a higher centre elsewhere. A hospital staff member, on account of anonymity, said that the absence of an MRI machine causes huge inconvenience to patients and also adds to their treatment cost as private facilities charge a high price for an MRI scan. Though exact figures aren’t available, GDMCH officials told TOI that every day, approximately 30-40 patients are referred to other facilities for MRI testing. In Dehradun, an MRI scan can cost upwards of Rs 9,000 at private centres. “Going to a private diagnostic lab or hospital costs us a lot of money. If there was an MRI machine here, treatment would become economical and convenient,” said an attendant to a patient at the hospital. Meanwhile, according to authorities, the state-run facility is scheduled to start a receive an MRI machine this month itself. “An entirely new room is being prepared where the machine will be installed. We expect to complete the infrastructural work by around December 20. Subsequently, the machine can be installed and eventually become operational,” said Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent, Doon Hospital. Expressing concern on the issue, Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities foundation, told TOI. "If such a crucial facility is not available in the biggest government medical facility of the state capital, one can imagine the state of public hospitals in smaller towns of the state. Steps should be taken to procure an MRI machine at the earliest possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-mri-machine-at-doon-hosp-yet/articleshow/88244245.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi
---||Jaipur||India now ruled not by Hindus but Hindutvawadis: Rahul slams BJP||JAIPUR: Comparing Mahatma Gandhi and his killer Nathuram Godse, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a withering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-RSS combine, denouncing them over religious ideologies, farmer issues and inflation at a party rally here on Sunday. Stressing on the difference between a Hindu and ‘Hindutvawadi’, Rahul said a Hindu lives in search of the truth, while a Hindutvawadi lives to grab power by whatever means it takes. “Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu and Nathuram Godse was a Hindutvawadi,” he said, to highlight the difference. Rahul said India was a country of Hindus and not of the Hindutvawadis. “Two living beings cannot have a single soul, likewise, two words cannot have the same meaning. In today’s politics in the country, there is a fight between the two words — Hindu and Hindutvawadi. You and I are Hindu but not Hindutvawadi,” Rahul said. “Whatever may happen, a Hindu searches for the truth, his path is satyagraha. Mahatma Gandhi wrote ‘My Experiments with Truth’ and at the end a Hindutvawadi pumped three bullets in his chest. Hindutvawadi spends the entire life striving for power; his path is not satyagraha but satta- (power) graha,” Rahul said, amid loud clapping at a stadium overflowing with people. “Since 2014, there is the rule of the Hindutvawadi, not of the Hindus. Is it not true?” Rahul asked the crowd, which replied in the affirmative. Rahul said the country’s entire wealth was now controlled by 4-5 capitalists, all institutions were controlled by “one organisation” and the RSS men were ministers’ OSDs. “We have to remove these Hindutvawadis and bring in the rule of Hindus. And, who is a Hindu? He who loves all, embraces all and who fears none and who respects all religions,” he added. As the crowd cheered, Rahul continued, “Read any of our scriptures, be it Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita or Upanishads, show me where is it written that a poor or a weak is to be killed or crushed? Krishna did not ask Arjuna to kill his brothers for power but for the truth.” The Congress leader said the country was facing inflation because of Hindutvawadis who wanted power even if that required working for a handful of capitalists. “India’s 1% population holds 33% wealth, 10% population holds 65% wealth and the poorest 50% population has just 6% wealth. Narendra Modi ji has left them poorer using his tools like ‘notebandi’, GST and the three black laws against farmers. Earlier, the unorganised sector’s share was 52%, now it is 20%, and 90% of the corporate profit goes to 20 companies.” Rahul said that employment cannot be generated by two-three industrialists but requires participation of lakhs of small and medium scale businesses. The Congress leader also attacked the PM for alleged lies on China’s land occupation in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. Rahul said Congress governments in states waived loans of farmers who are the country’s backbone but the Modi government “stabbed them in the back”. “When Hindu farmers stood up against him, the Hindutvawadi apologised,” Rahul said, referring to the PM. Rahul read out a grocery list and fuel prices comparing these with prices in 2014 to underline the rise in inflation under the Modi government. “These are the ‘acche din’ (good days)! But for whom? For ‘hum do, hamare do’ (referring to Modi-Shah and Adani-Ambani),” he said, adding that every day the PM thinks of something new that he can give to his industrialist friends. Addressing the rally, Priyanka Gandhi said the PM wants to sell public resources that the Congress governments built in 70 years to his crony capitalists. “They should tell what they have given the nation in the past seven years,” she said. Speaking about her experiences in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka said, “The PM can buy Rs 8,000cr aircraft for himself but cannot provide fertilisers to farmers who died standing in lines.” She urged the people to make the BJP government accountable on issues of development and welfare instead of talking about ‘pointless things’. Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi was present at the party’s national-level rally but did not address the public. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, his Chhattisgarh counterpart Bhupesh Baghel and other senior Congress leaders attended the rally. Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi reached late and could not attend the rally. Addressing the rally, Gehlot said the Modi government was weakening the states by plunging them into a financial crisis. “BJP-ruled states are not speaking up, while the PM is unable to reply to Congress CMs. This rally will herald the beginning of the NDA government’s fall,” Gehlot said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/india-now-ruled-not-by-hindus-buthindutvawadis-rahul-slams-bjp/articleshow/88245317.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

Senior police inspector Shankar Khatake of the Warje police station told TOI, “After the meeting, the two were going back to Kolhapur in an SUV. They halted in Warje in the afternoon. After lunch, the two went back to the SUV. While they were settling into it, the bag with the pistol slipped from Dilip’s hands and fell on the road. The bullet hit the hands of Komalkumar.” Dilip runs a spinning mill in Kolhapur and has a valid firearm licence for the gun. Komalkumar works in the mill. “We have seized the pistol, 15 live cartridges, and an empty cartridge from the spot. We have made a record of the incident and a further probe is going on,” Khatake said. The injured man has been admitted in a private hospital and is stable, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/kolhapur-man-injured-after-pistol-misfires/articleshow/88244907.cms||---

Mortal remains of late Naik Gursewak Singh, who was one among 13 persons, including Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, killed in an Indian Air Force chopper crash in Tamil Nadu’s Coonoor on December 8, were consigned to flame with full military honours. Body of the late Naik was airlifted to Amritsar on Sunday morning in an Army plane from where it was sent to his native village in an Army convey. However, the family members were not allowed to see his face. As the body arrived in the village, almost every eye was moist and people raised slogans in praise of late Naik Gursewak Singh. Late Gursewak Singh’s father Kabal Singh said, “Jai mai dukhi hai tae mera India ve dukhi hai, meri pind ve dukhi hai sab dukhi nay” (I am not grieving alone, my India , my village is also grieving with me). My son was not only my support system but his family’s also.” Local resident Gurlal Singh said the Army should declare all 13 persons who had lost their lives in the chopper crash as martyrs so that their family members could get benefits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/naik-gursewak-cremated-at-his-native-village-in-punjab/articleshow/88245318.cms||Yudhvir Rana

His friend Datta Patekar has been arrested under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). “Sutar and Patekar were friends and were staying together,” said assistant inspector Avinash Pawar of the Wakad police. On Saturday night, the duo consumed liquor. They brawled and Patekar bludgeoned Sutar to death, then fled the spot. “Our team tracked him down and took him into custody,” said Pawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/friend-arrested-on-charge-of-murder/articleshow/88244911.cms||---
---||Dehradun||After Covid gap, all govt schools to open even on Saturdays||Dehradun: The state education department has released an order for the schools to operate six days a week from the coming week. The department had earlier ordered the schools not to operate on Saturdays due to the Covid-19 protocols. The sanitisation work used to take place in the schools every Saturday but with easing of Covid-19 restrictions, students will now have to go on Saturday as well. The department, meanwhile, is mulling to increase the number of vacant posts for primary teachers in the ongoing appointment process. There were over 450 primary teacher posts available but now the department may add 200 more. There was a demand for the increase of posts, especially from the B.Ed TET graduates as they felt that the current number of available posts won’t help most of them getting employed. The decision has also been taken in light of the upcoming assembly elections as lack of vacancies for teachers in the government schools has been a huge issue over the past four years, an official said. Besides, education minister Arvind Pandey on Sunday met department officials to discuss the establishment of the proposed State School Standards Authority. The body will be set up to regulate the fee structures of private, government and aided schools in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/after-covid-gap-all-govt-schools-to-open-even-on-saturdays/articleshow/88244256.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Pune||Genome sequence of 900 samples in Pune district rules out Omicron transmission||PUNE: Researchers have ruled out local transmission of the Omicron variant in Pune for now. The targetted accelerated sequencing carried out of the 909 Covid positive samples drawn from the community of infected patients without a travel history found Delta and its sub-lineage behind the infection. Besides sequencing the positive samples of infected travellers and their close contacts, research labs in Pune are also sequencing positive samples from the daily Covid cases to track the variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the community. For this, five research centres have teamed up and have drawn 1,400 positive samples from private and public laboratories for genome sequencing. “Of the 1400, sequencing of 909 samples has been complete and we did not find a single Omicron case in them,” said Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, senior microbiologist and state coordinator for genome sequencing. The sequencing of the remaining 491 positive samples is underway. “Their reports will be available in a week,” Dr Karyakarte said. The state-run B J Government Medical College in the Sassoon General Hospital has the central coordinating laboratory. It collates positive samples fitting the criteria of CT value from private and government laboratory and distributes them for whole-genome sequencing. The remaining four research-cum-laboratories that are part of the Pune Region Genomic Consortium are the National Institute of Virology (NIV), the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), and National Institute of Cell Science (NICS). Researchers at IISER sequenced the highest 764 positive samples followed by NCCS (139) and NIV (6). Barring Mumbai, Pune, and Nagpur, the whole genome sequencing work — reinforced in the wake of the concern over Omicron — is primarily representing only a few cities. Experts say genomic research needs collaborative work across all the districts to rule out the community spread of extremely contagious variants like Omicron. District officials entrusted with the responsibility of sending adequate positive Covid samples from their jurisdiction for sequencing to the designated research labs, however, underlined the drastic decline in positive cases, resulting in uneven representation in the sequencing work at the state-level. “We have started prioritizing samples with less than 25 CT values for genome sequencing in Maharashtra. However, for some districts, we have stretched this limit up to 30 CT values Covid case count has gone down significantly in some places in Maharashtra. The objective is to ensure that an adequate number of samples from every district is sequenced,” a state health official requesting anonymity said. Maharashtra has reported 18 Omicron cases, so far. They either have a history of international travel or are close contacts of such infected people with travel history. However, there has been not a single case of local transmission indicating the community spread as of now. From Australia to Zambia, the Omicron variant has been spotted in at least 60 countries and regions so far, with more than 20 reporting local community transmissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/genome-sequence-of-900-samples-in-dist-rules-out-omicron-transmission/articleshow/88244909.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Decide quickly on booster dose to pre-empt Omicron: Experts||MUMBAI: To stay ahead of the Omicron threat, public health experts want the government to urgently decide on booster shots, especially for the immunocompromised and elderly. While India has detected 36 cases so far, it is predicted to replace Delta as the dominant variant in the months to come.  Leading virologists argue that even as evidence is collected on need for boosters, the government must prepare to roll it out for the susceptible population. They said full vaccination must be accelerated using all means. Nationally, over 50% of the adult population is fully vaccinated against Covid.  Booster dose makes a lot of sense and the time for the government to “act is now”, Vellore-based virologist Dr T Jacob John told TOI. “Why are we being stingy about a dose of vaccine?” he said, adding that full vaccination with two doses is a misnomer. “Two shots are for priming the immunse system, and that effect is likely to wane in 6 months to a year,” he said, adding that a booster will increase immune response exponentially. Many countries started boosters 3 months ago.  Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel, also the former head of the advisory group to Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortia (Insacog), said the immunocompromised must get boosters on priority. “If they’ve got 2 doses, they must get a third,” he said at a webinar recently. But, boosting somebody with a third dose of the same vaccine they’ve been immunised with may not do much good, he said. Samples from people vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer vaccine found it could neutralise Omicron about 40 times less than the parental virus, he said, underlining why added protection through booster was needed. Up to 90% of vaccine rollout in India has been with Covishield. “A third dose of Covishield may not do much good...,” he said. In his opinion, mRNA vaccines (developed by Moderna and Pfizer), are good booster candidates. India could also consider its indigenously produced DNA vaccines, he said.  “ZyCov D can be made available as a booster. Even Covaxin can be used as a booster for people who got Covishield and vice versa,” said Dr Jameel. He said two other protein vaccines that have undergone clinical trials in India (by Serum Institute of India and Biological E) could be good options. “Data is sitting with the regulator and they must show urgency in giving approvals,” he said.  Dr John cautioned that India had vaccines in January. “But we allowed the second wave as we waited for evidence. Evidence is good in the normal course of life not when the house is on fire,” he said.  Omicron is a variant that is more infectious and transmissible, Dr Jameel said. “It’s reducing vaccine effectiveness, which means there would be more reinfections among vaccinated and previously infected people, but it will continue to protect against hospitalisations and severe disease,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/decide-quickly-on-booster-dose-to-pre-empt-omicron-in-mumbai-experts/articleshow/88245589.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The move aims at giving opportunity to the roadside vendors so that they could restart their businesses. “Registered vendors will be allowed to be part of the scheme. Their records and documentations will be checked before giving them the aid,” said Madhav Jagtap, the head of PMC’s anti-encroachment department. According to PMC officials, funds have been made available to PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi scheme. As per the initiative, PMC had offered Rs 10,000 as working capital to each vendor. A total of 6,000 vendors had availed it. These vendors will now be eligible for Rs 20,000 capital each. If they repay it diligently, they will be able to get more loans. It is extended to all street vendors engaged in vending in urban areas as on or before March 24, 2020. According to PMC officials, the civic body needs to establish 288 hawker zones to accommodate all vendors. The civic areas have 21,000 licenced hawkers. A hawkers’ policy has been drafted to set up norms for roadside vendors. The civic body’s plans under this policy includes introduction of colour codes and logos to identify authorised hawkers. Even a biometric system will be provided to cross-verify the authenticity of vendors. Two major Covid-19 waves have hit the world so far. In India, there has been pan-nation lockdowns starting in March 2020 followed by localised lockdowns. Most businesses remained shut because of the restrictions. The PM SVANidhi scheme was launched to empower street vendors by not only extending loans to them, but also for their holistic development and economic uplift.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-aid-to-help-hawkers-restart-their-businesses/articleshow/88244914.cms||---

The PMC has already crossed 100% vaccination of the first dose. The PMC has recorded double vaccination of at least 22.81 lakh beneficiaries against the total target of 30 lakh population till December 9. The Pune rural and Pimpri Chinchwad units have recorded double vaccination of 59% and 66% target population respectively, the report stated. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said, “After the successful 100% first dose vaccination, our next target remains speedy double vaccination across the district. The Pune unit is doing well in terms of the second dose vaccination and there is no dearth of doses.” While an official from the PMC said that there are at least 7-8 lakh beneficiaries, who are due for the second dose from the PMC limits in December. Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said that for the PMC’s good show in the first and second dose vaccination, the private hospitals have a lion’s share to play. During May, June and July, the private hospitals catered to the citizens’ paid vaccination, which in turn eased the burden on the free vaccination sites, he said. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the district recorded vaccination of around 43,578 beneficiaries across the district’s 384 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm. The district now has administered a total of 1.41 crore doses of Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V. Of them, 84.54 lakh are first doses and 57.17 lakh are second doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/75-target-beneficiaries-in-pmc-limits-double-vaxxed/articleshow/88244913.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Nagpur||40-year-old from West Africa is Nagpur’s first Omicron patient||NAGPUR: Genome sequencing has confirmed the presence of Omicron variant in the sample of a 40-year-old man, who had returned to the city last Sunday via New Delhi, from Burkino Faso in West Africa, civic chief Radhakrishnan B told TOI on Sunday. This is the first confirmed patient of Omicron variant in Nagpur. Declared variant of concern by WHO, the new strain has now been found in 18 patients in the state. Other cases are from Mumbai (5), Pimpri Chinchwad (10), Kalyan Dombivli (1), and Pune city (1). Omicron is said to be more transmissible, and rapidly replacing Delta strain in many countries, which have not reported increased hospitalisation due to it. The West African nation is not among the ‘at risk’ destinations. As per state public health department, 30 close contacts of the man were traced and tested but found negative. A resident of Dighori, the man is unvaccinated since he had tested Covid positive on April 11 and left the country on June 26, before he became eligible for the vaccine. On testing positive in April, the man had mild Covid symptoms and didn’t need hospitalisation. He travelled on the basis of a negative RT-PCR report. On December 5, he arrived at Delhi from West Africa with a negative RT-PCR, which is may be why he was allowed to take the next plane to Nagpur. “Our team found he has fresh foreign travel history and asked him to take a test. Because we are taking details from even domestic flyers, we have been able to prevent any person from going unmonitored,” said the civic chief. The man was moved to AIIMS Nagpur on December 6, the patient said. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had sent 17 samples of Covid positive patients, including three more international flyers, for sequencing to NIV Pune, which returned just one positive. Samples of two UK returned flyers, a prominent businessman, and 10 of a family cluster were among those found negative. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said the Omicron patient’s four family members, relatives and neighbours were among his close contacts. “All of them were tested on December 6 and found negative. Only the positive flyers will be tested again on 10th day,” he said.  NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar said the civic body has informed the state government about the man’s arrival from Delhi. “The higher authorities shall take a call on informing other state officials,” they said. The Omicron patient had travelled in a private vehicle to his home after giving swab sample at Nagpur airport on December 5 evening. Civic officials said he hasn’t given details about the trip to home from airport. Dr Chilkar said all the suspects are in institutional quarantine in public and private hospitals. “The treating doctor will take a call on their discharge as per norms,” he said. He said the man has been asymptomatic since the day of admission to AIIMS Nagpur’s special ward, where a 39-year-old woman and her 9-year-old daughter too are admitted following their travel to UK. Dr PP Joshi, professor and head, department of medicine, AIIMS Nagpur, said they will be tested on December 14 and discharged if found negative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/man-coming-from-west-africa-is-citys-first-omicron-patient-18th-in-state/articleshow/88244908.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

This has been a respite for the hotel industry because the Omicron effect has started impacting restos in the US and the UK. Pradeep Shetty, senior vice-president of HRAWI, said, “Restaurants have managed to salvage 80% of pre-Covid business and hope for better profits during the Christmas and New Year period. Events are already being planned. The new variant is unlikely to affect the footfall and business unless the government imposes restrictions on the operations.” Shetty said all restaurants would plan Christmas and New Year events but remain guarded since the pandemic is ongoing. “Business is reviving at a good pace,” he said. Praful Chandawarkar, director of Malaka Spice, said, “Reports of Omicron have had no impact on the footfall, as several scientists have highlighted the possibility of the variant being a milder version. Business is getting back to normal and has touched 90% of the pre-pandemic level. Home delivery has come down, but dine-ins have increased.” Ganesh Shetty, president of Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association, said, “The footfall was good on Friday with restos on Karve Road running full at 50% capacity, and we expect good business this weekend.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/footfall-in-restaurants-remains-steady-hopes-rest-on-year-end/articleshow/88244918.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||Delhi Police launch online learning platform for first-timers||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana launched an e-learning platform for youths from unprivileged backgrounds on Sunday. The platform, called Unnati, will help the youth enrol in courses of their choice, get trained through live, online classes. The cops will also provide counselling, training and placement. The police chief said that over 1.5 lakh people were arrested by Delhi Police for various crimes every year, and more than 85% of them were first-timers. “Unnati aims to target that these 85% who do not fall in the web of crime and they get a chance to take a fresh shot at life,” he added. The top cop unveiled the South West district's initiative under the police’s flagship scheme, Yuva, to help school dropouts and youths from weaker sections of the society get education, skills and realise their dreams of secure future. “Anyone can learn from anywhere through a laptop, desktop, tablet or simply a mobile phone. It provides side-by-side placement to trainees,” the top cop said. The portal, Asthana added, made available the recordings of the session so that once it was over, any trainee who missed the live class could go through it again. On the successful completion of the e-Learning course, a certificate is awarded, which helps the holder in getting placement. The commissioner also felicitated seven Yuva trainees who had jobs and supported their family’s livelihoods. Asthana said that he was moved by their stories. One of those felicitated was a young girl named Megha who was looking for a job after completing Class XII to support her family. She enrolled for four months of training in computers under Yuva and got placed as an executive in a human resource firm. “Rahat Ali lost his father due to Covid and pursued a mobile phone repairing course through Yuva. He initially worked in a mobile repair shop at Karol Bagh and now runs his own shop,” PRO Chinmoy Biswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-launch-online-learning-platform-for-first-timers/articleshow/88244941.cms||---

---||Pune||Workers who braved return to city now worried about fresh curbs||Pune: Forty-year-old Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Bihar, had gone back from Pune last year in May due to the national lockdown. He postponed his plans to come back due to the second wave earlier this year, but constant calls and assurances from his employer and the promise of an increased pay packet resulted in his return in June. Rakesh, who works as a waiter in Kondhwa, is worried again. “While back home, I had somehow started a small paan and tea shop near my village. By December last year, business started improving, too. I wouldn’t have returned if not for my employer, under whom I had been working for six years in Pune. But with the new variant spreading, I dread the worst. If I have to go back now, I will not be able to pull myself up again,” Rakesh, who hails from Arwal district, said. The new Omicron variant, said to be highly transmissible if not fatal, has been giving sleepless nights to many like Rakesh, who bravely came back to their workplaces here to reboot their lives. Madhok Kumar, a Nepal resident, who has been working at a Hadapsar-based restobar as a server since five years, was also nervous. “After I went home in April last year, for around three months, I had nothing to do. I slowly picked myself out of stress and depression, went to Kathmandu and found work in a small factory. I decided to ignore the constant calls my employer here was making, asking me to come back since October last year. In January this year, I found a better job back home, but things again took a nasty turn between April to June. Still, I retained my job. But then, I decided that since all was fine, I should return to Pune. This time I came back with my wife and have been trying to get a job for her, too. The new variant has got us stressed. If it spreads, we again will have to go back and this time, we will not be able to return. Leaving a job there and coming back is a big risk and I hope there are no lockdowns again,” he said. Anup Patel from Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh works at a factory in the Ranjangaon MIDC area. He said he had to sell some cattle to set up a small grocery shop once he was back home. “My wife somehow takes care of it at present, but the business has been going downhill. I decided to come back to Pune in July after continuous calls from my employer, who sent me a train ticket and increased by salary by Rs 2,000. With this new variant, even my employer is worried and not confident when I ask him if things will be fine. I should have concentrated on my shop back home,” Patel said. A representative of a construction company that got back a large number of its workforce from Jharkhand this year by sending them air tickets said they were waiting. “If we have to let them go again, they will never come back. This will affect our projects. Last year, we took care of them as much we could, but they left amid the lockdown. Even a mention of restrictions, containment zones and lockdown affects us,” the representative said. Luvkush Kevat, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and came back to his employer in Pune only five months ago, said, “I had to sell off a plot back home to survive. Restrictions in Maharashtra come faster than the other states. I cannot go back again. It will destroy me and my family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/workers-who-braved-return-to-city-now-worried-about-fresh-curbs/articleshow/88244924.cms||Joy Sengupta

Around 2.5 lakh job aspirants from across the state were to appear for this exam. Pune police had received a tip-off on Saturday night about an attempt to leak the question paper. Amitabh Gupta, city police commissioner, said, “Working on some clues, our cyber police team on Saturday arrested a Pimpri resident, Pritish Deshmukh, director of G A Software Company and his two friends, Ankush Rambhu Harkal and Santosh Laxman Harkal, from Vishrantwadi on the charge of conspiracy to leak paper.” The police recovered nine pen drives containing PDFs of the question paper and a laptop containing similar incriminating material from them. “Deshmukh and the two others, who were to circulate the paper, had no business carrying the set paper in PDFs and the laptop outside the company office. Deshmukh was expected to maintain utmost secrecy in this matter,” Gupta said. Ankush is a resident of Sindkhedraj in Buldhana and Santosh is from Aurangabad. Apart from these three, the police secured custody of three other suspects, who are already in prison in connection with the recent health department exam paper leak case, after their link with the Mhada paper leak attempt came to the fore, police said. Gupta said, “Aurangabad residents Ajay Chavan, Krushna Jadhav and Ankit Chankhore were among the 17 held so far in the health department recruitment exam paper leak case. The three have close ties with the Harkals and had asked the latter to circulate Mhada exam papers among aspiring candidates.” Mhada’s chief executive officer Nitin Mane-Patil had lodged a complaint in this connection. On Sunday, a holiday court ordered the custodial remand of the six held in the Mhada case till December 18. After receiving a tip-off, police teams under additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale (crime), deputy commissioner of police (Cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake, assistant commissioner of police Vijaykumar Palsule, inspectors Ankush Chintaman and Meenal Patil left for Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Pune and Thane in search of the suspects. The police then got the information that the Harkals were at Vishrantwadi and laid a trap to take the two along with Deshmukh into custody. The three were found in a car where Deshmukh was to handover the pen drives to the Harkals, police said. The police found three hall tickets, educational certificates and blank cheques of aspiring candidates with these three. Police also found a pen drive containing the question paper of Mhada’s recruitment examinations, and a list of 35 candidates who were supposed to appear for the health department’s examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mhada-recruitment-exam-put-off-after-paper-leak-bid/articleshow/88244926.cms||Gitesh Shelke

---||Dehradun||Forest dept to conduct monkey estimation||Dehradun: Forest department in association with Wildlife Institute of India (WII) will start an estimation of simian population from Monday. In the first phase, experts from the institute will impart a one-week training to the field staff of forest department on how to go about the procedure. The proper exercise may start from December 24 once the training of the forest staff is over, as per forest officials. The last population estimation, conducted by forest department in 2015, had revealed that Uttarakhand has 1.46 lakh monkeys and around 54,800 apes.  Speaking with TOI, WII director Dhananjai Mohan said, “We want to have a clear picture of monkeys’ habitat and are also looking at their actual population at various locations of the state. We might as well know about their behaviour through a detailed analysis.” The exercise will also have GPS coordinates, which identify the precise location, and a simple visible count methodology will be followed.  Interestingly, the previous estimation was also conducted in December 2015 and now too, the exercise is being undertaken in December. Officials are stating that during this month, monkeys generally come out in the sun and the probability of robust estimation increases as compared to monsoon or summer when they are not sighted that frequently. “Through the exercise, the department aims to come up with some solutions to the monkey menace as it is one of the major problems according to villagers," said Dhananjai Mohan. Notably, Uttarakhand has witnessed several instances of monkeys destroying standing crops and attacking locals as well as tourists.  The estimation will also indicate whether they are present more in forests, cities, towns or human habitation as their locations will also be marked. Though locals had demanded culling of monkeys, nobody has asked for a 'written' permission for the same from the department to date. Department officials will also be taught to count other wild animals in the mid-Himalayas. “The population count in the lower Himalayas is carried out during the tiger, predators and co-predators’ estimation exercise, but this time, the number of other wild animals will also be assessed,” Mohan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/forest-dept-to-conduct-monkey-estimation/articleshow/88244304.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Chandigarh||DJ party, flowers & hugs at state borders||Ambala/Jind: Contrary to what the farmers faced at the Shambhu border last year, it is party, flowers, enthusiasm and happiness on their return to Punjab after victory in their protest against the controversial agri-marketing laws of the Centre government. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has suspended the year-long movement after the government agreed to their demands and repealed all three agri-marketing laws. As the SKM gave a call to the farmers to return home, the Shambhu border of Punjab and Haryana has turned into a joint celebration place for farmers of both the states. Last year, on November 26, the Punjab farmers had to face concrete blockades, barricading, teargas shells, water-cannons as the Haryana government tried to prevent their march to Delhi. However, the return journey has been completly smooth as farmers from Punjab travel in cars, motorcycles and tractor-trolleys. In the evening, the Shambhu border turned into a party spot and a DJ was arranged, where farmers of all ages danced to the beats of songs sung by the Punjabi singers. Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu was also present at the border, and he too danced with the farmers to express happiness over the victory. Similarly, the Devi Nagar toll plaza remained busy throughout the day on Sunday as well, as the farmers continued their movement towards Punjab and waited for the Fateh March being carried out to Amritsar. A specially decorated palanquin, carrying the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, was also a part of the procession. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Charuni national president Gurnam Singh Charuni, who was leading the Fateh March in Haryana on Sunday, reached Kurukshetra's Umri Chowk Langar and Pipli Chowk, where hundreds of people, including villagers welcomed the farm leaders with garlands, flower petals, Siropaos (robes of honours) and sweets. Hardeep Singh Dibdiba, grandfather of farmer Navreet Singh, who died during the January 26 incident in Delhi, was also present in the Fateh March. Meanwhile, several farmers entered Punjab from Haryana’s Jind district as well, where the triumphant procession was greeted with flowers and langar service at multiple points in Haryana. During a short stop at the Uchana Kalan langar site, farmers from Punjab and Haryana danced to Punjabi and Haryanvi songs. The scenes that unfolded were pretty much like last year in some ways, when Haryana farmers had given a warm welcome to farmers heading to Delhi borders. At the time, Haryana police started barricading Khanauri-Data Singh Wala border to stop entry of farmers but Jind farmers warned police that security layers would be thrown away if Punjab farmers were hindered. Virender Singh, Uchana Grain Market Association president, who arranged langar service for returning farmers, said around 40,000 farmers had food in two days and this would continue till the last trolley returned. “We have showered five quintals of flowers on farmers in this period and given a warm welcome to all farmers who ensured victory and saved democracy. The bond between farmers of Haryana and Punjab has also strengthened,” he said. Meanwhile, farmers at Singhu border lit candles to pay tribute to farmers who lost their lives during the year-long protest. Farmers said they spent 380 days on the Delhi borders, during which 714 lives were lost. In another significant development, the Delhi police has started removing a wall constructed at Kundli-Singhu border to prevent entry of farmers into Delhi. At Tikri border too, the Delhi police removed all hurdles and opened the way completely. Box: Celebrating brotherhood Committee members of a langar service at Jhanjh village of Jind district, which had started on December 13, will celebrate their yearlong service offered to Haryana and Punjab farmers on Monday. Gurjeet Kaur, niece of martyr Bhagat Singh, will address the farmers on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dj-party-flowers-hugs-at-state-borders/articleshow/88245336.cms||---

He has submitted the bill “The Farmers’ Right To Guaranteed Minimum Support Price Realisation Of Agri-Produce Bill, 2021” in Parliament but it is yet to be introduced. The proposed legislation came a week after the central government had introduced a bill to repeal the three farm laws against which farmers had been protesting for almost a whole year. Over the past few months, the Pilibhit MP has openly been supporting the farmers’ cause, calling them “own flesh and blood” and recommending the need to “understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground”. Speaking to TOI, Gandhi said, “For 70 years, farmers have not received adequate compensation for their crops. It is important to create an institutionalised and enforceable mechanism that ensures fiscal security for them. The financial burden will not be on the state as has been argued. It will merely be shifting of money from a few lakh traders to crores of farmers who actually need and deserve that money.” The bill aims at providing a legally- guaranteed minimum support price (MSP) for 22 crops that should be set at a profit margin of 50% over the comprehensive cost of production. Gandhi has also suggested the creation of a separate department for implementation of both MSP and the Swaminathan Committee report. Giving details, the MP said, “As recommended by the Swaminathan Committee-2006, the MSP should be set at a profit margin of 50% over the comprehensive cost of production which includes actual paid expenses on inputs, value of unpaid family labour and foregone rentals on farmland and fixed agricultural assets.” He added, “The bill provides for creation of a separate department under the ministry of agriculture and farmers’ welfare for implementation of the said law. It should be headed by a separate decision-making body comprising farmer representatives, public officials and experts in agricultural policy.” He further said that “in cases where the MSP is not realised, the government should pay the difference in value between sale price and MSP within a week from the matter being reported.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/varun-gandhi-to-pilot-first-private-member-bill-on-msp-recommends-implementation-of-swaminathan-panel-report/articleshow/88243557.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Aurangabad||Aurangabad civic body told not to set up cafeteria at Thackeray memorial||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court at Aurangabad has directed the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) against raising a food court or cafeteria inside the upcoming Balasaheb Thackeray memorial at the Priyadarshini garden, besides restraining hawkers from selling eatables in the area. As a measure to curtail possible menace in the future, the court also said that the AMC shall prohibit picnic/tiffin parties, smoking, chewing of tobacco, gutka and consumption of liquor inside the premises. “With the development of a cafeteria inside the garden premises and with a free entry (if any) to the garden, there is a high possibility of large number of students arriving at the cafeteria area, not with the intention of visiting the memorial, but for privacy and to have private moments,” the HC bench of Justice Ravindra Ghuge and Justice S G Mehare said on December 8. “This would become a hazard/problem to the AMC as it would not be able to restrain such visitors or couples, who have come to the cafeteria area only to share private moments and not to visit the memorial,” the bench said. “In historical places, like the Ajanta and the Ellora Caves or the Daulatabad Fort, which have developed into tourist spots, visited even by foreigners, there are no eateries or food courts inside the premises of such locations,” the HC pointed out. “We are not oblivious to what has happened in one of the tourist places ..... like Mahabaleshwar, which is littered all around by the tourists,” the HC said. The HC was hearing a public interest litigation filed in 2019 by activist Yogesh Bharsakhale and others highlighting the poor state of the Priyadarshini garden, which was once developed into an oxygen hub with a sizeable green cover. The PIL blames the AMC for neglecting the garden, resulting in dwindling green cover as well as degradation of water bodies etc. The PIL also came against the backdrop of the state government’s decision in October 2016 to hand over nearly seven hectare of the garden land for the Thackeray memorial project and fears of tree cutting and construction activity. In its latest order, the HC said that all the natural and man-made tracks inside the garden will be of a maximum of four meters width. The court also constituted a committee under Aurangabad divisional commissioner, with the district collector and the municipal commissioner/administrator being the other members, to undertake periodical inspection of the site and to ensure that the greenery and bio-diversity is maintained and preserved. The AMC, in an affidavit, pleaded that there shall be no special VIP entry gate for the memorial. The court also objected to the movement of large water tankers at the site, besides, cutting of non-native tree species like Nilgiri, Gulmohor and Subabhul. The court said the divisional commissioner led panel shall visit the spot along with lawyers from both the sides to assess as to whether it would be pragmatic now to relocate the washroom coming up at the site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civic-body-told-not-to-set-up-cafeteria-at-thackeray-memorial/articleshow/88243549.cms||Prasad Joshi

The incident happened in jail number 8 of Tihar on Friday. According to jail sources, two inmates were getting their hair cut by a barber in their ward, when one of them was attacked with the barber's scissors. The victim and one of the attackers sustained injuries. They were sent to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital for treatment from where they were discharged the same day and came back to jail the same day. A Delhi Police officer said they received information from the hospital about the attack. “The injured inmate Yogesh was found admitted after allegedly being assaulted by the other inmates,” said a police officer. The injured inmate did not want to file any complaint. However, information of the incident was received from jail authorities and appropriate legal action is being taken in the matter, a senior police officer said. This is not the first time such incident took place in prisons. In October, a 39-year-old prisoner was stabbed by two others in Mandoli Jail. He later died during treatment.

---||Ludhiana||Moves afoot in Punjab to form farmers’ political party for poll leap||JALANDHAR: Gung-ho after returning “victorious” from Delhi borders after getting the three central farm laws repealed, the farm groups of Punjab may be confabulting on foraying into the political arena for the Punjab elections by forming a new farmers’ party. If this becomes a reality, it will upset the poll calculations of all established parties in the state. “We are actively working in this direction and contacting different farm unions to form a party of farmers and also to widen the platform to contest the elections. The issue is already being discussed among farm groups and we are trying to take all stakeholders on board to form a farmers’ party and also to take good representatives from other sections and professions to bring a qualitative political change in Punjab,” said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, in influential group of farmers in the region. He said they were also working to bring into the fold Mission Punjab launched by BKU leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni so that a formidable force is formed. “We are talking to unions that are part of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), other farm groups and mazdoor organizations as people are already disenchanted with other established political parties and there has been strong undercurrent for a qualitative change,” he added. “Common refrain among farm groups and farmers is that farmers should widen their platform and contest on their own in place of having alliance with any existing political party,” Sangha said.  The farm movement has already added to the political fluidity in the state and in case the farm groups jump into the poll fray by forming a common platform, this would further complicate the situation and all the poll arithmetic would change. Other parties - Congress, Shiromani Akali Dal and AAP – are likely to be impacted while BJP is already limited to urban areas, barring very few exceptions.  Traditionally, Congress and SAD Dal have dominated in Punjab’s political scene, and the latter had an alliance with BJP, its earlier avatar Jan Sangh till 1980 and then with BSP. However, as disenchantment with principal players grew, it proved advantageous for AAP in the 2014 elections despite lack of party infrastructure. However, the party failed to gain further as its central leadership through its observers from Delhi micro-managed the party affairs, and it could get just 20 seats in 2017 assembly election, with its vote share also slightly dipping despite SAD–BJP alliance being relegated to third place. In 2019, AAP lost even security deposits at most of the seats but after the crisis in Congress started in April, it started gaining ground.  Well-placed sources revealed that AAP had also sent emissaries to a senior farm leader for joining hands. However, Sangha said that most of the farm groups would not like to join or have alliance with any party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/moves-afoot-in-pb-to-form-farmers-party-for-poll-leap/articleshow/88245344.cms||IP Singh
---||Delhi||Since pandemic struck, inmates at 3 Delhi jails earned Rs 33 crore in wages||NEW DELHI: Inmates of Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini jails have together earned more than Rs 30 crore in wages since the start of the pandemic, as per official data. While they received about Rs 20 crore between April 2020 and March 2021, they have so far earned Rs 12.7 crore in wages in the current financial year. The prison complexes of Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini consist of 16 jails and house nearly 18,000 inmates. According to data, there are 952 skilled (256 convicts and 696 undertrials), 1,238 semi-skilled (398 convicts and 840 undertrials) and 2,696 unskilled inmates (590 convicts and 2,106 undertrials). More than 20 units, including carpentry, handloom, tailoring, chemical, handmade paper, commercial art, stitching, toy-making, flour mill and bakery, are run inside the prisons. Wages are paid to the inmates as per their work. “While prisoners get Rs 308 for skilled work, they get Rs 248 for semi-skilled work and Rs 194 for unskilled work,” a Tihar official said. Till August last year, the wages used to be much lower — skilled labour would get Rs 171 per day while semi-skilled and unskilled labourers would be paid Rs 138 and Rs 107. An officer at Tihar said when officers visit different jails, they inform the inmates about the vocational courses being offered. “Those who are interested are trained by NGOs and staff. Many of the prisoners want to learn new skills and during the process, they earn wages as well. This motivates them to opt for work again in the jail,” the officer added. Another officer said that many of the inmates are the sole breadwinners in their families and, therefore, take up jobs inside the prison complex to send money back home. According to director general (prisons) Sandeep Goel, “Vocational training goes a long way in helping an inmate in his rehabilitation. He can live a better life after getting out of jail.” The Covid-induced lockdown adversely impacted the work done in the jails, an officer told TOI. “Movements were restricted when there was a complete lockdown, so we had to reduce the work. Moreover, the prisons were also decongested during that time,” he added. The prisons have been following Covid protocols and taking all precautions, said another officer. “Apart from providing masks and sanitisers, we screen inmates daily before they report at their workstations. They are also given detailed guidance on hand hygiene,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/since-pandemic-struck-inmates-at-3-city-jails-earned-rs-33cr-in-wages/articleshow/88244973.cms||Abhay Singh

Chandrashekhar, participating in an event on the ‘Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2021’ organised at Tungabhadra Hall in the Davanagere deputy commissioner’s office complex, said that 80% of the depositors were lower-middle class and middle-class families. “Taking cognisance of this fact, we have increased deposit insurance coverage from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. This amendment is a landmark in financial reform, as was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to increase the sum lent to rural residents. The Deposit Insurance Credit Guarantee Corporation has been vested with the responsibility of protecting the interests of depositors in both nationalised and cooperative banks. Prior to 2014, depositors were offered no protection,” the Union minister said. He added that the Reserve Bank of India and the central government were committed to protecting the depositors. Chandrashekhar pointed out that the passage of the new amendment had helped those who had lost money in the Millat Cooperative Bank in Davanagere recover their deposit. Davanagere MP GM Siddeshwar addressed the gathering, while PM Modi delivered the presidential address, through a video conference. Chandrashekhar promised youngsters in Tier-II cities and small towns such as Davanagere that a large number of jobs in the IT and telecommunication sectors would be generated. “The Union government is working closely with the Basavaraj Bommai-led Karnataka government to create more jobs that are integrated in nature in Tier-II cities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/centre-is-protecting-interests-of-depositors-says-rajeev-chandrashekhar/articleshow/88244154.cms||---

Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said as per Disaster Management Act, 2005, every family whose member died is entitled for ex gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh. Since Covid-19 has been declared as a disaster, every family whose member dies due to it is entitled for ex gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh, Chawla said. Chawla demanded all relatives of those who died of Covid-19 complications should be given compensation of Rs 4,00,000 immediately. Congress slammed the health department for misleading the people of Chandigarh by showing wrong figures of Covid deaths under pressure of the BJP-led government. The department has now admitted a mismatch of 256 more Covid fatalities in the city. The department further admitted that the data has been reconciled after matching the figures from the cremation ground. With this, the toll of Chandigarh jumped from 820 to 1,076, surpassing the figures of Mohali (1,073) and Panchkula (379).The callousness of the UT administration is evident from the fact that only 29 kin of Covid-19 deceased have got ex-gratia relief of Rs 50,000 and the rest are running from pillar to post to claim it, Chawla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chawla-slams-bjp-for-concealing-covid-cess-expenditure-details/articleshow/88244342.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Goregaon woman duped of nearly Rs 2L by man she met online||Mumbai: A woman from Goregaon (East), who works in an IT firm, has become the latest victim of customs fraud. The 41-year-old was duped of Rs 1.95 lakh after she befriended a man on Facebook in September. The accused, who identified himself as Tore Laritts (39) and claimed to be from Britain, took money from the victim between November 24 and December 9 on the pretext of paying a dealer in Nepal and also to release goods blocked at airport customs in Delhi.  Andheri police registered a case on the woman’s complaint on December 10. The victim realised she had been duped when the fraudster became incommunicado when she told him she was almost bankrupt and was unable to transfer more funds to him.  It all started with the fraudster sending a friendship request to the victim in September. The woman, in her complaint, said, “He showed interest in marrying me and even spoke with me and my cousins and relatives through WhatsApp video calls in November when I visited my hometown, Surat.” “On November 22, the man said his company had signed a contract with a Nepal-based oil company and said he would go on an official tour to Nepal. He requested the woman to transfer him Rs 55,000 as he claimed to have fallen short of money to pay a transporter for orders,” said a police officer.  “The man assured the woman he would return the money once he reached Mumbai as he had to convert pounds into rupees. Two days later, the victim got a call from a woman claiming to be from Delhi airport customs, who told her that her friend (the accused) had been caught for undeclared currency. The woman demanded Rs 1.4 lakh for his release and towards tax for carrying high-value foreign currency. The victim realised that she was being duped when the fraudster kept demanding money and later became incommunicado,” said the police. Andheri police have sought bank details to track the money trail. They are also looking at a trail of internet protocol (IP) addresses to track the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-goregaon-woman-duped-of-nearly-rs-2l-by-man-she-met-online/articleshow/88245609.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

It also owns the Parimatch brand, a global online sports betting platform. Belianin told TOI that owing to the growing trend and shift from offline to online gambling, the industry has grown dramatically in the last couple of years. “The current gambling revenue estimates vary from $5 billion to $90 billion a year. This applies to online gambling, offline gambling, and cash collection from offline agents, and hence calculating the real numbers is not quite possible,” he says. Belianin says the concept of betting and gambling is not new to Indians and dates back to the 7th century BC, and that 80% of all Indian adults gamble at least once a year. “In some form or the other it has been part of the culture and has been passed on down the generations. As time progressed and technology made advancements, the iGaming world also progressed along with it, making India the second largest market for iGaming across the globe,” he says. Legalising betting can provide a good source of tax income for the government and create jobs, added Belianin. “But it should come with a proper legal infrastructure to monitor the operations. We foresee state-by-state legalisation in the next 3-5 years, the same way the US market has been doing it,” he said.

In default of fine, the accused has to undergo further imprisonment of three months, the court stated.  The court noted that the raid was conducted in 2012 and the evidence was recorded 9 years later. “After such a long gap of time, minor discrepancies are bound to occur due to the lapse of memory,” it said, adding, “that the case of the prosecution cannot be discarded as the discrepancies are not on vital aspects.” In this case, cops had received information that a male person, aged 30-35 years, would be delivering narcotic drugs to a customer near St Anthony Church, Anjuna. The raiding team seized 470 gm of charas from his person. The prosecution examined seven witnesses to prove the charge.  The court stated that a commercial quantity for charas is said to be 1 kg and a small quantity considered as 100 gm. In the present case, the weight of the charas without the wrappings was 446.3 gm, which would be a variable quantity.  The punishment for being in possession of cannabis of quantity lesser than commercial quantity but greater than small quantity is rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend up to ten years and fine which may extend up to Rs 1 lakh under Section 22 (B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/srinagar-native-gets-1-yr-term-for-possessing-drugs/articleshow/88245414.cms||---

From 2020-21, the commission had received 87 complaints (57 of which are pending), while till October this year, 56 complaints were registered (50 are pending). This year, most complaints poured in from Nainital (19), followed by Udham Singh Nagar (15) and Dehradun (12), with the trend remaining the same the previous year when 29 complaints were reported from Nainital, 23 from Dehradun and 18 from Udham Singh Nagar. Haridwar, which has the largest share of minority population at 36%, was at the fourth place during both periods with 12 (2020-21) and 6 complaints being registered in the district. Incidentally, several hill districts like Bageshwar, Pauri, Pithoragarh, Uttarkashi and Champawat recorded nil complaints from the minority community during both periods. RK Jain, president of the Uttarakhand Minority Commission, told TOI that the share of population and awareness play a major role as far as the rising number of complaints is concerned. “Nainital has the fourth-highest share of minority population at 15% after Haridwar (36%), US Nagar (33%) and Dehradun (16%) yet it has recorded the maximum number of complaints. It seems that the minority community in the district is aware of its rights, which is a good sign. The reason for zero complaints being registered in hill districts can be attributed to the fact that the share of minority population in such districts is extremely low. Also, awareness in these places is low,” said Jain. The report also throws light on government departments against or related to which the complaints have been registered. In 2020-21, the highest number of complaints were registered against or related to police department (29), followed by the revenue department (20) and the education department (10). This year, administration topped the list at 21, followed by police department (20), and education department and minority welfare department at 3 each.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/minority-panel-receives-maximum-plaints-from-nainital-reveals-report/articleshow/88244345.cms||Mohammad Anab

Analysis of new and active cases in Ahmedabad reveal that the epicentre of Covid cases is stabilizing after a spike. Moreover, compared to 100 active cases on December 1, till December 12, Ahmedabad has recorded a 42% increase. It is lower than the state’s figure of 87%, from 293 to 548. Experts say that even in the city, the western parts are recording more cases than the eastern ones. “There is a difference in the socio-economic profile and propensity to undergo Covid testing. Due to fewer cases, prevalence of RT-PCR tests is much higher than RAT. The need of the hour is to be on guard and ensure that the cases don’t spiral upwards,” said a city-based critical care specialist. On December 7, the city reported 25 cases whereas in terms of active cases, December 10 and 11 saw 158 cases. Hospitalization has, however, remained lower, show figures from the Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA). On Saturday, nine patients were admitted at private hospitals in the city, including two in ICUs and one on ventilator. According to state health department figures, the district has 33 persons under quarantine.

The suspects claimed to be involved in ‘trading’ various cryptocurrencies and they cheated the complainants by floating various schemes of different cryptocurrencies. In the last two weeks, men from Chatushrungi, Sahakarnagar and Deccan areas lodged complaints with the cyber police. One of the victims invested Rs85 lakh with a man, while the other two invested Rs10 lakh and Rs5 lakh, each with another group of men. “Yes, we are receiving more cheating complaints involving cryptocurrencies. People believe that they will earn celestial profits on their investments in cryptocurrencies after hearing about profits obtained by others. Without verifying the credentials of the websites or the persons, people are investing their money and are falling prey to the promises made by the cheaters,” said deputy commissioner of police (cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake. Police said the suspects promised handsome returns to the victims on their investment in the various cryptocurrencies, but the suspects swindled them. “People want to earn more in quick time. They want better profits on their investment when compared to shares and mutual funds,” Navatake said. Navatake said, “People have been cheated by the suspects in three different ways involving virtual currencies. Firstly, suspects float a scheme among the people and promise handsome returns on investment in cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the suspects prepare their own virtual currencies and ask investors to invest in them and then dupe them. Lastly, the suspects prepare a fake or bogus exchange of prominent cryptocurrencies and cheat the investors.” She said, “As of now, there is no legal framework to control or regulate the spread and use of cryptocurrencies in India. But despite this, people are investing in the cryptocurrencies”. “It is not known if it is a commodity or a currency, but people are buying it in bits and pieces,” a senior police officer said. A senior police officer said that the Central government is discussing on creating a regulatory regime for an official digital currency issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and prohibiting private cryptocurrencies. As of now, cryptocurrencies are not legal tenders. The government is likely to discuss a bill on cryptocurrencies soon and will frame regulations on the use and exchange of cryptocurrencies, the senior police officer added. In a recent case in Kerala, the Kannur police arrested four persons for allegedly running a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme by promising high returns to investors in a fraud estimated at around Rs 100 crore. The accused ran a Ponzi scheme in the name of Bengaluru-based Long Reach Technologies and lured investments from for five schemes by promising huge returns of between one per cent to five per cent daily. When they could not pay investors the promised returns or the money they had invested, they offered investors a cryptocurrency called Moris Coin which was also cheating. A large number of people have lost their money through the scheme, a TOI report said. The scheme run by the accused operated on a money chain model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cryptocurrency-cheating-cases-up-from-2-to-54-in-yr/articleshow/88244979.cms||---

She had been critical after suffering liver damage due to dengue and multi-organ failure subsequently. She was 44. A large number of leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, condoled the death of Asha Patel. An active member of the Patidar reservation agitation, she won the Unjha assembly seat on a Congress ticket in 2017. Subsequently, she quit the party and joined the BJP, winning the Unjha seat again on a BJP ticket. Dr V N Shah of the private hospital where Patel was admitted, in a video message said, “Ashaben was admitted to the hospital on Thursday evening due to dengue. She gradually developed multi-organ failure. Her heart and lungs had weakened and her liver and kidneys were not functioning. All these organs were functioning on life-support systems.” The state government had on Saturday moved a team of expert doctors from the government-controlled UN Mehta hospital to the private hospital in an attempt to provide further medical assistance to her. She was diagnosed as having dengue after getting a fever on December 7 after she returned from Delhi, where she met several top BJP leaders. She got herself treated at a local hospital in Unjha for a couple of days and was shifted to the private hospital in Ahmedabad. Asha Patel won the byelection in 2019 on a BJP ticket with a margin of 23,072 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-mla-asha-patel-succumbs-to-dengue/articleshow/88245373.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Just 15% cyber cases solved in Mumbai, but rate better than past years||MUMBAI: The city cyber police have managed to solve just 15% of cyber offences registered this year till October 31, making just 657 arrests in 2,369 cases. The silver lining is that the detection rate rose in the first 10 months of 2021 compared to 8.5% in 2020 and 12.8% in 2019. Looking at the innovative ways fraudsters have adopted to dupe people during the pandemic, the city police have differentiated between crime categories to get a better idea of the modus operandi of cyber criminals. The categories include jobs fraud (which increased because of the ascendancy of work-from-home arrangements, with many losing their savings to fraudsters who demanded money in exchange for ‘job offers’), online purchase fraud, loan fraud, fake website scam, customs or gift fraud, cryptocurrency fraud, sextortion, obscene email, morphed email, credit card fraud, and pornography.  Data from 2018 to 2021 shows that a total of 2,648 credit and debit card fraud cases occurred, but only 131 cases could be solved in all. A major category of concern is miscellaneous cyber offences: out of 3,732 cases, only 411 could be solved. Retired IPS officer D Sivanandhan, who served as Mumbai’s police commissioner and Maharashtra’s director general of police, said qualified cyber investigation officers are few. The IT Act warrants officers of at least inspector rank to be investigating officers, and they are in short numbers. “Police stations are clueless and personnel are untrained. Almost all future crimes would be cyber-based. So, the entire police force has to be very qualified in cyber technology. We need to outsource skill by inducting highly qualified youngsters to investigate and we need to pay them well,” he said. Cyber lawyer, Dr Prashant Mali said it is very strange that in spite of the reluctance for filing FIR of the common man, whatever gets filed is not detected. “Less motivation and poor technical skills lead to dismal detection rate. New Home Minister doesn’t seem that interested in cybercrime, leadership and policy initiatives for cybercrime in this Government is missing,” said Dr Mali.  He said even the emergency helpline, which some States have started, is still not implemented in Mumbai and Maharashtra to stop the money that is fraudulently siphoned from banks and through other online means. “Not providing cybercrime helpline 155260 is the biggest cyber sin of this government, crores lost by common man could have been saved if this government would have acted till date,” he pointed out. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said, "Firstly the cases registered are very low in number for the given period. I am sure that not many cases are being registered. Statistics should also show the number of complaints received irrespective of whether cases are registered or not." “During the pandemic, there was also an exponential increase in internet use as more people shopped online. As a result, fraudsters took advantage of this factor and this led to an increase in cybercrimes. Cybercops need continuous training sessions as cybercrimes are evolving and getting more complex,” said Bhatia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-just-15-cyber-cases-solved-but-rate-better-than-past-yrs/articleshow/88245632.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘52% of kids aged 2-4 years attend preschool’||AHMEDABAD: The National Family Health Survey-5 (NHFS) results showed that 51% of boys and 53% of girls aged 2-4 years attended preschools during the survey period (2019-21). The attendance was the same for both nuclear and joint families at 52%. There was not much of a difference when it came to rural (51%) and urban (52%) areas where the children either attended private preschools or anganwadis run by the state government. The preschool attendance was included in the survey for the first time. Among the major urban centres, Vadodara recorded highest attendance of 76%, followed by Rajkot (59%), Ahmedabad (56%) and Surat (48%). Anganwadis worked as a one-stop solution for age-eligible services. The most prevalent usage remained supplementary food which was availed by 66% of eligible population under survey. “Early monitoring is of utmost importance. For example, the percentage of stunted (low height for age) children remained the same at 39% compared to NFHS-4 conducted in 2015-16. The share of underweight children increased by 1% from 39% to 40%,” said a city-based NGO official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/52-of-kids-aged-2-4-yrs-attend-preschool/articleshow/88245376.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Dehradun||Nainital: Friendly tigress saved from burning forest turns pet at rescue centre||NAINITAL: Five-month-old tigress Shikha was scared, weak and dehydrated when she was rescued by the forest department from a burning forest in Terai East, Nainital, in 2019. She had been haplessly looking for her mother. Officials searched for the cub’s mother, but there was no trace of her.  Since then, forest officials have raised her on their own. Now, the two-and-a-half-year-old tigress has become friendly at the Rani Bagh rescue centre in Nainital and is like a pet for the staff who raised her lovingly and with immense care. She was briefly moved to Nainital Zoo in 2020 to fraternise her with other tigers but was attacked by one of the tigresses. Shikha was then sent back to the rescue centre. “Tigresses like Sikha, who have a jolly, friendly nature, aren’t accepted by other big cats in the wild, and may be harmed by them. Looking for easy prey, they turn to human habitats. While we do release animals back to the habitats they were rescued from after treatment, that is not the case with Shikha. She was rescued as a cub and her habitat was burned down. The rescue centre is the only home she knows. At Rani Bagh, she is happy and never misses an opportunity to play with the staff,” divisional forest officer Biju Lal said. Lal believes Shikha may have to stay there for good. Dr Himanshu Pangti, who treated the tigress at the centre, told TOI that Shikha was wild and aggressive when she was rescued. But soon she became friendly with the staff who were taking care of her, almost as if they were her family. Shikha loves spending time with her caretakers. She cooperates when medical tests are done, and gladly allows vaccine jabs, say officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/friendly-tigress-saved-from-burning-forest-turns-pet-at-rescue-centre/articleshow/88244366.cms||---

The city’s minimum temperatures have remained above the normal by two to three degrees for the last few days. On the contrary, the day temperature has been below normal by one to two degrees. Last week, unseasonal rain had caused the real-feel temperature to dip. On Sunday, the Shivajinagar observatory recorded 28.6 degree celsius as the maximum temperature which was below the normal by 0.4 degree while the Lohegaon recorded 28 degrees celsius which was below normal two degrees. “The day temperatures are below the normal range due to cloudy conditions. Because of the current weather conditions, the night temperatures are above the normal range. This weather condition is likely to remain till December 18. Thereafter, there is a chance of a fall in the night temperature,” Met officials said. The IMD officials have forecast isolated very light to light rainfall over the city from December 14 to 18 with partly cloudy conditions in the afternoon hours. “There is no strong weather system present over Maharashtra and the adjacent states at present. On December 13, there is a chance of interaction between northerly winds and southerly winds over the state. Because of this weather phenomenon, all four meteorological divisions including Madhya Maharashtra, which includes Pune, are likely to get isolated very light to light rainfall between December 14 and December 18,” Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecast division of the IMD, said. The Met officials also forecast a little bit of foggy weather conditions in the late night and early morning hours for the next few days.

The aid, which consisted of life-saving medicines was sent on Saturday from New Delhi to Kabul by a special flight. Taking to Twitter, the Afghan ambassador to India, Farid Mamundzay said the aid will help many Afghan families in this difficult time. "All kids need a little help, a little hope and somebody who believes in them.'

---||Ahmedabad||Education@home: Myopia cases rise among children in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: At the clinic of an ophthalmologist in the city, a seven-year-old patiently put his chin on the machine and looked at the ‘images’ on the screen. The child was complaining of headaches and blurry vision and had asked his parents to set the chair near the computer. The parents’ suspicion proved right as he was diagnosed with myopia (nearsightedness) and was prescribed glasses. Dr Neera Kanjani, an Ahmedabad ophthalmologist, said that before the pandemic, four of every ten children coming for a check-up would be diagnosed with myopia but now the figure has jumped to six. “About 20% of the new paediatric patients are already reporting high numbers though they had no history,” she said. “We see the trend of increase in numbers in glass-wearers too.” The primary reason, said experts, is the high usage of digital devices including mobile phones, laptops, and desktops. Experts said that some were reported to be using screens for six to seven hours as many attended both schools and coaching classes online. Dr Manish Joshi, another city-based ophthalmologist, said that often the children’s difficulty in reading letters on blackboards would prompt the parents to seek a check-up. “Due to the pandemic, the distance between the eyes and screens has reduced,” he said. “Thus, in many cases, children came with myopia requiring lenses of high power.” The experts are also prescribing eye drops to those complaining of irritation in the eyes, blurred vision, and double vision. They suggest rationing screen time, taking frequent breaks, and including leafy vegetables and carrots in the diet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/educationhome-myopia-cases-rise-among-children/articleshow/88245378.cms||---

Gopal shed light on the common ground shared by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the Indian Constitution. Both documents are beacons of human rights that have stood the test of time. The scope of human rights in the text of the UDHR needs a revisit and broadening to make it suited to the present times, he said. The role of Dr B R Ambedkar in representing the voices of the oppressed was reiterated by the legal luminary. The audience was reminded of the exemplary role played by Dr Ambedkar in shaping a constitution that gave thrust on fundamental rights and separation of powers by the jurist. Gopal pointed out that the Indian constitution is anchored in the ideals of freedom, equality, liberty and dignity. That the Constitution has to be the guide of our interpersonal behaviour was a crucial point highlighted by the jurist. The session was followed by a lively discussion between the jurist and the students and faculty of the department of political science. The question-answer session touched on the state-citizen relationship during the pandemic phase, the importance of upholding constitutional values, and the political subtext of the Uniform Civil Code. The role of Buddhism in creating a debate surrounding human suffering and thereby uplifting the oppressed was highlighted by the jurist. The talk was chaired by Suresh R, head of the department of political science who spoke of the importance of human rights in the Indian context and how a constant engagement between the citizens and the law will lead to the evolution of human rights in the Indian context.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ku-campus-observes-human-rights-day/articleshow/88230412.cms||---

In Hubballi-Dharwad, there are a total 62,000 streetlights, of which nearly 8,000 are defunct. The HDMC officials have decided to replace more than 6,000 defunct streetlights with LED bulbs, and repair them, for which the authorities are spending more than Rs 1.7 crore. A total 40 new high-masts and mini-masts will be installed at various places in Hubballi-Dharwad at a cost of Rs 1.8 crore. S M Ganachari, chief of electrical section, said that they have completed the process of floating a tender for the work. “Due to the election code of conduct being in force, the work order was not issued, and it will be started after that.” “We have listed 6,000 streetlights for replacement of bulbs with LED bulbs, and to carry out necessary repairs. There are 8,000 streetlights that need to be replaced, of which 6,000 have been shortlisted for the work in the first phase,” he added. According to sources in the HDMC, the complaints pertaining to defunct streetlights was more, compared to others, in the control room. Due to the lockdown clamped due to Covid-19 and other issues, the complaints were not addressed for months. “It’s good news that HDMC officials are going to repair or replace streetlights. In the absence of streetlights, people were finding it difficult to use roads in the evening and at night, due to the fear of crimes like chain-snatching,” said Ramesh S, a social activist. “The authorities should repair streetlights and replace LED bulbs on them, in the outskirts of the twin cities, and also at the extension areas of Hubballi-Dharwad. In some extension areas, streetlights were not repaired or replaced for 2-3 years. The civic authorities should ensure that streetlights are working in the evening,” said Mohan C, a resident of Gokul Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/defunct-streetlights-to-be-repaired-soon/articleshow/88244132.cms||J Abbas Mulla

Laboratories of DRDO-Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), Pune, and High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL), Pune, have jointly designed the system. “The newly tested system could achieve the range of up to 45km, which is a big feat for the Indian Army. The existing Pinaka system, which is already in the Army, has a range of up to 35-37km. The new system will be inducted in phases in the coming months,” said a senior DRDO scientist who wished not to be named. He said, “The new version is equipped with advanced technology to enhance its strength. Second, the metal weight is lesser compared to the earlier version. These factors are crucial for operational preparedness.” “It is a result of two-and-a-half-years’ (efforts). Other nations have shown interest in the Pinaka Extended Range System and are already considering its capability and use in the operation,” said the scientist. An ordnance factory and a private firm based out of Nagpur will carry out mass production of the system, said another senior DRDO scientist. “The protocol states that the Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) will carry out testing of the first lot of the system. Thereafter, it will hand it over to the Army,” he said. A team of scientists from both the laboratories had carried out the testing at the range in the last few days. The DRDO and the Army conducted a series of performance evaluation trials of these industry produced rockets at the field firing ranges in the last three days. In these trials, Enhanced Range Pinaka rockets were test-fired at different ranges with various warhead capabilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/advanced-pinaka-achieves-45-km-range-during-trial/articleshow/88245010.cms||Sandip Dighe

The start of negotiations for purchasing old buildings, demolishing them, removing the rubble through the narrow, circuitous lanes in congested localities, rehabilitating the displaced while keeping the intrinsic culture and tradition of Kashi undisturbed seemed like an improbable job at hand. Recalling the journey, divisional commissioner and Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board chairman Deepak Agrawal said, “Our first test was to ensure that the culture and religious traditions remain undisturbed as the expansion had to take place in a densely populated area with commercial activities.” In the initial survey for the project, 166 buildings were identified but after two plan revisions, 320 buildings were earmarked, and then complex negotiations began with the owners, he said. “There were numerous tenants who paid nominal rent, many properties belonged to trusts or religious bodies while some owners had shifted abroad. There was resistance of various shades, including political,” he added. Approximately 1,111 persons were rehabilitated after convincing them through transparent negotiations, said Agrawal Rs 390 crore was spent on purchase of buildings and almost Rs 100 crore was spent on rehabilitation, he added. There were more hardships ahead when temples were found in many buildings. The buildings had to be razed manually to ensure the temples were not damaged, said Agarwal. Removing the debris after demolition through congested lanes and uneven ground while ensuring that sewage, water, and power supply are not affected was also a challenging task. “During all this, we had to ensure that entry of devotees at KVT was not disturbed. Since KVT is in the red zone (inner security cordon) of the highly sensitive KVT-Gyanvapi complex, we had to be extra alert in allowing entry to the people engaged in construction work,” said Agrawal. When 70% of identified buildings were purchased and razed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation of KVD on March 8, 2019. And, when the construction started in February 2020, the Covid-19 waves and lockdowns multiplied our challenges since the project was scheduled to be completed in August, he added. “We did our best to keep the work going amid all curbs and protocols. We have ensured all facilities which pilgrims can dream of at any prime shrine,” said PWD executive engineer Sanjay Gore, who is supervising the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvd-turns-into-reality-despite-spate-of-challenges/articleshow/88245013.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation sewage used to dilute industrial waste: Task force||AHMEDABAD: Since October 20, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has disconnected 330 drainage lines from industrial units for discharging untreated toxic effluent into them, which then pollutes the Sabarmati river. Strangely, AMC’s treated domestic sewage water is being drawn by major central effluent treatment plants (CETPs) to dilute industrial effluent before it is release into the river. CETPs are places where only toxic industrial effluent is to be treated. A joint task force (JTF) constituted by the high court visited three major CETPs and was surprised to find the supply of raw sewage of the AMC for “dilution” purposes, which is against the Consolidated Consent and Authorisation (CCA) issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB). The JTF in its October report pointed out that drawing sewage from outside industrial estates should be immediately stopped as industrial discharge and domestic sewage have different sets of parameters and one should not be used to dilute the other. “The AMC is yet to disconnect these sewage supplies to CETPs,” said a senior GPCB official. The JTF in its report mentioned that it visited a CETP in Odhav and found that it was drawing 0.5 million litres of AMC sewage everyday for dilution. Similarly, a CETP in Naroda used a 3 MLD mixed wastewaster stream consisting of sewage, food and textile waste, while another CETP was receiving 2 MLD of treated sewage from AMC’s Vinzol STP everyday for dilution purposes. The JTF drew up a 10-point action plan for the CETPs, GPCB and AMC to immediately put their houses in order. Another important step taken by the JTF was to ask farmers of Miroli village, 25km downstream of Ahmedabad city, to stop using the toxic water of the Sabarmati for irrigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-sewage-used-to-dilute-industrial-waste-task-force/articleshow/88245380.cms||Paul John
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Keeping the protest alive with little savings||Thiruvananthapuram: Nima Mohanlal has won many medals in volleyball at national level competitions from the year 2010- 2014. Both her father and husband are bedridden patients. So Niima has to put aside her job as a helper in a fish stall to participate in the ongoing strike in front of the Secretariat. She is a daily wage worker and earns very little money and is also mother of a 4-year-old child. Nima’s mother is an anganwadi helper and now her family runs with her mother’s meagre salary. Nima is a resident of Cherai, Eranakulam, who is now in the state capital to take part in the protest. Among the 40 sports people who stage a strike in front of the secretariat, the majority are women. As the strike hosted by the national level sports players has completed its ninth day, the sports minister’s office has acknowledged to them that favourable actions will be taken soon to resolve the issue. However, the protestors have decided to continue their strike till they get their appointment order. Every day at strike, the protesters run short of their meagre savings, starve often and stretch themselves. The women protesters do not even have access to sanitation facilities.  No toilet facilities are available near the protest area and the protestors are forced to skip the restaurant toilets in the area because they cannot afford the food from the restaurants. The food and water for the protesting sportspersons are being sponsored by charity workers every day. The protestors coming from other districts have to rent rooms at hostels and hotels. They say that they sacrificed the best phase of their youth for the nation, but now; the government is giving them a very hard time. “My younger sister is a sports person, but she stopped practicing seeing my situation. I have seen people, including sports council and ministers cheering us when we win a medal, but I have not seen anyone till this day here to support us,” Nima said. “This is our only option for survival. We are here to fight against our fate. Even we started feeling like we have wasted our life by dedicating our lives to sports. We were treated very badly by the police officials during the protest. This would not have happened if the government had shown some interest,” she added. “I have been into this field from a young age. We have struggled a lot to get a national medal. The officials continue to say favourable actions will be taken but we barely see anything happening,” said Shalini Thomas, an athlete from Idukki. Rajesh R, a swimmer from Nedumangad gave up his teaching job to take part in the strike. “Now, I do not even have a single rupee with me to meet my daily needs here. The small vegetable shop owned by my father is the only survival option for my family back home. My son is really good at sports, but I will never let him come to this field. My experiences have forced me to take this decision,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/keeping-the-protest-alive-with-little-savings/articleshow/88230430.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CM's olive branch: Wants governor to be chancellor not 'resident'||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday told the media that the LDF government had never tried to weaken the powers of the governor in his capacity as chancellor of Kerala's universities, let alone fire from his shoulder to realise 'political' objectives. Stating in categorical terms that he and his government wanted to see the governor continue as chancellor, the CM nevertheless seemed to hint that the LDF government was fully prepared fo face the worst. "Namukku nokkum" (let's see) was his response to a pointed query as to the government reaction in case the governor was adamant on relinquishing his position as chancellor. In an hour-long news conference held in Kannur, the CM painstakingly replied to each of the charges the governor had raised in his December 8 letter alleging political interference in the functioning of universities and dilution of academic standards. Vijayan said his government had never asked governor Arif Mohammed Khan to do anything against his conscience and it has no intention to take over the post of chancellor of universities. Vijayan said there are efforts from some corners to sabotage the government’s attempt to give a new sense of direction to the higher education sector. "It is sad to see public statements from the governor that can help such efforts. A stand that can provide support to people who think that Kerala shouldn’t progress shouldn’t have come from people like him who occupy a constitutional post,” he said. “The government desires that the honorable governor should continue in the chancellor's position. I hope he will change his stand on this.” Referring to earlier remarks that the governor had been called 'resident', the CM clarified that it was in the context of the unanimous Assembly resolution opposing CAA (the controversial citizen amendment act) and was only mentioned in an impersonal context to emphasise the democratic rights of elected representatives.  The chief minister said university vice-chancellors are appointed through search-cum-selection committees as per UGC guidelines. "Prof V K Ramachandran, an expert in social sciences, was the government nominee in the search committee, including in the case of Sanskrit university. It also had Prof Rajan Gurukkal and a UGC nominee. It is not rational to say that all these persons were appointed based on politics,” he said.  "Those nominated by such a committee are considered for VC appointments and the chancellor has all rights to express his opinion, but the allegation that all these things are decided by the CM and ministers is false," Vijayan said. He said the issue was between the chancellor and the search committee in Kalady Sanskrit university. “The committee found a person suited for the post and this was communicated to the chancellor. The thought for a panel came up then and the committee members went ahead with its procedures. What I heard is that the honorable governor then told a person occupying a responsible position in the higher education department -- not the minister but another person-- that there was no need for a panel. What I understand is that this was the situation in which one name was given,” he said. The chief minister said one name was sent for appointment in Sanskrit University as there was a consensus among all members, including the UGC representative, in this regard. In the case of Kannur University VC, the order was issued by the chancellor himself. “After taking a decision, if a statement of that nature is coming up, then doesn’t it mean that he is acting under some pressure? The governor is a person who has been in the public sphere for years and has occupied various posts. If he has put his signature and appointed a VC and then he speaks against his own decision, what needs to be doubted is whether it is due to any interference," he said.  Vijayan said it was not the government's policy to fight with the governor. “On December 8, the governor, who is also the chancellor, sent a letter raising some issues in the higher education sector. The government took his concerns seriously and a response was given on the same day. The response letter was given in person by the chief secretary and the additional chief secretary (finance). The finance minister also met him and listened to his concerns. I couldn’t meet him as I was in Kannur but had contacted him over phone,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-offers-olive-branch-wants-guv-to-remain-chancellor-not-resident/articleshow/88245018.cms||---

The Bhosari police have registered three separate cases, including dacoity and robbery, against them. “We have arrested three suspects and have launched a search for the others,” sub-inspector Govind Pawar of the Bhosari police told TOI. A 34-year-old autorickshaw driver, who sustained severe injuries in the attack told TOI, “On Saturday night, my father informed me that someone had broken the windscreen of my autorickshaw. I found a big stone stuck in it.” The suspects were present at the spot. “When I demanded answers, the suspects threatened me and warned me against going to the police. They also robbed Rs850 from me,” he said. He said that he was talking to a mechanic for repairs, but the suspects thought that he was informing the police. “After some time, they barged into my house and assaulted me, my parents and brother with cement blocks,” the autorickshaw driver said. Later, the suspects pelted stones at a saloon. “They also assaulted one of our workers and robbed him,” the shop owner said. He said that these suspects have been harassing shop owners in the area and often extort money from them, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-of-gang-arrested-after-vehicle-vandalism-spree/articleshow/88245015.cms||---

The government is still awaiting confirmation from the invited leaders and a final announcement, if the proposal materialises, is expected to follow a meeting of the foreign ministers of these countries with their Indian counterpart S Jaishankar later this month. This may also be only the second time in recent times that the Republic Day event sees several heads of state and government as chief guests. Leaders of all Asean countries had attended the parade in 2018. India has been seeking stronger connectivity and trade ties with central Asia, a region China has heavily invested in, and is working closely with them under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Except for Turkmenistan, all other central Asian countries are full members of SCO. India's development of the Chabahar port in Iran is also aimed at bypassing Pakistan for access to central Asia, apart from Afghanistan. Three of these countries - Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - also share border with Afghanistan. India had invited all the five countries recently for the NSA-level conference on Afghanistan. Official sources admitted the pandemic situation will also be a factor in deciding whether or not the leaders are able to participate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/leaders-of-five-central-asian-nations-may-be-invited-for-r-day-event/articleshow/88246111.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Lensman chronicles rich cultural history of the city of palaces||Kolkata: The magnificent mansions of yesteryears along Kolkata’s central and northern stretches, which are an integral part of the city’s rich cultural history, have been chronicled in a visual narrative. Titled ‘Calcutta: Stately Homes and Palaces, the work by Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), under the Union ministry of culture’, embodies a magnum opus by photographer Anirban Mitra, who was on the project since 2005, and a foreword by UK-based lensman Derry Moore. The publication follows the exhibitions at the ICCR in 2012 and London’s Nehru Centre in 2013. The 346-page volume includes more than 200 compositions from inside 35 traditional elite homes of the second city of the Raj. One of the photographs portrays etchings on glass panes of Shyampukur's Mitter Mansion. The interiors inspired Satyajit Ray and his art director Bansi Chandragrpta for props of films like ‘Charulata’. “These rare images take us into the interiors of a vanishing society and provide an insight into the cultural collage found in the palaces. Many of the houses have never been showcased in this manner. These are not merely images of buildings that have been mute witnesses to centuries of eventful history but a visual journey into a glorious and significant chapter of Calcutta’s and India’s past,” said EZCC director Gouri Basu, who commissioned the project and has penned the anecdotal text to complement the document comprising colour and monochrome photographs. Moore, who specializes on architecture and spaces, also felt that in the midst of unrelenting change and decay, the work is poised to present a rare glimpse of a world within Kolkata. “Mitra’s photographs are highly evocative and capture the poetry and mystery of the places he visited,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lensman-chronicles-rich-cultural-history-of-the-city-of-palaces/articleshow/88244423.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Pune||Squalor makes way for garden on Bhairoba Nullah right bank section||Pune: A dump yard that was an eyesore for over a decade is turning into a small and attractive garden along the Bhairoba Nullah in Wanowrie. For years, residents and passers-by have been complaining about the recurring waste dumping on this plot along the banks of the nullah, seeking a more sustainable solution to discourage litterers. A few months ago, they took matters into their own hands and decided to beautify the open ground. Rajesh Mishra, chairman of Ganga Satellite Housing Society, said, “Civic authorities often cleaned up the area but commercial ventures like poultry shops, restaurants and others would dump their garbage again. People would come by at night and leave their garbage or throw it on the banks of the nullah from moving vehicles. Security guards from our society were put on duty to keep an eye out for such litterers, but we could not stop them. The only way to make them stop dumping waste here was to make it so beautiful that they felt ashamed to litter it.” Mishra, who works for Vulkan Technologies Pvt Ltd, took it up as his company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) project and used the funds for the beautification of the area along with help from other residents of the housing society. “We appointed Green Thumb, an NGO, for the initial plantation work. The day-to-day maintenance and supervision is done by a team of residents. All expenses were paid through the CSR funds. The costliest work was to put in a pipeline for the water supply for the plantation,” Mishra said. Another resident of the society said, “The open space is public property and anyone can walk or sit on the benches. We took up the initiative because the mounds of waste was a problem for us living close by. Not only was this space an eye sore, it could also be hazardous to health.” Yet another resident said it is difficult to change the mindset and habits of everyone, but their work was a good start. “We still see passers-by throwing garbage in this area, but we have gardeners and security exclusively for the open space, and the housekeeping staff of the housing society also helps in cleaning up the area daily,”another resident said. “Though littering has not stopped completely, it has reduced after the beautification of the area,” the resident added. Unmindful people are now piling up garbage on the other side of the nullah that comes under the Cantonment board. Local corporator Kalindi Pund, who helped with the cleaning up of the area and provided two benches, said, “After some delay, we finally got the permission from Southern Command to carry out the beautification work in the open space, which has turned out very well.” “ But now, we have to tackle the same waste dumping problem which has increased on the other side of the bridge,” the corporator added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/squalor-makes-way-for-garden-on-bhairoba-nullah-right-bank-section/articleshow/88245021.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Accomplice in Pocso case held||Thiruvananthapuram: Thiruvallom police here on Saturday arrested a 24-year-old man who was wanted in connection with a case related to abduction and sexual abuse of a minor girl. The police identified the accused as Shine Mon of Ozhuvuthadam in Idukki district. He is arraigned as the second accused in the case. The charge against him is that he aided the first accused in the case to abduct the girl and sexually exploit her. The police said the 17-year-old girl was abducted on November 12 by the prime accused Prakash. He allegedly took her to various places and sexually abused the girl. A week ago, the police traced Pakash and arrested him following the investigation for the missing girl.  During the interrogation, he told the police that it was Shine Mon, who provided him with a vehicle to abduct the girl. He too had traveled with them and used his identity card to rent lodge rooms. Shine Mon was arrested by a team led by Thiruvallam station house officer inspector Suresh B Nair. Man held for attacking girl: Kadakkavoor police on Saturday arrested a man on charges of attacking a young woman who was returning home from college. The police identified the accused as Ananthu, 25, of Vellipattumoola near Melkadakkavoor. The police said that unrequited love is suspected to be the reason behind the attack as the woman told the police that she had recently rejected his proposal of love. The alleged crime happened on Friday evening when the complainant was walking home. On the way, the accused started following her on his motorcycle. When she reached a secluded spot on the road near Manglavila Progressive Public Library near Vakkom,, the accused intercepted her and attacked her. He also snatched her gold ornaments before fleeing. The accused was arrested by a team led by Kadakkavoor sub inspector Deepu and additional sub inspectors Rajeev and Sreekumar. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.

---||Pune||Government interference stifles progress of industry, says Goyal||Pune: Government interference has always “stifled” industry progress, said Union minister for commerce and industry Piyush Goyal on Sunday. “The biggest and single most reason behind the success of the IT (Information Technology) sector in India is the less involvement of the government. Whenever the government got involved, we have seen nationalisation of so many businesses and sectors in the ’60s and the ’70s. The growth of such sectors is very limited,” said Goyal. He was addressing entrepreneurs and start-up owners at the Science and Technology Park of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). Goyal said giving freedom to entrepreneurs to work freely will be the key to their success. “If you give freedom to entrepreneurs, with the least amount of government interference or involvement, they will be able to come up with cost-effective and affordable solutions, improve their designs and quality,” Goyal said.  He added that the Startup India mission was an apt step taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 to recognize the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the youth of the country. Goyal said, “Today, we have a start-up ecosystem across the length and breadth of India. As many as 45,000 start-ups have been registered in India. It is the third largest ecosystem in the world. These start-ups are not only based out of the Metros but are also from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Some of them are from rural areas as well.” Manisha Verma, the state’s principal secretary, skill development, employment, and entrepreneurship department, listed the issues that are being faced by the start-ups in Maharashtra. “If you want to promote products of the start-ups, the reformation in the procurement policy is the need of the hour. On the lines of Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) other sectors such as agriculture should also see similar approaches,” Verma added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/government-interference-stifles-progress-of-industry-says-goyal/articleshow/88245045.cms||Sandip Dighe

State health officials said it was a case of reinfection since the man had recovered from Covid in April this year.  The patient had returned to Nagpur last Sunday via Delhi from Burkina Faso, a west African country that is not on the list of ‘at-risk’ destinations. He has mild symptoms and is currently hospitalised at AIIMS Nagpur. Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said 30 of his close contacts have been traced. All of them have tested negative. The health officials added that the man has not received any vaccine yet.  This is the first Omicron case to be detected in Nagpur. The other cases detected are from Pimpri Chinchwad (10), Mumbai (5) and one each in Kalyan-Dombivli and Pune. Of the 18 cases, nine have been discharged after a negative RT PCR test, said Dr Awate.  A resident of Dighori, the man said he was unvaccinated since he had tested Covid positive on April 11 this year and left the country on June 26, before he could become eligible for the vaccine. The government recommends a gap of 90 days for vaccination after Covid infection. He had mild Covid symptoms even then and didn’t need hospitalisation. He travelled abroad on the basis of an RTPCR negative report. Speaking to TOI on a video call, the man said, “This is just to show how fine I am, I can do fifty push ups right away,” he said. In Mumbai, no new cases were detected. Of the five positive cases, three have been discharged, said Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/40-yr-old-from-burkina-faso-is-nagpurs-first-patient/articleshow/88245659.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

During the questioning, Shilpa told police that since 2018 she has been organizing kitty parties at her villa and started accepting money from interested investors, who attended those parties for handsome interest. “Shilpa claimed to have taken money from about 12 to 13 people, amounting to about Rs 20 crore,” an investigator said. Offering 10 to 12% monthly interest on the principal to investors, the socialite in turn lent the amount to others, who promised to offer her slightly more interest. “Shilpa claims that those who took money from her, failed to repay in time and in turn she could not pay the interest to people who lent her. For majority of the transactions, there were no written agreements. some have post-dated cheques issued by her,” the investigator said. Police would produce her before court on Monday morning.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shilpa-did-not-cheat-only-delayed-payments/articleshow/88245034.cms||---

The situation is so bad that there are no funds to restore the sprawling buildings on the 300-acre campus. The institution on Sunday made a public announcement on the immediate need for funds at its first-ever carnival organised at Birkmyre Hostel, owned by the Homes on Middleton Row. The carnival, which saw a large turnout of Anglo-Indian families, was a huge success and the money collected was added by the Homes administration to the funds that the alumni have put together to repair the classrooms first. “There are about 40 classrooms and the alumni has collected funds to start work on nine of them. All the buildings have become structurally weak. We have to launch a restoration project to save the Homes,” said president Shane Calvert. Baked condiments from the bakery and dairy of the Homes were sold in the carnival. Many Anglo-Indian families put up stalls where winter delicacies were sold. “Birkmyre Hostel is a transit point for the students of the Homes and since it has a sprawling campus, we decided to organise the carnival here,” said Denise Smith, spokesperson for the 96-year-old hostel. The evening reached a high point with popular singers Rodney Rodrigues, Christopher Lobo and Craig Francis taking to the stage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/carnival-to-raise-funds-for-dr-grahams-homes-repairs/articleshow/88244448.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Soon after the incident, a CCTV footage purportedly depicting the MLA slapping the man went viral on social media. Ghulam Ghouse Jeelani, the accuser, lodged a complaint with the Hussaini Alam police against the legislator and a case was registered under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) against the MLA. Jeelani alleged that when he was sitting outside his house at the Charminar bus stand on Saturday night, the MLA came to him with his personal security officer and slapped him 10 to 15 times. The complainant said that he resides near the legislator’s house and as he did not greet him, the MLA lost his cool and slapped him. In his complaint, the victim alleged that the MLA even threatened to kill him if he does not greet him and said that he has the power to do anything as he has been an MLA for the last 25 years. Jeelani also alleged that he has had a dispute with the legislator in the past too and has been receiving threats from the MLA. “We have received a complaint against the MLA and the matter is under investigation,” said G Naresh Kumar, inspector, Hussaini Alam police station. A few months ago there was a verbal spat over a mobile phone between the legislator’s son and Ghouse Jeelani’s brother Mannan. Later, the issue was settled amicably. However, the AIMIM MLA denied any such incident and refused to elaborate on the issue when quizzed by reporters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/aimim-mla-slaps-man-for-not-greeting-him-case-registered/articleshow/88245057.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ATS gets voice identification software||Mumbai: For the next-level identification of terror suspects’ activities, the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is setting up a voice data bank of terror suspects in the state. For a stronger prevention and detection strategy, the ATS has now procured software for voice identification from a premier laboratory of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Vineet Agarwal, additional director-general of police and ATS chief, said: “We have procured a software, Language Independent Speaker Identification System (LISIS), from the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR). We are in the process of setting up a voice data bank. By using this, we can identify a suspect even if he changes his phone number or WhatsApp number. A person can be identified on the basis of his voice.” So far the ATS has mostly been relying upon fingerprints, phone calls records, messages and human intelligence during probes in various cases. The agency is now going one step ahead with setting up a voice data bank of suspects. The agency feels it will help it identify a suspect’s voice even if he is involved in other crimes as well. It has been found in the past that a suspect changes phone numbers making it difficult to track him. The process to collect voice samples of arrested accused has begun in ATS. The software is generally used to operate robots, which identifies a person’s voice while following instructions. In another development, the ATS stated that anyone associated with Dr Zakir Naik’s banned outfit Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) will be charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). This declaration came after the Centre extended its ban on the IRF for five more years in November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ats-gets-voice-identification-software/articleshow/88245678.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Blaming Transco authorities for completely failing to check the menace, despite repeated complaints, residents say even fences have not been erected around transformers. Citing an example, a shopkeeper Kamla, at Marthandanagar, said a transformer installed at the ground level in their locality had no fencing. “This is a huge risk especially when children and others move around.” Also stating that kids were the most vulnerable, Subhas Kumar, another resident at Marthandanagar told TOI, “Many times, I see children coming and going along transformers, which is dangerous.” Speaking about the double standards, S Sruti, a local, complained, “While safety measures are put in place at commercial complexes, for us there is nothing.”  Besides open transformers, dangling wires are another headache for locals of Marthandanagar, Premnagar, Subhas Chandra Bose Nagar and Adityanagar. They said the issue should be immediately addressed by Transco authorities. Residents have sought chief minister K Chandrasekar Rao and MAUD minister K T Rama Rao’s intervention. Local electricity officials told residents that they would look into the matter. “We will see what we can do address these issues,” a Transco official said. In a complete waste of electricity, residents also say that street lights are on during the day as well. This at a time when consumers’ power is cut even with a month’s delay in payment of bill. One consumer Abdul Gaffar from Adityanagar told TOI that they were forced to clear the bill at night to restore power supply after it was cut for not paying a month’s dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dangling-wires-unfenced-transformers-plague-new-hafeezpet/articleshow/88245063.cms||Omar bin Taher
---||Hyderabad||3 youths die as car rams into stationary truck||HYDERABAD: Three persons were killed and another sustained injuries in a suspected case of drunken driving after their car crashed into a parked truck at Dundigal on Sunday morning. The victims were identified as G Venkata Sai Charan, P Ganesh, N Sanjay, all three 25-year-olds from Nizampet, Bachupally. Their friend, S Ashok, 26, from Shapur, suffered injuries. All the victims were natives of Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh and they had been searching for jobs while staying in Hyderabad. The accident occurred around 2.30am near Coca-Cola factory in Bowrampet when the victims were travelling from Pragati Nagar to Bowrampet in Charan’s car, Dundigal police said. At 2.50 am, Dundigal police received an alert from ‘Dial 100’ about the accident. When the patrolling team reached the spot, they noticed that three persons — Charan, who was driving the car, Ganesh, who was in the front passenger seat, and Sanjay, who was in the rear seat — died on the spot when the car rammed into the rear portion of a trailer truck parked on the road side. Ashok, who was sitting in the rear seat, was alive and police shifted him to a nearby hospital in an ambulance. “There was space for two more trucks to pass through, but we don’t know why Charan was driving on the extreme left portion of the road,” Dundigal inspector P Ramana Reddy said. The driver of the truck, Nimbulal, who parked the vehicle on the road side, came to the Coca-Cola factory to pickup load and he did not turn on the indicators. “The truck driver did not turn on the indicators. We are suspecting that Charan was under the influence of alcohol. Viscera samples will be preserved for blood alcohol concentration analysis. The speedometer was stuck at 80 kmph,” the inspector said. During the preliminary investigation, police found out that the victims had a party with their friends Venu, Sai and Durga at Pragati Nagar prior to the accident and a case was registered under Section 304 (ii) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3-youths-die-as-car-rams-into-stationary-truck/articleshow/88245059.cms||---

Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur made the announcement while presiding over the 18th meeting of the Himachal Pradesh Gaddi Kalyan Board in Dharamshala on Sunday. The state police, said Thakur, had issued Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on the subject, according to which responsibility of the police administration had been fixed to ensure safety of community members’ lives and property. In a bid to get members of the Gaddi community to participate in the Gaddi Welfare Board, the government had nominated members of the community from across the state, said the CM. He added, “I myself belong to the rural environment and understand the problems of sheep farmers very well. I have had a special attachment and relationship with the Gaddi community and have received the same love and respect from this community as well.” He said that compensation should promptly be provided to Gaddis on loss of their sheep or goats due to natural disaster or the pandemic. Thakur directed officers concerned to ensure timely vaccination of the sheep and goats of Gaddis to protect their flock from diseases. He also asked them to examine issues raised in the meeting about opening and upgrade of health and educational institutions in tribal and remote areas. He asked the department concerned to ensure that no one transferred the grazing permit issued to them to another as this would be taken seriously. Box: CM reaches out to Gujjars Presiding over the 21st meeting of the Gujjar Kalyan Board in Dharamshala, chief minster Jai Ram Thakur said that the state government was committed to the welfare and development of the Gujjar community and had launched several schemes for the purpose.

---||Ahmedabad||Electric vehicles ecosystem takes shapes in Gujarat||Even though electric vehicles, particularly two-wheelers, have been in the market for at least a decade, the uptakes had not been significant despite the subsidies rolled out by state and central governments. However, with growing awareness, the emergence of technologically sound and efficient vehicles, and the creation of charging infrastructure, the demand for electric vehicles has grown substantially in Gujarat. Riding on increased demand, the state is gradually building a sound ecosystem for manufacturing electric vehicles (EVs). Gujarat is already home to automobile giants such as Tata Motors, Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India Limited, Hero Two-wheelers, and Suzuki Motor Corporation. Moreover, the demand for EVs is rising across the country as well. New players have entered the field, the established ones are doing robust business, a policy push from the state and central governments is offering sizable subsidies, and startups are driving innovations in EV manufacturing. These factors have led to the setting up of a wholesome EV ecosystem in Gujarat. Sales double in a year Over the past one year, the sales of electric vehicles have shown nearly a tenfold growth within Gujarat. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), against about 149 electric vehicles — two-wheelers and four-wheelers — sold in the state in November 2020, about 1,755 vehicles were retailed in the same month this year. The number represents a 1,007% growth. Pranav Shah, the FADA-Gujarat chairman, said: "The demand is bullish and with the latest steep rise in fuel prices, the shift towards EVs is definitely evident." Shah added: "Subsidies extended by state and central governments under the Gujarat EV Policy and the FAME-II programme have indeed given the needed boost to EV sales." He went on to say: "As customers have begun realizing the reasonable cost of operation of an EV, the gradual shift is taking place." Yatin Gupte, the chairman and managing director of Wardwizard Innovations and Mobility Ltd, said: "The past six months have seen a sudden spurt in demand, not only at the consumer level but also at the dealership level." Gupte added: "In November, we sold 3,300 units and this month we are eying sales of 6,000 units. Our planned production for January is 8,000 to 10,000 units and about 10,000 for March." Gupte went on to say: "We are fully booked till March 2022." Shah said that as established two-wheeler makers launch their EV products, the demand will further increase. Lack of infrastructure a challenge: Dealers Automobile dealers suggested that even though the demand is good, the lack of charging infrastructure is still a challenge. "The unavailability of charging infrastructure deters some," said Pranav Shah, the FADA-Gujarat chairman. "This is especially true for four-wheelers because people prefer travelling over longer distances in cars." Shah added: "Without charging stations readily available on highways, people are unsure about investing in an EV." Even though public charging stations are yet to be operationalized across most major cities of Gujarat, a few home-grown startups are giving the ready infrastructure a push. For instance, Vadodara-based Tecso ChargeZone has already installed a charging network of about 1,000 points across 19 Indian cities. "The limited number of charging stations is a challenge currently. But with the demand spiking for EVs, the demand for infrastructure is increasing and so is the utilization of existing facilities," said Kartikey Hariyani, CEO of the startup. "We have seen customers at charging stations from the very first day of installation along the NH-8 between Ahmedabad and Mumbai." Hariyani added: "Going forward, we plan to add 1,500 more charging stations over the coming five months." Subsidy push drives demand In July 2021, the Government of Gujarat announced an EV policy. The policy has fuelled optimism not just in dealers but in manufacturers too. The Gujarat Electric Vehicle Policy 2021 provides a subsidy of up to Rs 20,000 for EVs in the two-wheeler category, Rs 50,000 for three-wheelers, and up to Rs 1.5 lakh for cars. Over and above this, the central government has extended subsidies under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME)-II. The amount of subsidy is based on the battery capacity. According to dealers, this spurs the demand. "Subsidy is one of the biggest factors that has made electric vehicles much more affordable," said the branch head of an electric two-wheeler maker in Ahmedabad. New players ride into 2-wheeler spacehe renewed thrust on electric mobility has attracted new players in the recent years. Companies such as Wardwizard Innovations, Odysse Electric Vehicles Pvt Ltd, Matter, and Svitch Energy Private Limited have entered the electric two-wheeler space over the past five years. In January this year, the Vadodara-headquartered Wardwizard Innovations inaugurated a bigger two-wheeler manufacturing facility with the capacity of 2.5 lakh units per shift per annum. The BSE-listed company, which has had a presence in the EV segment since 2016, is further mulling the establishment of two more plants — one in south and the other in north or east of India. Odysse Electric commissioned a plant at Changodar in Ahmedabad in 2020 with 24,000 units per annum capacity. An electric vehicles and electric technology startup, Matter, is also setting up a manufacturing facility near Ahmedabad with an annual capacity of 2 lakh units. Founded by Mohal Lalbhai, a scion of the Lalbhai family, the startup has also readied a plant for battery manufacturing, which is expected to start functioning from January 2022. Startups bring innovationsA number of startups have flourished in the EV segment across Gujarat and industry experts said that these innovators are among the driving forces for developing home-grown technology and electronics for EVs. "Instead of focusing on product development, many startups are focusing on innovations," said Anupam Jalote, CEO, iCreate. "This is broadly seen in four segments: energy storage, energy recovery, energy intelligence systems, and powertrain. This is giving a major boost to the ecosystem here." Jalote added: "These startups will eventually pave the way for original equipment manufacturers to use India-made hardware and technology and reduce import dependence. "Over the next 3 years, startups in Gujarat will cater to global EV and component makers."

---||Goa||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee in Goa, Churchill Alemao to rejoin TMC in Goa today||PANAJI: Former chief minister and NCP’s lone legislator Churchill Alemao is likely to resign as MLA on Monday and join Trinamool Congress (TMC). Alemao, a two-time member of Parliament, will likely contest the 2022 assembly election on the TMC ticket. Asked if he would resign as MLA or merge the NCP’s legislature wing, he said, “I will take a decision on Monday”. This isn’t Alemao’s first entry into TMC. Ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election, he had joined the party and contested on its ticket. West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Benerjee, who arrived in Goa on Sunday, is likely to attend Alemao’s induction into her party fold. The Benaulim MLA has organised a public meeting in its constituency at 2.30pm on Monday. Alemao had recently announced that he would take a decision whether to continue with NCP or join TMC. Alemao, along with his daughter Valanka, met Benerjee to discuss his joining. Alemao will be the second MLA to join TMC after Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, who is now a Rajya Sabha MP. A political observer said that Alemao may not influence voters except in Benaulim and Navelim. “Churchill Alemao is seen negatively in Salcete, except a little pocket in Navelim and (has) some hold in Benaulim,” said Cleofato Almeida Coutinho. “I would say his presence is a liability in other places. In MGP-dominated areas, he’s a complete liability.” Further explaining Alemao’s prospects, he said, “With Luizinho, he becomes a force in Navelim. With or without TMC, he would have been there (influential) in these two places. For Saxttikars, it is good as there is at least clarity about him. Otherwise, his credibility is at an all-time low”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mamata-in-goa-churchill-to-rejoin-tmc-today/articleshow/88245065.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Kochi||NGT asks PCB to file report on status of waste management in Ernakulam||KOCHI: The national green tribunal (NGT), while hearing a batch of petitions regarding the Brahmapuram waste treatment plant, has asked the Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB) to ascertain the present status of the implementation of solid waste management rules in Ernakulam and to give an overview of how it is being implemented in other local bodies. Issuing orders to various departments, NGT has asked KSPCB to inquire into the nature of observations made by the state-level monitoring committee in its report to the green court and come up with a proper action taken report against defaulters. The chief secretary, environment secretary, district collector and all the local bodies in the district, including Kochi corporation, have been directed to file further progress reports regarding the implementation and its success on or before January 24, 2022. The green court has come down heavily on the chief secretary’s action plan report submitted before it, stating that it was not satisfactory. No proper scrutiny was made by him or the concerned principal secretary. It has also asked for a realistic report considering that the implementation of solid waste management is poor. The state chief secretary had submitted that the state and Kochi corporation have made a concerted effort to resolve the issue of pollution by remediating the legacy waste dumped at Brahmapuram and to establish a waste-to-energy project. The report said that directives were sent to the district collector and inspector general of police Kochi seeking their intervention to stop illegal dumping of faecal sludge into the water bodies near Brahmapuram. It was decided that a joint taskforce of the corporation, police, KSPCB and health department should conduct inspections and catch vehicles illegally transporting waste and dumping septage waste at Brahmapuram, the report said. The court said that authorities have not started the work of biomining at Brahmapuram. It is still in the stage of finalizing the tender and handing over the area to people who are said to be the successful bidder. No significant improvement has taken place in reducing the legacy waste lying in the dumpyard. Further, the leachate treatment plant is not functioning properly, and they are operating the waste management facility without proper authorization for a long time. If local bodies are themselves violating the rules and carrying out activities, how can the government impose penalties on poor people who are not able to comply with the same?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ngt-asks-pcb-to-file-report-on-status-of-waste-mgmt-in-ekm/articleshow/88244469.cms||---

Most have been complaining of mosquitoes buzzing and stinging everywhere — from tarmacs to inside the terminal, to the airport buses and even inside the aircraft. “I generally love wearing light and comfortable clothes during air travel. I mostly wear loose fitting trousers with slippers. But its difficult to wear slippers any more because of mosquitoes stinging in the security area. I had to shift to uncomfortable ankle high boots,” said Sutirtha Basu, who shuttles between Kolkata and Delhi for work. Several frustrated fliers have also taken on social media to spew their anger. One such flyer with Twitter handle Bindasfauji recently tweeted: “Saari raat Machhar meri maarte rahe, aur jab possible hua tab hum machhar maarte rahe . . #kolkata airport! Dear @DGCAIndia please #SwachhBharat ka thoda sa palan aap bhi kar lo, aur machharon ko panapne se rokein, Dawai ka chidkao karein! (The mosquitoes bit me all night. Appealing to Kolkata airport and DGCA to deploy Swachh Bharat protocols and get rid of mosquitoes from the airport)” Another international flyer Dinesh Agarwal, who was waiting for his RT-PCR report at the airport on December 3 also wrote: “People have to wait for almost 6 hours with mosquitoes at night for their results after a journey. It’s a recipe for disaster. Request for your kind intervention.” Being in close proximity with dengue-prone areas like Baguiati, Keshtopur and the presence of long grass and wet areas inside the airport premises, make the terminal a vulnerable place when it comes to mosquito menace. Airport officials said they are trying all means — from fogging to repeated disinfection, pruning of long grass to draining out water from artificial water bodies inside and outside the terminal — but are still unable to control the crisis. “In winter, this area gets infested with mosquitoes. But we are trying our level best to get rid of them from the terminal. We have been able to bring down the numbers but more sustained preventive measures need to be continued,” said C Pattabhi, the airport director.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-airport-faces-mosquito-menace-irate-flyers-staff-lodge-complaints/articleshow/88244480.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||Candidates raise campaign decibel on last Sunday before civic elections||Kolkata: The city witnessed a high-octane campaign on the last Sunday before the ensuing civic election on December 19 as candidates across parties organized rallies, roadshows and public meetings with senior leaders, celebrities and political heavyweights by their side. Trinamool’s ward 13 candidate and prominent lawyer Anindya Routh had former mayor and minister Firhad Hakim, who shuttled between north and south Kolkata on Sunday rallying for multiple candidates after finishing his own Sunday campaign early in the morning, by his side. “We are asking people to vote for us so that we can continue this wave of development,” said Hakim, who is contesting from ward 82. Another cabinet minister Partha Chatterjee also sought votes for party candidates at pockets in Behala and Tollygunge. Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya was also on the road seeking votes for her son Sourav Basu, who is contesting the polls from ward 86 in the Gariahat-Hindusthan Park area. “I am appealing everyone to shower their blessings on my son,” Bhattacharya said. BJP’s senior leaders — state president Sukanta Majumdar, leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari and national president Dilip Ghosh — also campaigned for multiple candidates. Adhikari started the day offering prayer at a Posta Hanuman temple before campaigning for Meena Devi Purohit in the area. He also rallied alongside candidates of ward 84 and 87. “Don’t call it a last Sunday. Did we get any scope for campaigns before the civic polls? The State Election Commission is just following the schedule laid down by Nabanna. Their party men are not allowing us to hold campaigns,” Adhikari said. At Park Street-Camac street area, BJP leaders campaigned at the high-rises on Sunday. At ward 47, Majumdar campaigned for candidate Chitra Pal while Ghosh was found campaigning for ward 123 candidate Sarmistha Bhattacharya. Senior Left leaders Sujan Chakraborty and Bikash Bhattacharya were also in action in the Jadavpur area campaigning for candidates of ward 99 (Sikha Mukherjee) and ward 96 (Dipali Goswami). “We have never left a battlefield without a fight. Hence, no matter what the situation is, we will give our best,” said Chakraborty. Upping the celebrity quotient were director Raj Chakraborty and actor Sayoni Ghosh for Trinamool, actor Hiran and ex-cricketer Ashok Dinda for BJP and actor Badshah Moitra for the Left. While Chakraborty campaigned for ward 108 candidate Susanta Ghosh, Sayoni travelled the bylanes of Patuli in a hoodless jeep with ward 101 candidate Bappaditya Dasgupta. Hiran went for a door-to-door campaign alongside BJP’s ward 129 candidate Nabanita Bhattacharya while Dinda visited multiple slums under ward 116 in Behala with BJP candidate Swapna Banerjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/candidates-raise-campaign-decibel-on-last-sunday-before-civic-elections/articleshow/88244476.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Chandigarh||Blaze renders 30 families, cattle roofless in roadless Kullu village||Manali: Fire ravaged the remote Majhan village of Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu district on Saturday and reduced its 27 houses, 26 cowsheds, and two temples to ashes, rending more than 100 families homeless in extreme cold weather. The villager could not even save their clothes, rations and children’s books and uniform. They could only save the cattle. The earliest report suggested that 10 houses were gutted. But as it took the firemen more than three hours to reach the village after a steep hike, the blaze had consumed all 27 houses by late night. On Sunday, the officials counted 30 families as left with no shelter. The 26 cowsheds and two temples of Nag Devta were also gone. Kullu deputy commissioner Ashutosh Garg hiked to the village with a team on Sunday and met the affected families. The families shared with the DC how the village had limited resources and how unavailability of road and mobile connectivity had delayed the relief work. The DC said: “Each family has received an immediate relief of Rs 5,000, besides blankets, tarpaulin, rations, and utensil. They families will receive Rs 20,000 each from the Red Cross as well. The education department has orders to issue books and uniform to the village children. As directed by the chief minister, those affected will be recommended for new houses under the Mukhyamantri Awas Yojana.” The DC directed his team to speed up the relief work and look into the requirements of the villagers. Road and mobile network could have saved Majhan. None of the Gadaparli panchayat villages is connected by road, while mobile communation service is rare, hence the villagers couldn’t alert the fire and police departments in time time. For want of a road, the fire tenders couldn’t enter the village. The team had no input about the size of that blaze and the damage it had caused until the subdivional magistrate got there with his revenue department team, which had to walk downhill to find a mobile-phone signal. Majhan is short of water, so there was nothing to fight the fire. The villagers requested the DC to provide them with basic fire-prevention infrastructure. Gadaparli panchayat chief Yamuna Devi said: “The temples of Jada and Rai Nags were dismantled for fire safety, yet those were destroyed.” She claimed that: “If we had road and water, we could have saved our homes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/blaze-renders-30-families-cattle-roofless-in-roadless-kullu-village/articleshow/88245076.cms||Suresh Sharma

The junior doctors resumed duty after cops arrested six of the assaulters and the authorities promised better protection of doctors in a month. Around 10pm on Saturday, a 6-month pregnant lady from Karaya reached the hospital complaining of stomach pain. Doctors found that the woman’s child had already died inside the womb. But with a number of other patients at the ward, they allegedly asked the lady to wait and went on to attend other patients. This irked the relatives of the patient and they attacked the doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/doctors-go-on-9-hr-strike-after-assault/articleshow/88244481.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Students build rockets, telescopes, rainwater harvesters at science fest||PANAJI: Even as schools and their laboratories have been closed and inaccessible for much of the past two years owing to the pandemic, thousands of students got a chance to engage in educational experimentation by building rockets, telescopes and even harvesting rainwater. Over a course of three days at the India international science festival (IISF), students dabbled in physics, mathematics, and even aerospace engineering. “Mass assembly of such gadgets or building model replicas is something we have never experienced before,” said Class VII student Kanishka Ninawe. “Even though it is something that could be done from home by watching a YouTube video, simply seeing everyone working simultaneously was exciting, instead.” “ I could observe others around me and follow the step-by-step process better.” Students of Class XI from 11 different schools of Goa assembled a Gaganyan rocket model kit on Saturday. This was then tested for launch at the Panjim gymkhana grounds. In addition, students of Classes VII and VIII from Goa and from 125 cities across India, who joined the session virtually, built a rainwater harvesting and water purification model on Sunday. “Water is becoming a scarce resource for all of us, and conservation, reuse and recycling of water is very important,” said Class VIII student Aryan Naik. “The groundwater levels are very low, therefore harvesting rainwater, purifying and charging it becomes very important. This can be used for gardening, toilet flushes and other domestic purposes.” Another student, Shraddha Naik, was hopeful that the activities she engaged in at the festival could be replicated or adopted in their academics. “It would be great if our schools could have practical activities such as these that are educational as well as enjoyable,” she said. On Monday, another batch of 1,000 students will build a replica of the giant radio telescope dish antenna. The semi-workable model will comprise a dish made of 30 raw materials that are laser cut for assembly. “The purpose of IISF is to take science to the community and society. The youngsters have therefore demonstrated that even rocket science is not a big challenge for us as despite the complex design, complex raw material and highly-technical skills, they were able to learn it in the shortest possible time,” said Prashant Kodgire, faculty at IIT Indore and coordinator for the activities at IISF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/students-build-rockets-telescopes-rainwater-harvesters-at-science-fest/articleshow/88245075.cms||Nida Sayed

Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth flagged off the train around 7 am. Bound for the Katra railway station in Jammu and Kashmir, the train had 531 passengers on board. Earlier, the Railways had announced to launch the Dakshin Bharat Yatra train in September, but due to the fresh Covid scare, it had to be cancelled. After the flagging-off ceremony, Seth said: “It is a commendable decision on part of the Railways. Many pilgrims could not visit the sites owing to financial crunch. The fare of this particular train is reasonable and, hence, it will cater to many pilgrims.” For passengers travelling in the sleeper-class coaches, the round-trip fare will be Rs 8,505, including accommodation and food, while it is Rs 14,175 for the AC coach passengers. IRCTC officials said the train, which is due to arrive at the Katra station on Tuesday morning, has five coaches each for the sleeper and AC class. “One of the AC coaches has been kept vacant to be used as an isolation ward if a passenger shows symptoms of Covid-19,” said Jyoti Kumari, area manager of the IRCTC’s Ranchi zone. The train will pass through Bokaro, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Madhupur, Jasidih, Jhajha, Kiul, Mokama, Bakhtiyarpur, Patna, Ara and Buxar. In the return leg, the train will reach Haridwar on December 17, Mathura the next day before arriving at Ranchi on December 20. The first pilgrimage special train, bound for the South India temples in September this year, had 450 bookings, but it was cancelled after Covid-19 cases started to rise in the destination states. “For the Vaishno Devi tour, there were 630 travellers. However, as Omicron cases were reported in the country, over 100 passengers withdrew from the trip in the past five days,” another IRCTC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/states-1st-pilgrimage-train-to-katra-chugs-off/articleshow/88244311.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand to table anti-lynching bill||RANCHI: The Jharkhand government will table an anti-lynching bill in the state assembly’s upcoming winter session to prevent mob lynching incidents in the state by imposing severe penal provisions against those found guilty. The bill titled Jharkhand (Prevention of Violence and Mob Lynching) Bill of 2021, provisions for life imprisonment and a penalty of Rs 25 lakh for those who are found guilty of lynching and its abetment. Talking about the bill, JMM central general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “In our manifesto for the 2019 assembly polls, we had promised to bring about strict laws to prevent mob lynching in the state. Through this bill, we intend to fulfil our promise.” He said the JMM-led coalition government comprising Congress and RJD, which will complete two years in office on December 29, is hopeful of the bill’s passage in the winter session, which will be conducted between December 16 and December 22. Once passed, it will become the third state after Rajasthan and West Bengal in framing the anti-lynching laws. Both the state had passed the laws in 2019. Notably, Jharkhand hit the national headlines with the mob-lynching incidents of Alimuddin Ansari (40) in Ramgarh in June 2017 and Tabrez Ansari (24) in Kharsawan in June 2019. Talking to TOI, a senior police officer said, “Unlike other states, the accountability of preventing lynching will be fixed right at the local police station level. The officer-in-charge of a local police station, will be responsible for preventing the dissemination of objectionable material, hate speeches and prevention of such incidents.” The draft bill proposes that in case of a lynching victim’s death, the guilty will be imprisoned for life and will have to pay a penalty of Rs 25 lakh. The government will also attach all of the movable and immovable assets of those found guilty. In case of minor injuries, the guilty will be imprisoned for three years with a maximum fine of Rs 3 lakh. In case of grievous injuries to the victim, the guilty will be punished with life imprisonment (or 10 years) with a fine of up to Rs 5 lakh. “Those who are proven to be a part of a lynching conspiracy, aiding or attempting to lynch will also be punished in the same manner like he or she has committed a lynching,” the draft bill states. Those who are found guilty of disseminating objectionable material and hate speeches and enforcing a hostile environment that may lead to lynching will also be jailed for three years and will be fined up to Rs 3 lakh. The draft bill also proposes that an IG-ranked IPS officer will be made the nodal officer to monitor and coordinate the prevention of lynching incidents. The officer, who will be appointed by the DGP, will hold meetings with the deputy commissioners and police officers of districts to identify existing hotspots of vigilantism, mob violence and lynching in their respective areas. The medical expenses of a lynching victim will be covered under the state-sponsored compensation scheme, the draft bill adds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jharkhand-to-table-anti-lynching-bill/articleshow/88244282.cms||Dhritiman Ray

---||Ranchi||Homeless spend sleepless nights as officials pass bonfire buck||By: Kusum S Chakravarty RANCHI: What is it like sleeping in the open on a biting winter night in Ranchi? Ask Dhaneshwar Mahto, a homeless rickshawpuller who, after pulling his rickshaw during the day, spends his evenings collecting materials to light a bonfire at Birsa Chowk to survive the cold every night. But despite best efforts, the fire doesn’t last the night which he spends shivering. Usually the administration takes care of the bonfires. Like Mahto, rickshawpullers and the homeless at Argora, Sujata, Albert Ekka, Hinoo and Kantatoli chowks are all waiting for the administration to step in and save them from the cold. The disaster management department has already sanctioned the necessary funds for bonfires but because of administrative lapses, the beneficiaries have been left high and dry. Dhaneshwar Mahto, a rickshaw-puller at Birsa chowk said, “I pull my rickshaw from Birsa chowk to Hatia station everyday. Since I am homeless, I spend the night on the road. Last winter, Nigam officials had made arrangements for bonfires but this year we are still waiting,”he said. Once the disaster management department releases the funds, it is the responsibility of Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) to arrange bonfires in the municipal area while circle officers are entrusted with the job of arranging them in rural areas. RMC officials and the district administration are busy passing the buck. RMC deputy municipal commissioner Rajnish Kumar, said, “The arrangements are done by the district adminisrtration, it is their job.” But mayor Asha Lakra admitted that it was RMC’s responsibility, “and we expect to launch it from Albert Ekka square in a day or two,” she said. Imtiyaaz Khan, a rickshaw-puller at Sujata chowk, complained about the delay and said, “Last year, too, we were not provided any arrangements for the bonfire but we saw piles of wood at other squares.” Lack of coordination among officials seems to be the prime reason for the delay. Assistant collector Rajesh Kumar Barwar, who is responsible for making the arrangements in the non-municipal areas, said funds have been alloted. “The order has been issued to the respective circle officers (CO) for the withdrawal of the allotted money. The process of money withdrawal will commence from Monday and will be wrapped up in two days,” said Barwar. Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC) Chavvi Ranjan, who is responsible for arranging bonfires and night shelters for the homeless, did not answer calls or text messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/homeless-spend-sleepless-nights-as-officials-pass-bonfire-buck/articleshow/88244520.cms||---

While large gatherings, crowds at shopping complexes and malls, no social distancing near food stalls have become a common sight in major cities, face masks have either vanished or started slipping to the neck or dangling from the ear, except among children who are regularly checked by school authorities. The instances in Jharkhand are testimony to the NITI Aayog claim that wearing face masks has dropped by around 60% across the country. Though exact figures for the drop in usage of masks and shelving of Covid appropriate behavior is not available with any government agency here, data from the police department, entrusted with the responsibility of enforcing norms, speak volumes. On Saturday, no one was found violating lockdown norms in 21 districts, except for Jamshedpur, Ramgarh and Bokaro where 75, 55 and 20 people, respectively were caught. The violators were fined Rs 28,500 in Jamshedpur and Rs 57,000 in Ramgarh. No fine was collected in Bokaro though. The police checking drives were carried out at 520 places in the state out of which Ranchi district topped with 102 checkpoints while there was no checking in Khunti at all. No FIRs were lodged anywhere in the state though an amount of Rs 1,54,700 was levied as fine, including Rs 67,200 for not wearing masks. In May this year when the state started observing the Health Safety Week, as many as 1,755 violations were registered on the first day and 911 people were fined Rs 3.71 lakh for not wearing masks. Sources in the police department agreed that Covid appropriate behavior and wearing masks have gone for a toss and so have the enforcement drives. “It is for the betterment of people that they are encouraged to follow Covid appropriate behaviour and we expect them to be cautious after the bad experience of the second wave,” said a police officer requesting anonymity. The opposition has been blaming the government for laxity in enforcing Covid appropriate behaviour and taking the Omicron threat lightly. BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said since chief minister Hemant Soren is busy holding Sarkar Apke Dwar programmes, the entire administration is busy gathering crowds for his events. “How can we expect mask checking drives when the police and civil administration are busy gathering crowds for the chief minister’s programmes?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/visible-laxity-in-cov-control-measures-across-most-cities/articleshow/88244671.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

Rules say there must be compensatory afforestation of 10 times the number of trees cut, forest department officials said. "We should be planting 3.6 lakh saplings as per the rules. The national highways authority of India (NHAI) has already allotted funds for the purchase of the saplings. We are now looking for land outside our jurisdiction. It is important to maintain greenery," said Bijnor divisional forest officer (DFO) Anil Kumar Patel. DFO M Semmaran, who was recently transferred from Bijnor to Kanpur zoo, said: "In Bijnor, around 15,500 trees were felled along both sides of NH 119 (Delhi-Pauri), 16,000 on NH 74 (Haridwar-Nainital), 4,310 on Bijnor-Nagina Road in the past year and a half. Besides, 4,000 more trees are to be cut on NH 119; and the process to get permission for the same is under way." Expressing concern, forest department officials said the natural habitat of birds were destroyed during the NH widening work, and may also have serious health issues and other repercussions for locals. Former DFO Salil Shukla said: "Unfortunately, we are destroying trees on which our survival depends. The loss of so many trees can cause desertification, soil erosion, growing of fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and a host of issues for the local population. Deforestation may pose a serious threat to the existence of several species of birds." Research scholar at Gurukula Kangri University in Haridwar and president of a biodiversity club in Bijnor, Mayank Malik, said, "Birds have different ways of building nests. Rapid deforestation poses a direct challenge to their survival. Reduction in bird habitats may increase the chances of territorial fights among species. Ultimately, if they fail to find a satisfactory environment, their number will gradually dwindle leading to extinction."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-30k-trees-felled-for-nhs-but-no-land-for-afforestation/articleshow/88246140.cms||Harveer Dabas

The cremation of Lt-Col Singh (43), the staff officer of Gen Rawat who was also among the 13 killed in the Mi-17 V5 helicopter crash near Coonoor on December 8, was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh and the three Service chiefs, among others. The minister paid his condolences to Lt-Col Singh's wife Major Agnes P Menezes (retd) and Preet, who also showed quiet dignity and the characteristic military ethos of bearing loss with fortitude, much like Gen Rawat's daughters Kritika and Tarini and Brig Lidder's daughter Aashna had done before her. The bodies of Lt-Col Singh and eight other military personnel killed in the crash were positively identified only on Saturday after DNA testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/12-year-old-daughter-shows-military-ethos-performs-lt-col-singhs-last-rites/articleshow/88246154.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Omicron may be from patient with Covid & cold virus mix||HYDERABAD: A group of Indian researchers based in the US and Canada in a major study found that Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) may have been born from a co-infected Covid-19 patient after the virus changed its genetic template. A Covid-19 patient may have been simultaneously infected by one of the seasonal coronaviruses like HCoV-229E, which is one of the viruses that cause the common cold. The genetic exchanges between the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Covid-19 and a seasonal coronavirus causing common cold may have given birth to Omicron, the only Covid-19 variant discovered so far with more than 50 mutations, the researchers said. To arrive at the hypothesis, the research team from nference, a medical data research body based in the US, studied 5.4 million genomes of 1,523 lineages of Covid-19. It has also found Omicron to be unique in genetic makeup and different from the earlier lineages. "It is plausible that the Omicron insertion could have evolved in a co-infected individual. There is a need to understand the function of the Omicron insertion and whether human host cells are being exploited by the novel coronavirus as an 'evolutionary sandbox' for host-virus and inter-viral genomic interplay," the researchers stated in their report. Researchers call for intense monitoring of mutations  The research team comprised AJ Venkatakrishnan, Venky Soundararajan, Praveen Anand, Rohit Suratekar and Bharathwaj Raghunathan. Michiel JM Niesen and Patrick J Lenehan are also part of the study team. The results of the research were published in the preprint server, OSF Preprints. Stating that substitution and deletion mutations have appeared in previous novel coronavirus lineages, the study noted that insertion mutation (ins214EPE) has not been previously observed in any novel coronavirus lineage other than Omicron. The study highlighted that Omicron's spike protein harbours an insertion mutation ins214EPE that is absent in all other novel coronavirus lineages. "Given the salience of viral genetic recombination and the debated plausibility of host genome integration by novel coronavirus, we considered a variety of host-viral and inter-viral genomic matter exchange scenarios that may have contributed to the adoption of this insertion mutation in the precursor variant of Omicron," they said. The researchers have called for intense monitoring of the changing mutational landscape that could lead to the emergence of new novel coronavirus variants. They also emphasized the need to sequence novel coronavirus genomes from individuals with viral co-infections and in general to develop a "variant warning system" for early detection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-may-be-from-patient-with-covid-cold-virus-mix/articleshow/88246223.cms||Syed Akbar

Track the pollution level in your cityThe next few days are likely to be warmer due to a western disturbance, the met office said, after which temperatures will dip again. The air quality remains 'poor', with marginal improvement: AQI was 254 on Sunday, against 281 on Saturday. While Safdarjung station recorded the lowest minimum temperature, Ayanagar, Jafarpur and Lodhi Road recorded 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4 degrees Celsius respectively. The minimum temperature was 8.3 degrees at Ridge and 8.8 at SPS Mayur Vihar. Temp may rise slightly in next few days due to western disturbanceThe maximum temperature touched 23.9 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal, at Safdarjung. The weather office said the city has been witnessing a gradual fall in temperature. The night temperature was recorded at 8.3 degrees Celsius on Saturday. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, "Due to clear sky, the minimum temperature dipped in the city because of radiational cooling. The minimum temperature dropped from Delhi to Aligarh but other parts of northwest India like Punjab and Haryana saw a rise in temperature." Under the impact of a feeble western disturbance, there might be a marginal rise in temperatures, the weather office said. "The easterly winds may set in for a few hours on December 13-14," an official said. The forecast for December 13-15 shows minimum temperature around 8 degrees Celsius while it may drop to 7 degrees on December 16. The lowest minimum temperature recorded in December 2020 was 3.3 degrees Celsius, in the last week of the month. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said, "For the next two days (December 13-14), winds are likely to be low to moderate. Partially cloudy conditions and moderate mixing layer height (~ 1 km) are likely to keep air quality within 'poor' during noon time or 'lower end of very poor' during night and early morning hours for the next two days. From December 15, air quality is likely to improve due to relatively high wind speeds but within 'poor' or 'lower end of very poor' category."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-records-seasons-lowest-minimum-temperature-at-6-4-degree-celsius/articleshow/88246245.cms||---

Pointing out that many poor people from the tribal community of Fatorda have been deprived of the welfare schemes of the government, Sawant blamed Sardesai for his failure to ensure that benefits reach the deserved. “I don’t know how many schemes have reached the people of Fatorda. There are 13 ST-specific government schemes. We have provided toilets to all houses, tap water to all houses, but in Fatorda, some poor Niz Goemkars are deprived of toilets under the scheme as landlords refuse to give them the NOCs. It is the responsibility of the MLAs to ensure that the schemes reach the needy and the deserved,” he said. Stating that Antyodaya – uplifting the last person of the society – was his government’s objective, Sawant said had it not been for the two years of Covid, he would have reached out to every person of the state. Stating that he has never discriminated on the lines of caste and religion, Sawant accused his rivals of resorting to the caste and religion cards when their armoury is exhausted. He cited the Old Goa illegal structure controversy to drive home his point. Alleging the involvement of a GFP functionary in the case, Sawant accused his rivals of dividing people on religious lines. Sawant appealed to voters to give him “a chance to serve Goa to complete the unfinished tasks for realising my dream of Swayampurna Goa.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/states-forward-march-began-after-vijais-exit/articleshow/88245273.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||GFP alleges Pauskar’s PA to be recruited as technical assistant in Sewerage Corp||Panaji: Allegations of irregularities, corruption and nepotism in the ongoing government recruitment program continue to fly thick and fast. Yet another charge is being made against PWD minister Deepak Pauskar. Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Sunday alleged that vacancies were created in the Public Works Department (PWD) and Sewerage Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa Ltd (SIDCGL) to accommodate Kashish Chandrakant Naik, an aide of Pauskar. GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat said an attempt was made to employ Naik with the PWD as a technical assistant (mining) but after a hue and cry was raised, a similar post was created at SIDCGL. Naik’s name features in the list of candidates who successfully completed the written examination conducted on November 15. “On November 29 we had tweeted that the technical assistant (mining) post in PWD was fixed for the minister’s personal assistant and the plan was then dropped in PWD. Instead of that, now a post is fixed in Sewerage Corporation as the minister’s personal assistant,” said Kamat. GFP’s allegations come just a day after Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate conveyed his dismay that all vacancies at PWD were being filled by charging candidates sums as high as Rs30 lakh. Monserrate also said that jobs at Goa Medical College and in the health department were being predominantly allocated to candidates from Sanquelim and Sattari. Kamat and GFP president Vijai Sardesai said they will approach the high court of Bombay at Goa and the Election Commission of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-alleges-pauskars-pa-to-be-recruited-as-technical-assistant-in-sewerage-corp/articleshow/88245554.cms||---

He said that he is not asking for the Panaji ticket because of the ‘Parrikar name’, but mainly because he has been getting immense support from core BJP workers and supporters and also the general voters of Panaji. “I am getting a lot of support from among core BJP karyakartas and party supporters who have worked for the party for the last 30 years. My fight is for their rights,” Utpal said. He expressed confidence that the central leadership will take cognisance of this and would nominate him for the 2022 polls. Indirectly hitting out at the Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate, Utpal said that he won’t be making false 100-day promises for the sake of votes. “Everyone knows that the current MLA represents a philosophy totally antithetical to what my father stood for. I only promise Panaji people that if they elect me then I will work very hard and give more than 100% and bring to bear whatever knowledge I have gained from my education and my upbringing from my father,” he said He also said that he would come out with a detailed plan for Panaji at the right time. Utpal was denied the Panaji ticket in the 2019 bypolls held after the demise of the former chief minister. Monserrate, who contested on a Congress ticket had won against BJP’s Sidharth Kuncalienker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/utpal-fighting-for-my-fathers-principles-to-be-maintained/articleshow/88245286.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Chidambaram said the scheme, which would be routed through women who are the head of a household, would put a huge burden on Goa’s finances. TMC shot back and questioned why Congress was getting riled up with the Griha Laxmi scheme. TMC said that Goa’s annual budgetary allocation for the Griha Laxmi scheme would be just 6-8% of the state’s total budget and with “good and sensible governance” the scheme could be successfully implemented. Chidambaram taunted TMC saying that their math “deserves the Nobel prize for economics”. “A monthly grant of Rs 5,000 for women across 3.5 lakh households in Goa will cost Rs 175 crore a month. That is Rs 2,100 crore a year. It is a “small” sum for the state of Goa that had an outstanding debt of Rs 23,473 crore as on March 2020,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pc-taunts-tmcs-maths-for-griha-laxmi-scheme/articleshow/88245566.cms||---

While Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik and other party politicians said the people of the country were looking at Pawar to provide alternative leadership in 2024 against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Pawar himself did not speak on the issue.  "Many in this country are still not able to live in dignity and the NCP workers should work towards that. The social situation in the country is changing and the party should lead by the ideals of social reformers like Babasaheb Ambedkar, Shahu Maharaj and Jyotiba Phule. The common man should be able to say that it is the NCP that works to resolve their problems," said Pawar. The birthday celebrations were low-key with a rally at Nehru Science Centre. Initiatives like launch of the party app and a government scheme for handicapped individuals were also accomplished on Sunday. Pawar said the NCP might be small but its workers were committed to take along all the deprived sections of society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-81-pawar-reiterates-focus-on-minorities/articleshow/88246282.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Sending Q papers online helps CBSE avoid truck transport, curb pollution||Nagpur: CBSE’s decision to shift the delivery of the board exam question paper to online mode has made a major, though still unquantified, positive impact on its carbon footprint. The decision to send the question paper for board exams in which around 30 lakh students (X and XII) are enrolled, has kept thousands of transport vehicles off the streets thus reducing pollution across the country. A senior CBSE official said, “The question papers and other exam-related stationery would be ferried to cities and villages using a vast network of thousands of vehicles. Obviously, the air pollution caused due to such vehicles will be very high. But now, we send the question papers in online mode contributing immensely to saving the carbon footprint.” Currently, CBSE is conducting Term-1 board exams for both X and XII. These exams are being held in MCQ format, for which question papers are delivered to schools using the board’s exam management website. Papers come around 90 minutes or so before the exam starts, after which schools start printing it. The CBSE official said that this has another advantage. “The security of the paper is intact right till the end. Earlier, the question paper would be printed in advance because of the need to distribute it. Then storage with custodians (most banks) was another logistical challenge,” said the official. In one swoop, the central board has eliminated the need for all of this. It’s IT team led by Antriksh Johri designed the online paper delivery system and backtested it extensively. A CBSE principal told TOI that first, information was collected on the infrastructure schools have, vis-a-vis high speed printers and photocopiers. “Then there were mock tests held to see how much time the entire process takes and what the hiccups are. So far it has been working flawlessly for everyone,” said the principal. While CBSE is saving a lot of carbon footprint by making transport vehicles redundant, it has also had some impact in the amount of paper that’s used. The need for extra question papers is almost gone now. A principal said, “We know exactly how many students are appearing at our centre and only those numbers are printed. Earlier, the board had to print extra to handle any unforseen event.” A big part of the OMR sheets, used for answering, is also printed by schools and that too to ensures zero wastage. Schools are expected to be reimbursed for the stationery expenses ‘as per policy’. A principal said, “So far no details have come but unofficially we have been told that it will be done.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sending-q-papers-online-helps-cbse-avoid-truck-transport-curb-pollution/articleshow/88244910.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

So, there is no question of any talks with them. We are determined to give Goa a fresh alternative with good candidates and form an honest, corruption free government," AAP Goa desk in-charge Atishi tweeted on Sunday. She was responding to a tweet by a West Bengal-based journalist, who asked about AAP looking to forge an alliance with the TMC in Goa Stating that politics in Goa has deteriorated considerably over the past several years, Atishi said, “There are daily reports about someone switching parties in the state. Sometimes a leader leaves the party and goes to another party. Sometimes a party makes an alliance with another party. Sometimes a party stands in opposition and campaigns against the particular party and forms the government with the same party," she said. “The leaders of Goa have been thinking about self-development till date. They only think about how to enrich themselves through corruption. The politicians never thought about developing the state. That’s why AAP is determined to change the politics of Goa. AAP is the only party which will provide honest governance in the state," she said.  “Goa is currently witnessing only two types of political discourses - party hopping and alliances. There isn’t any leader who talks about improving the quality of education, bettering water supply or providing employment to locals. It’s all dirty and ugly politics of which Goans are fed-up. On the other hand, AAP national convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal announced five guarantees to Goans as of now and has come to Goa with a blueprint for Goa's development," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/no-tmc-alliance-we-want-to-give-goa-an-honest-govt-aap/articleshow/88245314.cms||---

Harsh Mendhe, a resident of Milind Nagar in Pachpaoli, jumped into the lake to end his life but was saved by assistant police inspector Anchal Kapoor and two others of Ambazari police, and local diver Devidas Jambhulkar, who jumped into the lake to rescue him. Mendhe, a school dropout, has been depressed ever since he saw his mother die in a ghastly accident on Diwali day, November 4. A distraught Mendhe was consoled, counselled and handed over to his father Rajesh by Ambazari police. Senior inspector of Ambazari police station Ashok Bagul said his team was conducting panchnama of 50-year-old Rajesh Kale’s body after it was found floating in Ambazari lake. “As the formalities were being completed, there was a noise of someone jumping into the late. The victim was barely afloat. Our team jumped in sensing trouble, and pulled him out of danger,” said Bagul, adding the youngster was mentally disturbed. Bagul said Mendhe had to be counselled before he agreed to share his father’s mobile number. “Mendhe has been depressed and he had attempted such drastic acts of ending life in the past too. We all counselled him at length before reuniting him with his father,” said the senior PI. He said the youngster had been shaken up by his mother’s horrifying death in front of his eyes, which had affected him greatly. Bagul said Ambazari police have already put up mobile numbers of all senior officers at prominent places along the two lakes, Futala and Ambazari, so people can seek help from them. “We have managed to save four lives so far from the lakeside. Police are constantly counselling youngsters to remain safe and think positive. As far as possible, lakesides are being kept under watch to ensure lives are not lost,” said Bagul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/suicide-attempt-foiled-during-panchnama-of-drowning-death/articleshow/88244893.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Nature safari starts in G’chiroli to address man-animal conflict||Nagpur: Grappling with man-animal conflict, Gadchiroli forest circle has found a via media by launching nature tourism project at Gurvala, 12km from the district headquarters on Potegaon road. The project will be run with people’s participation. Conservator of forests (CF) Kishore Mankar said Gurvala forest area is spread in 3,733 hectares, but safari will be available in 54km routes. “The human-tiger conflict has been raging in the past and there was a demand from locals to launch nature safari. At least 15 families will benefit directly and many others indirectly from the maiden project,” said Mankar. The number of tigers has been growing in Gadchiroli and Wadsa forest divisions and in the last three years, at least 18 villagers have died in tiger and leopard attacks there. “To create positive feedback about forest and wildlife by seeking local support, we have started the project. It will be run by joint forest management committees (JFMCs) of Gurvala and Hirapur. The project was opened by Gadchiroli Zilla Parishad chief Ajay Kankdalwar on December 10,” said Mankar. Apart from the presence of tigers, leopards, hyenas, fox, sloth bears, wild dogs, and herbivores like barking deer, chitals, blue bulls, and wild boars, the forest has a typical characteristic of some stony mounds. These natural mounds of stones have been identified as tourist spots and locally named after their shape and size. For example, at one spot a stone looks like a coconut and hence is called a ‘Narali Gota’. A huge stone mound has been named ‘Dholi Gota’. Dholis are used by tribals to store grains and are still in prevalence. Though Gadchiroli has four protected areas (PAs) — Kolamara conservation reserve, and Chaprala, Pranhita, and Bhamragarh wildlife sanctuaries, this is the first such nature safari in a territorial forest. The Gurvala project was started taking a cue from Chandrapur circle, where two jungle safaris — one in Karwa in Ballarshah range and another in Chora-Tirwanja forest in Bhadravati — were launched in January and February this year. Gurvala sarpanch Darshana Bopche welcomed the move and hoped tourism will bring in some employment to the local youth. “However, the flip side is that villagers will have to shed dependence on the forest as there will now be restrictions on grazing, collection of fuelwood, and tendu leaves, which is the biggest livelihood source for the people,” said Bopche. “If we continue with these practices, the very purpose of nature safari will be defeated. But on the demand from locals, we will take up the issue with the forest officials for alternative compartments,” said Bopche. BOX Gurvala Safari At A Glance * Gurvala forest spread in 3,733 hectares * Safari will be available in 54km routes * Road distance to Gurvala Nature Park is 150km from Nagpur * At present, there is only one Gypsy * Private vehicles are allowed * Carrying capacity 10 vehicles per day * Rs1,000 entry fee for private vehicles & Rs2,000 for Gypsy * Guide fee Rs300||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nature-safari-starts-in-gchiroli-to-address-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/88244902.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Nagpur||‘Calendar of evidence’ to be scrutinized in 90 murder cases: CP||Nagpur: The ‘calendar of evidence’ or contents of the evidence in 90 murders that have occurred in the city would be assessed by several ranks of supervisory officers, as per the latest instructions of city police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar. The elaborate exercise has been undertaken to ensure the murder cases end up in conviction and the accused remain behind bars for the longest time. The top cop’s decision came on the heels of his observation during police station visits that the accused in some sensitive murder cases were out on bail within a short period. In a separate development, city police have drawn up the city’s ‘murder hotspots’ to earmark places where incidence of murders has been higher and more frequent than other places. As per the CP, there is a different set of preventive techniques and strategies to curtail murders at these hotspots. As per the latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2019, Nagpur and Patna had the country’s worst murder rate. Kumar has instructed police stations to prepare the calendar of evidence in each murder case. The documents would be scrutinized by supervisory officers at different levels, following which they will be sent to the top cop for his final assessment on the evidence collected and amendments needed. The CP said an exhaustive practice of evidence assessments has been undertaken in which the proof collected in each case would be analyzed “The main aim is to ensure there is a conviction in each case for which the chargesheets have been flawless and watertight. This exercise of assessments is done to improve conviction rates in murder,” said Kumar. The top cop said the other aim of the exercise is to ensure the accused’s bail pleas are well contested and cancelled. “Murder accused are expected to remain in judicial custody for as long as possible. The challenge is to keep them behind the bars by contesting their bails,” said Kumar. The police chief added, “We are also supposed to keep a close watch on the bail conditions of the accused. As soon as there is a violation of the bail conditions, we must bring it to the court’s notice and get the order cancelled.” To prevent murders, especially at the hotspots, Kumar said cops would organize aggressive community interactions at such places and step up the “visibility of the police” and juvenile management strategies, involving families. “We are aiming at strict implementation of liquor permit norms at murder hotspots so that those below the age of 25 do not get access to liquor,” he said. Two-time city police chief PKB Chakraborthy said evidence collection should start from the spot and that framing an accurate FIR is crucial. “Evidence should be pursued in the FIR too,” he said, adding that care should be taken to ensure the collected evidence does not get tampered. Former district government pleader Vijay Kohle said crime scene management and witness protection are the two most crucial aspects for convictions. CP’s take on murder prevention Aggressive community interactions with stakeholders Visible policing Strict enforcement of liquor permit norms Ensuring those aged below 25 cannot access liquor Sensitization of country liquor shop owners to alert cops regarding goons Get bails of murder accused cancelled Ex-CP PKB Chakraborthy’s 10-point agenda Record correct FIR Senior officers must visit crime spot Pursue evidence in FIR Interrogate accused properly Identify weapons correctly Maintain forensic reports and evidence well Seniors must vet chargesheet Investigation officers should be instructed in writing Key role of supervisory officers No evidence should be missed||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/calendar-of-evidence-to-be-scrutinized-in-90-murder-cases-cp/articleshow/88244932.cms||Soumitra Bose

However, technical difficulties and redtapism is delaying the establishment of a local set-up for genome sequencing in the city. The All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and government medical college and hospital (GMCH) have already initiated the process to start genome sequencing, but both the proposals are in limbo for various reasons. “We have already submitted the proposal to set-up and start genome sequencing at AIIMS. But, right now we are waiting for the ministry of health and family welfare to offer us relaxation from the ‘Make In India’ clause,” said Maj Gen Dr Vibha Dutta, director and CEO of AIIMS. As per the Central government rules, it’s mandatory for the procuring institution to buy at least 20% parts of the set-up from an Indian manufacturer. AIIMS officials say there’s hardly any Indian manufacturer involved in making parts to set up a genome sequencing centre. So, they have request the Centre to relax norms. When it comes to testing, AIIMS has been the leading from the front right from the onset of the pandemic. AIIMS was the first amongst institutions to start an RT-PCR testing facility in Central India. During the first wave, AIIMS was the authority to train and approve new RT-PCR labs in four states. Even now, AIIMS is monitoring the testing process in more than 50 labs across Central India. Genome sequencing was the most important addition for which the AIIMS was trying since months. “There is no Indian manufacturer involved in production of the sequencer set-up. We can’t comply with the ‘Make In India’ clause. The Centre should allow us to go for total foreign purchase,” said Dr Dutta. On the other hand, GMCH, which once had the highest capacity of daily RT-PCR tests, is waiting for the sequencer since 8 months. Authorities told TOI that GMCH has not only submitted the proposal but also deposited Rs 1.25 crore with the Haffkine Institute, the procuring agency appointed by the state government. “The delay is from the Haffkine front. We have completed all the formalities from our end,” said a senior official from GMCH. Nagpur is central India’s medical hub and caters to the medical needs of Vidarbha region as well as border regions in adjacent states. At present, samples from Nagpur had to be sent to NIV Pune for sequencing. GENOME SEQUENCING LOCALLY * Samples of Nagpur-based Covid positive patients sent to NIV Pune or CCMB Hyderabad for genome sequencing * It takes time as these select institutions have to deal with samples coming from many districts/states * Local genome sequencing facility will provide several benefits like early results and wider testing window * AIIMS and GMCH have trained manpower for genome sequencing.

Her male companion who had given fake names for them at the lodge register is missing. The victim, identified as Poonam Pal, was killed with a sharp weapon, police said, adding that her head is yet to be found. The killer fled with all her clothes and belongings to hide her identity, cops said. Since the couple was caught on CCTV wearing Covid mask and the lodge didn't take any identity proof like Aadhaar from them, the probe was initially delayed, but then police found a handbag. Medical prescription helps cops identify victimRaigad district police said they found her handbag about 50 metres from the lodge. Based on a medical prescription from Goregaon they found in the bag, when the investigators called up Goregaon police, they were informed that a missing person complaint had been lodged by the family of Poonam Pal. The lodge owner, Ketan Ramane, found the body when he went to their room for morning service. The couple was caught on CCTV cameras of Dasturi Naka entry point entering Matheran Saturday evening. The Dasturi naka CCTV does not show the suspect leaving, which means he took a different route to flee, police said. His identity is still not clear. Matheran police have formed five teams to looking for the suspect and also find the woman's head. Three teams with Mumbai police and two teams of Raigad police are positioned in the upper and lower areas of Matheran for investigation. "The woman's body has been taken to Panvel sub-district hospital for postmortem," said Dr Rupali Misal, medical officer, BJ Hospital, Matheran. "Most of the locals' livelihood is dependent upon the lodging business. Most of the lodges are illegal in terms of obtaining permission, CCTVs and security, following minimum compliances, etc. License and other compliances checking are ignored completely by police and administrative authorities," said a Matheran resident. "Police have convened a meeting of all lodge owners wherein minimum compliance will be rolled out. The lodge owner's permission details are being tracked," said Surekha Bhanage, chief officer Matheran municipal council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-beheaded-by-partner-in-matheran-lodge/articleshow/88246309.cms||Umesh K Parida

This was the fourth Sharjah-Nagpur flight since the international route was reopened on December 5 after a prolonged closure. After the first flight, three more flights landed directly from Sharjah on December 7, 8 and 12. None of them has tested positive so far. Eight more flights are scheduled to land in Nagpur this month. Three international flyers, who tested Covid positive, entered the city from Mumbai and Delhi. One of them — a 40-year-old man — is now confirmed Omicron patient and admitted to AIIMS Nagpur’s special ward along with two others. With Sunday’s addition, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has tested around 400 flyers for Covid infection. Amid the Omicron scare, flyers directly landing in city and testing negative is a huge respite. The NMC is monitoring the flyers and they are said to be doing well. Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said flyers directly landing in city need to be tested on the 8th day of arrival. “We have asked them to furnish negative RT-PCR reports. Our zonal medical teams too are assisting them in case they want to take a test at our centre. A list of another 600 international travellers was provided to us by the bureau of immigration. All those who could be traced were asked to take a test. Some of them tested positive,” he added. The NMC has sent samples of these passengers too for genome sequencing to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Joshi said many never came to the city after entering the country, but were in other cities when the civic teams called them. The passengers had their permanent residence in Nagpur and, therefore, the local body was alerted. A zonal medical officer said some of the flyers have also moved out of Nagpur as per their original travel plan. “It is difficult to keep a constant check when they are negative, though the norms mandate seven-day home quarantine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-flyer-from-direct-intl-flight-tested-ve-so-far/articleshow/88244959.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Nagpur||FRA activists fume over state govt’s move to monitor CFRs||Nagpur: The Vidarbha Livelihood Forum, a consortium promoting Forest Rights Act (FRA), has opposed the state government’s decision to set up convergence committees to prepare management plans to effectively and transparently implement community forest rights (CFRs) offered under the FRA. Till the end of August 2021, of the 11,842 CFR claims, the district level committees (DLCs) have approved 8,133 in Maharashtra. For better monitoring and effective implementation, the tribal development department issued a GR on November 22, directing to set up convergence committees at gram panchayat, taluka and district levels. These committees will prepare management plans of CFR villages and work will be done as per the plan. The plans will have to be approved by the taluka level and district level committees, which will include officials from the forest, revenue, irrigation, PWD, agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries departments. “The idea is to strengthen grams sabhas and increase its member base, provide sustainable livelihood through the forest, boost wildlife and biodiversity conservation and maintain an ecological balance. We will also provide benefits of various state schemes and funds made available under MGNREGA, MP/MLA local area development schemes at the grassroots,” said tribal department officials. However, talking to newsmen, VLF activists Dilip Gode, Purnima Upadhyay, Mahadev Gillurkar, Rajiv Thorat, Mohan Jadhav and Gunwant Vaidya said, “The government decision is like infringing upon gram sabhas rights and is also against the FRA, 2006. Such committees cannot run parallel to the gram sabhas. It will affect the smooth implementation of the FRA.” “The FRA was brought to undo the historical injustice occurred to the forest-dwelling communities and to ensure land tenure, sustainable livelihood and food security of the forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes & Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (ST & OTFDs). The GR breaches gram sabhas rights,” they said. The tribal department officials said the decision was taken in a meeting chaired by the tribal department secretary on August 5, 2021. It was under consideration since October 2016. Earlier, a steering committee too had taken a decision on March 5, 2014. Rule 4 (1) (F) provides a mechanism to monitor and control the committee constituted under clause (e) which shall prepare a conservation and management plan for community forest resources. However, tribal department officials seeking anonymity said, “FRA activists are opposing the GR as they will lose the clout they have on these CFR villages. Few NGOs want to drive the entire process and especially run the business of tendu and bamboo under the name of gram sabhas. Opposing the GR means denial to the participation of other stakeholders who want to contribute to strengthening the communities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fra-activists-fume-over-state-govts-move-to-monitor-cfrs/articleshow/88244965.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The work on connectivity in this route has remain stalled since May 2017 for want of permission from the state government after protests by Khasi Students' Union (KSU) and other organisations, senior railway officials of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) said. According to the updated status of the remaining projects, the entire Dimapur-Kohima rail link in Nagaland is also likely to be completed by March 2026. Officials said despite several challenges in the region, they have been working hard to expedite the works. "How can you carry out any work on a stretch where locals are not allowing us to carry out any activity? The rail connectivity project is only going to bring economic prosperity to locals and they will be the biggest beneficiaries," said an official in reference to the delay in the work on the Shillong link. Out of eight, the capitals of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura have been connected with railway networks and work is in progress on the remaining five, said Northeast Frontier zone general manager, Anshul Gupta. According to general manager (works) Sunil Sharma, with the government expanding the rail link across the region as part of its 'Look East' policy, they have stepped up monitoring of the ongoing works and will go for phase-wise commissioning of different lines so that people can benefit. The railways is currently implementing projects worth Rs 55,000 crore. It said these projects will positively impact the lives and the economic activities of people in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/plan-for-ne-capitals-on-rail-map-by-2024-may-get-delayed/articleshow/88246329.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Nagpur||Farmer who achieved record sugarcane yield bats for tech use||Nagpur: In a region infamous for farmers’ suicides, a farmer from Saoner created a record for maximum production of sugarcane — 110 metric tonnes — per acre. Rajesh Baghel is the first one to do so from Vidarbha. He also earned a handsome profit of Rs1.75 lakh after sale of his produce. He said it was unbelievable when Union minister Nitin Gadkari advised farmers to plant sugarcane initially. “Of course, technology played its part as I used advanced techniques like drip irrigation, coupled with fertiliser and crop management,” he said. Baghel was felicitated by Gadkari during the inauguration of the first ever app-based radio for farmers at Press Club for his efforts on Saturday. The minister also praised him in his speech calling him an inspiration for other farmers. The MP said record production achieved by Baghel is equivalent to those in Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli, the sugarcane belt of western Maharashtra. Baghel owns 40 acres of ancestral land and has been farming since the last two decades. “I have experimented with various crops, but never got this much success. Since the last few years only, I have cultivated sugarcane that turned out to be a cash crop. I also undertook tours to western Maharashtra to study the crop pattern and its requirements. It would have never been possible had Gadkari not convinced the farmers to go for it,” he said. When he began to use sugarcane, no one in the village believed him. “Even when I said I achieved over 100MT production, still no one believed. I would appeal to the farmers to shun their traditional approach and adopt technology to progress,” Baghel said. Lauding Baghel’s efforts, Gadkari said he proved that sugarcane can be cultivated in Vidarbha and farmers can earn profits if farming was done using technology. “Our farmers can also become rich. Unfortunately, they do not use the facilities available to them. The role of Agro Vision is to fill this gap and educate the farmers.” The minister said even three factories of Manas group were shut down in the last three years due to lack of sugarcane production in the region and suffered losses. “However, they have restarted since last year and this year, we reached break even. Next year, we are targeting export of Rs300-Rs400 crore, as we are producing pharmaceutical and sulphate-free sugar used by soft drinks makers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/farmer-who-achieved-record-sugarcane-yield-bats-for-tech-use/articleshow/88244977.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nagpur||Again, NIT gives hospital project to firm that lost contract 3 yrs ago for doing nothing||Nagpur: A hospital project posing a threat to over 60 big trees in Trimurti Nagar has been given back to a private company — Zest Multicare Hospital Private Ltd earlier ABCP Health Care — by the Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). The firm, which failed to do anything for three years, was even blacklisted after forfeiture of the earnest money deposit of Rs 80 lakh. Instead of fighting out the case, the civic agency accepted the company’s proposal seeking an amicable settlement. On Sunday, TOI had reported that NIT taken the measurement and done the demarcation of the land situated between Gajanan Maharaj Mandir and Shankar Saoji for handing it over to the company for development of the hospital. The land comprises of over 60 old trees of which a few were transplanted in 2001. NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi passed an order on September 6 for the board of trustees to take note of and the implementation as well. As per the order, the NIT had terminated the tender in which the company was selected as the successful bidder. On January 15, 2018, the NIT chairman had also forfeited the company’s EMD of Rs 80 lakh. It also blacklisted the firm and terminated the tender. Later, the NIT issued a fresh tender. The company had filed a petition in the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court which stayed NIT’s decision to go for a fresh tender on August 31, 2018. The company, on May 25, 2021, submitted a letter with the NIT. “The applicant submitted an offer to end the deadlock with progress of the project and also to resolve the issue amicably. The application is partly allowed. Expedite pendency of civil litigations, re-calculate the premium and hand over possession of the land,” NIT chairman stated in the order. The NIT chairman cited an order of the HC for considering the company’s request. In the order dated April 19, the HC had directed the government agencies to facilitate land to private hospitals for construction of oxygen plants. The order has no mention about giving government agencies’ lands for construction of new hospitals, especially to those terminated and blacklisted. In a statement to TOI a day ago, Green crusader Shrikant Deshpande said it’s a conspiracy of the NIT as many hospitals situated in sprawling lands of the NIT and NMC are lying abandoned and not utilized even in the Covid pandemic. The land at Trimurti Nagar has encroachments and big trees and will require time. Also, construction of any hospital will require atleast two-three years or more. Suryawanshi said, “The HC issued directions to decide on the representation made by the company. The decision has been taken in the larger interest of the NIT and the city. Requirement of more hospitals was felt during the second wave. Also, NIT did not receive any bids for a fresh tender. The company was also having stay from HC for three years. NIT did not get any revenue from the land in all these years which will come now. Decision was also taken to revise the premium as the pre-prevailing ready reckoner,” he said. Company’s Dr Ashish Ganjare did not respond to TOI calls and messages. As per NIT chairman’s order, the company had stated that it did not get loans due to litigations and encroachments and so, could not execute the project. The company had many a time demanded that NIT hand over the land without any hassles as per the letter of intent. IN A NUTSHELL * NIT owns 33,213.22 sq ft (3,086.73 sq m) land between Gajanan Maharaj Mandir and Shankar Saoji in Trimurti Nagar since March 1984 * Land reserved for dispensary and maternity home in city’s development plan * NIT proposed to buil hospital on design, built finance, operate and transfer basis for a period of 30+30 years and tender floated on July 8, 2014 * Zest Multicare emerged as highest bidder * Tender cancelled on January 15, 2018, citing firm did nothing * NIT even forfeited company’s EMD of Rs 80 lakh and also blacklisted it * NIT issued fresh tender but firm obtained stay from HC in August 2018 * Company sought amicable settlement with NIT in May * NIT decided to give project back to the firm * NIT cited HC’s order which is applicable for existing hospitals and not new ones * Land measurement and demarcation done recently * Over 60 big trees at site * Same area where trees, including some old ones, were transplanted in 2001||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/again-nit-gives-hospital-project-to-firm-that-lost-contract-3-yrs-ago-for-doing-nothing/articleshow/88244980.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Ahmedabad||55% girls and 41% boys do not reach class 12 in Gujarat: NFHS-5||AHMEDABAD: Out of every 100 girls who started education in class I in Gujarat, only 45 reached class XII, reveal the findings of National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 conducted during 2019-21. It's not only girls, though. The survey revealed that even among boys, out of every 100 students, only 59 reached class XII. The drop was steeper for girls at 55.1% compared to 41.2% for boys according to the survey findings. The state obviously lags behind in this crucial social development index even as the scenario has improved if one compares the statistics from NFHS-3 conducted in 2005-06. As compared to 57% boys and 44% girls attending higher secondary school in 2019-21, nearly 15 years ago only 36% boys and 28% girls were able to reach the landmark. The survey findings reveal that 82% of the children in 6-17 years in Gujarat attended school - 87% in urban areas and 79% in rural areas. Attendance was 71% in 2005-06. ‘Water availability, sanitation major factors for dropping out’In both rural and urban areas, the attendance has increased from 74% and 69% respectively in 2005-06. Experts said that there are multiple reasons for the phenomenon of overall dropout and sharper dropout for girls in Gujarat. Bharat Gajipara, president of the Self-Finance School Association of Gujarat, said that the lower classes don’t have a high percentage of dropouts as fewer students fail. “The major shift is seen in class X where our result hovers around 65-70% over the years. The failed students are less likely to continue studying. For girls, distance between school and home is a major factor – they are more likely to get primary education than boys as the parents are keen on giving her basic education, but when secondary and higher secondary schools are not in vicinity, they are likely to drop out,” he said. Water availability and sanitation is a major factor, too, said Rajesh Bhat, founder of Bal Manch, an NGO working with child education in Gujarat villages. “If the schools don’t have separate toilets, girls are less likely to attend. With onset of menstruation in higher classes, water availability is another issue,” he said. “Of course, numbers are improving primarily due to initiatives such as midday meal scheme and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.” Narayan Patel, former board member of Gujarat Secondary Education Board (GSEB) who is associated with education and examination process for over three decades in Gujarat, said that disappearing grant-in-aid schools in some parts of the state could be one of the reasons for dropout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/55-girls-and-41-boys-do-not-reach-class-12-in-gujarat-nfhs-5/articleshow/88246357.cms||Bharat Yagnik
---||Goa||Goan football's trailblazer||Francis D’Souza thought like no other footballer. At a time when most were happy to play and secure jobs with top clubs like Salgaocar Sports Club, Dempo Sports Club and Sesa Goa, the star striker dared to be different with a move to Calcutta, now Kolkata, in the seventies. Francis had made a name for himself by winning the Bandodkar Gold Trophy on his senior debut with Panvel Sports Club in 1974. Then won the Rovers Cup the next year with Dempo, scored twice in the final against Orkay Mills, and represented the country at the Asian Games in 1978. If he wished, he could have secured a comfortable job with any of the top business houses in Goa and lived happily ever after. But he chose to be different and instead packed his bags for Kolkata, the self-styled Mecca of Indian football. “The motivation to go to Kolkata was not money,” says Francis, who joined Mohun Bagan in 1979. “I was already winning trophies with Dempo and was a regular with the national team. I wanted to be among the best players, competing for the biggest prizes.” Those days, in the late seventies to be precise, all the best footballers headed to Kolkata. Even if they didn’t want to leave the comfort of their home states, it was difficult to say no when the Big Three —Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting—came calling with tempting offers. “Ever since I took to football, I wanted to be the first in everything I do,” says Francis, popularly known as Matari (old woman). So that’s how it all began. Francis was the first Goan to emerge top scorer at the national football championship for the Santosh Trophy, having scored in every game he played at Srinagar in 1978. He even scored in the final against Bengal, but that was infamously – and incorrectly – ruled out for offside. The Dempo striker was the first to score a hat-trick in the final of an all-India tournament. It happened in the 1976 edition of the Bandodkar Gold Trophy, against Leaders Club, made famous by the great Inder Singh. Francis was also the first to score a hat-trick against Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan and the first to be named the best player at the inaugural Federation Cup in 1977. Then he became the first Goan footballer to turn professional, in every sense of the word. “I always approached football as a professional. I had seen my colleagues whose desire to excel died down after they secured jobs (with companies that ran the clubs). They were talented players, but stagnating,” says Francis, whose motto of ‘perform and survive’ made him different. The Saligao-born footballer performed, consistently, all through his career, starting with Don Bosco Oratory (DBO) in the second division and helping the team to qualify for the senior division. After a stint with Panvel (1973-74), Francis moved to Dempo where he won the Rovers Cup twice, Stafford Challenge Cup (twice) and Nizam Gold Cup, besides all the trophies on offer in Goa. In 1977, when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) launched the Federation Cup, Francis scored a hat-trick against Mohun Bagan and emerged as the best player of the tournament. Little surprise, offers followed. The India striker accepted a lucrative offer of Rs 75,000 from Bagan, apart from other perks, including four flight tickets to Goa, but could not make the move due to “technical reasons,” according to what he was told by the Goa Football Association. He sat out for six months, trained by himself, and when it was time for him to finally make the move, showed just why he was the most sought-after footballer. “I scored the fastest goal in the Federation Cup on my debut for Bagan,” recalls Francis. It was 1979, and Francis was up against Salgaocar for his Bagan debut. When the match was just 19 seconds old, he sweetly struck the ball past goalkeeper Brahmanand Shankhwalkar. “Bagan fans were always eager to see me play and to score in the first minute itself was like a dream come true,” says Francis. For three years, Francis donned colours for Bagan and then moved to Mohammedan Sporting, winning all the top trophies with the two Kolkata giants. He returned home in 1984 and, not surprisingly, chose Dempo to end his career. “Playing in Kolkata was very exciting,” says Francis. “If you perform, fans make you a hero. I enjoyed my time there. If there’s any regret, it’s that I did not have anyone with me. I should have had another Goan teammate.” A year after Francis packed his bags for Kolkata, Joseph Machado followed him, though he opted to join East Bengal. Since then several Goan footballers have taken that path. But like they say, the one who took the first step will always remain in memory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goan-footballs-trailblazer/articleshow/88245676.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||India||Mizoram churches bat for baby boom||AIZAWL: The largest and most powerful church in the Christian-dominated state of Mizoram, the Presbyterian Church, decided to make an appeal to the state government to prolong maternity leave for women in order to encourage married couples to have more babies. The resolution was passed by delegates of the Synod conference, the highest decision making authority of the Prebyterian Church, on Saturday. The annual Synod conference was held at Republic Veng, the local church in Aizawl, from Tuesday and concluded on Sunday. A majority of the delegates from across the state said increase in population of church members and, the Mizos as a whole, has become important for their survival and prosperity. They said population can be increased only by having more babies and one of the most important encouragements is extension of the days of maternity leave for women working in the state government as an incentive. The decision to appeal to the state government to prolong maternity leave for women who have more babies has been accepted and the Synod conference authorised the Synod Executive Committee, the second highest decision-making authority of the Presbyterian Church, to pursue the matter with the state government. Not only the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church of Mizoram, the second largest church in the state, and other church denominations are also batting for baby boom in the state for survival as a minority religious community in the country, while the central committee of the Young Mizo Association (YMA), the largest and most powerful civil society group, also supported the decision. The churches and the YMA are of the opinion that the Mizos, as a tribe and a religious minority, should increase their population for survival and have been encouraging couples to have more children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mizoram-churches-bat-for-baby-boom/articleshow/88246372.cms||HC Vanlalruata
---||Nagpur||Only 40 workers for 179 gardens on 238 hectares||Nagpur: In sharp contrast to its ‘green city’ reputation, the 179 gardens (spread over 238 hectare) across 10 zones in Nagpur city are slipping into a state of neglect, with only 40 employees to maintain them. The lack of gardening staff and paucity of funds for park maintenance due to meagre budgetary allocations by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are gradually choking the city's lungs. The fact that more than 50% of the gardens or parks in Nagpur are in a bad state points to the lack of seriousness in civic authorities in providing breathing space to residents, said some citizens. One of the prime reasons for such neglect is the manpower crisis in the department. Against sanctioned 273 staff, only 40 are working for gardens. Thus, with only 15% of assigned manpower, it is impossible to maintain 238 hectares of gardens in Nagpur. As many as 182 of 273 posts in the garden department are lying vacant. The posts were sanctioned when the number of parks or gardens was 42, said sources. Important posts like gardeners, security guards and mazdoors (workers) are lying vacant. Of the sanctioned 76 posts of gardeners, only 21 were appointed. Similarly, 66 of the 115 posts of workers are lying vacant, affecting maintenance of gardens. Of the 91 posts, 51 employees of the garden department are working in other departments, which is surprising since the garden department itself is struggling without manpower. TOI visited many gardens across the city and found that gardens developed by Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) and handed over to NMC are in a pathetic condition. Officials from the department admitted that the department is facing a severe crisis in maintaining gardens and parks. With available manpower, the department is maintaining gardens as and when possible, he said, and said that if a garden is cleaned today, its next turn could be after many days once the staff has cleaned other gardens. Congress corporator Manoj Sangole also pointed out that the NIT gardens at Siddharth Nagar, Lashkari Bagh, Laghuvetan Colony are in a shambles due to zero maintenance. Play equipment in many gardens is damaged and there are heaps of garbage at many parks. The situation of gardens can be improved if manpower is appointed, said Sangole. Echoing Sangole, green activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee pointed out that eyebrows had been raised when the civic body took over 48 gardens from NIT, as the former was struggling to appoint manpower even for its 131 gardens. “The decision proved to be over optimistic and as a result most of the gardens are in pathetic condition today,” he pointed out. Political interference needs to be restricted so that employees can work at the job they have been recruited for, said Chatterjee. Due to manpower crunch, the garden department is facing difficulty in conducting tree census as well as restricting illegal tree felling. “Since power of giving permission for tree cutting has been given to zone offices, cases of tree cutting have increased manifold due to political pressure,” said the green activist. NMC should not neglect manpower in the department as it plays a vital role in checking and maintaining greenery of the city, said citizens.

---||Hubballi||Will table anti-conversion bill in Belagavi session: Karnataka CM||BELAGAVI/HUBBALLI: After weeks of being in two minds over it, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Sunday said the state government will table the anticonversion bill in the winter session at Belagavi which starts on Monday. The draft bill is currently being scrutinised by the law department. In Belagavi and Hubballi, Bommai said the bill is meant to curb conversion through inducements and has assured members of the Christian community of protection for prayers and other rituals across the state. “There should not be any scope for conversion with allurements misusing poverty. The state will table the bill in this session itself,” he said. He added that after scrutiny by the law department, the bill will come up for discussion in the cabinet for approval and then introduced in the assembly. However, despite assurances, attacks against members of the Christian community continue unabated. According to Pastor JS Sudhakar, a church functionary in Belagavi, claimed that this year alone, more than 16 pastors came under attack from right-wing groups in Belagavi, highest number in the state. Only three FIRs were filed and the rest were resolved at police stations. On Saturday, an unidentified man carrying a machete entered a Caholic church and threatened the priest, Fr Francis D’Souza. The priest ran out of the church and the man chased him and later escaped. The police have filed a case. Sudhakar told attacks intensified recently after the debate about anti-conversion law started. Reverend Father Pramod, finance administrator of Belagavi diocese, said some elements are trying to paint the community in bad light. ‘32 attacks in past year over conversions’Reverend Father Pramod said: “According to census data, the population of Christians has come down, contradicting the claims of forceful conversion. Also, there is a law to deal with forced conversion. Where is the need for the new law?” Advocate Niyaz Moosa, who has been dealing with such cases, said in the past year, in Karnataka, 32 attacks have been reported. “All attacks were based on false allegations of conversion.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee in Goa on two-day visit, meetings on agenda||KOLKATA: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee reached Goa on Sunday on a two-day visit, ahead of the state assembly election next year. Mamata, who visited Goa twice in two months, will be accompanied by TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee. Mamata will hold three consecutive meetings at Benaulim, Panjim and Assnora — a village in south Goa. The CM will also hold an organizational meet at Dona Paula. The meetings come close on the heels of TMC announcing a host of projects for the state. On Saturday, the party said it would roll out a universal income support scheme, called Griha Laxmi, to guarantee Rs 5,000 to every woman head of a household if it won the Goa assembly polls. AITC Goa has claimed that so far more than 1,500 leaders have joined the party since Mamata’s first visit on October 30. Trinamool forged an electoral alliance with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party last week. In the 40-member Goa assembly, MGP won three seats in the last assembly polls. Meanwhile, a war of words erupted after former finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram took a dig at TMC’s proposal of offering Rs 5,000 to one woman per family under Griha Laxmi. Chidambaram questioned how a state with a Rs 23,473 crore debt at the end of March 2020 could provide Rs 2,100 crore a year under the scheme. The rebuttal came a little later with TMC MP and the party’s Goa-in-charge, Mahua Moitra, claiming that Rs 2,100 crore will be 6-8% of the state’s budget. “Rs 2,100 crore is 6-8% of total budget, which is perfectly doable. Good economics in a depressed post-Covid scenario requires putting cash in hand and liquidity into the system,” she said. The Trinamool Twitter handle was also critical of Chidambaram. “You can continue doing the math, while we are busy immersing ourselves in serving the people of Goa since that’s the need of the hour. Goa deserves good and sensible governance and it is time someone provided that,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-in-goa-on-2-day-visit-meetings-on-agenda/articleshow/88245117.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Woman held for choking baby daughter to death||MIDNAPORE: A woman in Pingla’s Uttarbar village was arrested on Saturday for allegedly choking her 2-year-old daughter to death with a pillow. Puja Jana was arrested following a complaint by her father-in law Tapan Kumar Jana. Toddler Dipti was pronounced dead when she was taken to a Kharagpur hospital. Police said the mother had confessed to killing her child so she could elope with paramour Debashis Mondal, who too was arrested. They have been slapped with charges of murder and hatching conspiracy. The child’s father, who works as a mason in Andaman, has been informed and asked to return home. After Puja informed neighbours that Dipti had died due to choking, villagers smelt a rat and informed police. Later, a relative too claimed that that Puja had confessed her crime. Mondal, however, said he had been framed as he was in no way connected with the murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-held-for-choking-baby-daughter-to-death/articleshow/88245109.cms||Sujoy Khanra
---||Bengaluru||After massive dip, foreign student arrivals up 14%||BENGALURU: After a massive dip of 72% in 2020 — a year that saw extraordinary measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 — the number of foreign students arriving in India has seen a 14% increase in 2021. Most are from the immediate neighbourhood. Data from the ministry of external affairs (MEA) shows 23,439 foreigners arrived in India on student visas between January and December 2021, compared to 20,561 in 2020. To put that in context, the number was 74,689 in 2019. Data from 2016 to 2021 shows more than 3.3 lakh foreigners from more than 160 countries came to India on student visas. The highest number of such visas were issued in 2019, followed by 2018 (72,268). The two other years also saw more than 70,000 people obtain such visas. Vikram Shroff, an expert on immigration law with Nishith Desai Associates, said: “I expect the Centre to further ease Covid-19 travel restrictions in a phased manner. Given the importance of education, getting students back to Indian universities should be a priority. While online education has played a crucial role, research and networking opportunities are indispensable for higher education. India’s focus should be on attracting foreign students by promoting Indian universities and to exceed the 2018 and 2019 intake levels by next year.” Students from Bangladesh (45,250) and Afghanistan (39,111) — together accounting for a quarter of such arrivals in the past six years — outnumber others by a huge margin. Among the top countries that exported students to India during the period are Malaysia (20,758), Sudan (15,126), Sri Lanka (14,635), Thailand (13,423), Yemen (11,437), Republic of Korea (10,135), Iran (9,960) and Iraq (7,113). These 10 countries account for more than 45% of overall arrivals. In 2021, 47% of students came from Bangladesh (3,565), Afghanistan (3,431), Sri Lanka (1,599), Tanzania (1,426) and Sudan (1,088). TV Mohandas Pai, chairman, Aavin Capital Funds, said: “While the increase is welcome, there is a lot to do. India has 7.5 lakh students studying outside the country but only a small number come here from abroad. We should identify the top 100 institutions and enable them to market education to ensure we get around 1 lakh or 1.5 lakh foreign students coming here.” Another expert said it will take at least two years to reach 2019 levels. “There is a need for globalisation of Indian education,” Pai said. “We need to give our top institutions freedom to get global students. There are about 3-4 million students globally and a lot of them are Indians, whose parents spend about $20 billion each year to educate them. This is more than the Union government’s budget for higher education. We cannot have global institutions without global students. Poor policy has depleted our resources, diminished our names and hurt us very badly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/after-massive-dip-foreign-student-arrivals-up-14/articleshow/88246433.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Visakhapatnam||Covid-19: Ireland returnee first Omicron case in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh reported its first case of Omicron on Sunday after a 34-year-old local resident of Vizianagaram, who recently returned from Ireland, testing positive for the Covid-19 variant. The man arrived at the Mumbai airport from Ireland on November 27 and initially tested negative for Covid-19 in a RT-PCR test. He was cleared to travel all the way to Visakhapatnam, but after learning about his foreign travel history, a repeat test was conducted by local officials in his native Vizianagaram district on December 4, which returned positive for Covid-19. Officials said subsequent genomic sequencing conducted on his sample at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) Hyderabad turned positive for the new variant Omicron. "Thankfully, the third test conducted on December 11, Saturday, came back negative for the disease," a local health official said. District medical and health officer (Vizianagaram) Dr Ramani Kumari, said that the patient arrived at his native Veeranarayanam village in S Kota mandal on December 3. "We conducted tests on 40 primary and secondary contacts soon after the patient tested positive for the pandemic. But all the clinical samples returned negative. We are once again testing about 100 people, who are in close contact or living near the patient's house to make sure that the variant has not spread to others. People need not worry as his third test came back negative," said Dr Kumari. The man, who does not have any symptoms, is in home isolation at his in-laws' house in Madhurawada, Visakhapatnam. 10 people under home isolation  About 10 people, including the patient, have been kept under home isolation. Another of his seven primary contacts and 15 secondary contacts tested negative for the disease. Dr G Hymavathi, director, Andhra Pradesh public health and family welfare department, said that so far, a total of 15 foreign returnees tested positive for Covid-19 in RT-PCR tests. "All these samples were sent to CCMB, Hyderabad for genomic sequencing. We have received reports of 10 cases so far and one turned positive for Omicron," Dr Hymavathi said. "The public is advised not to worry and believe in any rumours. We request people to continue to take all the Covid-19 precautions such as physical distancing, mask wearing and frequent hand washing," she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/andhra-pradeshs-first-omicron-case-reported-from-vizianagaram/articleshow/88246446.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Technician arrested for anti-Rawat post on Facebook||BENGALURU: A 40-year-old lab technician was arrested on Sunday for allegedly posting a derogatory message about the death of India’s first Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Facebook. Vidhana Soudha police identified him as Vasanth Kumar TK, working in a private hospital in Bengaluru and native of Mysuru. Kumar has been produced before the magistrate court, which remanded him in judicial custody. The arrest came two days after a case was registered against Kumar based on a complaint filed by Roopa, a sub-inspector attached with the social media wing of the city police commissioner’s office. The charges against Kumar are under IPC section 505 (Statements conducing to public mischief). Police said aside from derogatory remarks against Rawat, Kumar allegedly insulted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. His message included comments on Chinese intrusion into Indian territory. On Saturday, home minister Araga Jnanendra directed DGP Praveen Sood to punish those who post derogatory remarks against Rawat. “...Trace the home addresses of such anti-nationals and punish them,” the minister told Sood. CM Basavaraj Bommai too had warned of legal action against such people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-technician-arrested-for-anti-bipin-rawat-post-on-facebook/articleshow/88246468.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||96 with both doses had Covid in Ghaziabad, but none needed hospital care||GHAZIABAD: A total of 96 people have been found to have Covid after taking both shots of the vaccine in the city. Of them, 72 did not have symptoms of the virus while the others had mild signs. There were no deaths. Officials insisted the vaccine not only prevented the infection from getting severe, but also helped in faster recovery of the patients. None of these 96 Covid patients had to be admitted to hospital. According to officials, among 250 Covid patients who had taken only the first dose of the vaccine, about 50 turned serious and needed hospitalisation. But all of them recovered in time and no one succumbed to the infection. “The vaccine is proving to be a strong shield against the virus and considerably reduces the chances of contracting the infection. Even if someone tests positive after taking both doses, the infection is not severe,” said RK Gupta, the district surveillance officer. Around 40.6 lakh vaccine shots — 25.06 lakh first doses and 15.5 lakh second jabs — have been administered in Ghaziabad since inoculations began in January this year. So far, over 200 samples have been sent for genome sequencing, but “no substance of concern” has been reported. The officials said 203 samples had been sent to a Delhi laboratory, but they were yet to receive the reports. “All the reports concerning genome sequencing go to the state government directly from the laboratory. If there is any matter of concern or a new variant is confirmed, the government informs the district about it. We have not received any such report from the government so far,” Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/96-with-both-doses-had-covid-in-gzb-but-none-needed-hosp-care/articleshow/88244971.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||Noida Extension is set to get its first crematorium on Hindon banks||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) will build a crematorium on the banks of the Hindon river. The decision follows the demand for a crematorium from nearly 10 lakh residents of the different sectors and villages of Noida Extension. The crematorium will be built and operated in association with NGO Last Rites on the ‘build, operate and transfer’ (BOT) model for the next 10-11 years. It will comprise a freezer for the bodies, an air-conditioned hall for prayers and a memorial park. With no such facility in the area, residents of Noida Extension have to go to neighbouring Safipur village Mokshdham for the last rites of their kin. “We have been demanding a crematorium apart from other facilities in Noida Extension for a long time as the area is still lacking these facilities. We welcome the move and expect the facility to be ready soon,” said Annu Khan from Noida Estate Flat Owners and Members Association (NEFOMA). After GNIDA CEO Narendra Bhooshan agreed to the demand and instructed the planning and project department of the authority to find a suitable plot for the facility, the banks of the Hindon in the area was proposed. The authority will lease the said land to Last Rites for 10-11 years. All cremation arrangements, including wood, CNG and electric cremation facilities, will be provided at the crematorium. Families, meanwhile, can plant saplings in memory of those they have lost at the memorial park. While the authority will construct the approach road to the crematorium site, the general manager of the planning and project department has been appointed the nodal officer of the project and will provide the formal proposal for approval to the GNIDA CEO soon. “A joint team of the authority and NGO Last Rites will soon inspect the spot and draw the project blueprint. Work will commence after the plan is cleared,” said Deep Chandra, the additional CEO of GNIDA. Residents of areas around Noida Extension have also been demanding a community centre, a government hospital, a government school and a fire safety office for the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-extn-is-set-to-get-its-first-crematorium-on-hindon-banks/articleshow/88244934.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Dealers go faceless, adopt Russian treasure hunt model to sell drugs||BENGALURU: With police striking the city’s narcotic supply chain more frequently in the past few months, drug pushers have adopted a ‘faceless’ modus operandi to sell banned substances. And, sleuths tracking drug networks in the city see this method as similar to what’s employed by Russian cartels. In what police describe as a ‘treasure hunt’ style of operation, dealers are dropping off packages at odd places, directions to where — including GPS coordinates — are shared with customers using social networking platforms such as WhatsApp after they receive money through digital payments. “Dope-pushers no longer want to see customers and personally exchange drugs for cash. They don’t even want to deploy delivery boys. Instead, drug packets are dropped off in public places, the locations are geo-tagged and passed on to customers. The latter go on a treasure hunt trying to locate the drug packets; this is the modus operandi adopted in recent times by Russian drug cartels to avoid detection,” a senior police officer told TOI. Police learnt of the new method after a recent arrest of five people, including two students — Pranav VM and Shamil Y, residents of Koramangala; Shamdas of Soladevanahalli; Anubhav Raveendran K of Gangammanagudi and Mohammed Sakariya of Choodasandra — in Koramangala by the Central Crime Branch (CCB). All five hail from Kerala and are in their early 20s. The CCB seized MDMA crystals and ganja worth around Rs 10 lakh from them after they were busted following a tip-off. Led by inspector Deepak R, the team raided the house at Venkatapura in Koramangala on December 4 where the arrests were made. Having taken them into custody, a police officer said: “The key question was: How did the five get hold of the drugs? We pushed them to give up their dealers.” However, the five men said they had never met the people who sold them the narcotics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-dealers-go-faceless-adopt-russian-treasure-hunt-model-to-sell-drugs/articleshow/88246487.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||India||‘No part of non-NDA opposition is divided’||Amid dissonance in opposition ranks over the shape of the anti-BJP alliance and demands that it be expanded beyond the UPA — views treated sceptically by Congress — party MP and well-known lawyer Abhishek Singhvi tells Subodh Ghildiyal that he agrees that all non-NDA parties should be brought together like the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance. Excerpts from the interview: Now, even NCP chief Sharad Pawar is echoing Trinamool Congress’s line that UPA is restrictive and all the non-NDA parties should be brought together. What are your views?I cannot agree more with Sharadji’s statement that it is the bounden duty of each one of the non-NDA constituents to get what he calls the non-NDA, non-UPA elements together, as fast as possible. In fact, Congress and Pawar are the best example of the successful implementation of this very thought in India’s commercially most important state Maharashtra, where doomsayers and naysayers had not given the tripartite coalition a hope in hell. There is absolutely no reason why the Maharashtra model cannot and should not be successfully replicated, be it qua Telangana or Andhra Pradesh or Odisha or for that matter J&K. Trinamool Congress’s attacks on Congress are a serious setback to attempts to create a united opposition against BJP. How did it come to such a pass after a joint vow of unity in August?Not only is opposition unity the need of the hour but it will, and shall, happen for 2024. No one should be misled by early skirmishes which may be limited to local elections or on account of regional considerations. On basics, virtually no part of the non-NDA opposition is divided. I think that extra bit of effort is needed by each and every non-NDA stakeholder, and you will see it happening from mid-2022 onwards in a more focused manner and at a rapid pace. But how is the unity possible when Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has declared an intent to supplant Congress?I disagree that there is an attempt to supplant Congress. In any event, an entity like Congress, which lives in the hearts and minds of people across states, cannot be supplanted, nor can an entity which in 10 states is the main opposition and ruling in three, be ignored or wished away. Aren’t these views rooted more in optimism than reality?Its not optimism or starry-eyed wishful thinking. It’s the hard logic, the full recognition by all non-NDA forces that Modi’s BJP succeeds only because of repetitive division within the 62% anti-NDA vote. There appears an aversion to Congress. Even Samajwadi Party has cold shouldered Congress in UP?I am sad at the non-emergence of a consensus between Congress and SP in UP. The need of the hour is for such consensus. I still have hope. Obviously, politics recognises no vacuum. So in case such convergence becomes impossible, we will have to practice ‘ekla chalo’, though that should be the last option.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-part-of-non-nda-opposition-is-divided/articleshow/88246543.cms||---

Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan met his family members and attended the funeral at Dhamda village. Calling the commando a 'martyr', Chouhan said: "An honour fund of Rs 1 crore will be given to his family. The village school will be named after him and his wife will be given a government job. A memorial will be built to keep his memory alive." The government will take care of his children's education, he added. Thousands gather to pay homageThe soldier’s mortal remains reached Bhopal airport from New Delhi around 11am, and then taken to Dhamda on a flower bedecked truck. Thousands of people lined the 60km stretch between Bhopal and Sehore to pay homage. Thousands more had gathered in Dhamda where the body arrived around 1.30pm. The village was full of posters of the commando who sacrificed his life in the line of duty. Police had barricaded Jitendra’s house. CM Chouhan offered flowers and said: “Martyr Jitendra Verma was a brave hero and a skilled sniper, who could hit enemies even in darkness.” Senior military officers, local leaders and officials were present at the cremation. The soldier’s younger brother Dharmendra lit the pyre in the presence of his twoyear-old son. “Madhya Pradesh is proud that such a hero lived with General Bipin Rawat, a symbol of bravery of the Indian Army,” the CM said, adding: “I bow to the parents and family of the martyr.

---||World||My cat isn’t dangerous: Iran bill on pet ban sparks outrage||TEHRAN: “No, my cat is not dangerous,” said Iranian animal lover Mostafa, outraged by a proposal from ultraconservative lawmakers to ban pets. The 25-year-old, who runs a pet supplies shop in downtown Tehran, is stunned. “Crocodiles can be called dangerous, but how can rabbits, dogs and cats be dangerous?” he asked incredulously about the bill introduced a month ago. The proposed law pits growing numbers of people with pets against those who consider the practice decadent and hold that under Islamic law dogs, like pigs, are unclean. According to media reports, 75 MPs, or one quarter of parliamentarians, recently signed a text entitled “Support for the rights of the population in relation to harmful and dangerous animals”. In their introduction, the authors condemn the practice of humans living under one roof with domesticated animals as a “destructive social problem”. The phenomenon, they said, could “change the Iranian and Islamic way of life” by “replacing human and family relationships with feelings and emotional relationships towards animals”. The bill would prohibit “importing, raising, breeding, buying or selling, transporting or walking, and keeping at home wild, exotic, harmful and dangerous animals”. It lists the animals as “crocodiles, turtles, snakes, lizards, cats, mice, rabbits, dogs and other unclean animals as well as monkeys”. Offenders would risk a fine equivalent to 10 to 30 times the “minimum monthly working wage” of about $98 or and the “confiscation” of the animal. The bill has sparked criticism and mockery among the people. A person posted a photo of his kitten on Twitter with the message: “I have renamed my cat ‘Criminal’ since I heard this proposed law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/my-cat-isnt-dangerous-iran-bill-on-pet-ban-sparks-outrage/articleshow/88246580.cms||---

"Tomorrow, 13th December is a landmark day. At a special programme in Kashi, the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham project will be inaugurated. This will add to Kashi's spiritual vibrancy. I would urge you all to join tomorrow's programme," the PM tweeted on the eve of the launch. The Rs 900-crore project which has a 400-meter long and 75-meter wide corridor will connect the Kashi Vishwanath temple with three main ghats of the Ganga. The stretch has 24 newly constructed buildings to provide top-class amenities to pilgrims. The PM is inaugurating the first phase of the project. 'Corridor paves way for devpt of entire Purvanchal region'An outcome of the PM's vision for Kashi, the corridor facilitates hassle-free movement of pilgrims between Ganga and the temple and paves way for development of not only Varanasi, but the entire Purvanchal region, enhancing tourism and trade and creating employment opportunities for youth from the region," said a Kashi Vishwanath Temple official. "Prior to the construction of this corridor, the KV temple lacked direct access from the Ganga and devotees had to negotiate through congested lanes to reach the temple. The corridor gives Kashi a new identity of a smart city while retaining its ancient cultural and spiritual heritage." "To host the PM and other dignitaries for the opening of KVD corridor, all necessary preparations including floral decoration of the temple, Mandir Chowk as well as the 400-meter corridor area from Lalita Ghat to temple has been completed," divisional commissioner and chairman of Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board, Deepak Agrawal, told TOI. CM Yogi has reached Varanasi to oversee preparations for the mega event. All the ghats would be lit with diyas for the next three days while citizens will illuminate their houses to give city a festive look. Regarding the rituals to be performed by the PM, KVT chief priest Pt Shrikant Mishra said, "After reaching Lalita Ghat by boat, the PM will fetch Ganga Jal and move towards KVT on foot. PM will directly reach KVT's sanctum sanctorum where amid chanting of Vedic Mantra by three priests, he will perform the rituals of Shivarchan to mark the opening of KVD." From the KVT, the PM will reach Mandir Chowk amid blowing of conch shells and sounds of 'damru' to address the gathering of seers from different parts of country, including akharas, Adheenam Sect of Tamil Nadu, Lingayats and Veershaiva, religious and spiritual gurus. Board's secretary and KVT chief executive officer Sunil Verma said seating arrangements for guests had been made at Mandir Chowk. The testing of facade and other lighting arrangements in and around KVD had started three-days ago. The PM is inaugurating the first phase of KVD two years and eight months after he laid the foundation on March 8, 2019. In the second phase, 27 big and over 120 small temples found during the encroachment-removal drive would be restored.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/with-shivarchan-pm-narendra-modi-to-open-kashi-vishwanath-dham-corridor-project-today/articleshow/88246638.cms||Rajeev Dixit

To augment their resources, banks would be encouraged to raise funds from the market and also by selling their non-core assets, they added. In the current fiscal, the government has earmarked Rs 20,000 crore for the recapitalisation of PSBs. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to present the Budget on February 1. It is to be noted that the net profit of PSBs surged to Rs 14,012 crore in the first quarter, which further rose to Rs 17,132 crore in the second quarter ended September 2021. The combined profit of the first half of the current fiscal is close to the total profit earned in the entire previous financial year. During the last financial year, PSBs raised capital funds to the tune of Rs 58,697 crore, the highest amount mobilised in a fiscal. Capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of PSBs increased to 14.3% at the end of June, 2021 while the provision coverage ratio of public sector banks rose to an 8-year high of 84%. In some non-performing assets, banks have done provisions up to 100%, sources said, adding that recovery from those accounts will straightaway form part of the bottomline. Banks have been asked to focus on the recovery process as this would further boost their financial health. Meanwhile, banks are also working to expand their balance sheet under the credit outreach programme started October 16, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/psb-capital-infusion-is-unlikely-in-next-budget/articleshow/88246702.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Govt needs to step up pressure to ensure mask compliance in MP||BHOPAL: Compliance to mandatory mask norm goes up when an atmosphere is created by the government and the administration that caution is still a must to contain the pandemic and as soon as they become lenient, people also start being negligent towards Covid norms. When 14 new Covid cases were detected in Bhopal on November 30 putting both the state government and the district administration on the alert with the district collector raising the penalty for not wearing mask to Rs 500, the impact was felt the very next day with more people seen in masks on the roads and the markets, offices putting up "No mask, no entry" notice on the gate and students also seen in masks even after they had come out of schools and colleges and were returning home, at least in the new Bhopal areas. But, as days are passing without administration, police and BMC showing any urgency to enforce mandatory mask rule, leniency has started setting in among the people. "I have read in the media administration saying at the time when Corona cases had dropped drastically that night curfew might not be necessary but it has a symbolic value, it keeps reminding people that the threat of Corona is still there. After the state government lifted all the Covid curbs and Corona cases also started receding rapidly across the state, people had stopped wearing masks though the cases have regularly been reported from Bhopal and Indore. "We have always seen Indore and Bhopal taking the lead in spreading the virus both in the first wave and the second wave", said a doctor on the condition of anonymity. But, the district collector may have raised the fine on those not wearing the masks but administration, police and BMC have not yet started the campaign to catch people without masks and penalise them. Moreover, they may not say it openly but they don't seem to have a go ahead for the purpose from the state government either. Police says it's waiting for guidelines from the administration to start checking for masks and till that time. They are making public announcements requesting people to wear masks. The BMC staff says it is imposing spot fine for spreading litter and fogging is different localities to contain vector-borne diseases. On Friday, it collected more than Rs 39,000 by penalizing 302 people across the city for spreading litter at public places and use of banned polythene. Though BMC spokesperson said that they are also checking for masks and social distancing but in the details given of how many persons were fined in which ward, there was none penalised for violation of Covid norms. Spokesperson for the district administration, Arun Bhatt, said "We are being persuasive and not coercive right now. We are making public announcements, asking restaurants and shopkeepers not to sell goods to people who come without wearing masks. Police and BMC are also assisting in the task. "Roko Toko" campaign is also being run. Corona cases have also stabilised to 6-7 daily but if the cases start going up, checking will start and people violating Covid norms will be fined. We only hope that people exercise caution on their own and they don't have to cough up money unnecessarily."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-needs-to-step-up-pressure-to-ensure-mask-compliance-in-mp/articleshow/88246756.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

In his address at the ‘Depositors First’ event, Das said that deposit insurance payout was the last resort as the regulator was committed to ensuring that the banking system remains robust and resilient. “The RBI has been adopting a proactive strategy to strengthen the regulatory guidelines, to strengthen the supervisory methods and to look at things which will ensure that going forward, the banks function in a very resilient manner.” At the same time, Das asked all players to remain vigilant. “Every stakeholder whether it is the management of banks, whether it is the board of banks, whether it is the various committees of banks, the audit committee, the risk management committee, or any other regulatory authority that is associated, it has to be a joint responsibility for all of us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/high-returns-associated-with-higher-risks-shaktikanta-das/articleshow/88246788.cms||---

---||Business||Deposit cover hike to make banking system more secure: PM Modi||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that the government’s move to increase the deposit insurance limit to Rs 5 lakh will not just provide safety to depositors, but will also make the banking system more secure. “Banks have a major role to play in the country’s prosperity. And, for that it is equally important to ensure the safety of depositors’ money. We will need to provide safety to depositors if we want to secure banks,” the PM said at an event. He added that dues of nearly one lakh depositors, which added up to Rs 1,300 crore, was paid recently with money of another three lakh depositors would be transferred in the coming days. After 27 years, the government had amended the law to increase the deposit cover from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, while also deciding to ensure speedy payment of dues, within 90 days of the RBI imposing a moratorium on banks. Modi said that following the amendment, 98% of the depositors would be covered by the insurance scheme, which was started in the 1960s. “Earlier things used to keep hanging for 8-10 years... it took lot of effort for depositors to withdraw their own money. Whenever, there was a problem with a bank, there was an uproar and it is natural. People keep their funds in a bank with a lot of trust, especially the middle class which has a fixed salary, a fixed income,” he said, while arguing that his government was being decisive instead of postponing decisions or pushing them under the carpet. FM Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government had given top priority to ensuring the interests of depositors. “There were cases of people who waited for their deposits for five years, six years, seven years and couldn’t get the money back because either the bank had to be liquidated, or some kind of amalgamation had to happen,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/deposit-cover-hike-to-make-banking-system-more-secure-pm-modi/articleshow/88246811.cms||---
