Telangana Congress working president and MLA T Jayaprakash Jagga Reddy on Monday said there was never any problem about procurement of paddy, right from the Jawaharlal nehru government to Congress-led UPA government up to 2014. The Nehru-government had put in place a system of centre lifting paddy from the states through Food Corporation of India. "The present problem is a crisis created by TRS and BJP, which are now trying to derive political mileage by championing the cause of paddy farmers," Jagga Reddy alleged. "Everyone thought that problems would be solved once Telangana state is achieved. But the problems are continuing to haunt the people seven years after the new state has been formed. Farmers are compelled to sleep on the heaps of their paddy under the sky and on the roads awaiting procurement. This is the status of affairs in the Telangana state," he said. The TRS had supported the BJP in the election of the President of India. Why is the TRS failing to prevail upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to buy all the paddy from Telangana? "Both the TRS and BP are trying to derive political mileage out of the paddy procurement issue. Pm MOdi and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao can sit together and solve the issue. The TRS and BJP are playing a double game. They have created this paddy procurement problem and are now projecting as if they are trying to protect the interests of paddy farmers," Jagga Reddy alleged. On the TRS ministers delegation's visit to New Delhi, Jagga Reddy said when CM KCR visited the national capital twice but the problem remained unsolved, how will the ministerial delegation solve it. The Congress will continue to fight for the cause of farmers and expose the drama being played by the TRS and BJP. "Congress, if voted to power, will give top priority to farmers' welfare. All the procurement centres would be opened, priority would be given to paddy cultivation and farmers can cultivate the crop of their choice," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-and-bjp-responsible-for-present-paddy-procurement-crisis-in-telangana-congress-jagga-reddy/articleshow/88397533.cms||Roushan Ali

Senator Joe Manchin, who is a Democrat only notionally in a ruby red Republican state of West Virginia, joined the Omicron variant of the virus on Monday in delivering a one-two punch to the market and to Democratic plans surcharge the economy after he broke ranks to kill Biden's landmark legislation in a Senate that is tied at 50-50. It would have required every single Democratic vote and the vice-president's tie-breaker to pass a bill that has already cleared the Democrat-majority House, but Manchin stunned Washington on Sunday by going on Fox News and declaring he would not vote for it. An angry White House unloaded a 714-word statement on the perceived betrayal, casting Manchin as a duplicitous liar, because he had reportedly agreed to back the President after changes he sought to the legislation had been incorporated. Biden had spent days and weeks trying to win him over, to the extent that vice-president Kamala Harris was asked in a radio interview last week who was the real PotUS: Joe Biden or Joe Manchin. The legislation Manchin torpedoed by aligning with Republican objections included far reaching proposals on child tax credit, healthcare and climate change, and it was expected to help the poor and boost the Dems prospects in upcoming midterm polls. "Maybe Senator Manchin can explain to the millions of children who have been lifted out of poverty, in part due to the Child Tax Credit, why he wants to end a program that is helping achieve this milestone -- we cannot," the White House statement asked sharply. Even though the legislation died before his eyes, Biden himself tweeted, "Right now, there’s a kid out there whose family can’t afford her insulin because it costs $1,000 per month. The Build Back Better Act would cap their monthly insulin costs at $35. I’m committed as ever to getting it done for them." Democratic Party progressives reacted with fury. "Let’s be clear: Manchin’s excuse is bullshit. The people of West Virginia would directly benefit from childcare, pre-Medicare expansion, and long term care....Joe Manchin sold out the people of West Virginia to Mitch McConnell, corporations, and the wealthy," Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a direct attack on a Senator whom the left accuses of being a closet Republican. Others are calling for structural change in the American political system, pointing to quirks that enable Senators from thinly populated states elected by less than half a million people hold to ransom a President elected by 81 million people. Aside from Manchin's internal subversion of the party agenda, a Republican Senator has for months put a hold on dozens of Biden's diplomatic nominees, including the ambassador-designate to India, who are awaiting confirmation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/democratic-senator-joe-manchin-torpedoes-bidens-landmark-bill-and-own-party/articleshow/88398867.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

The visit comes a week after the full Commission visited Punjab, starting its customary exercise of touring poll-bound states for discussions with the state administration, state chief electoral officer and political parties on all poll-related issues, before finally announcing the election dates. Sources said the Commission is due to visit Uttarakhand next on December 23 and 24 to assess all aspects of poll preparedness with the stakeholders, followed by a visit to the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh, tentatively scheduled between December 28 and 30, for the same purpose. As per convention, the EC announces the polls after assessing the ground situation and poll preparedness with visits to the election-bound states. The visits also give the commission a fair assessment of the requirement of Central para-military forces for poll security. Based on the requirement assessed, the EC will have discussions with the home ministry to finalise the extent of forces to be deployed based on the availability indicated by MHA. Usually, a discussion between the EC and the home secretary is one of the last exercises to be undertaken before announcing the election dates. As per indications, EC may announce the poll schedule early next month, and hopes to do it after the revised electoral rolls for the poll-bound states with January 1, 2022 as reference date, are published. UP has indicated that it will have the rolls published by January 5, which incidentally should pave the way for announcement of assembly polls in UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. The polls are likely to be timed in February-March 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-punjab-ec-in-goa-to-assess-poll-preparedness-will-visit-uttarakhand-on-dec-23-24-up-between-dec-28-30/articleshow/88398835.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Trump reveals he got Covid-19 booster shot; crowd boos him||NEW YORK: Former President Donald Trump revealed he received a booster shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, drawing boos from a crowd in Dallas. Trump made the disclosure Sunday night during the final stop of "The History Tour," a live interview show he has been doing with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. "Both the president and I are vaxxed," O'Reilly said at the American Airlines Center, drawing some jeers from the audience, according to video shared online by O'Reilly's "No Spin News."  "Did you get the booster?" he asked the former president. "Yes," Trump responded. "I got it, too," O'Reilly said, eliciting more hectoring. "Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!" Trump told the crowd, waving off their reaction with his hand. While Trump has expressed opposition to vaccine mandates, he has long taken credit for the vaccines developed on his watch. At the same time, he has refused to urge his supporters to take them, even though Republicans remain far less likely than Democrats to be protected. For instance, while other world leaders, including former Vice President Mike Pence, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, received their doses publicly to promote the lifesaving medicine, Trump chose to receive his in private - an acknowledgement of the unpopularity of the vaccine with large swaths of his base. And while he has blamed the Biden administration for high levels of vaccine skepticism, he repeatedly undermined public health recommendations while in office, encouraging the use of unproven treatments and playing down the threat the virus posed as he tried to prioritize economic recovery and secure a second term. Trump had told the Wall Street Journal in a September interview that he "probably" wouldn't get a booster shot. "I feel like I'm in good shape from that standpoint," he told the paper. "I'll look at stuff later on. I'm not against it, but it's probably not for me."  The US has been urging all eligible Americans to get booster shots as quickly as possible as the country faces a surge in the new, highly contagious omicron variant. Both Moderna and Pfizer have said that booster shots of their Covid-19 vaccines appear to offer protection against the new strain, which preliminary evidence suggests can better evade vaccines than previous versions. Trump was hospitalised with Covid-19 in October 2020, weeks before the presidential election, and received experimental monoclonal antibodies treatment. His former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, revealed in a book released this month that Trump was far sicker than the White House disclosed at the time. Before the booing, Trump on Sunday told the audience that they should "take credit" for the success of the vaccines developed while he was in office. "Look, we did something that was historic. We saved tens of millions of lives worldwide. We together, all of us - not me, we - we got a vaccine done, three vaccines done, and tremendous therapeutics" Trump said. "This was going to ravage the country far beyond what it is right now. Take credit for it. Take credit for it.... Don't let them take it away. Don't take it away from ourselves." "You're playing right into their hands when you sort of like, Oh the vaccine,'" he added. "If you don't want to take it, you shouldn't be forced to take it. No mandates," he said, drawing cheers. "But take credit because we saved tens of millions of lives. Take credit. Don't let them take that away from you." Trump aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-reveals-he-got-covid-19-booster-shot-crowd-boos-him/articleshow/88398943.cms||---
---||World||Pak PM sparks uproar in Afghanistan over terrorism, graft remark||ISLAMABAD: The acting Taliban foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, defended the latest remarks of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on corruption, terrorism and cultural diversity in Afghanistan, which had created an uproar in the war-torn country. Khan had claimed during his keynote address at the OIC meeting o Sunday that Daesh has been threatening Pakistan from Afghanistan. "We have had attacks from the Afghan border, from ISIS, into Pakistan," he had said. Khan had stated that due to years of corruption in Afghanistan, poverty was widespread in the landlocked country even before the collapse of the former government there. He also spoke on the human rights issue, saying that it should be understood in the context of prevalent cultural values in the country. "We must understand… when we talk about human rights, every society is different. Every society’s idea of human rights and women’s rights are different," Khan said. "Culture in Kabul was always different from rural areas, just like we see in Peshawar where it is completely different from the districts on the border with Afghanistan," Pakistan’s PM had said. His remarks on ISIS and human rights drew a sharp response from former Afghan president Hamid Karzai and other Afghan nationals on social media. Karzai called Khan’s remarks "an attempt to sow discord among Afghans, and an insult to the Afghan people". "Allegations that ISIS is active in Afghanistan, threatening Pakistan from Afghanistan, is clear propaganda and in fact the opposite is true. The threat of ISIS has been directed from Pakistan against Afghanistan from the very onset," Karzai said in a series of tweets. At a presser in Kabul on Monday, the interim Afghan FM said that he believed the Pakistan PM’s remarks at OIC’s extraordinary session were not an insult to Afghanistan. Muttaqi said Khan’s remarks were critical of the former governments and therefore the former officials felt compelled to react. "Imran Khan criticised the former (Afghan) governments. I think officials of the former governments felt obligated to react, I don’t see (Khan’s remarks) as insulting." Muttaqi said that if the Pakistan PM meant that a weak Afghan government would not be able to control the Daesh threat, that is another issue. "I hope it will never happen," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/afghan-taliban-fm-defends-pm-imran-against-criticism-from-his-countrymen/articleshow/88398961.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

He, however, said that some people don’t want to ensure 24-hour electricity to the people and that they expect the administration to function according to their will, "which is never going to happen". Sinha said at a function that people across J&K have suffered badly due to the strike called by PDD employees. He assured that in the next four to five years, consumers will be able to get 24-hour electricity. With regard to the restoration of electricity in affected areas, the L-G said that the Army, NHPC, and others have been roped in to restore the electricity supply, adding that 60% had been restored by Sunday and that ti would be at 100% across J&K on Monday. "Unlike other places, J&K lacks 24-hour electricity. With the assistance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 236 projects — transmission and others — have been completed," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/100-electricity-to-be-restored-across-jk-by-tomorrow-l-g-sinha/articleshow/88399072.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The backlash by People's Conference, one of the estranged constituents of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, was partly directed at what it termed "a U-turn" by NC on participating in the delimitation exercise. "The recommendations of the delimitation commission are totally unacceptable. They reek of bias. What a shock for those who believe in democracy," said Lone, whose party was until recently rumoured to have secretly arrived at an understanding with BJP. NC president Farooq, who had agreed to join the delimitation panel's meeting in New Delhi for the first time along with two MP colleagues, said he had "reservations" about the recommendations, which include quotas for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. His son and party vice-president Omar Abdullah tweeted, "It is deeply disappointing that the commission appears to have allowed the political agenda of BJP to dictate its recommendations rather than the data which should have been it’s only consideration. Contrary to the promised 'scientific approach', it's a political approach." Omar said the distribution of new seats between the Jammu and Kashmir divisions was "not justified by the data of the 2011 census". Anantnag MP Hasnain Masoodi, who is from NC, said later that the delimitation panel had asked the party to report its objections and recommendations on the draft prepared by December 31. He said NC had already informed the commission that there was a Supreme Court ruling on delimitation, based on which the draft should follow the 2011 census data. "Otherwise, the exercise would be unconstitutional," he said. PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti, who had initially refused to accept PM Narendra Modi's invitation to an all-party meet in Delhi, said her apprehensions about the delimitation exercise weren't misplaced. "They want to pitch people against each other by ignoring the population census & preposing 6 seats for one region & only one for Kashmir," she tweeted. Altaf Bukhari’s Apni Party, another regional outfit accused of being part of BJP's "B-team" in J&K, said the delimitation commission needed to revisit its recommendations. "The current proposals stand in total contrast to the process and guidelines mandated by the laws governing delimitation in the country. The district areas and their respective population numbers were to be taken into consideration as per the census of 2011, which for some unknown reason is missing from the said report," he said. "Not only the population criteria has been ignored, it seems that the commission has done away with the representational requirements of the existing administrative units."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/jk-parties-junk-delimitation-draft-over-seat-inequity/articleshow/88408343.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The youth allegedly jumped over a barrier into the sacred area of the the holiest shrine of Sikhs where the Guru Granth Sahib, the holiest book of Sikhism, is placed, and then grabbed a diamond-crusted sword and committed sacrilege. He was then beaten to death by sevadars. But he has not yet been identified. Whilst the sacrilege has sparked fury among Sikhs in Britain, British Hindus are angry with Preet Kaur Gill’s remarks. Gill, a British Sikh MP, initially tweeted on Saturday: "Hindu terrorist prevented from an act of violence at the Sikh holy shrine of Harmandir Sahib against Sikhs." She then deleted the tweet and replaced it with: "No place of worship or community should be targeted in this way. Awful scenes from Harmandir Sahib."

Awful scenes from Harmandir Sahib. 🙏 https://t.co/jYHs9ctOmm— Preet Kaur Gill MP (@PreetKGillMP) 1639851816000But the deleted tweet is being shared on social media and WhatsApp and has caught the attention of the Indian high commission. Vishwesh Negi, minister (press and information) at the Indian high commission, said: "The High Commission of India is constrained to unequivocally repudiate the public comment by a member of the British Parliament regarding a crime that occurred in India even before the Indian law enforcement authority could investigate or comment or declare their finding." He added that the Indian mission "is concerned at the effect that such commentary by a foreign MP may have on inter-communal harmony and peace in the British Indian community". Gill, shadow international development secretary, told TOI: "I have posted my tweets but if people want to focus on a deleted tweet clearly they have another agenda which is to incite hate and division." She said she was at the receiving end of trolling by rightwing Hindu groups and had reported the matter to the police. She pointed out that during the farmers’ protests, Sikhs, including her, had been branded as terrorists. On Monday Gill tweeted: "Beadbi incidents are unacceptable but the lynching of another person is also unacceptable and no one should take matters into their own hands. We need a full inquiry into these matters." Trupti Patel, president of the Hindu Forum of Britain, called on Gill to apologise and said she was going to report Gill to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. "The Hindu community is shocked to see this tweet by the chair of the APPG for British Sikhs. Without checking facts, she believed the gossip of others and tweeted spreading anti-Hindu fake news when she knows very well that Hindus only act in self-defence and never attack anyone." One diaspora group, Reach UK, accused Gill, in a tweet, of inciting religious hatred amongst Hindus and Sikhs in Britain.

Uzra Zeya, who is currently the State Department's Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, was named for the post by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with the announcement that "Specifically, she will promote substantive dialogue, without preconditions, between the China and the Dalai Lama, his representatives, or democratically elected Tibetan leaders in support of a negotiated agreement on Tibet." "She will promote respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans, including their freedom of religion or belief, and will support efforts to preserve their distinct historical, linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage," Blinken added. Zeya, a veteran US foreign service official, is US-born to parents who immigrated from Bihar. Although the office the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues is mandated by the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, she appears to have been entrusted with an expansive role amid the current tensions between Beijing and Washington. Blinken said Zeya will support US efforts to address the humanitarian needs of Tibetan refugees and diaspora communities, including those in the United States who, he said "have faced threats and intimidation instigated by the PRC," an unusually direct charge against Beijing and its actions on US soil. He said she also will "promote activities to protect the environment and sustainably manage the water and other natural resources of the Tibetan plateau," a role that will hearten India given its stakes in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/indian-origin-diplomat-appointed-us-special-coordinate-for-tibet/articleshow/88399379.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

The bill, opposition MPs said, was suddenly and hastily included in the supplementary list of business on Monday afternoon and was passed by a voice vote and the MPs alleged they were not given time to move any amendments even as they said the legislation was a violation of the Aadhaar Act. They have said the bill will be strongly opposed in the Rajya Sabha, which might take it up on Tuesday. Law minister Kiren Rijiju, however, said the bill was an important electoral reform and already had the backing of a parliamentary standing committee with all-party representation, which had asked the government to expedite linking of Aadhaar with electoral roles as it would lead to "purifying" electoral rolls of fraud and duplication. On Monday morning, all opposition parties had unanimously opposed the introduction of the bill and said it must be referred to a parliamentary standing committee. Congress MP Manish Tewari said the Aadhaar Act does not allow for linking of Aadhaar to voters list and is only intended to be used for the disbursal of financial benefits and such matters. Tewari also said it is beyond the legislative competence of the House to take up the bill. The government has held that the Aadhaar Act's aims that it can be used for welfare and good governance enable such an electoral reform. Times ViewImportant bills should not be rushed through in such a hurried and cavalier manner. Detailed discussions only help in fine tuning and improving them. Parliamentary proceedings are not a painful formality to be endured; they are the very essence of legislative procedureTMC, on the other hand, said the bill was being brought to tamper with the voter list and violate voter rights. BSP, RSP and other opposition parties strongly opposed the bill linking Aadhaar with voters’ list too. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said Aadhaar is only proof of residence and not proof of citizenship, and the move to link it to voters list will be violation of fundamental rights. Responding to the MPs’ concerns, Rijiju said the bill was in the interest of the state since it will rein in bogus voting. He also claimed that a standing committee had already examined and discussed the bill threadbare and BJP MP Nishikant Dubey responded to the politics of the bill, saying Bangladeshis and non-citizens must not be on the electoral roll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lok-sabha-passes-poll-reforms-bill-amid-opposition-protest-over-aadhaar-link/articleshow/88399427.cms||---

The HC’s remarks were in line with a Supreme Court order in May 2018 that an adult couple can live together without marriage. The HC made the observation while hearing a plea for protection by a couple in a live-in relationship from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district. Both are above 18 years — the age a woman attains adulthood and can get married. Men also lawfully become adults at 18, but cannot marry before 21 in accordance with the Hindu Marriage Act. The couple approached the HC for protection, alleging threats from their families over their relationship. Their counsel said they feared that their families might murder them. "It is the bounden duty of the state as per the constitutional obligations cast upon it to protect the life and liberty of every citizen. The mere fact that the petitioner No. 2 (man) was not of marriageable age would not deprive the petitioners of their fundamental right as envisaged in the Constitution, being citizens of India," Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill said.

The content in question, sources said, ranges from “blasphemous” to that which “blatantly impinges on India’s security and sovereignty”, and appears to have its origins in Pakistan and could have links to the Pakistan ISI. Among the portals that have been identified for being taken down include the ‘Naya Pakistan Group’, which runs over 15 channels on YouTube and has a following of more than a million subscribers. Sources said the videos and photographic content disseminated on its platforms includes claims such as: ‘PM Modi concedes defeat in Kashmir; Article 370 restored’, ‘Taliban Army leaves Kabul for India’, ‘Taiyyap Erdogan sends 35,000 mercenaries for Kashmir’, and the ‘Turk Army enters Ayodhya Ram Mandir to Take revenge’, all of which were seen by the ministry as a “concerted effort to sow unrest in India”. The orders for the immediate takedown of the offensive propagandist content were taken by invoking Section 16 of the IT Rules, the emergency clause which permits the I&B ministry to block content that is considered “necessary or expedient and justifiable to block”. The orders, sources said, were a “first step by the ministry” and were conveyed to YouTube’s India and Global offices. The social media platform is also learnt to have confirmed compliance and is likely to block the channels identified by the ministry within 24 to 48 hours. As per the IT Rules, the ministry’s interim orders to DoT and YouTube will also have to be ratified at a meeting of the Inter-Departmental Government Committee (IGC) within 48 hours. Since the notification of the IT Rules in February this year, this will also be the first time when the IGC will meet. Government sources said that while the ministry of electronics and information technology has been identifying and acting against individual used-generated content, this is the first time the I&B ministry has taken punitive action under the IT Rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ib-ministry-orders-20-youtube-channels-2-sites-blocked-/articleshow/88399869.cms||Swati Mathur

Though the plan is at a nascent stage, the Centre is considering objecting to the rulings on certain grounds while questioning the top court’s “Krishna Murthy judgement” of 2010, which laid down the “triple test” -- the root of the OBC quotas in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh being struck down. It seems that a legal review by a larger bench may be sought. However, experts believe that a legal review may not completely undo the situation caused by the rulings as the “Krishna Murthy judgement” appears to talk about separate lists of OBCs for political quotas as against state lists of OBCs based on social and economic backwardness for reservations in government employment and educational institutions. If the government has to strike at the core of the provocation and find a permanent settlement, then a constitutional amendment to the relevant sections dealt by the “Krishna Murthy judgement” may also be a possible route to remedy the situation. For instance, according to an expert, the government can identify the OBCs for political quota in Articles 243d and 243t as the state lists of OBCs are used for the purposes of job and education quota. This may obviate the need for determining backwards exclusively for political quota. The urgency appears to stem from the realisation that since no state has determined the OBCs afresh through setting up commissions, a legal challenge in court may scratch the backward quota in all other states. The “Krishna Murthy judgement” is particularly consequential as it rules economic and social backwardness need not mean political backwardness, with many reading it to have asked for a separate list of OBCs for political backwardness as distinct from the state-wise lists of backwards used for job and education quotas. However, it is to be seen how the situation evolves given that the issue is tricky after the Supreme Court in detail laid down the reasons for its refusal to accept OBC quota in local body elections in the absence of “triple test“, which includes states altering the OBC quota quantum to ensure that SC/ST/OBC reservation does not exceed 50%, and setting up commissions to collect contemporaneous data on OBCs and their political backwardness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-to-seek-review-of-scs-obc-quota-rulings/articleshow/88399990.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

He will replace Vikram Misri, who is scheduled to take over as deputy NSA very soon. Rawat served in the ministry of external affairs (MEA) headquarters as joint secretary in charge of East Asia, which includes China, before assuming charge as ambassador to Indonesia. He will now take the new charge at a very tough time — Chinese troops remain aggressively positioned in eastern Ladakh and other points on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there is very little bilateral interaction, and India is attempting to decouple from Chinese-controlled supply chains. Politically too, there has been almost no interaction between the two countries, and that could prove a problem going forward. In addition, China’s activities on its periphery and vis-à-vis India are both expansionist and aggressive. Misri will be adding much-needed China expertise to the National Security Council, where he will be on deputation. The MEA bureaucracy will be looking at a shuffle in the coming months as a number of top-level ambassadorial posts open up, from London to Tokyo, South Africa, Bhutan, Nepal, Canada etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pradeep-rawat-is-indias-next-ambassador-to-china/articleshow/88400240.cms||---

According to the terms of settlement, Devraj Singh and his sister Lalitya Kumari, the grandchildren of Maharani Gayatri Devi, will get back the luxurious heritage property, Jai Mahal Palace Hotel, from their step uncles while they forego their stake in Rambagh Palace in favour of their uncles. Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari, children of late Jagat Singh, Sawai Man Singh’s lone child from his marriage with Gayatri Devi, will get back their inherited properties after an amicable settlement within the Jaipur royal family. The family members of the Jaipur royalty, who had stakes in the personal properties of the Jaipur royals that included luxurious hotels and other immovable properties, decided to go for an amicable settlement out of the court following the Supreme Court’s direction to various stakeholders to explore that possibility. This followed years of legal battles being contested in various courts, including the National Company Law Tribunal. The SC had appointed retired apex court judge Justice Kurian Joseph as the mediator to work out a solution. According to the settlement, Vijit Singh and his brother Jai Singh, sons of late Prithviraj, Sawai Man Singh’s sons from his marriage with Maharani Kishore Kunwar, agreed to handover Jai Mahal Palace Hotel to Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari at a settlement arrived at on December 15. The majestic property is run as a hotel by the Tata Group under contract management. Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari would in turn forego their shares in the Rambagh Palace entirely in favour of Jai Singh and Vijit Singh. Following the settlement, Justice Joseph presented the amicable settlement to the apex court which passed an order to this effect that would be binding on all stakeholders.

The backlash by People’s Conference, one of the estranged constituents of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, was partly directed at what it termed “a U-turn” by NC on participating in the delimitation exercise. “The recommendations of the Delimitation Commission are totally unacceptable. They reek of bias. What a shock for those who believe in democracy,” said Lone, whose party was until recently rumoured to have secretly arrived at an understanding with BJP. NC president Farooq, who had agreed to join the delimitation panel’s meeting in New Delhi for the first time along with two MP colleagues, said he had “reservations” about the recommendations, which include quotas for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

The CM's statement came in the light of a debate over the border dispute and language row in Belagavi which has taken an unseemly turn in the past four days. Stating that Maharashtra's parties have been trying to rake up the border dispute time and again for political gains, he said Karnataka has accepted the Mahajan Commission report on the dispute. At the same time, he said, Karnataka was ready to protect the interests of Kannadigas living in the border areas of the neighbouring state. At the same time, he said, Karnataka was ready to protect the interests of Kannadigas living in the border areas of the neighboring state. Bommai cited an example of 40 gram panchayats in Jath tehsil of Sangli district which have passed a resolution that they be included in Karnataka after they expressed disappointment that Maharashtra was not able to provide them water for irrigation. "Now, this dry land area – where Kannadigas are in a majority -- has passed the resolution to be added into Karnataka. We (Karnataka) are ready to include all those areas, except for those regions where the Mahajan report states that the status quo shall be maintained," said Bommai. He said the state has always tried to maintain cordial ties with Maharashtra, but has been unsuccessful in the border area, which has remained tense over the years following the birth of Maharashtra Ekikarna Samiti. "The MES was once a strong power centre, but its influence has been waning in Belagavi and the border dispute appears to be its way of trying to regain influence. However, it has been rejected by the people of the district," he said. On demand for banning MES, the CM said he will secure legal opinion in this regard. The CM, during his statement on the border row, said he will speak to his counterpart in Maharashtra to resolve the law-and-order issue in that state as Kannadigas have been targeted over this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ready-to-include-kannada-areas-into-ktaka-bommai/articleshow/88400405.cms||---

The round valued Bizongo at $600 million. Founded in 2015 by IIT graduates Aniket Deb, Sachin Agrawal, and Ankit Tomar, Bizongo is headquartered in Mumbai and is backed by a slew of investors including Schroder Adveq, CDC Investment, Chiratae Ventures, IFC, and Accel. The company focuses on packaging, textiles, apparel and other contract manufacturing goods, and has a network of over 1,500 curated manufacturers across these categories. The company will use the fresh funds to ramp up its business and tech teams to develop a suite of digital services for both sides of the marketplace. It will also invest in growing its vendor partnerships and transform over 100 factories into "cloud factories." A cloud factory is a SaaS-based solution that will enable manufacturers to provide their customers with real-time visibility, control, and intelligence across the entire supply chain. It recently unveiled an IoT-powered cloud factory for made-to-order goods. Sachin Agrawal, co-founder at Bizongo, said, “There is a lot of untapped potential in the way Indian businesses can leverage technology to grow and thrive. Bizongo offers solutions across digital vendor management, supply chain automation and supply chain financing to its enterprise customers. We are now fully geared to sustainably grow the business by at least 300% year-on-year from here on.” John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, said the market for customised goods is the fastest-growing segment in B2B e-commerce. "At a size of $500 billion, this market is vast yet highly fragmented and unorganised. We found Bizongo very unique in the way they have been building a transaction-led platform with a tech-first vs a trade-first mindset. The full-stack approach with an asset-light operating model makes Bizongo stand out as a market leader in this segment.” Bizongo has grown its topline eightfold from its pre-pandemic scale, clocking $250 million in transactions in November. The company said it is now cash flow positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/b2b-e-comm-platform-bizongo-raises-110mn-from-tiger-others/articleshow/88400406.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

Within five months of its launch, the 10-minute grocery delivery app Zepto has raised $100 million in Series C funding led by Y Combinator. New and existing investors also participated in the round. The funding doubles Zepto’s valuation to $570 million. The round comes 45 days after Zepto raised $60 million. Over the past two months, it has expanded beyond Mumbai, by launching in Bengaluru, Delhi, Gurgaon, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. Kolkata will follow soon. 19-year-olds Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra left computer science degrees at Stanford University to build Zepto earlier this year. Q-commerce has taken off in Europe, and includes players like UK-based Dija, Germany's Gorillas and Flink, and France's Cajoo. Berlin-based Flink raised $750 million led by DoorDash recently. Palicha said the funding would be used to enter other cities and expand its team from the current 400 people in roles including operations, supply chain, marketing, finance, product, engineering, and human resources. The company has hired senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Pepperfry, and Pharmeasy. “About 80% of our orders are delivered in under 10 minutes. Our median delivery time is 8 minutes and 24 seconds. Only 10% of our orders are about 12 minutes. The grocery universe in India is 10,000 SKUs (stock keeping units) and 93% of the demand is consolidated in 1,800 SKUs,” he said. Zepto has created over 100 dark stores from which supplies are made. It packs and dispatches goods in under 60 seconds. Each dark store has the capacity to undertake 2,500 orders daily. Vohra said their month-on-month buyer retention is 65% with an 88-point net promoter score (NPS). "This data has given us the confidence to expand the 10-minute model across the country,” he said. Anu Hariharan of Y Combinator said, “Since Aadit and Kaivalya went through Y Combinator, we have observed that they're exceptional founders who bring relentless focus and "DoorDash-like" execution to the quick commerce model. They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021, and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/q-commerce-co-zepto-raises-100mn-from-y-combinator-others/articleshow/88400407.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

It is given to 20 young changemakers from across the globe who are working towards a sustainable environment. Sia, 15, was selected for Sole Warriors, an initiative she started in 2019. Along with an army of volunteers, she has collected, refurbished and distributed more than 23,000 pieces of footwear to the underprivileged not just in Bengaluru, but also in remote villages of Jharkhand and even in Liberia, West Africa. Speaking about the December 9 award ceremony, Sia told TOI it was held in Princess Diana’s childhood home of Althorp Estate in Northamptonshire, England. “Lord and Lady Spencer (Princess Diana’s brother and wife) presented us with the award,” she said. Sia, a Koramangala resident and class 10 student of Neev Academy, said she began the initiative after seeing children with hard and cracked feet on the street because they had no footwear. “I did some research and found that millions of people contract diseases by walking barefoot, while 350 million pieces of footwear are discarded by privileged households and some are just stashed in cupboards unused,” she said. She added that her team of volunteers — from Indian Plogger’s Army group and Robin Hood Army — helped her balance studies and managing Sole Warriors. She hopes more people can join her cause. “If you are interested in starting shoe-collection drives across India, please reach out to me through Instagram at @sia_godika,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/city-teen-wins-award-for-footwear-initiative/articleshow/88400410.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Transit hub scrapped, only Metro station to come up at Challaghatta||BENGALURU: Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd has decided to scrap the proposed inter-modal transit hub (IMTH) at Challaghatta, across NICE Road and along Mysuru Road. IMTHs are common in foreign cities to help passengers shift from one mode of transport to another without hassle. BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “We decided to scrap the IMTH proposed at Challaghatta and only a station-cum-depot will come up there. Earlier, the plan was to have an elevated depot at Challaghatta and a bus depot for KSRTC and BMTC buses below. But we have now decided to construct the depot at the ground level. If it is elevated, it’d be difficult for buses to manoeuvre because of the number of pillars. Going at-grade has also helped us reduce the project cost from Rs 900 crore to Rs 500 crore.” Challaghatta station (Kengeri-Challaghatta) will be ready by September 2022. “The structural work has been completed and architectural work is pending. But the depot will be completed later. There is no immediate requirement as it is needed only after the other phase 2 corridors are operational.” The earlier deadline for the extension from Kengeri Metro station to Challaghatta (2km) was March 2022. Soma Enterprises Ltd received the contract in 2016 for the Challaghatta section and depot and it was supposed to be completed in 27 months, but the firm is said to be going through a financial crisis that has delayed the work. Parwez said the decision to scrap IMTH was taken after consulting with other government agencies such as Directorate of Urban Land Transport. “In Kengeri, BMRCL is planning to construct a foot overbridge (FOB). BMTC and KSRTC buses are also terminating there and there is a railway station as well. There is no need for an IMTH every 2-3km,” he said. The earlier plan was to terminate intercity buses from the likes of Bidadi, Ramanagara, Channapatna, Mandya and Mysuru at Challaghatta IMTH. Proposals on paper In 2009, the government proposed IMTHs at Yelahanka, Byappanahalli, Yeshwantpur, Peenya and near the trumpet intersection. In the 2019-20 budget, the government announced a new plan to establish such hubs in six places: Hebbal, Byappanahalli, KR Puram, Challaghatta, Peenya, and Kadugodi. However, none has seen the light of the day. In fact, Bengaluru traffic police had proposed to restrict Mysuru-bound intercity private buses at Kengeri, Tumakuru buses at Peenya, Kolar ones at KR Puram and those from Tamil Nadu at Parappana Agrahara to reduce traffic congestion in the city. The government had also decided to connect bus terminuses in Yeshwantpur, Banashankari, Vijayanagar and Peenya with Metro or railway stations. All these proposals have remained on paper. Parwez said tenders will soon be finalised for FOBs at Yeshwantpur, Dasarahalli, Nagasandra, Mailasandra, Jnanabharathi, and Chikkabidarakallu (Jindal) at an estimated cost of Rs 12 crore. “We had to float a fresh tender as the earlier contractor pulled out after steel prices increased. We will also provide FOBs at places such as KR Puram and Cantonment for better multi-modal integration.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/transit-hub-scrapped-only-metro-station-to-come-up-at-challaghatta/articleshow/88400411.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

People reach out to him on Instagram (@lakshitkankariya) with their problems and he connects them with either mental health experts or shares ways to deal with them. He has 12.5k followers. Lakshit is part of the growing tribe of youngsters and children who are now seeking support on time. Instead of bottling up their trauma, youngsters believe in expressing their troubles and are seeking guidance, the grade 12 student at Christ College said. “Youngsters share their stories on social media platforms, which has helped normalise and inspire others to talk about their trauma without shame,” he added. According to him, there’s a change in parents’ mindset. “My parents have been supportive which has helped me express myself without any hurdle,” the Chamarajpet resident said. Afsheen J, a grade 10 student, said: “My parents used to say I have no reason to be anxious. But now they have understood that mental health is just like physical health, and it needs to be taken seriously,” she said, adding that creating memes and jokes around these issues will help ease conversations around it. Dhatri, a degree student, said change has been possible for them because of exposure and awareness through popular series and social media platforms. Parents too are educating themselves. Karthika Prakash, a homemaker, said her 18-year-old daughter has helped her understand the difference between sadness and clinical depression. Choosing guidance over social stigmaDr A Jagadish, Consultant Psychiatrist at Abhaya hospital says the new generation is not scared to seek help and children as young as 12 are now not afraid to tell their parents that they need help and must see a doctor. “Recently, two 12-year-old boys came to me with their parents. One of them was unable to overcome his OCD symptoms and asked his father to bring him to me. Now, these youngsters would rather seek help than giving in to the social stigma," he says. Dr Jagadish adds that most of the youngsters reach out to him with issues like anxiety, depression, and even OCD. “Some parents are hesitant but not the children,” he says adding that social media platforms and media have played a role in raising awareness. Dr Shubha Madhusudhan, Clinical Psychologist, Manasvi Counselling Centre in Banashankari say teenagers and young adults are reaching out to her with much ease to address their issues now. Schools offer helping handSridhar G, Founder, Deeksha said that about 47% of students have come forward to seek help either directly or indirectly through anonymous emails/calls and they received support through their ‘OpenDoor’ initiatives and 14/7 wellness helplines. Ruth Sneha Inbasekeran, Teacher at Ekya School Byrathi said: “We have an in-house counsellor with whom students can connect because as an institution we believe that mental health needs more sunshine, more candour and unashamed conversations.” While Aloysius D'mello, Principal, Greenwood High International School says students in class 10 to 12 share their anxieties around the exams and other issues they face with their counsellors without any hesitation now, Shweta Sastri, Managing Director, Canadian International School, Bangalore said that a team works together to meet the emotional needs of their students through individual or small group sessions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/youngsters-show-the-way-in-opening-up-on-mental-health-issues/articleshow/88400412.cms||Farheen Hussain

Then roads were re-laid and footpaths neatly done! And in December 2021, this is what we get to see. Horrible. Why?? #ITPL Main Road,” read a tweet which went viral on social media. BMRCL officials said they had awarded a contract to L&T for laying 66KV UG cables from KPTCL’s EPIP and Hoodi substations to Namma Metro’s receiving substation at Kadugodi (Whitefield) depot.“The contractor started cable-laying works from Kadugodi depot area through open-trench and horizontal directional drilling method as per BBMP’s approval and after getting necessary permission from traffic police. After the work is completed, road restoration works will be done by L&T as per MORTH specification,” said an official.Many netizens criticised the development. Dhanush kumar tweeted: “The roads are being dug up by BMRCL for laying electric cables from an electric substation to facilitate electric supply for running trains. I guess they had forgotten trains require electricity to run before laying roads.”“Someone needs to get fired for this, wasting public money is a criminal offence. all corruption, you make road i will get another tender to break it, then one more to break it, what a waste @CMofKarnataka pls look into this scandal (sic),” read the post on a Twitter handle named @adhura_sach.Akash Ragavan, another Twitter user, posted: “Lack of coordination between various departments causes this kind of incident....

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BH series no. plates for government staff vehicles||BENGALURU: The transport department has finally begun issuing Bharat (BH) series registration number plates for new vehicles in the city. On August 26, the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MORTH) issued a notification on BH series, which came into effect on September 15. However, the state transport department issued a notification only on November 30, and many prospective vehicle owners complained there was a delay even after this notification. According to sources, the first BH series registration holder in Karnataka is Vijay Kumar Jadhav, who registered his car at KR Puram RTO. N Shivakumar, transport commissioner, told TOI: “We have issued BH registration for three vehicles, including two at KR Puram RTO, so far.” However, BH series registration is not being issued to private vehicles for now. “We are issuing to Union government employees, All-India Services officers (IAS, IPS, IFS), and senior bank officials. Most private employees are on contract basis, so they may switch jobs. In Delhi also, they are not issuing BH series registration to private contract employees.” Waseem Memon of Drive Without Borders, an NGO campaigning for ‘one nation, one tax’ since 2014, said: “It’s a positive step. Karnataka took time, but finally it was implemented. But the government cannot discriminate against citizens on the basis of employment or income. It’s a violation of their fundamental rights. BH series registration should be open for everyone.” BH series is mainly to facilitate seamless transfer of vehicles from one state to another. It is also considered the preliminary step towards the Centre’s ‘one nation, one motor vehicle tax’ plan. According to Motor Vehicle Rules, a vehicle is not permitted to ply with another state registration number beyond 11 months from date of migration. Otherwise, the owner will have to re-register it in the new state, which is a cumbersome process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bh-series-no-plates-for-govt-staff-vehicles/articleshow/88400416.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Wall across road forces locals to take 1km detour at Kasavanahalli||BENGALURU: A four-foot-tall wall across a mud road, which was once the lifeline of Mudaliar Layout, off Kasavanahalli, Bellandur ward, has been standing for three years, despite efforts by locals to get it razed. Kasavanahalli, 5th Cross, as the road is called, stretched up to 100 metres, linked KPCL Layout and Kasavanahalli and passed through Mudaliar Layout. For almost a decade it not only shortened the distance between KPCL Layout and Kasavanahalli, but was also the main link to the outside world for residents of Mudaliar Layout. “For us, this was the unofficial main road and we used it while commuting to oversee the construction of our house,” said Rajesh R, a resident of Mudaliar Layout. This stretch helped residents avoid traffic snarls on Kasavanahalli Main Road. “Since this was a motorable road, school buses would easily use it to drop off our children,” said Priya L, a resident of Kasavanahalli. However, things changed mysteriously three years ago, when a wall sprang up across the road, forcing Mudaliar Layout residents to take a circuitous route to reach their homes, which meant commuting a kilometre extra. “School buses are hesitant to take the roundabout route and prefer dropping kids far away from their homes; we need to rush to pick them up,” said a parent. Thanks to the wall, the road has fallen into disuse and the place is used for open defecation by people from a nearby slum. “We are forced to keep our windows closed,” said another resident of Mudaliar Layout. Locals say they have approached BBMP officials several times, requesting that the wall be pulled down, but their pleas have fallen on deaf years. Documents accessed by TOI revealed that a work order for improving the road was issued in 2017. A similar order was issued in 2019, but till date there has been no change on the ground. Incidentally, BBMP officials from Bellandur ward refuse to even acknowledge the presence of the wall. “We are not aware of anything like that. We will look into it and take necessary action, if there is a violation,” said a senior official from the road infrastructure division. “Kasavanahalli 5th Cross has been encroached by powerful people. If the encroachment is not cleared, we will hold a protest and take out a march to the local MLA’s office soon,” said Mahadevapura Aam Aadmi Party president Ashok Mruthyunjaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/wall-across-road-forces-locals-to-take-1km-detour-at-kasavanahalli/articleshow/88400417.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Dalit employee forced to clean manhole at hospital; three booked||BENGALURU: Three staffers of Chinmaya Mission Hospital (CMH) in Indiranagar have been booked for coercing one of its housekeeping staffers to manually unclog sewers on their premises. Daivadeenam, 53, belongs to the Mala caste, a Dalit community, and has been working as a permanent employee of the hospital for the past 21 years. He had refused to lower himself into the manhole when asked to do so by his supervisors at the housekeeping department, sources said. Upon his refusal, he was allegedly threatened with his job by top officials and forced to complete the task. The hospital’s housekeeping supervisors, Raja D and Gilbert, and the administrator have been booked under Section 3(1)(j) of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act-1989 and Sections 7, 8, and 9 of the Prohibition of Manual Scavenging and Rehabilitation Act-2013. On December 15, a complaint was filed on behalf of Daivadeenam by social workers from Karnataka Samata Sainik Dal and Madhusudhana KN, assistant director at the state’s social welfare department. The accused were named in the FIR and ACP Kumar of Halasuru station is investigating the case. Daivadeenam stated in his complaint that when he refused to carry out the physically dangerous job, the management allegedly said, “it was his duty to perform manual scavenging”. He had reportedly undertaken such operations in the past and was once spotted by a government official and let off with a warning. Kamala, a social worker with Samata Sainik Dal, said: “Daivadeenam approached us on December 9, a week after doing the job. He had initially refused the work citing his age and health problems. At this age, he could not risk his health by getting into a manhole and many lives have been lost doing this kind of work, but he was threatened that he would be fired from his position.” Other housekeeping staff confirmed Daivadeenam was always assigned the duty of cleaning toilets and clearing garbage in the hospital. Dhananjay, former medical technician and joint secretary at CMH Employees Association, said the hospital lacked transparency in its operations. “He suffered breathing problems after he was compelled to perform manual scavenging and sought treatment at CMH. But we heard his request for medical attention was declined,” he added. TOI tried to meet Dr Unchil Sudhir, medical director, and Gopal B Hosur, chief executive officer, at the hospital but they were unavailable for comments. The hospital administration directed the TOI reporter to resident medical officer Dakshinamurthy, who redirected the responsibility to human resource head Shankar Ganesh. The HR head said he was in a meeting and did not meet the reporter . Several calls to the HR head, the CEO, and the medical director on the numbers provided by the hospital too went unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dalit-employee-forced-to-clean-manhole-at-hospital-3-booked/articleshow/88400418.cms||Sanika Athavale

---||Bengaluru||Pankaj Advani retains billiards title||BENGALURU: After the initial skirmish, Pankaj Advani got into the groove to floor his friend and PSPB teammate Dhruv Sitwala 5-2 and retain his title in the senior men’s National billiards championships in Bhopal on Monday. The 36-year-old Bengalurean took a little longer than Sitwala to get adjusted to the table. By which time, his rival had taken a 2-1 lead and was up by over 100 points after a 101-break in the fourth game of the best-of-nine game finale. TURNING POINTBut an error at that juncture gave Advani an opportunity to bounce back. And get back the 24-time World billiards and snooker champion did in splendid fashion. A brilliant 127 break under pressure helped him draw level at 2-2. With his confidence, rhythm and range back, Advani looked a different player altogether. He came up with back-to-back 150 breaks to take a vice-like grip over the proceedings, running up a 4-2 lead. Southpaw Sitwala made a valiant effort to get back into the contest with a run of 134. However, the Mumbai cueist was unlucky to lose position and allow Advani back on the table. Advani then compiled a fluent unfinished 148 to take the game and the match with it. This was Advani’s 11th senior billiards title and 35th National title overall. “It feels great because we have not had any billiards at all in the last two years, largely due to the pandemic. To come back and win the National billiards championships, which is highly competitive, is a great feeling,” said Advani. “To win the billiards title, especially after not living up to my expectation in snooker, is even sweeter this time,” he added. Results: Final: Pankaj Advani (PSPB) bt Dhruv Sitwala (PSPB) 5-2 (53-152, 150-4, 43-151 (84), 151 (127) -101 (101), 150 (150) -0, 150 (150) -35, 151 (148) -141).Third-place playoff: Brijesh Damani (PSPB) bt B Bhaskar (Kar) 3-1 (89-150, 151-98, 152-6, 151 (110) -101).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/advani-retains-billiards-title/articleshow/88400422.cms||---

---||Chennai||‘Accept those who return with regret’||Chennai: Triggering a fresh round of debate, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam on Monday said those who returned after regretting their wrongdoings should be “accepted,” presumably hinting at the reinduction of ousted leader V K Sasikala. Shortly after Panneerselvam’s cryptic statement, former minister D Jayakumar clarified that Sasikala would not be forgiven. Panneerselvam, who was elected as coordinator of the party by the “primary members” in the recently-held organisational election, made the statement during the party’s Christmas celebrations in Chetpet in Chennai. Party joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami and senior leaders were present on the dais when OPS spoke. “I saw this in a newspaper clipping today and thought of using the opportunity at this Christmas event to convey the message,” Panneerselvam said, narrating the parable of the prodigal son, one of the famous teachings of Jesus Christ. The parable was about a forgiving father, who welcomed his second son with a celebration, when he returned after squandering his inherited wealth. While Palaniswami and his supporters were firm that neither Sasikala nor her clan should be re-inducted into AIADMK, party leaders say that OPS, who belongs to the same mukkulathor community as the ousted leader, was keen to take her back given their caste affinity. Incidentally, OPS and EPS will continue to hold the post for five years as per a new party bylaw, which has been challenged by Sasikala in a city civil court. “The functionaries and cadres of the AIADMK remain workers of the public. We don’t discriminate against people based on caste and religion,” OPS said, amid allegations of AIADMK leaning towards caste-based politics. Soon after OPS made the statement, Jayakumar clarified that the former CM did not mean Sasikala. “Those who feel remorse for their wrongdoings are certainly forgiven. It is for the common man. But there is no such thing as forgiveness for Sasikala,” the former minister said. The party has preferred complaints against her for using the party flag, name and the post of general secretary. Jayakumar said the coordinator, joint coordinator, headquarters office-bearers, district functionaries and all office-bearers had decided that the party would not have anything to do with Sasikala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/accept-those-who-return-with-regret/articleshow/88400424.cms||Julie Mariappan

Arappor Iyakkam has written to the chief minister and the chief secretary, demanding that an inquiry be conducted and action initiated against senior officials of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) who approved the payment when the contractor has built a sub-standard facility. In the complaint, Arappor Iyakkam members also pointed out that a panel of experts from the Centre for Urbanization, Buildings & Environment (CUBE), a body jointly raised by IIT Madras and the state government, had found major lapses in the construction of KP Park tenements at Pulianthope comprising four blocks of multi-storeyed buildings. The lapses include use of M-sand for plastering.

There is a slight nip in the air late at night and early in the morning. IMD has forecast that chilly weather will continue at least for the next two days with minimum temperatures a degree or two below normal, while private forecasters and bloggers say the conditions may last till the weekend. Monday was misty and cloudy, with the mercury dipping by 0.2 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam that recorded 21.7 degrees C and 21 degrees C. This, say meteorologists, is due to cold and dry winds blowing from the north in the upper atmosphere and the absence of easterlies in the lower level. IMD has forecast temperatures will be a maximum of 29 degrees C and a minimum 20 degrees C with the sky partly cloudy in the morning and clear thereafter. “Minimum temperature may be 2-3 degrees below normal over the Western Ghats and interior districts while the coastal areas may record a dip in temperatures by 1-2 degrees,” an official said. Experts say cold dry winds from the north are dense and are sinking, while the easterlies are getting restricted and are unable to move on to land due to the presence of a system over south Andaman Sea. The absence of easterlies has left particles hanging in the air causing the hazy weather. “Parts of Rajasthan, MP and Telangana have been experiencing cold wave conditions and winds from these regions are moving over TN. This is likely to last at least for the next 48 hours as wind directions may change with a western disturbance likely to obstruct the northerly winds,” said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather. Blogger Pradeep John said, “Our monsoon is over. This chilly weather may last till December 26.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cold-north-winds-bring-fleeting-winter-to-city/articleshow/88400431.cms||---

There is no other reason but politics for the governor not to give assent to the Bill, Ramadoss alleged.  “The Bill was passed on September 13 for medical admission on the basis of marks obtained by students in class 12 board examinations. All parties except BJP had endorsed the Bill. There has been no progress barring passage of the Bill,” Ramadoss said. He said a Bill to cancel the entrance examination for medical and engineering admission was passed in December 2006 and the entire process, including assent for the Bill, was given in 86 days, which was the correct duration. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/pmk-seeks-clarification-on-neet-bill-status-from-dmk/articleshow/88400432.cms||---

The plea was moved by M Sameeha Barvin, a woman athlete with 90% hearing disability. Though she became eligible for World Deaf Athletics Championship held in Poland, she was not selected on the ground that she was the only woman athlete in the team. The court said, “This is a case of discrimination based on the gender as well as the disability, due to which, the petitioner has faced several difficulties and barriers to participate in the international event.”The state and central governments, being the competent authorities to provide and ensure support and safety to the sports women with disabilities, so as to inspire their confidence freely and take part actively in the events at all levels, have failed to do the same in an appropriate manner, Justice Mahadevan said.The court then passed 12 directions , including a policy to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination against the women athletes with disabilities, on one or more grounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/give-disabled-women-athletes-parity-with-male-counterparts-hc/articleshow/88400434.cms||---

The hiring by startups at the IIT Madras campus has almost doubled in 2021 compared to 2019. During phase I of placement season, 63 startups have offered 190 job offers which is the highest number of offers to come from startups in the premier campus in the city. In 2019, the institute received 97 offers from 53 startups.

Startups offering solutions in engineering and technology, information technology, data analytics, fintech and artificial intelligence, management (research and development) have been hiring for roles such as data analyst, data scientist, software development engineer, product analyst and product designer. C S Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement) said, "IIT Madras students receive good exposure to the entrepreneurship and startup ecosystem through interactions with the Institute Entrepreneurship Cell, the IIT Madras Incubation Cell and the IIT Madras Research Park. Hence, they are able to make well-informed decisions in this regard.” Vikash Upadhyay, who accepted an offer from a medical equipment manufacturing startup, said these jobs come with unique challenges and he is looking forward to them. Noccarc, a startup that manufactures ventilators and other medical equipment, made three offers to IIT-M students and all three students accepted their offers. "The healthcare sector has been booming post-pandemic. We are looking to expand the strength of our team from 130 to 270 by the end of 2022. We hired two mechanical engineering students and one business analyst from IIT Madras this year," said Minal Rani, manager (talent acquisition), Noccarc that was launched by the alumni of IIT Kanpur. S P Balamurugan, the co-founder of Ed-tech startup GUVI, said, "The startups which offer technology solutions have received more funding post-pandemic. The funding offered a lot of leverage in terms of scaling up the product and reaching out to more people." The firm has added 65 more personnel to its work strength. Balamurugan says the user base has also increased from 3 lakh people to 13 lakh people in the past one and half years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/startup-offers-at-iit-m-jump-by-100/articleshow/88400438.cms||A Ragu Raman

This will be under two different projects – the KfW-funded Kovalam basin and the World Bank-funded missing link storm water drain project in the core city. Both projects were and sanctioned last year but were reworked after issues of faulty design were raised and a National Green Tribunal case came up.The civic body will build 40km at a cost of 150crore in the Kovalam basin at Perungudi, Nanganallur, Velachery and Madipakkam, in areas inundated during the recent floods. The work has been tendered. For the 45 km to be built at a cost of 120 crore with World Bank funding, work orders have been issued. “Review meetings were held by municipal administration minister K N Nehru who wanted drains in Hindu Colony, P V Nagar, Kannan Colony, Nehru Colony, Nanganallur, Srinivasa Nagar, Ram Nagar,Sadhasivam Nagar and Gubendiran Nagar in Alandur and Perungudi. These areas in the Kovalam basin lacked drains, which was one of the major reasons for flooding. We redesigned the drain network to make these areas flood ready before the next monsoon,” said a senior corporation official. The World Bank-funded project entails construction of 12km of missing links and demolition and reconstruction of 33km of drains in Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar, Teynampet, Anna Nagar, Adyar and Kodambakkam.  Jayaram Venkatesan of Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption NGO, said the details of the projects should be released so that residents can check if their streets require such drains and monitor implementation. Chilambarasan, member of Srinivasa Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said many streets had been excluded. “If they again construct drains without proper network continuity, it would again result in a mess,” he said.

Ravi, who shared the dais with Stalin for the 34th convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University,also congraduated Tamil Nadu for containing the effect of pandemic.He also praised the state-run medical university for identifying a vaccine candidate for Sars Cov 2. During his convocation address, he asked young graduates to hold on to five essential things — not to commercialise medical profession, develop the art of listening to improve diagnosis and treatment outcomes, integrate traditional and modern medicine using evidence-based research, continue learning and working hard and stay healthy.Earlier, Stalin in his convocation address urged medical graduates, including those from urban areas, to serve in the rural areas of the state. You should be recognised as people’s doctors, he told young medical graduates seated at the Silver Jubilee Auditorium on the university campus. “When you start working you know that regardless of sex, caste or any other factors, what you will see in front of you is life. You are the nation’s children,” he said asking them to be prepared to face challenges ahead.The state he said will reopen 11 new medical colleges this academic year, he said. The department has launched a slew of programmes such as door-to-door delivery of medicine, insurance for accident victims, clinic for internet addiction and emergency and rehab centre for people with mental illness.Health minister Ma Subramanian said at least one in every eight doctors in the country was from Tamil Nadu. “Our best doctors did not join medicine after clearing NEET,” he said. This is the last batch of students from the university, who joined the undergraduate medical programme without clearing medicine. The state’s bill against using NEET as sole criteria for admission is now awaiting governor’s nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/perfect-co-coordination-between-health-services-infra-in-tn-guv/articleshow/88400446.cms||---

But after the launch of Makkalai Thedi Maruthuvam (MTM) that delivers essential healthcare at doorstep, she has not only saved cost on medicine but also does not have to go out to buy medicine. A woman health volunteer visits her house once in two months and gives free medicine for two months. In Chennai, a total of 60,831 people have received medicine for diabetes and hypertension at their doorsteps under the scheme since its inception in August. Officials said the majority of the patients were aged above 45. Officials with the National Health Mission said one women's health volunteer is appointed per 5000 population and they visit the houses with a glucometer and electronic BP monitor . “Some are diagnosed for the first time and some have been already diagnosed,” the official said. According to the data shared by the NHM to TOI, among the total people covered under the scheme, 57% (35,055) diabetes and hypertension patients are from the five central Chennai zones, -- Thiruvika Nagar, Ambattur, Anna Nagar, Teynampet, and Kodambakam. The patients covered include those having only diabetes and hypertension, and those with both the diseases. Officials said tablets are being distributed door-to-door and the health records of the people are also collected. “560 women health volunteers are deputed for this and 426 are on duty. The remaining vacancies will be filled,” said NHM officials. Dr V Mohan, chairman of Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre, said it is a very good attempt but regular follow-ups must be done to keep the diseases under control. “ABC mantra - Hemoglobin A1C test helps to diagnose sugar levels. B is for blood pressure check and C for cholesterol. If all three are under check, diabetes can be controlled,” he said. Dr Mohan said according to earlier studies, the prevalence of diabetes in the city was around 25% of the population across all socio-economic statuses.  Dr S Krishnamoorthy, senior consultant, general physicians & diabetologist at Apollo Hospitals, said as soon as diabetes and hypertension are diagnosed, there is ample time to curtail its progression through lifestyle modification in the early stages. “Diet, exercise, and controlling smoking and alcohol consumption is the basis to curtail the two NDCs at the early stage. People with hypertension can consume a lot more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains,” he said, adding that food rich in potassium such as banana, fruits, tomato, and black beans too must be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/60k-got-drugs-for-diabetes-bp-at-doorsteps-since-august/articleshow/88400449.cms||Omjasvin M D

The body of Premkumar of Otteri was found buried at Eachangadu village in Tiruvallur on Sunday after villagers alerted police on spotting hair and bloodied teeth at a deserted location. Police said investigations led them to the two girls, who had paid Premkumar 50,000 each over the last year after he threatened to publish their photos online. He befriended them on Instagram and neither was initially aware they were involved with the same man. Unable to handle the blackmailer’s pressure, the girls asked Ashok, another youth they had befriended recently on Instagram, to help them snatch Premkumar’s phone and delete the photos. Police said Ashok and three of his friends from Red Hills used the girls to lure Premkumar to Sholavaram toll plaza on Friday morning and kidnapped him. Later that night, Ashok and another friend took Premkumar to Eechangadu where they allegedly murdered and buried him. “We have launched a hunt for Ashok. Only after we nab him will we know what exactly happened,” said an investigating officer. Premkumar’s body was handed over to his family on Monday after autopsy at Government Stanley Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-uses-pvt-pics-to-blackmail-schoolgirls-they-get-him-killed/articleshow/88400452.cms||---

An MHA official however claimed that Mishra opted out as some important work had come up, leaving him no choice but to request his fellow MoS in the home ministry, Nisith Pramanik, to step in. An SSB official told TOI that they were told on Sunday evening that Pramanik would be attending the Raising Day event. Opposition protests have rocked Parliament against continuation of Mishra in the council of ministers after his son Ashish Mishra was arrested on charges of allegedly mowing down four protesting farmers and a journalist in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3. A court in Uttar Pradesh last week added stringent charges to the police complaints against Ashish and 12 other accused. This came after a special investigation team observed that the Lakhimpur Kheri violence was a “deliberate, pre-planned conspiracy”. Ever since, the opposition's demand for his resignation to enable an impartial probe, had grown shriller, and even led to the stalling of parliamentary proceedings. Pramanik, in his address at the SSB function on Monday, congratulated the force and force personnel for their operational achievements in the field of seizures and apprehensions and also praised the commendable work being done by the force in the field of human trafficking and civic action programme being carried out by the force in the border areas. He also praised the role of SSB in anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and in anti-terrorist operations in Jammu and Kashmir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/under-pressure-from-oppn-to-resign-union-min-skips-ssb-raising-day-function-sparks-speculation/articleshow/88400464.cms||---

When Jaya Bachchan rose to speak on the bill, there were heated exchanges between her and the treasury benches, forcing Bhubaneswar Kalita who was in the Chair to adjourn the House till 5pm. She called out the Chair for not listening to the opposition side as 12 members continue to remain outside. “We want justice. Don’t expect justice from them (pointing at the ruling party) but can we expect justice from you,” she said. Amid the din, she alleged that “personal” remarks were made against her and sought protection from the chair. “I expect you to take action on the comment made on me and my career ... How can they make personal remarks in the House... Aap logon kay buraey din aayengay (Your bad days will come), I curse you,” she said. Jaya’s remarks came on a day her daughter-law and actor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was questioned by ED in connection with disclosures in the Panama Papers case. Objecting to her remarks, Rakesh Sinha (BJP) said she was casting aspersions on the Cair. “Opposition is casting apersions on the Chair. They are degrading the House. This is not the custom of the House. Any member can sit on the Chair,” Sinha said. Moving the bill in the House, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it replaces the ordinance which was promulgated in September. The House passed the bill by a voice vote. The House was adjourned thrice till 5pm and later several opposition members, including those of Congress and RJD, walked out after the Chair refused to allow them to speak on their demand of seeking the sacking of Union minister Ajay Mishra Teni, whose son is an accused in the killings of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, Uttar Pradesh. The Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Bill-2021 was passed by Lok Sabha on December 13. Congress MP Digvijay Singh expressed regret that it has taken the government six years to correct the mistake in the bill. Taking the protest further and referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, he alleged that an “accused” is sitting inside while those who have “done no wrong” are left outside. In the morning session, the stalemate over the suspension of 12 members continued with Chairman Venkaih Naidu expressing disappointment for the lack of progress in resolving the issue. The meeting that was to take place between the government and opposition leaders to resolve the issue didn’t happen because the latter did not turn up, sources said.

The categories of markets will differ from each station depending on the location. The initiative follows attempts by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) in the past to commercially exploit the unoccupied space at MRTS stations failed to take off. Urban planners, however, caution that the move should not lead to the stations turning into parking hotspots for private vehicles. Plans to turn Chintadripet MRTS station, which housed parcel offices and was used for parking omnibuses till a decade ago, into a complex housing standalone shops including restaurants with an aim to decongest traffic on Arunachalam Street are being explored. At the southern end, the MRTS station at Velachery is likely to have upscale shops. Currently, most of the space inside MRTS stations remains vacant with the Velachery station alone running a food court. CMDA, which has two-third stakes in revenue generated from MRTS stations, will discuss with Southern Railway over the new proposal. A consultant would be engaged to study it. CMDA officials said the plan was to provide an opportunity for shops in the neighbourhood to utilise space at MRTS stations such as Chintadripet so that adjoining roads can be decongested. “The concept is to generate revenue by catering to the immediate neighbourhood. At the same time, we will discuss with Southern Railway to ensure it does not cause any hardships to regular commuters and ways to facilitate access to shoppers,” an official said.Advait Jani, senior manager (sustainable cities and transport) with WRI India, said the proposed facilities at MRTS stations should be accessed by cycles and pedestrians and that entry of private vehicles must be discouraged. “Otherwise, they would become congested hotspots for private vehicles,” he added. The CMDA had examined plans to open the MRTS stations at Thiruvamiyur and Kasturba Nagar for office spaces and a convention centre with office space at Velachery about eight years ago. But, it did not materialise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/neighbourhood-markets-at-7-mrts-stns/articleshow/88400490.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Chennai||Vijay Hazare Trophy: Tamil Nadu hold aces against Karnataka||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu will see the return of Baba Aparajith --- replacing Hari Nishaanth in the line-up --- ahead of their Vijay Hazare Trophy quarterfinals against Karnataka in Jaipur on Tuesday. The 27-year-old, who missed the league stages of the competition due to his India A commitments, reached Jaipur last week and has completed the necessary quarantine to be available for the crucial clash. “Aparajith’s presence adds a different dimension to the side as he is an experienced campaigner. Having Aparajith back is a boost for the side,” Tamil Nadu coach M Venkataramana told TOI. The last time these two sides faced each other --- during the league stages --- Vijay Shankar’s boys had registered a comprehensive 8-wicket win. However, Venkataramana doesn’t want his team to dwell much into past performances. “When we played them in the league phase --- the conditions in Thiruvananthapuram were different. The wickets and the weather in Jaipur are a lot different and we wouldn’t be thinking too much about the previous matches against Karnataka,” stressed Venkataramana. Tamil Nadu topped the Elite Group B to earn a direct qualification for the quarterfinal stage. The league phase saw Tamil Nadu notch up convincing wins against Mumbai, Karnataka and Bengal before facing reverses against Pondicherry and Baroda. Their superior Net Run-Rate (NRR) saw them finish on top of the table. As far as their batting goes, the seasoned Dinesh Karthik (185 runs from 4 innings) and Baba Indrajith (164 from 5 games) have done the bulk of the scoring. The team’s bowling has been led by Washington Sundar (12 wickets in 5 games) and M Siddharth (11 in 5 outings). Karnataka, on the other hand, took a longer route to make the last-8 stage as they beat Rajasthan by 8 wickets in pre-quarters on Sunday. Karnataka will want their opener R Samarth --- the side’s leading run-getter with 297 runs in 6 games --- to continue his strong show with the bat. Skipper Manish Pandey --- with 270 runs from 6 games ---- too has been a solid presence in the middle-order. As far as their bowling goes, medium-pacer V Koushik, spinners --- J Suchith and Praveen Dubey --- have taken 7 wickets each in the tournament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-hold-aces-against-karnataka/articleshow/88400491.cms||Prasad RS

---||Chennai||Supreme Court backs probe into treatment given to ex-Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has upheld the inquiry into the “correctness, adequacy and inadequacy” of medical treatment extended to the former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa and turned down the Apollo Hospitals’ plea challenging the setting up of the Justice T A Arumughaswamy Commission of Inquiry. A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari, however, allowed the hospital to cross-examine any witness and also lead its own evidence before the commission. It upheld the Madras High Court order which had refused to interfere in the proceedings before the commission. The bench passed the order on an appeal filed by Appolo Hospitals which approached the court through advocate Rohini Musa. It had accused the panel of bias and of conducting proceedings in violation of natural justice. The commission, however, denied the allegations and told the apex court that it was holding the inquiry as per the law. “Having heard the learned senior counsel for the parties, we do not find any infirmity in the order of the high Court,” the apex court said in its order which was passed on November 30 but has been uploaded now on the SC website. “However, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that it is just and proper for the commission to furnish the documents, the depositions and the records as available in the records of the commission on an application to be made by the hospital... The hospital is also permitted to make an appropriate application seeking permission to crossexamine/recall of any witness or individual including those witnesses whose evidence has since been closed and also lead its own evidence. If such an application is filed, we request the commission to consider the same and pass appropriate orders thereon,” it said. The bench said that it would be just and proper to constitute a medical board to assist the commission in disposal of the case. “For this purpose, we request the director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, to nominate a panel of doctors, specialists in the fields of treatment of the ailments as suffered by late chief minister of the Tamil Nadu. Needless to say that the commission has to furnish the said medical board, so constituted, with complete records of the proceedings. The mdical board, so appointed, is permitted to participate in all further proceedings of the commission and furnish a copy of the report to the commission,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/supreme-court-backs-probe-into-treatment-given-to-jaya/articleshow/88400497.cms||---
---||India||After experts raise concerns, biodiversity bill sent to JPC||NEW DELHI: Amid certain concerns expressed by experts over its proposed amendment, the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, was on Monday referred to a joint committee of Parliament, which will further examine it and submit its report in the first week of the budget session next year even as opposition Congress initially wanted it to be sent to the department-related parliamentary standing committee on environment, forests and science & technology. The 31-member committee has 21 MPs of different political parties, including two of Congress, from the Lok Sabha with the remaining 10 to be included from the Rajya Sabha. Unlike the standing committee on environment and forests which is headed by the Congress member in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh, this joint panel will be chaired by a member of party in office. The bill, introduced by environment minister Bhupender Yadav in the Lok Sabha on December 16, seeks to facilitate fast-tracking of research, encourage Indian system of medicine, bring more foreign investments in the chain of biological resources and decriminalise use of biological resources by ‘vaids’, ‘hakims’ and AYUSH practitioners who have been practicing indigenous medicines for “sustenance and livelihood”. Experts, however, questioned why the government didn’t seek public comments on the bill as it concerns every part of the country. The Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE) - New Delhi-based environmental research group - in its analysis of the Bill said that the principal aims of the proposed legislation was to "reduce the compliance burden" and facilitate investment. "Conservation of biological resources is clearly the last priority. The Amendment Bill will undo all the efforts made in the last few years to implement the Biological Diversity Act," it said. Noting that the main focus of the Bill is to facilitate the trade in biodiversity, the LIFE said, "Not a single provision in the proposed amendment relates to protection, conservation or increasing the stake of local communities in the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity. The amendment seems to be done with the sole intention of providing benefit to the AYUSH industry." Flagging his party's opposition which wants the Bill to be referred to standing committee, Jairam Ramesh had on last Friday written to the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, urging him not to allow the government to take the select committee route. "The subject matter of the Bill and indeed of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 which is sought to be amended belongs fairly and squarely to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, and consequently to the standing committee related to it," said Ramesh in his letter to the Speaker. The Opposition suspects that the select committee, headed by any ruling party member, may not do justice with the various concerns raised by different experts over certain provisions of the Bill which has not only diluted the penalty provision by replacing imprisonment with fines in the proposed legislation but also replaced judge (court) with a joint secretary-level officer to determine the penalties. Ramesh had in his letter, however, not stated any specific reason. "I don't wish to say more on the motivations of the government to bypass the standing committee concerned and refer the contentious Bill to a select committee. The motivations are obvious. All I wish to say is that the move is a deliberate insult to the standing committee," Ramesh wrote, urging the Speaker to refer the Bill to the concerned standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-experts-raise-concerns-biodiversity-bill-sent-to-jpc/articleshow/88400512.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The recruitment process had to be suspended on two occasions due to non-completion of the panchayat polls. Now, however, the State Election Commission has notified that the time limit for the oath-taking ceremony of the newly-elected mukhiyas and election of the heads of panchayat samitis is January 3. Hence, the counselling and recruitment of teachers in the third cycle will be done from January 17 to 28. Sanjay Kumar, the additional chief secretary of the education department, told this reporter on Monday, “The counselling and appointment of teachers against 12,495 vacancies under 1,368 recruitment units will begin with urban bodies, followed by blocks and panchayats.” The recruitment of social science teachers of classes VI to VIII will be done on January 17 and that of others (mathematics, science and languages) on January 18. The counselling and appointment of teachers of classes I to V will be done on January 19. The appointment of teachers under the block recruitment units will be made on January 22, 24 and 25. The counselling of social science teachers of classes VI to VIII will be done on January 22 and that of others (mathematics, science and languages) on January 24. The counselling and recruitment of the teachers of classes I to V will be done on January 25. On the other hand, the counselling and appointment of teachers of classes I to V under the panchayat units will be done on January 28. The notification also stated, “The final merit list of candidates would have to be uploaded to the NIC portal of the districts concerned a week before the date of counselling. In case of any irregularities, the counselling will be cancelled in 24 hours.” More than 48,000 teachers have already been recruited in the last two cycles of counselling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/process-of-recruitment-of-teachers-to-resume-in-january/articleshow/88397720.cms||B K Mishra

The first consignment of 900 kilos of honey was recently delivered to the TTD. The second consignment will be delivered in February 2022. “The TTD will give quarterly, and not yearly, indents. The agreement came into reality following talks between the TTD and GCC chairpersons,” general manager of marketing at GCC, A Surendra Kumar, said. Honey is the major commodity that brings in substantial revenues to the GCC. The corporation earned Rs 12 crore from honey sales out of its revenue of Rs 24 crore in the 2019-20 financial year. In 2020-21, revenue from honey stood at Rs 17 crore out of a turnover of Rs 33 crore. In fact, the GCC’s honey sales increased amid the pandemic last year as other suppliers faced constraints such as delay in transportation sources said. The GCC will also supply turmeric as part of the agreement. The corporation received the indent for the supply of 2,000 kilos of turmeric a couple of days ago. The consignment will be delivered over the next three to four days. The GCC procured 1,000 quintals of turmeric in 2019, Surendra Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/gcc-honey-turmeric-for-tirumala-temple/articleshow/88398015.cms||Siva G

Pankaj Kumar Saini, the in charge of the Obra police station, told this newspaper, “One Satyendra Narayan Singh alias Mantri, a resident of Dihra village, was travelling by a car to Aurangabad from Arwal with Deepak Singh (30), David George (34) and Galaxon George (32). They met with an accident when a truck coming from the opposite direction collided with the car.

He was then taken to the BHU Trauma Centre in Varanasi, but he too died during treatment. According to sources, Satyendra was the director of an Aurangabad-based private school where David and Galaxon were teachers. Deepak was Satyendra’s relative. Meanwhile, the accident led to a massive traffic jam on NH-139 for a few hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/four-killed-as-car-rams-into-a-truck/articleshow/88398019.cms||---

The state transport department has set the target to swap 50 city buses with environment-friendly fuel by March 2022. The department has received 83 applications from private players for replacement of old buses with CNG-run buses and 43 applications have already been accepted by the district-level selection committee. Transport minister Sheela Kumari said introduction of CNG buses would reduce pollution in Patna urban area. “It will be operated on the designated routes,” she said. The minister said 70 CNG-run standard-size buses are being operated by Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC). “The number will be increased further in future. These buses are environment-friendly and cost-efficient,” Sheela said. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agrawal said diesel-run buses would be phased out from Patna roads by June next year. These buses, however, will be allowed to run in rural areas of Patna and other districts,” he added. The 24-seater CNG buses will be equipped with CCTV cameras, speed governor, GPS tracker, fire extinguisher and first-aid kit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/diesel-run-buses-to-be-phased-out-from-patna-soon/articleshow/88398126.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Patna||Special status issue: JD(U) may launch stir||PATNA: JD(U) parliamentary board chairman Upendra Kushwaha on Monday urged the BJP leaders of the state to convince the Centre to grant special category status to Bihar as they are “aware of the ground situation”. “Alternatively, the JD(U) will not shy away from launching a fresh agitation over the issue,” he added. The recent report of the NITI Aayog in which Bihar was placed at the bottom in matters of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and improvement of the household economy has spurred the JD(U) to renew special status demand. Incidentally, state BJP leaders, including deputy CM Renu Devi and a few ministers, have taken a different stand on the issue. They have maintained that Bihar does not need special category status, as the Centre has given a special package to the state. “The state BJP leaders know the situation in Bihar. They should convince the Centre to grant special category status to the state,” Kushwaha said. “The NITI Aayog report has made it clear that Bihar is a backward state. Now, it does not need to be proved. The central government also knows about it,” Kushwaha said, adding under the leadership of Nitish, the state has made new strides on the development front, but much more was needed to be done. Without taking the name of the BJP leaders, Kushwaha said, “Those who think that Bihar has got more under special package should explain how much money has been given and under which heads.” Asked what the JD(U) would do if the Centre did not grant special category status to Bihar, Kushwaha said, “They have to take the decision. If it is not given, the JD(U) will launch an agitation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/special-status-issue-jdu-may-launch-stir/articleshow/88398061.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Vijayawada||HC issues notices on solar power purchase||Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Monday issued notices to the state and Union governments to file counter affidavits in the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed challenging the state government’s decision to accept the proposal of Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to purchase 7,000 MW of solar power at the rate of Rs 2.49 per unit. CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna moved the high court challenging the cabinet decision to accept SECI’s offer and subsequent orders issued by the government for the purchase of solar power from SECI. Ramakrishna argued that the process adopted by the state government to procure solar power from SECI is in violation of the Electricity Act and will cause huge loss to the public exchequer. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao told the high court that if any purchase of power has to be made by distribution companies (discoms), it should be done through a public hearing before the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) which determines the tariffs. Moreover, the power purchase has to be done through a competitive bidding process. Contrary to the procedure stipulated in the Electricity Act, SECI sent a proposal to sell solar power at Rs 2.49 per unit to the state government on September 15 and the state cabinet accepted the proposal the next day, said Rao. Contending the price quoted by SECI that was accepted by the state government without following the procedure, Rao said SECI derived the prices at Rs 2.04, Rs 2.05 and Rs 2.09 in other tenders. The price of solar power quoted by other producers was as low as Rs 1.99 per unit. Rao argued why the state government should procure power at a higher rate from SECI when other producers are offering a much lower price. He further argued that the state government claims it is a power surplus state even as it is trying to purchase power generated in Rajasthan. When sufficient power is being generated from power producers within the state, why should the state government procure additional power from elsewhere. If the state government has power purchase agreements with producers within the state, it has to pay, whether or not it purchases power from them. This will not only weaken the financial stability of discoms but also burden consumers as the cost of procurement will ultimately be transferred to them. Considering the arguments of Adinarayana Rao, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy directed the respondents to file counter affidavits and posted further hearing on the matter after two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-issues-notices-on-solar-power-purchase/articleshow/88398256.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Visakhapatnam||Raising legal marriage age may run into rollout hurdles||Visakhapatnam: The Union cabinet has recently cleared the proposal to raise the marriageable age for girls from 18 to 21 years. The Bill is likely to be tabled in Parliament in the next few days.  The move, which brings in parity in the marriageable age of both genders, is likely to face several challenges in implementation, even as it leads to a major overhaul in education, health, societal change, career, decision making, and economic empowerment of girls. In a state like Andhra Pradesh, where the median age of marriage is around 19 years, it is likely to face greater challenges. The incidence of child marriage in terms of numbers still remains high in the state.  As per the recently released National Family Health Survey-5, the median age of marriage is 18.1 among women aged 25-29 in Andhra Pradesh, while it is 18.4 among women aged 20-49.  About 29% of women aged between 20 to 24 years in Andhra Pradesh get married before attaining the existing legal minimum age of 18 years. However, this is a decline from 33% in the National Family Health Survey-4 of 2015-16.  There is also an urban and rural divide with women from rural areas getting married much earlier than their urban counterparts. Speaking to TOI, former chairperson of AP State Commission for Protection of Child Rights and secretary, Nature NGO, G Hymavathi explained that the move would go a long way in boosting the prospects of women on all fronts—be it health, education, employment and empowerment. “Apart from physical and psychological development, it would give them enough time to pursue higher education and jobs. Raising the marriageable age for girls from 18 to 21 can also address maternal and infant mortality and reduce domestic violence,” said Hymavathi. “But unfortunately, the traditional and cultural practices still outweigh the laws for several parents, particularly in rural areas and among poor families. As Andhra Pradesh is reporting a substantial number of child marriages, the stereotypes that ‘marriage offers protection to young girls’ and ‘respect-deserving tradition’ need to be broken. Child marriages would only lead to school dropouts and various health issues due to a lack of physical and personal development,” said Hymavathi.  State convener of the Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF), Gondu Sitaram, said the decision is well-intentioned and would lead to better health and improve the education and employment opportunities of girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/raising-legal-marriage-age-may-run-into-rollout-hurdles/articleshow/88398237.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

It was spotted about 50 metres behind the government high school and about 100 meters from the site of the proposed Keeladi museum, where thousands of artefacts unearthed during the seven phases of excavation will be displayed. “The first ring on the top of the well was spotted about two feet from the ground level,” P Baskar, co-director of Keeladi excavation, told TOI after visiting the site with his team on Sunday. He said the landlord and workers could see a few rings till they dug the pit for their required seven feet. It was brought to the notice of state archaeology department commissioner R Sivanantham who directed the team to visit the spot. “Only one ring was visible when we visited as water draining from the field covered the rest. We expect the ring well to have the standard diameter of one metre. We will inspect the well further after the water drains, with the permission of the owner,” he said. Baskar said the ring well could be excavated to its full depth only when the eighth phase excavation begins. This is the third ring well to be spotted in Keeladi and 18th in Keeladi and Agaram (15) combined. The most number of rings found in a well so far in the state is 39 in the sixth phase of excavation at Keeladi. Prior to that, there were 32 rings in a well in Agaram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/farm-workers-stumble-upon-ring-well-in-keeladi/articleshow/88398784.cms||---

The locals alleged that the promise of suitable jobs for the people from whom land was purchased was not yet fulfilled. The protest was in the wake of KKNPP kick-starting recruitment process for 34 engineers on Sunday. Out of around 1,700 candidates, one tenth of them were shortlisted for the personal interview to be held on Monday and Tuesday. The protesters led by Kudankulam Vincy Maniyarasan contended that no one got selected from the Kudankulam area. As the protesters continued to block KKNPP employees from entering the site for a few hours, the superintendent of police (SP) for Tirunelveli district P Saravanan conducted talks with them. This was followed by tripartite talks by the Cheranmahadevi revenue divisional officer and Tirunelveli SP with KKNPP site director Manohar Godbole and other senior officials of the project. On behalf of the protesters, district panchayat chairman V S R Jegadeesh and presidents of Kudankulam, Vijayapathi and Irukkanthurai panchayats took part in the meeting. . It was decided that KKNPP management would put the ongoing recruitment on hold and discuss the issue with the district collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/kknpp-suspends-recruitment-after-protest-from-locals/articleshow/88398790.cms||---

Last week, addressing the press on the bank’s corporate strategy, deputy MD Rajiv Anand said that the bank was seeing growth come back across segments of the economy. “We are well-positioned in terms of the balance sheet, people, process and technology to capture growth opportunities,” he said. Anand said that the bank was seeing fairly strong capacity expansion in renewables, manufacturing under the production- linked incentive scheme, roads, ports, specialty chemicals and data centres. He said that there was capacity expansion in core sectors as well.

He will join TMC in Kolkata on Tuesday in the presence of West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee. Lourenco’s resignation has left Congress in a state of shock. Four days ago, he was announced as the party’s Curtorim candidate for the 2022 assembly elections in Congress’ first list of eight candidates. “There were a lot of issues… people issues. So many things had to be decided and we (Congress) were not able to do it. I waited but there was no move from Congress. So, I decided to move to a party that is ready to take up the issues. And TMC does that,” Lourenco, who has held talks with both BJP and AAP before settling for TMC, said. “We are all Congressmen and we are accepting Banerjee’s Congress,” he said in a video message from Kolkata. On Monday, he submitted his resignation to the legislature secretary, and later, speaker Rajesh Patnekar accepted it. With Lourenco’s resignation, the strength of Congress in the 40-member legislative assembly has been reduced to two — leader of opposition and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, and senior Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane. In the 2017 assembly election, Congress had emerged as the single largest party winning 17 seats. Political observers say that for more than a year, Lourenco has been exploring his political options, and finally he found it in TMC. A while ago, speculations were rife that Lourenco was to join AAP, and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal was even scheduled to visit Goa for his induction into the party. But state party president Girish Chodankar and Kamat convinced him to stay by promising to give him a big role to play in the party. Rahul Gandhi spoke to him and later, he was appointed the second working president of the party. Lourenco had also met BJP Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis and discussed his plans to join BJP, but that didn’t materialise. Lourenco was the most vocal of Congress MLAs over the past five years, both inside and outside the assembly. He had raised various issues, including the three linear projects at Mollem. Recently, former chief minister and former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro had resigned from Congress to join TMC, which nominated him as a Rajya Sabha member. Another former chief minister and former Congress Ponda MLA Ravi Naik, too, recently resigned and joined BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-working-prez-3-time-mla-lourenco-quits-to-join-tmc-today/articleshow/88399363.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Business||BSR quits as auditor of Medi Assist||MUMBAI: BSR & Co, sub-licensee of KPMG in India, has resigned as the auditor to Medi Assist Insurance TPA. Medi is the largest third-party administrator (TPA), providing services to health insurers. The audit firm is understood to have differences with the company, which led to the out-of-turn resignation. Medi Assist was planning an IPO and had filed its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) earlier this year. The DRHP names BSR as the statutory auditor and has said that there has been no change for the past three years. According to sources, the differences were over the company’s settlement of claims with healthcare providers. Sources said that the company changed the payment process to speed up settlement during the Covid pandemic, which auditors did not agree upon. When contacted, KPMG said that it would not comment on the development. A Medi Assist spokesperson, in response to a query, said, that in keeping with industry practices the company had tailored its Covid response to the new world of unpredictability. “As the largest TPA, we constantly enable business continuity and help our customers access top quality healthcare. We have also engaged with a leading audit firm and are in the process of completing their appointment formalities. This change has no bearing on the company, its performance or its growth opportunities.” the spokesperson said. In the resignation letter, BSR & Co said that it had completed the audit for FY21 and issued a disclaimer of opinion on November 16, 2021. “For the reasons included in the ‘Basis for disclaimer of opinion’ paragraph in our audit reports, we have carried out our annual continuance process and, basis that assessment, we express our inability to continue as statutory auditors of the company with immediate effect.” Source said that the company was in talks to appoint PwC’s licensee as its new internal auditor and also planned to appoint BDO as external auditor. Medi Assist is the largest health benefits administrator in India. In its DRHP, Medi Assist has said that it has a market share of 22-25% of the total revenue pool of TPAs, and 44% of their profits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bsr-quits-as-auditor-of-medi-assist/articleshow/88399246.cms||Mayur Shetty

The purchase also makes Vedanta the leading cobalt producer in India. Nickel & cobalt are the minerals of the future as they are used in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, for energy storage systems and in other uses like steel-making. Nicomet, with an annual capacity to produce 7.5 kilo tonnes at its Goa plant, has been non-operational for the last several years. The company’s creditors took control of Nicomet under the bankruptcy code and initiated a sale of the asset. Vedanta, which routed the purchase through its subsidiary, did not reveal the acquisition price. The purchase comes at a time when the nickel market is tightening with a surge in battery demand and an increase in global stainless-steel production in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue into 2022. Currently, India imports 100% of its nickel requirements, which is about 45 kilo tonnes per annum. With an ambitious growth plan in place, Vedanta is well poised to meet 50% of the country’s total nickel demand, the company said in a statement. “Nickel and cobalt are a metal of great strategic importance, especially for our (India’s) transition towards clean energy and electric mobility,” said Vedanta chairman Agarwal. “Our focus will be to boost domestic production that would fuel India’s transition to a net zero economy.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vedanta-buys-bankrupt-nickel-cobalt-co-nicomet/articleshow/88399238.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||Impossible to drink liquor in Bihar: Nitish Kumar on Jitan Ram Manjhi’s remark||PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Monday said it’s impossible to drink liquor in Bihar. He was reacting to former CM and HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi’s recent suggestion to the poor to drink liquor after 10pm to “avoid police action”. “It is impossible in the state. If one or two people say such things, I want to explain to everyone that liquor ban in the state was enforced only after all MLAs/MLCs unanimously took oath in the assembly and legislative council in support of prohibition. A resolution in favour of total prohibition was unanimously passed from both houses of the state legislature,” Nitish told media persons after his weekly ‘janata darabr’ programme at the CM secretariat here. Rejecting the demand for certain relaxations in total prohibition, Nitish said, “We held a programme on the occasion of De-addiction Day on November 26 this year. All government officers and employees took oath in support of prohibition. Moreover, when we recently held a meeting of the NDA legislature party, all legislators of the alliance raised their hands in support of total prohibition. If some of them are speaking against the prohibition now, it is very strange.” Though the CM didn’t take the name of any NDA legislator, he was probably referring to Manjhi who was present at the NDA meeting and had also raised hands in support of total prohibition. A few days ago, while talking to mediapersons in Bagaha, Manjhi had suggested poor people to drink liquor but only after 10pm to avoid police action and arrest. “It is an open secret that big and wealthy people like contractors, doctors, engineers, IAS and IPS drink liquor after 10pm and go to sleep. The world does not know about them. I have asked the poor to learn from the rich people and drink after 10pm. Poor people get caught because they drink any time and create nuisance on the roads,” Manjhi had said. When the CM’s attention was drawn towards recovery of large quantity of Indian-made foreign liquor from the campus of Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, he said, “There are some people who remain indulged in wrongdoings always.” Earlier, the CM listened to the grievances of 135 people who had arrived at the ‘janata darbar’ programme from different districts and issued necessary instructions to the departments concerned for solving their problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/impossible-to-drink-liquor-in-bihar-cm-on-manjhis-remark/articleshow/88398134.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Patna||Met: Cold wave likely in south Bihar today||PATNA: The winter season finally seems to be reaching its peak as icy north-westerly winds continue to bring down night as well as day temperature. Mercury plunged to season’s lowest level in Patna on Monday as the minimum temperature in the state capital was recorded at 6.6 degrees Celsius (C). Gaya, on the other hand, shivered at 4.1 degrees C, which was five notches lower than the corresponding normal for the day. An official at Patna meteorological centre said the average minimum temperature in the state was in the range of 8-9 degrees C and maximum temperature in the range of 22-23 degrees C. India Meteorological Department (IMD) in its all-India weather bulletin on Monday issued alert for cold wave at isolated places in Bihar on Tuesday. Cold wave condition is declared at a place when the actual minimum temperature is 10 degrees C or lower along with departure of 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C from the corresponding normal. Patna meteorological centre meteorologist Sanjay Kumar claimed that cold wave conditions may be primarily felt in south-western and south-central parts of the state, including places such as Gaya, Patna, Dehri and Sasaram. The minimum temperature is expected to be in the range of 5-6 degrees C in Gaya till Friday and 7-8 degrees C in Patna. Days are also likely to remain cold as maximum temperature at both places is likely to be in the range of 21-22 degrees C. Weathermen at Patna meteorological centre claimed that residents should be prepared to brave similar cold conditions till the year-end, though the rate of drop in temperature is likely to slow down for a few days. “The speed of cold north-westerly winds coming from snow-laden western Himalayan region is likely to reduce. It was only due to gusty north-westerly winds that a sharp plunge in temperature level was witnessed over the last 3-4 days,” Kumar said, adding, however, the wind speed is expected to lower a bit from Wednesday, which will lead to the stabilisation in temperature. The temperature will, however, continue to remain low. The weathermen are also expecting a slight change in weather owing to two western disturbances in succession. Both western disturbances are expected to hit western Himalayan region on December 22 and 24, respectively. The western disturbances around this time of the year bring rainfall or snowfall in the Himalayan region and cloudy conditions followed by sharp temperature drop in northern plains, including Bihar. “Partly cloudy skies may be witnessed at isolated places in the state till the year-end under the influence of the two successive western disturbances, depending upon the direction of their movement. The departure of each western disturbance will pave way for further drop in mercury column,” Sanjay said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-cold-wave-likely-in-south-bihar-today/articleshow/88397699.cms||Piyush Tripathi

---||Kolkata||Bars & restaurants in Kolkata gear up for bumper weekends||KOLKATA: The next two weekends could be the biggest of the year for Kolkata’s bars and restaurants, with footfalls surpassing that of Durga Puja, prompting many to make arrangements for extra food. While several have already dropped their liquor prices, food prices remain unchanged since 2020. This would be an additional attraction for patrons, believes the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI). “While the last weekend saw a dip in footfalls due to the polls, the crowd has started building up from Monday. We expect this to swell every day till Christmas and it could well be more crowded than during the Pujas which saw an unusually high attendance. Liquor prices have been reduced at many places, which will be an incentive. That apart, food orders, too, could be very high this time and we are making arrangements to meet the extra demand,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar who also owns Songhai and Manthan. Most Park Street restaurants have taken a late-closure permission and will stay open till 1am on December 24, 25, 31 and January 1. Mocambo and Peter Cat have made provisions for extra food and may serve till 2am on these days if footfalls remain high. Liquor will be served till 1am. “During the Pujas, too, we had to prepare food for late orders. So, this time we are keeping extra provisions,” said owner Nitin Kothari. Liquor prices, however, will remain unchanged at Mocambo and Peter Cat till old stocks last. Some others, like Oasis, have dropped their liquor price. “Despite the polls, the footfall this weekend wasn’t low. It picked up on Monday and we expect a full house from December 24 to 26. The New Year weekend would obviously be even more crowded,” said Pratap Daryanani, owner of Oasis on Park Street. Oasis, too, will serve till 1am on the four festive days. With the decorative lights on and a chill descending on Kolkata, the time is just right for a night out at Park Street, said Rajiv Kothari, owner of Bar-B-Q and One Step Up. At Bar-B-Q, liquor prices are set to drop by 20% to 35% this week. “We expect a big turnout from Wednesday till Sunday. The cheaper liquor will be an incentive,” the owner said. The restaurant will be open till 1am on Christmas Eve, Christmas, New Year’s Eve and January 1. Songhai and Manthan have reduced liquor prices from Monday. Mughlai chain Aminia expects full occupancy across all outlets between December 24 and 31. “The footfall has already jumped to near-capacity at all outlets. The crowds will now get bigger every day,” said owner Kabir Azhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bars-restaurants-gear-up-for-bumper-weekends/articleshow/88398728.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Kolkata||Mercury may slide to 10 degrees Celsius in Kolkata today||KOLKATA: The city woke up to a sharp chill on Monday even as the minimum temperature dropped to 11.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the season so far. With the northwesterly winds getting stronger, the mercury was set to dip further and might slide to 10 degrees on Tuesday, said the Met office. The chilly spell, however, could be broken on Wednesday as the northwesterly starts losing intensity. But the mercury may still remain below 15 degrees. The temperature had been on a steady slide since early last week when the minimum temperature dipped three degrees from 18 to 15. Ever since, it has remained below 15 degrees Celsius, inching down gradually to slide below 12 degrees on Monday. “The northwesterly has been gaining strength gradually as there is no obstruction in its path. From Wednesday, though, some easterly winds will infuse moisture and may hinder its flow. It will help the mercury rise marginally and the chill will lose its sting,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He added Christmas could still be moderately chilly in Kolkata. A western disturbance is expected to intervene into the path of the northwesterly and slow down its intensity. The mercury is expected to hover around 14-15 degrees on December 25. “Once the northwesterly weakens, both the minimum and maximum temperature will rise. But it may not continue for long,” said Das. This is the first chilly spell in Kolkata this winter. The city experiences at least three, during which the mercury plunges. The rise and fall of the mercury depend on the flow of northwesterly winds that bring in the chill from the icy Himalayan peaks. It is often interrupted by weather systems, like low-pressure troughs along its pathway or incursion of easterly winds from the sea. This season, it had happened during the second week of December when a low-pressure trough had led to clouds and drizzles, pushing the minimum temperature up and pulling the maximum down. The difference between the two had narrowed down to just two degrees. Monday’s minimum temperature was four notches below normal. The maximum—22.8° Celsius—was four degrees below normal as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mercury-drops-to-11-2c-in-city-slide-may-continue-to-10c-today/articleshow/88399138.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||Kolkata||May Christmas spirit touch all with peace: West Bengal CM||KOLKATA: All-round political pollution and divisive politics are threatening the country and choking peace of mind just as global warming is choking the environment. We need to stand united and work towards peace and harmony starting this Christmas season. With these words, chief minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurated the 11th edition of Kolkata Christmas Festival at Allen Park on Park Street on Monday. “If we have to restore mental peace, a smiling face is the only alternative, just like a green and clean environment is our only alternative…” Banerjee said. “Peace is the only solution.” Quoting the national anthem, she reminded that the strength of the country lay in unity. “We are united and must fight the battle unitedly…let us think, speak and write with unity. Every religion preaches unity,” Banerjee said. She prayed that from the Vatican to Goa to Kolkata, may the Christmas spirit touch all with mercy and peace. These were difficult times but if we stayed united we would be able to defeat negative forces, the CM said. She spoke about her visit to the tomb of St Francis Xavier at the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Goa and how touching the walls had inspired her. “We are blessed with St Xavier’s college and university here and I will remain grateful to the priests for the education they have been imparting to our children here. I am deeply indebted to all Christian institutions for the legacy of education they have built,” she said. The event started with the blessing of the crib by Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of the Kolkata diocese of Church of North India. Archbishop Thomas D Souza, head of Roman Catholics in the archdiocese of Kolkata reminded one about how the darkness within every man can be conquered by the lamp of love that Christmas brings. “We feel secure under her leadership,” D Souza said, congratulating the CM for her Assembly polls win and wishing her the best for a similar win in KMC elections. Shane Calvert, former Anglo Indian MLA, who conducted the programme took the audience through the symbolism of Christmas Tree, Santa Claus and the lights that shine within and without. The festival will continue for 10 days and carols will be sung by church choirs every day. Popular bands will also perform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/may-christmas-spirit-touch-all-with-peace-cm/articleshow/88399144.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

After an initial investment of Rs 40,000, Malviya had become a ‘crypto millionaire’ within a year as the value of bitcoin hit $20,000 in 2017-end. In 2018, Malviya, however, lost nearly 80% of his net worth as bitcoin’s price crashed to $3,000. He could not even access his assets due to an RBI ban on facilitation of crypto trade by banks. “It was a difficult time not only financially but also socially. Crypto was perceived as illegal,” said Malviya. Crypto is still in a legal grey zone but it has become a household phenomenon amid the pandemic as the prospect of multi-bagger returns attracted Indians to the highly volatile digital tokens. According to Reuters, up to 15 million Indians own crypto assets. Crypto’s rising popularity caught policymakers’ attention earlier this year. Last month, the government said it will introduce a bill seeking to ban ‘private cryptocurrencies’ while allowing for ‘exceptions to promote the underlying tech’ in Parliament’s ongoing session. The government’s cryptic announcement, however, had spooked Indian investors and led to heavy selling. Nishcal Shetty, CEO of crypto exchange, WazirX, said, “The Indian market was trading at 15-20% discount to the global one briefly. The description of the bill being the same as in January had induced fear among investors,” he said. However, Parliament’s month-long winter session is set to end on Thursday and there are no signs of the bill still. To add to investors’ worries, the RBI last week told its board that a complete crypto ban was needed as partial restrictions won’t work. The domestic crypto industry, which includes unicorn startups, has been in talks with the government and FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement in Parliament in November-end — that the government has no plans to recognise bitcoin as a ‘currency’ — is in line with industry demands. “Crypto should be classified as an asset class. It is similarly regulated in many other countries, and most use cases of crypto are an investment and not payment,” said Ashish Singhal, co-chair of industry body BACC. Crypto exchange BuyUcoin’s CEO Shivam Thakral also said that the “industry has been advocating against any recognition of crypto as a legal tender”. The government and the RBI have a problem accepting privately issued currencies as they are not backed by a guarantee or commodities. The bill will be closely watched as the government’s definition of ‘private’ crypto is not clear.

One Guntupalli Srinivas filed the petition arguing that only 13 per cent of the population can understand the GOs issued in English, which is unfair, unjust and a violation of the basic postulates of democracy. Srinivas sought directions from the high court to implement the Official Languages Act in true letter and spirit. He argued that government websites should be maintained in the Telugu language by utilising advanced technologies that are now readily available. Srinivas argued that transacting government business in English creates an uninformed or misinformed citizenry. He stated that of the 8.45 crore Telugu-speaking people only 1.1 crore can understand English. Eighty-seven per cent of the population cannot understand government orders in English. Srinivas contended that the state government did not act on his various representations, requesting the constitution of a Telugu Language Development Authority and appointing official language supervising officers as contemplated in various GOs issued. He pleaded the high court issue directions to the government to implement the Official Languages Act by introducing Telugu in all governmental business from the state secretariat to the village secretariat level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/implement-official-languages-act-use-telugu-in-govt-biz-pil/articleshow/88398182.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Police managed to recover Rs 1.33 crore. Addressing the media, deputy commissioner of police K Babu Rao, the main accused identified as Gandikota Phanindra (24) was a trusted employee of gold shop owner Goli Radha Krishna, a resident of Sivalayam Street. Cops said Phanindra had been working for Krishna for the past four years, who handed Rs 1.64 crore to him and two other employees—Sunkara Ramanjaneyulu and Belu Syam—which had to be sent to Chennai for business purposes on November 26. Cops said Rao hatched a plan to steal the money by taking the help of five other friends —Nakka Siva Nagaraju, Alavala Saibabu, Tadiestti Bhavanarayana, Velpuri Ankama Rao and Gurram Ajay Kumar. Explaining the incident, Rao said that Phanindra staged a scene where two of his friends Siva Nagaraju and Ankama Rao hit their car with their motorcycle on the outskirts of Kavali town, Nellore district. Cops said Syam and Anjaneyulu got into a heated argument and their attention was successfully diverted. In the meantime, the other accused managed to sneak in and steal the money. Cops said they managed to trace and arrest all the accused, including Phanindra, based on their call data and vehicles used. Cops also said the recovered money will be handed over to the I-T department for verifying the income source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/six-arrested-for-stealing-over-rs-1-5-crore/articleshow/88398027.cms||---

Of these seven, derivatives contracts on chana and mustard seeds are already under suspension for trading. The new circular extends the period of suspension till December 19, 2022. Market players said that the government move is most likely aimed at reining in inflation in food prices with some of them also viewing it as a “knee-jerk reaction”. They also pointed out that in at least four of these seven commodities, trading volumes on the commexes are nearly zero and hence there may not be any impact on the prices of these items in the domestic market. Additionally, about 70% of the edible oils consumed in India is imported, so this government order may have a minuscule to no impact on the prices of these commodities. In the past too, the government has resorted to bans, including export of food products, describing them as essential to tame prices. Earlier this month, the government said that wholesale price inflation (WPI) for November was at 14.23%. This was the highest WPI level in 12 years, official data showed. The rise was because of a sharp increase in the prices of several items, including food products. Market players said the government is trying to rein in inflation since at least five states are going to polls in early 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-stops-futures-trade-in-7-agri-commodities/articleshow/88399251.cms||---

Reliance Industries and financial stocks led the decline. In mid-session, the sensex was down nearly 1,900 points, but a pull-back rally helped it close at 55,822 — a loss of 1,190 points or 2.1%. The day’s close was a fourth-month low for the sensex. Last week, the US Fed had said it would end its bond-buying programme, which was started in early 2020, by March 2022. The US central bank added that it would raise interest rates at least thrice next year, from almost zero level now. Also last week, in a surprise move, the BoE raised interest rate. This left investors around the globe jittery as the decision could lead to a situation of competing increase of rates among countries. Combined with it, the fast spread of the Omicron variant and its impact on markets and economies around the globe is making investors cautious, market players said. According to Kotak Securities head (equity research - retail) Shrikant Chouhan, the selloff in the domestic market “continued across the spectrum on weak global cues weighed down by factors such as rising Omicron cases in the West, rate hikes by several central banks in Europe and the US Fed also signalling its intent to undertake rate hikes next year to cool down inflationary concerns”. The short-term outlook for the market is still negative but, due to the oversold situation, there is a strong possibility of a meaningful pull-back rally, he said. The day’s selloff left investors poorer by nearly Rs 7 lakh crore with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 255.5 lakh crore. At the current level, India’s mcap is about Rs 18 lakh crore off its all-time high level of Rs 273 lakh crore, official data showed. The slide in investors’ wealth has come despite several new listings in the recent months like Nykaa, Paytm and Policybazaar, which have together added over Rs 4 lakh crore to BSE’s mcap. Like in the last few weeks, Monday’s selling was again led by foreign funds that recorded a net outflow of Rs 3,565 crore. So far in the month, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net sold stocks worth over Rs 19,100 crore, data from CDSL and BSE showed. Tuesday could witness another session of losses as the leading markets in the US opened deep in the red. The government bond market also saw strong selling on Monday with the benchmark 10-year gilt yield closing at 6.44%, a 21-month high, bond dealers said. The selloff came amid rising concerns about inflation, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-sinks-1200-pts-on-global-selloff-over-omicron/articleshow/88399232.cms||---

Unlike last year, when most churches had only allowed a few members for the special prayers and resorted to live streaming of the proceedings for others, this year members and other devotees will be allowed inside the churches, but only if they follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The decision was made due to apprehensions over the new Omicron variant. Iconic churches, like St Andrew’s, St John’s, St Paul’s Cathedral, Duff and Sacred Heart, have already been decked up with lights and Christmas fineries and pre-Christmas programmes have already started. From rehearsing the choir to decorating the Christmas tree, singing carols to readying the cribs for Nativity, churches in Kolkata are getting ready to usher in Christmas and open their gates to visitors to savour the Yuletide spirit. TimesViewA new strain of the coronavirus is running amok in the West and threatens to add to the burden of the public healthcare system in India. The challenge this festive season will, yet again, be balancing commerce and festivities with Covid precautions.At St Andrew’s Church on Brabourne Road, the special Christmas prayers will be held at 9.30am on December 25. It will be mandatory for all members to wear masks throughout the service. “The church has already been decorated for Christmas. The service will be in English at 9.30am and all the government guidelines for Covid will be followed,” said Father Swarup Bar. At Duff Church, the special Christmas Service will be held at 9am on December 25. “On the evening of December 24, we will have the special Nine Lessons and Carols. The church is being decorated and we will finish it by December 23. Since we are expecting over 300 people this time, we have made seating arrangements in the compound, too, so that social distancing can be maintained,” said Reverend Father Biswajit Biswas of Duff Church. The depiction of the birth of Jesus Christ at St John’s Church on Council House Street is one of the biggest draws, attracting people from far and wide. “We will have an hour-long Christmas service from 8.30am on December 25,” said Rangan Dutta, the church officer. The members of the Sacred Heart Church in Esplanade will come together this festive season to sing Christmas carols and take part in special Christmas prayers on December 24 and December 25. St Paul’s Cathedral is also being decorated for the week-long Christmas celebrations starting later this week. At Church of Christ the King in Park Circus, there will be multiple services throughout the day on December 25 so that the church doesn’t get crowded. Seating arrangements will also be spread out to maintain social distancing. “We will follow the ‘no mask, no Christmas Mass’ rule. Security personnel have been told that anyone seen without a mask on will not be allowed to enter. On December24, we will have Nine Lessons and Carol singing and Mass will start by 8.30pm. There will be a big LED screen in the compound outside so that people can view the proceedings inside,” said Basil Mandi, parish priest of the church.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/churches-to-enforce-no-mask-no-mass-rule-for-christmas-prayers/articleshow/88398687.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kolkata||Christmas: Day of greater joy, season of rejoicing and renewal||By: Rev Fr Dr Dominic Savio SJChristmas is here again! This day of Joy in a Season of Great Rejoicing! Behind the tinsel and the glitter and yuletide celebrations, there is a greater joy, a joy we truly celebrate. It is because God came down to earth to save us from our bondage in darkness, sin, and evil. Driven by our illusions, we live out our lives in self-seeking, division, hatred, envy, and avarice, seeking a happiness that is as fleeting as the light of a will-o-the-wisp. Christmas is a joy because it proclaims the good news that God has come to lead us out of the darkness of Maya into a Life of Light and Love, a life of genuine freedom, fellowship and justice, a life of breaking barriers and building bridges. As when we let the sunlight enter our rooms to dispel the darkness and illuminate everything clearly, so when we let the light of God enter our life, we see ourselves clearly as we are, and in His Light our life is sanctified and transformed. This analogy illustrates the essence of Christmas. Look again at the Babe in the Manger and it is clear he embodies the Light, Love and Life of God. It is through Jesus that God becomes present in our life and works our transformation, first by renewing our relationship with God, then by giving new meaning and dimension to our life, and finally by helping us find new ways of living our life. Our relationship with God is renewed, because often that relationship falls into the stale treadmill of routine, as we place ourselves before Him. Confined to ourselves, we forget others and even God. God comes to touch and renew our life by inspiring us to see new meaning in our life, so that we can love our brothers and sisters regardless of caste, creed or status. God comes to give new meaning to our life by giving us a deep peace such as only God can give, which is like a bridge over troubled waters. Finally, God always comes to help us find new ways of living our life. We realise that God needs us as we need Him. There is no better expression of this thought than in the words of Rabindranath Tagore: “Thus is your happiness with me, you have you come down to me, without me O Lord, futile would be your love.” This balance of the mortal and immortal is the harmony and rhythm of the universe, and here on this blessed Christmas Day we should renew our pledge to this remembrance. Yes, God’s life and joy become full only when we enter into His life in a fullness of union. As with parents and children, so with God and us, His children. So too we are nothing without him! He is our life giver, our provider and our ultimate destination after death. St Augustine, who lived in darkness and later discovered the light, writes, “Our hearts are restless O God, until they rest in Thee.” Christmas is here again! And while we celebrate, we should be imbued by the epiphany of renewal. Let us today renew the values and ways of God in our life to discover real joy, real peace and real happiness for always. Otherwise, it may so happen that Christmas will come every year but God will not. This Christmas we pray that God, for our transformation, touches us with His Light, His Love and with His life. Rev Fr Dr Dominic Savio SJ is the principal, St Xavier’s College (Autonomous)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/christmas-day-of-greater-joy-season-of-rejoicing-and-renewal/articleshow/88399266.cms||---
---||Business||Axis leads race to buy Citi’s retail biz, card ops in India||MUMBAI: Axis Bank has turned out to be the frontrunner in the race to acquire the retail and credit card assets of Citi India. Axis Bank has come up ahead after a private sector rival did not agree to the valuation that Citi was seeking for its business. Citi had announced its plans to exit the consumer banking business in India. The US-headquartered bank is keen on finalising a buyer before the end of December. Bankers estimated that the business would be worth around $2 billion. However, some private lenders have placed the valuation at a much lesser level. One of the conditions for the sale was that the employees of the retail business would be absorbed by the buyer. Given the higher compensation level among multinationals, this had made it a deal-breaker for public sector lenders like SBI, which has the second-largest card business through its subsidiary. When contacted, a Citi spokesperson said in a statement, “We continue to move forward with our process with respect to our India consumer business sale in accordance with our broader strategic refresh.” Axis Bank did not respond to any request for comments. Earlier, Kotak Bank was seen as a frontrunner for multiple reasons. The bank was still growing its retail liability franchise and was behind all its large private rivals in the cards business. It had also successfully integrated another multinational — ING Bank’s business in India. However, Kotak has stepped back over valuation issues. Axis Bank had earlier acquired the digital payments company FreeCharge and, more recently, bought a stake in Max Life Insurance. Citi has around 27 lakh credit cards outstanding and about 16 lakh savings accounts. It is the sixth-largest credit card issuer. Axis Bank, with its 77 lakh cards, is the fourth-largest issuer after ICICI Bank (1.2 crore cards). While an acquisition would not move Axis Bank up the rankings (see graphic), it would increase its average card spend due to the large premium portfolio that Citi has. One of the reasons why top banks have been wary of buying the multinational bank’s portfolio is that it has been extremely efficient in controlling costs and extracting value from its portfolio. “Usually, when a bank acquires a portfolio, there is scope to scale up earnings either through a reduction in the cost of funds or because of the higher yield on advances. Citi’s cost of funds is the lowest with a savings rate of 2.5%. Further, they offer some of the most competitive housing loans to high net worth individuals (HNIs). They would have also cross-sold all possible products,” said a banker. In the case of HDFC Bank, lenders say that there is a large number of customers who have cards from both banks. This would make it a less attractive option for the country’s largest private lender. Citi’s decision to announce the exit in advance and later look for buyers has also made it difficult for Indian operations. This prompted many key employees to start looking out and has turned some high net worth customers wary. “The ability of the acquiring bank to retain HNI customers will depend on their success in retaining the high-performing relationship managers,” said a banker. Citibank’s card portfolio has remained surprisingly sticky despite the sale announcement. Although the number of outstanding credit cards has dropped to 25.8 lakh in October from 26.2 lakh in April this year, the decline is more to do with the ban on Mastercard issuing fresh cards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/axis-leads-race-to-buy-citis-retail-biz-card-ops-in-india/articleshow/88399210.cms||Mayur Shetty

President of Junior Doctors’ Association-Bihar Dr Kundan Suman said the government has already issued a letter for payment of incentive for their services during the second wave of Covid pandemic. “Kishore has assured us that all our demands will be fulfilled by January 15. However, if the government fails to do so, we will launch a fresh agitation,” the JDA president added. Apart from grant of incentive for their duties during the second wave of Covid pandemic, the other four demands of the junior doctors are revision of scholarship of MBBS interns due since January 2020, relaxation in the provision of bond for PG students for pursuing higher education, early holding of NEET PG counselling and appointment of non-academic junior residents. Earlier, the strike had paralysed health services in the hospitals as the junior doctors abstained from OPD, emergency and other duties. Those posted in Covid wards, however, rendered their services. Dr Kundan said the JDA resorted to agitation after their repeated pleas failed to attract the government’s attention. Hundreds of junior doctors staged a peaceful demonstration at PMCH and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) holding placards. Superintendent of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), Dr I S Thakur, said the junior doctors’ stir had no major impact on the functioning of the PMCH as the senior doctors remained present in OPDs, emergency and other units. “At least 1,801 patients were attended by doctors in different OPDs of the hospital on Monday. We used to record almost same number of patients on usual days too,” he added. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said the number of patients in OPDs was 1,850 on Monday and none of the department had any impact of the agitation. “We have doubled the number of physicians to ensure that no patient returns disappointed from the hospital,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/junior-doctors-call-off-stir-after-govts-assurance/articleshow/88398030.cms||VK Tripathi

The high court had earlier allowed the petitions challenging the price fixed by the state government. A division bench of the high court declined to interfere with the single judge order after hearing the appeal petition filed by the state government. The high court bench headed by the Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy directed the state government to constitute a committee in accordance with earlier orders of the high court. The division bench also allowed the theatre managements to approach joint collectors, who are the licensing authorities at district level, with their proposed prices for tickets. Senior counsel for the petitioners B Adinarayana Rao sought clarification on the orders as the principal secretary (home) issued a statement that the orders are applicable only to the theatre that approached the court.

Hundreds of fishermen and relatives of those detained also held a demonstration demanding the release of the men and urging the Union and state governments to come out with a permanent solution for the issue. On Saturday night, the navy detained 43 fishermen and six boats from Rameswaram while fishing near Neduntheevu in Sri Lanka and took them to the Mylatti naval base. On Sunday, another 12 fishermen who went fishing from Mandapam on two mechanised boats were arrested on charges of fishing in Lankan waters and taken to Kalpatti naval base. Protesters said nearly 40 of the 55 fishermen are from Thangachimadam coastal village in Rameswaram and most of them are Christians. The detentions of their breadwinners less than a week before Christmas have derailed their celebrations. Fishermen’s representatives urged the Union and state governments to retrieve Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka as it is the traditional fishing ground for those from the central and southern coastal districts. They urged the government to resume bilateral peace talks between fishermen of the two countries to come out with an amicable solution. Representatives of 11 mechanised boat owner associations in Rameswaram also passed a resolution to intensify the protest if the fishermen are not released and brought home safely before December 31. Pointing out that a Lankan court had directed the detention of the men in jail till December 31, they threatened to hold a rail roko by blocking the Chennai express at Thangachimadam on January 1. Meanwhile, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, alleging that “the intention of the Sri Lankan navy is to implant fear in the minds of the fishermen and prevent them from fishing in their traditional waters.” MDMK general secretary Vaiko questioned the outcome of the four rounds of high-level talks between the governments of India and Sri Lanka in this regard so far. He asked why the government did not act as it did by summoning top officials of Pakistan high commission when a Gujarat fisherman was attacked by Pakistan navy recently. He said that Government of India should break all ties with Sri Lanka if the 55 fishermen and eight boats are not released immediately and fight for the justice of TN fishermen before the international court of justice.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/boat-owners-strike-kin-protest-for-release-of-fishers-held-by-sri-lanka/articleshow/88398800.cms||---

Physical director G Suthakar David and physical education teachers C Arul Titus and S Jesu Raj were also placed under suspension. “It is the responsibility of the physical education teachers to manage students during the intervals and lunch break. They should have regulated the students and avoided crowding at the toilet when the wall collapsed,” a diocese official told TOI.

---||Pune||More deaths in country due to bio outbreaks than disasters from 1995-2020, shows mapping||Pune: A spatio-temporal mapping by National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) has found that between 1995 and 2020, overall deaths were more due to biological outbreaks than climatic disasters. Three time-periods — 1995-2005, 2005-2015 and 2015-2020 — were selected for the study of climatic and biological disaster outbreaks in India. As per the analysis, climate disasters included floods, droughts, cyclones, heat waves and cold waves while biological disasters included diseases such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Covid-19. The research team, however, did not use the Covid data for comparative analysis, as it was not reported in any of the previous years. The Covid data was used as one event for each state in the composite analysis process in the study. The analysis showed that the total number of climatic and biological events recorded during the three periods in India were 594, 712 and 575 respectively — the latest period recording over 500 climate and biological disaster events in just a five-year period. The analysis also revealed that the incidence of dengue cases has been showing an increasing trend, with the total annual number of events increasing — 8.7 in 1995-2005 to 23.1 during 2005-2015 and 33.5 during 2015-2020. Anil K Gupta, professor coordinator of the NIDM’s technical advisory committee, told TOI, “In the latest period, the average number of dengue cases per year increased nearly four times in comparison to the 1995-2005 period. Twelve states experienced more than 20 outbreaks of JE and dengue during 1995-2020. Changes in the weather cycle and weakened immune systems could be responsible for an increase in the number of dengue cases.” The analysis showed that both the biological and climatic disasters showed an increasing trend during 2015-2020. “Among climatic disasters, drought and cyclones have shown a significant increasing trend in the latest period. None of the disasters show any decreasing trend in this period,” Gupta said. The state-level composite spatial analysis in the study showed that eight out of 36 states experienced more than 50 climate disasters during the study period. The highest number of climate-related adverse events were recorded in Rajasthan (72), followed by Odisha (67), Uttar Pradesh (66), West Bengal (66), Bihar (64), Maharashtra (60) and Andhra Pradesh (52). Gupta said, “Disaster risk reduction cannot be isolated from development plans, as lacunae in the latter are known to contribute to climate disasters to an extent. Degradation of ecosystems in the hilly regions, improper land use and reduction in wetlands play a major role in causing climate disasters. Development practices thus have to be revisited, while disaster risk reduction must be integrated with development planning.” He said biological disasters also were in a way a side-effect of climatic disasters. “For instance, areas prone to high humidity and flood situations have high incidence of JE and dengue. The report can be used by researchers and government authorities to plan new strategies or tweak the existing ones to reduce risk of disasters,” he said. As per the analysis, cyclones have accounted for 48% of India’s overall human life loss due to climate-related disasters in the past 25 years, followed by heat waves (26%), floods (18%) and cold waves (8%). The average annual number of flood events decreased during 1995-2005, while it increased during the latest period, the study team noted. Similar pattern of temporal variation was observed for droughts, cyclones and cold waves, the report said. Almost all states/Union Territories (33 of the 36 states/UTs) experienced droughts during 1995-2020. Prominent states of higher frequency included Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan, followed by Karnataka, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-deaths-in-country-due-to-bio-outbreaks-than-disasters-from-1995-2020-shows-mapping/articleshow/88399485.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Back-dated upkeep charges: Mhada gets high court rap in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday frowned on Mhada for asking a senior citizen, who got possession of a flat in redeveloped Currey Road high-rise after 45 years, to pay maintenance charges from December 2017 onwards.On Friday, the judges had directed Mhada to hand him possession of the 300 sq ft flat on Saturday. A bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar were informed by Suryakant Raut’s advocate Pradeep Havnur that while he was handed keys to the flat on Saturday, he was asked to pay nearly Rs 43,000 towards maintenance charges. Raut (74) had moved from the erstwhile Haji Kasam Chawl to the Vikhroli transit camp in September 1976. “There is no question of making any such demand,” said the judges, noting that Mhada offered an allotment only in February 2021. They said Raut will be required to pay regular maintenance from December 18, 2021 when he was given possession. Havnur said his client is allotted a flat on the twenty-third floor and prefers a lower floor. “At least 45 per cent of flats are unoccupied,’’ he said. But the judges declined to pass such a direction to Mhada. “Just because it is unoccupied, it does not mean it is not allotted (to others). We have gone out of our way. He can’t insist,’’ said Justice Patel.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Azadpur & Punjabi Bagh Chowk among accident black spots||NEW DELHI: The Outer and the Inner Ring Roads in Delhi witnessed the highest road accidents and fatalities last year. While the Inner Ring Road witnessed the highest 287 accidents with 88 deaths, the Outer Ring Road saw the highest fatalities with 100 people killed in 256 accidents, shows data shared by Delhi Traffic Police. According to the data, Azadpur Chowk and Punjabi Bagh Chowk were among the black spots identified by the traffic police that saw the highest number of 23 accidents. Azadpur Chowk also topped the chart in the number of fatal accidents with nine deaths. In 2019, however, Azadpur Chowk had only witnessed 13 accidents, while the highest number of accidents was witnessed at Mukundpur Chowk, the data showed. Further, in terms of the range-wise classification of accidents for last year, the data showed that the outer range saw the highest fatal accidents with 350 such cases reported last year. The Western range, however, stood second with 276 accidents. According to the police, black spots are accident prone spots where the frequency of accidents remains high. They are identified on the basis of concentration of accidents at a specific place. “Most of the road accidents take place due to cases of drunk driving and our officers have been briefed to ensure a crackdown on drunken driving. After a brief hiatus in breathalyzer tests due to Covid-19, we have resumed the checking and issued challans to such drivers,” said a senior traffic police officer. In addition to this, the traffic police are also focusing on night patrolling as most of the road accidents occur at night. “From 9 pm to 12 am, we have intensified our checks. Since this is the time that witnesses most accidents, we have enhanced vigil to ensure compliance of rules during these hours,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/azadpur-punjabi-bagh-chowk-among-accident-black-spots/articleshow/88399491.cms||---
---||Pune||Complaints galore about auto drivers overcharging commuters||Pune: A huge number of auto rickshaw commuters in the city are complaining about a rising trend of drivers’ refusal to ply by the meter. They are also facing demands to pay anything between Rs50 and Rs60 extra, simply because meters of less than 20% of three-wheelers in the city have been recalibrated according to the new rates, which came into effect from November 22. “Last week, I had to travel from Shivajinagar to MG Road. Around seven auto drivers refused to ply by meter, saying they were yet to be updated. They were all ready to ply without the meter and asked me to pay Rs300-400 for the trip. At last, I came across one who was ready to ply by meter, but even he took Rs50 extra, stating the same excuse. I was left with no option. This really needs to be looked into,” said Arvind Jadhav, a working professional. Early in November, the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), headed by the Pune collector, had announced increased fares for autos plying in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Baramati. The minimum fare for autos was to be Rs21 instead of Rs18 for the first 1.5km, and then Rs14 per km instead of earlier Rs12. Pune RTO officials had said that last date to recalibrate all meters to new fares is January 31. Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor told TOI, “There are around 1lakh autorickshaws in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas at the moment. Of this, around 15,800 drivers have got their meters recalibrated and approved by RTO. The RTO has come up with five special tracks in Kothrud, Ramtekdi Industrial Area, Alandi Road RTO office, near EON IT Park and at Dive Ghat, where autos with recalibration finished are tested and approved if readings are at par with new fares. The auto drivers need to contact the meter manufacturers for resetting process and then come to any of these tracks.” Commuter Kuldip Nagre, who took an autorickshaw from Pune station to Hinjewadi recently, said, “While many refused to ply by meter, they were all enthusiastic to ply without meter, and asked for a Rs600-700. When I said fare by meter would be not more than Rs250, they claimed the new fares would be that high. I ultimately just took a bus.” Pune deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane also said that drivers whose meters weren’t calibrated were to charge fares as per the old rates. “In no case are they supposed to charge more from any customer. Plying without the meter on is illegal in any case. People should approach the RTO if they have gone through such an experience — strict action will be initiated after investigation,” the official told TOI. Many auto drivers were asked about the same, but refused to answer, claiming that they always plied by the meter. Shrikant Acharya, president of the Aam Aadmi Rickshaw Chalak Sanghatana, a union of auto drivers, said the RTO was to blame for the same. “We had asked them that until all meters are recalibrated, they should allow us to use tariff cards with new rates against old rates. However, they have not allowed the same. Auto meters cannot be recalibrated overnight,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/complaints-galore-about-auto-drivers-overcharging-commuters/articleshow/88399486.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||HC dismisses plea against Metro project||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed a plea alleging inherent defects in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s double-decker viaduct project on the Pink line in North East Delhi. The plea had stated that if the project was allowed to be executed, it would create chaos and result in the cutting of thousands of 50-70 years old trees. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh, however, found not enough grounds to entertain the matter which it had disposed of earlier. The high court also noted the DMRC’s stand that the authorities have already rejected the representation made in this regard. The court had earlier directed the authorities concerned to treat the petition as representation and decide it in accordance with the rule, law, and government policy as expeditiously. The plea was filed by SD Windlesh, advocate in person, and Jain Arogya Naturocare Welfare Society, claiming that the implementation of such a badly designed and technologically poor project shall not only ruin thousands of crores of public money but also will be inconvenient to the public and create traffic problems forever if the said project is not modified or reviewed.

---||Pune||Biological, climate disasters rose in 2015-20 period: Study||PUNE: A spatio-temporal mapping by National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) has found that biological and climatic disasters put together in India were more in the five years between 2015 and 2020 than in the previous two 10-year periods (1995-2005 and 2005-2015). Also, overall deaths between 1995 and 2020 were more due to biological outbreaks than climatic disasters. Three time-periods — 1995-2005, 2005-2015 and 2015-2020 — were selected for the study of climatic and biological disaster outbreaks in India. As per the analysis, climate disasters included floods, droughts, cyclones, heat waves and cold waves while biological disasters included diseases such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and Covid-19. The research team, however, did not use the Covid data for comparative analysis, as it was not reported in any of the previous years. The Covid data was used as one event for each state in the composite analysis process in the study. The analysis showed that the total number of climatic and biological events recorded during the three periods in India were 594, 712 and 575 respectively — the last period recording over 500 climate and biological disaster events in just a five-year term. The analysis also revealed that the incidence of dengue cases has been showing an increasing trend, with the total annual number of events increasing — 8.7 in 1995-2005 to 23.1 during 2005-2015 and 33.5 during 2015-2020. Anil K Gupta, professor coordinator of the NIDM’s technical advisory committee, told TOI, “In the latest period, the average number of dengue cases per year increased nearly four times in comparison to the 1995-2005 period. Twelve states experienced more than 20 outbreaks of JE and dengue during 1995-2020. Changes in the weather cycle and weakened immune systems could be responsible for an increase in the number of dengue cases.” The analysis showed that both the biological and climatic disasters showed an increasing trend during 2015-2020. “Among climatic disasters, drought and cyclones have shown a significant increasing trend in the latest period. None of the disasters shows any decreasing trend in this period,” Gupta said. The state-level composite spatial analysis in the study showed that eight out of 36 states experienced more than 50 climate disasters during the study period. The highest number of climate-related adverse events were recorded in Rajasthan (72), followed by Odisha (67), Uttar Pradesh (66), West Bengal (66), Bihar (64), Maharashtra (60) and Andhra Pradesh (52). Gupta said, “Disaster risk reduction cannot be isolated from development plans, as lacunae in the latter are known to contribute to climate disasters to an extent. Degradation of ecosystems in the hilly regions, improper land use and reduction in wetlands play a major role in causing climate disasters. Development practices thus have to be revisited, while disaster risk reduction must be integrated with development planning.” He said biological disasters also were in a way a side-effect of climatic disasters. “For instance, areas prone to high humidity and flood situations have high incidence of JE and dengue. The report can be used by researchers and government authorities to plan new strategies or tweak the existing ones to reduce risk of disasters,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/biological-climate-calamities-rose-in-2015-20-period-study/articleshow/88399503.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Jaipur||Akshay leaves DJing, turf club & B’lore to develop infra in Raj||Before completing his B.Tech, he enjoyed fame and fortune as a DJ. He liked horse races and stock markets. By the time he turned 23, Akshay Hada had already owned a car and was living in a two-bed room flat in Bangalore. “I didn’t know my passion for mixing music would make me a DJ and sort of a celebrity in the college days. Similarly, I never imagined my flair for acoustics, lighting, and décor would lead to me designing lounges like 13th Floor, Blue Bar in Taj Westend and ICE for Taj Residency,” says Akshay.The founder promoter of Symphonia & Graphicus and Akshay Infrasys says it was a dream he was living but not without the hassles and chaos of an unscheduled life. “Sometimes, DJing would delay my return to the hostel and I would find myself spending chilly nights outside waiting for the gates to be unlocked,” recollects Hada. While DJing and watching horse races stayed with him even after the college, he started a portfolio management company (PMC) to make his day time productive. “I hobnobbed in the circles where I would often meet HNIs. The stock market in the early 2000s was taking off. Those were the triggers to start the PMC even though my understanding was limited to the blue-chip patch,” says Akshay. The ride that continued for 4-5 years was not without pitfalls. Akshay says once he lost Rs 6 lakh in a day. “The loss had shaken me. I thought giving up would mean living with the loss forever. That’s how I re-framed my thoughts,” he says. Around 2006, the magic of night life had started wearing off. His mother had developed heath issues. That’s when he learnt a delegation of the Rajasthan government was in Bangalore to attract investors. Akshay went to the meeting and floated the idea of setting up a turf club in Jaipur. “The Jagatpura Shooting Range was in the planning stage. I proposed to build a turf club. I was told enough land was not there. During that time my personal life was shifting. My mother was not well. In the meantime, I got married. All these factors came to a head before I decided to relocate to Jaipur in 2007 and stay with my parents,” recalls Akshay. He never felt enamored of a 9 to 5 job. In fact, he never made a resume for himself. Despite being a mediocre student, Akshay took interests in reading economic issues and science, while designing remained a passion from early days. In Jaipur, he got a small project in the Shooting Range and completed it even though the turf club never took off. “Between 2009 and 2012, I was trying too many things, without finding anything to settle down. I was in two minds whether to set up a company in Singapore or keep trying here. In the meantime, the state government announced they would increase warehouse capacity to another 8-9 lakh tonne in 3-5 years, which was the total capacity created since Independence. I was intrigued and participated in a tender and eventually won it,” reveals Akshay. For him, that became a turning point as one project led to another giving him the scope to introduce technological innovation in warehousing. For constructing the warehouses he depend ed on companies outside Rajasthan for pre-fabricated material. “I felt apprehensive about on-time delivery, price volatility, and logistics cost. Then I decided to set up a pre-fabricated facility of my own which led to the creation of Akshay Infrasys in 2016. Though it catered to my needs of pre-fabricated components, I started supplying to others,” says Akshay. So far, Akshay Infrasys has invested about Rs 170 crore in the Prahladpura facility that supplies pre-fabricated components to railways and highways bridges and real estate, including his own projects. “This is a first of its kind plant run on robotic automation,” says Akshay. Around four years ago, he won another contract to build elevated road in Ajmer. Akshay says, the road will be completed in record time because of his innovative infrastructure technology. Currently, both companies have a turnover of over Rs 100 crore. But Akshay says the future projects will be completely different than what he is doing now. “I don’t want to do similar projects time and again. What I am looking at now is building bridges that connect hills without cutting them. Even aircraft can land on them. Traditionally, mountains are cut and roads are paved, but that is uneconomical, time-consuming and environmentally damaging,” says Akshay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/akshay-leaves-djing-turf-club-blore-to-develop-infra-in-raj/articleshow/88399529.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

He urged applicants to attach all required documents while getting approvals as most of the time delay happens due to absence of some documents. “There are certain procedures before the application reaches the senior officials for approval. If the relevant documents are unavailable, the application will be put on hold, resulting in delay,” he said.Instructions have already been given to officials to ensure that they collect all required documents from applicants. Officials should not raise the issue of absence of documents in the later stage of the approval process, the minister said. The minister received petitions from the public in the grievance camp and listened to some of their issues.S P Thiyagarajan, an activist, urged the minister to cancel the 2019 order which allowed promoters to calculate open space reserve (OSR) land for each site after deducting the space allocated for roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/single-window-system-for-building-approvals-soon/articleshow/88398856.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Where garbage collection vehicles fuel corruption||In an internal audit of diesel used by door-to-door garbage collection vehicles, the city corporation officials have found out a difference of more than Rs 2.8 lakh of fuel being used excessively in August when compared with September this year.The corporation operates GPS-fitted garbage collection vehicles in its five zones. The audit was carried out in the central zone where 29 GPS-fitted light commercial vehicles are used.Deputy commissioner of city corporation Dr M Sharmila said that they compared the drivers' claimed distance and GPS data for the month of August in the central zone with the month of September.While the difference between drivers’ claims and GPS data worked out to be 3,376 litres of diesel in August, it nosedived to 66 litres in September. As per the logbook, 3,376 litres of diesel had cost Rs 2,81,790 for the corporation. The GPS data revealed that drivers often deviated from given routes.The drivers had been making a fast buck by siphoning off the corporation’s funds in this modus operandi for many months. The corporation has employed its own staff as well as people on contract to drive these vehicles.Following the revelation in the central zone, officials are checking the GPS data of other zones of the city corporation.“The reduction in the fuel use was made possible because the vehicles were monitored using GPS on a daily basis and fuel was rationed accordingly,” Sharmila said.A driver on the condition of anonymity said most drivers operating light commercial vehicles are contract staff. Only a handful of them are regular staff. He said drivers alone cannot be blamed for the pilferage.The corporation operates 209 light commercial vehicles, of which 145 are fitted with GPS.An official in-charge of vehicles said that diesel is supplied to each vehicle through private bunks tied up with the civic body. Each vehicle involved in door-to-door collection makes three trips a day, covering around 60-70km. There will be two conservancy workers in each vehicle apart from the driver. Each vehicle covers the same distance every day. Sanitary inspectors, who are in-charge of the vehicles, issue tokens for fuel everyday based on the distance covered by them.The average mileage of these vehicles is around 10km per litre. But vehicles, which were purchased before 2013 might give one km less, he said.Graphic:Total number of light commercial vehicles used for door-to-door garbage collection – 209Number of vehicles fitted with GPS – 145Number of vehicles to get GPS – 17Each zone has 29 GPS-fitted vehiclesAverage mileage expected from the vehicles is 10km/lA process of fixing fresh routes for each vehicle underwayIssues noticed through GPS analysis in central zone:August 2021:Distance claimed by drivers: Around 64,060kmDistance travelled as per GPS device: Around 33,760kmDifference in distance – 30,300kmSeptember 2021:Distance claimed by drivers: Around 22,660kmDistance travelled as per GPS device: Around 22,000kmDifference in distance: 660km||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/where-garbage-collection-vehicles-fuel-corruption/articleshow/88398869.cms||V Devanathan

---||Jaipur||Pravin returns to roots, an ‘eventful’ life||If lack of livelihood opportunities forced Pawan Kumar Joshi to relocate to Mumbai from native Ramgarh Shekhawati, his son Pravin looked for opportunities to return to his ancestral land. He was born and brought up in Solapur in Maharashtra, but it is Rajasthan that gave Pravin the feeling of his motherland. “We had most of our relatives in Rajasthan. I would never miss a wedding in the extended family to come here. Before a few days of every visit to my village, I would develop a restless longing,” says Pravin explaining why he shifted to Jaipur in 2004 despite setting up his first institute for events management in Mumbai a year before. The tourist town then was getting noticed as a wedding destination. But the events industry was limited to two-three players. Service providers were always on a short supply. Pravin not only saw a future for his institute in the city but an end to his diasporic alienation. “In fact, I thought if weddings were going to be a new attraction, the same infrastructure can be mobilized for other events. In that case, I thought, the talents that would come out of my institute would find opportunities in other sectors as well. Actually, that’s how it panned out,” recalls Pravin. As the hotel industry started expanding a couple of years later, corporate events, conferences, and exhibitions came along. Today, Praveen says 80% of its alumni are entrepreneurs who are marketing, curating and executing events of all kinds. After setting up a centre of Nest Academy of Event Management and Development (NAEMD) in Jaipur, he opened a couple of them in Ahmedabad and Delhi. From diploma courses, he started offering BBA and MBA in event management certified by Central University. In 2017, he went overseas with an institute in Dubai. “Rajasthan always had hotels and havelis to attract events. But few knew the potential in the absence of service providers and entrepreneurs who could market them. In that way students passing out of our institutes played a role in really expanding that market,” says Pravin. Pravin is now planning to introduce sports management in Jaipur. He is aware that the new mega cricket stadium being constructed will open up a number of opportunities. “After IPL, kabaddi, and others, sports management is emerging as a new opportunity. The events industry ecosystem can perfectly compliment any sports activity. But we want to create entrepreneurs who are specialized,” says Pravin. Industry estimates suggest the weddings, corporate events, exhibitions, and conferences is over a Rs 5,000 crore market in Rajasthan today. Recently, it has emerged as a new destination for webseries shootings. ‘The attractions of tourist town always add to the events,” says Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pravin-returns-to-roots-an-eventful-life/articleshow/88399541.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The Portuguese ordered inquisition in 1561, under which more than 300 Hindu temples were demolished. The CM said Shree Mangueshi temple had its origin in Kushasthali or modern-day Cortalim, which fell to the invading Portuguese in 1543. “Our ancestors moved the Manguesh linga from the original site at Kushasthali to its present location at Mangueshi. The Portuguese had demolished many temples in Goa, but our ancestors built those temples again,” he said. Goa celebrated the 60th anniversary of its Liberation on December 19. Sawant said an app for tourists has been developed by the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC), using which tourists can find a destination of their choice on their own. “Once they reach Goa, the tourist has to only enter the type of tourism they are looking for in the app. They can search for spiritual, hinterland or beach tourism and they will get all the relevant destinations in Goa. If they search for spiritual tourism and they click on Mangueshi temple, they will get the route as well, and there is no need for them to rely on anyone else,” said the chief minister. Sawant said the revamped tourism infrastructure inaugurated at Shree Mangueshi temple will enhance tourism capacity of the site. “In phase one, we have completed basic facilities like the toilet block, tourist information centre, parking, illumination and shops. Soon we will complete phase two, which will include a food plaza, community hall and cottages for visiting tourists,” Sawant said. The phase two works are being taken up at a cost of Rs 28 crore, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-to-start-rebuilding-temples-destroyed-by-portuguese-cm/articleshow/88420166.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

---||Jaipur||Shailander quits job in Pune to craft a new journey||Sikar boy Shailander Kumar is unlike the past generations who left Rajasthan in search of jobs and businesses and made their adopted land a native place. After his PG diploma in marketing in Pune in 2007, Shailander worked over six years with Vodafone there but he was sure to return home and start a business. “When I came back to Sikar in 2013, real estate was booming. I did two projects and made some money. Fanusta is a discovery that I made through a casual talk with an artist who sold me a wall painting for my office,” recalls Shailander. From the conversations, he understood that the artists don’t know the price of their creativity. This is mainly because they neither had market access nor the design innovations that could have fetched them a better price. “I realised that there is a hugely untapped market. I travelled to many places in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Assam to understand their work. Later, I put together a pool of more than 300 craftsmen and artists with whom I can work with,” says Shailander. He met craftsmen engaged in wooden handicraft, pichwai art, blue pottery, marble inlay, mosaic artwork, miniature painting, caning artwork, terracotta, tarkashi, honeycomb paper art, wrap and weft rope work, and distress finish, among others. Shailander says, “Since I wanted to marry age-old mastery with new-age design to create aesthetically functional decor, home utility and furniture, I hired a team of designers and architects who worked with the artists. Initially, I sold them on ecommerce platforms on a revenue sharing basis with the artists. But one day, a call from the Taj group of hotels opened another avenue. They needed wall paintings, and other décor items. That became the beginning of our business-to-business segment.” Shailander says it is not easy to convince artists to adopt innovation. “They have been doing this work for generations. They are also not sure if the new designs will find a market or not. Thirdly, they were afraid of losing their traditional skills,” says Shailander. He also financed the craftsmen who did not have money to buy raw material and gave a higher revenue share to those who were ready to supply. Shailander says, “Today we work with about 80 craftsmen regularly. Through this work, I am able to rediscover and celebrate traditional art and crafts by introducing them into modern living through curation of space designs, with an infusion of modern interpretations of art and craft.” In 2018, he forayed into interior designing for offices, showrooms, retail outlets and even homes. “I have now opened four experimental stores in as many cities like Jaipur, Pune, Kota and Sikar. The pandemic delayed our rollout. But in the next one year, we will be present in 10 more cities. Fanusta will also enter the overseas market with a store in Sydney very soon,” says Shailander. While he did not give details about Fanusta’s revenues, for Shailander revenue is just a byproduct. “Fanusta was started with an aim to bridge the gap between local artisans and customers through the medium of art. That’s why I gave up opportunities in real estate and devoted myself fully to it,” reveals Shailander.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/shailander-quits-job-in-pune-to-craft-a-new-journey/articleshow/88399558.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Delhi||Delhi: 36-year-old from Jammu and Kashmir murdered at Greater Kailash-I home, police suspect personal enmity||NEW DELHI: A 36-year-old man from Jammu and Kashmir was allegedly murdered inside his rented accommodation in S-Block of Greater Kailash-I on Monday. Police suspect personal enmity behind the crime, but have not ruled out burglary. On Monday, the PCR got a call in which the caller claimed that his tenant was lying unconscious inside his flat. “A team rushed to S-Block and found the victim, Rahul Thakur, who lived with his mother Anita on the ground floor, lying unconscious. He was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead,” said an officer. The house is owned by an advocate and his family lives on the first and second floors. DCP (South) Benita Mary Jaiker said Thakur worked at Dilli Haat Art Gallery. “He had taken the house on rent just a month ago. His mother had gone to their native place 3-4 days ago. Police have seized three mobile phones from the spot,” added the officer. Jaikar said preliminary inquiry suggested that he was strangled and police were waiting for the postmortem examination report to get clarity. According to residents, a maid came to the house in the morning and found Thakur’s door open. “The maid got suspicious and told the owner of the house. They rushed to the ground floor and then informed the police,” said a resident. A source said police had recovered CCTV footage in which they saw a white-coloured car entering the society around 1am and leaving around 3am. The vehicle stopped near Thakur’s house and a few people came out of the car. “We have identified a few suspects based on the footage,” an officer said. The DCP and additional DCP of South district also reached the spot in the morning. The source said there are five gates in the society. Four were closed and only gate number 2 was open. “The car entered the society from this gate. Seven cameras are installed there. Police are also checking whether the vehicle was a taxi,” added the source. The entry gate register has been seized by police and they have not ruled out burglary. So far, nothing has been found missing from the deceased’s house. Police are probing the role of people known to Thakur. “The deceased was the vice-president of an art gallery. We have picked up a few suspects for questioning,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/36-yr-old-from-jk-murdered-at-gk-i-home-police-suspect-personal-enmity/articleshow/88399559.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Now, live-track bus, check crowd status from home via BEST app||MUMBAI: Now, you can plan your BEST trip from home by checking on your phone if the bus is crowded or not. On Tuesday morning, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray will launch BEST’s mobile app ‘Chalo’ and a smartcard which is NCMC-(National Common Mobility Card) compliant, the undertaking announced on Monday. The app will provide information about the live location of a bus, its expected time of arrival at the bus stop and how crowded or empty it is. Commuters will be able to choose their route and make travel plans before leaving home so that by the time they arrive at the bus stop, they are ready to board the bus of their choice. Commuters can make e-payment for the ticket in advance via the purse in the mobile app. “The new app will be commuter-friendly. While standing at a bus stop, passengers can also find out the various routes for their destination. Sometimes, it is not possible for people to remember bus numbers, route and frequency; the app will be their guide,” said BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra. He added that commuters can opt for the newly announced “super saver plans” and travel anywhere on the BEST network within the fare stage they have selected. Passengers will also have the flexibility to use AC or non-AC buses as long as the fare stage of their plan is valid for the trip, Chandra said. Each plan offers passengers a specific number of trips for a fixed price. Prices are as low as Rs 1.99 per trip and based on a combination of fare stage, number of trips, and duration of the plan. They start from a one-day plan going all the way up to 84 days, and from two trips to 150. Chandra said that the smartcard will be formally launched on Tuesday, but it may take a couple of days for distribution. “The mobile app will be functional from Tuesday and one can access its features for a comfortable bus travel across the city,” he added. The ‘super saver plans’ will replace the distance-based, stop-to-stop passes wherein passengers had to choose a specific starting and ending stop and could travel only between those two stops. Passengers also had to choose AC or non-AC service for their pass.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-live-track-bus-check-crowd-status-from-home-via-best-app/articleshow/88399569.cms||Somit Sen

This was the second highest package in IIM-N records. Also, the sixth postgraduate programme (PGP) batch achieved 100% placements, with the highest number of students — 204 — appearing for job interviews. The 2020-22 batch was the first to adapt to hybrid mode as some students were attending classes in-person and others in online mode. The campus placements too were held in virtual mode, a press release by IIM-N said. Educational institutes couldn’t resume full-fledged in-person teaching due to Covid-induced restrictions in these two years. A jump was seen in average and median package offered this year. The average stood at ₹14.94 lakh per annum — an increase of 13.24% compared to last year, and the median package for this year is ₹15.42 lakh per annum — 18.61% increase compared to the previous year. “We could close the placements for this year almost two-and-a-half months earlier than last year,” read the release. Recruiters across various sectors like consulting, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), consumer durables, ed-tech, e-commerce, analytics, and logistics participated in the drive. Consulting and IT emerged as the sought-after sectors, followed by BFSI & FMCG/FMCD, with more than 60% of the batch opting for companies in these sectors. The current year also witnessed participation from logistics, e-commerce, conglomerate, ed-tech, with more than 15% of the batch choosing profiles in these sectors. Strategy and consulting followed by IT analytics were the most sought-after roles by the students. Apart from these, the students were offered prominent roles in marketing, finance, and operations domains. This year also witnessed participation from 45 first-time recruiters. “IIM Nagpur is uniquely located in the heart of the industrial hub at the central point of India. IIM-N’s ecosystem has once again proved ‘make-a-difference’ is the only way to grow faster,” said institute director Bhimaraya Metri. “The outstanding performance for the second successive year is an acknowledgement of the effort and training put up by the students and the faculty. The combined efforts have enabled us to have one of our most fruitful years,” said Nilesh Gupta, chairperson of career development services (CDS).

---||Delhi||HC: Crime within family confines has element of sin||New Delhi: Crime within the closest confines of family has to it the element of sin, Delhi High Court has said, awarding a life term under IPC Section 377 to a father and his friend for indulging in and enabling sexual assault of his minor daughter. “We do not hesitate to repeat, to sexually violate an innocent child is, in any case, an abhorrent act; but, when that happens within the filial father-daughter relationship, of which purity of affection is a sine qua non, the act descends to a different depth of depravity,” a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup J Bhambhani observed. “Without at all appearing to be Biblical, crime in society is one thing; but crime within the closest confines of the family adds to it the element of sin. Such acts must be dealt with the requisite level of severity,” they added. The court was shocked to note that the so-called uncle also indulged in anal penetration and, therefore, it upheld conviction under section 377 IPC. It observed the acts committed by the uncle, in connivance with her father, went beyond the physical element of sexual assault and caused trauma that might linger for very long. It added that it was evident from the prosecutrix’s stand that her father consciously and intentionally gave to the uncle access to her and also committed acts short of “digital penetration”. The court also defined the ambit of “carnal intercourse” as mentioned in IPC 377, pointing out that act must involve penetration other than penile-vaginal penetration. Hearing an appeal by the duo, the high court also modified the trial court order saying the offence of gang rape couldn’t be sustained. The offence dated back to 2012 when the much more stringent amendments to criminal law involving sexual crimes had not been enacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-crime-within-family-confines-has-element-of-sin/articleshow/88399574.cms||Abhinav Garg

Speaking to the media after landing at Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial), Rai said that Kerala government is advocating appeasement politics. Rai reached Kerala to pay homage to Sreenivasan, an advocate by profession and a state committee member of the BJP, who was hacked to death by a group of assailants near his house in Alappuzha on Sunday morning. The murder happened hours after the murder of SDPI state secretary K S Shan on Saturday. Rai said that the law and order situation in Kerala was ‘bad’ as the government is protecting criminals involved in the killings of two political leaders, including Sreenivasan, in Alappuzha. “We demand a fair investigation into the case. The culprits must be punished. There is no law and order enforcement in Kerala and the situation is really bad. The government is doing appeasement politics for their gains. They are protecting the criminals involved in the murders. Over the last few years, more than 200 BJP workers have been murdered in Kerala,” he said. Rai said that the state government aims to crush the growing popularity of BJP in Kerala and the increase in the public support for it. “They try to stop the growth of BJP by whatever means it takes. For this, the government is protecting those involved in the killings,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/union-minister-seeks-fair-probe-into-ranjiths-murder/articleshow/88398900.cms||---

He was 77 years old. Joshi, originally an art teacher, was also a movie enthusiast. This eventually got him into movie making. He used movies as a tool to bring about social change. Joshi found fame after the release of his Hindi directorial debut 'Sutradar' in 1987. Starring Nana Patekar, Girish Karnad, Nilu Phule and Smita Patil, the movie made a lasting impact. The movie depicted the rural life and the atrocities by landlords. Another Marathi movie 'Nirmala Macchindra Kamble' about a woman sarpanch directed also gained acclaim. After his stint as director, Joshi turned to movie activism and was one of first few to start a film festival in Kolhapur. The choice of movies in the film festivals by Joshi found dedicated supporters of not just Indian parallel cinema, but also foreign films of all genres. Recently, Joshi was engaged in organising another film festival. Due to stress, he got hospitalised where he breathed his last. Joshi's followers, well wishers are going to organise a funeral procession before he is cremated at the Panchganga crematorium on Tuesday. Joshi is survived by three sons, including eminent actor Hrushikesh Joshi, a daughter and grandsons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/director-art-teacher-chandrakant-joshi-passes-away-at-77/articleshow/88398898.cms||---

According to the decision taken at a cabinet meeting on Monday, admissions will begin for its four-year integrated programmes from the 2022-23 session. “Today, the Delhi cabinet approved the establishment of Delhi Teachers University. The university will prepare highly qualified and well-trained teachers in Delhi itself,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference after the meeting. “As per the commitment, Delhi Teachers University Bill 2021 will be placed before the Vidhan Sabha in the coming session. It will be a public university dedicated to prepare excellent-quality teachers for the city across different school stages,” he said. The campus will come up at Bakkarwala in west Delhi. During the 2019-20 budget speech, finance minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the education minister, announced the setting up of the institute, which will enable research in the field and designing of teaching programmes. The university will offer four-year integrated teacher education programmes like BA-BEd and BSc-BEd along with other programmes. Kejriwal said the vice-chancellor and the teachers of the university would be of global repute. “The students of the university will be attached with Delhi government schools for the entire duration of their course to get hands-on experience. The university will operate as a multidisciplinary academic centre that brings together varied stakeholders,” he added. “Delhi Teachers University will be a centre for excellence in teacher preparation at both pre-service and in-service levels in the areas of education studies, leadership and policy. It will engage in world-class teaching and research in emerging areas of teacher education to achieve excellence in school education through national and international collaborations,” the chief minister said. The university will work towards bridging the gap between practice, research and policy in teacher preparation while constantly engaging with the dynamic concept and realities of quality education in Delhi, he added. It will also act as a centre that will bring together varied stakeholders — practising and aspiring teachers, teacher educators, parents, administrators, policy planners and content developers — in a dialogue through a range of programmes and activities. The university will be the third specialised university to be set up by the Delhi government. This year, Delhi Skills and Entrepreneurship University admitted its first batch of students, while a sports university, which will have weightlifter Karnam Malleswari as its vice-chancellor, is also being built.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-cabinets-nod-to-setting-up-a-teachers-univ/articleshow/88399577.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Carlos Almeida resigns, says Manohar Parrikar loyalists being finished by BJP||PANAJI: On a day BJP national president J P Nadda arrived in Goa, the two-time party MLA from Vasco, Carlos Almeida, resigned from the assembly and also from the party on Tuesday, accusing it of “systematically finishing Manohar Parrikar’s loyalists”. Almeida said he is hurt by the manner in which the party has treated him, as proposals mooted by him for the development of Vasco were not cleared. “When former CM Manohar Parrikar was there, we used to work cordially, but after the demise of Parrikar, we are lost. All his loyalists are gone. The party is systematically finishing Parrikar’s loyalists,” he said. Almeida is the second BJP MLA to resign from Mormugao taluka, the first one being Alina Saldanha, who represented Cortalim constituency for two terms. In the 2017 assembly election, BJP had won all four seats in Mormugao taluka. Almeida has not announced on which party’s ticket he would seek re-election from Vasco constituency. However, he said, “I have met representatives of TMC." On November 30, former independent candidate from Vasco, Krishna ‘Daiji’ Salkar joined BJP, making it clear that Almeida would be denied the party ticket to contest the upcoming assembly election. “There are a lot of reasons to resign from the party. BJP doesn’t want me anymore. They said that I am not well and not capable. They have sidelined me,” Almeida said. He also resigned from the primary membership of BJP. He said that he has been conveyed that Salkar will be given the ticket. The two-time MLA said that he had exposed the alleged comunidade land scam involving Salkar, who was recently inducted into BJP. “They have asked me to work under him. How can I work under him?” Almeida said BJP is claiming that he is not in a position to win the election. He said that in the last municipal election, out of 11 wards, “we have won nine”. “We have won the semifinal, and the final would be easy to win against BJP,” he said. Almeida said BJP is no longer strong in the state. Recently, Almeida had demanded that the party should give 35% of tickets to the minority community, as per the formula Parrikar implemented in the 2012 assembly elections. Almeida had also demanded action against the minister involved in alleged sex scandal as it is denting BJP’s image. Recently, Cortalim BJP MLA Alina Saldanha resigned as MLA and later joined AAP to contest the upcoming election. In the Goa assembly, BJP’s strength has reduced to 25 following the resignation of two MLAs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/carlos-resigns-says-parrikar-loyalists-being-finished-by-bjp/articleshow/88420206.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED slaps money laundering case on smuggler of red sanders||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money-laundering case against red sanders smuggler Badshah Malik and picked him for questioning on Monday. Malik’s questioning continued late at night. The ED also searched his office at Kurla and home. The ED’s case is based on a smuggling case registered against Malik in 2015 by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI). Malik has been involved in red sanders smuggling for many years and had faced arrest in similar cases on the earlier occasion. Export of red sanders is banned. According to the DRI’s case, in 2015, they arrested Harshavardhan Hegde, director of Mumbai-based Emirates Shipping Agencies India Pvt Ltd, after intercepting a container at Nhava Sheva and recovered 7,800 metric tonnes of red sanders worth Rs 3.2 crore. Later, Malik was arrested. The DRI also investigated Andhra Pradesh-based red sanders smuggler Vijay Poojary in the case. Poojary would allegedly arrange supply of red sanders and Malik, with the help of Hegde, would export them along with the company’s other consignment. Malik had also faced arrest around two decades ago in another red sanders smuggling case. “But every time, he continues his activities after being released from jail on bail,” said a source from the Enforcement Directorate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-slaps-money-laundering-case-on-smuggler-of-red-sanders/articleshow/88399586.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Jagan Mohan Reddy to launch OTS in West Godavari today||AMARAVATI: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy will launch Jagananna Sampoorna Gruha Hakku (OTS) scheme in Tanuku town of West Godavari district on Tuesday. The chief minister will formally kick-start the process of completing the registration of document at ward and village secretariats during the public meeting. The chief minister will also interact with the beneficiaries from the public meeting venue. The scheme will be simultaneously launched in all the 175 assembly constituencies on Tuesday, which happens to be the birthday of Jagan Mohan Reddy. The ruling YSRCP legislators, leaders and cadres are making massive arrangements to celebrate the chief minister’s birthday on grand note along with the beneficiaries of OTS across the state. The West Godavari district administration has completed arrangements for the distribution of registered documents for 20,000 beneficiaries on Day One. The state government had recently announced the One-Time-Settlement (OTS) scheme for all those who secured loans under various housing schemes in the past three days. The government had decided to waive entire loan amount with a nominal payment of Rs 10,000 in rural areas, Rs 15,000 in municipal towns and Rs 20,000 in municipal corporation cities. Although opposition parties, particularly TDP, have been trying to rallying behind those opposing the OTS scheme, the government seemed to have convinced a good number of beneficiaries by explaining the advantages of the scheme. According to initial reports, about 8.5 lakh people have already enrolled under OTS and more are expected to join in the next few days. “This scheme will give the beneficiaries full rights over their property as we are giving them the registered document by clearing all the loans. They will be entitled to secure fresh loans, mortgage, sell the property in need or inherit them to their legal heirs with full rights,” said housing minister Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju. He said that the government is waiving loans to the tune of nearly Rs 10,000 crore and providing relief to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore by waiving registration charges. He said that the beneficiaries of old housing loans were unable to sell their properties or get fresh loans due to the litigation over pending loans. He said that the scheme was not designed to mop up revenues but to get rid of the poor from the decades-long trouble over their properties. The minister said they were also removing the assets from prohibitory lands register (22-A) to enable further registrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-to-launch-ots-in-w-godavari-today/articleshow/88398124.cms||Samdani MN
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Amid opposition protest, BMC panel clears Rs 1.8k crore road repair proposal||MUMBAI: Amid much uproar, the Shiv Sena-led civic standing committee on Monday cleared road repair proposals amounting to Rs 1,800 crore. The BJP, a former alliance partner of the Sena in the BMC, sought details on the status of the earlier road repair works done before sanctioning new works. But the Shiv Sena and Congress pushed for passing the proposals stating that there was already a delay caused in new road repair works for the year. BJP group leader Prabhakar Shinde said almost all the new road work contracts were being given to contractors who had quoted steeply below estimates. He said the administration must answer a few questions on the previous road repair works before the panel sanctioned new tenders. “The civic administration had cancelled the earlier road repair tenders stating that they were steeply below estimates. But this time again the contractors have quoted 13-27% below estimate. At such low rates, how can we expect contractors to deliver good quality works?,” asked Shinde. BJP-nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat, meanwhile, said that while there is a provision for a quality management agency to be appointed but no one to check the credentials of such agency. “Also, when would such an agency be appointed?,” he said, adding that the proposal lacked clarity. However, opposition party leader in the BMC and Congress corporator Ravi Raja said that in a year when civic elections are scheduled to be held in barely a few months, there was no point delaying the works and stalling the proposal. He was supported by two-time Congress corporator Javed Juneja, who said that the proposal should be passed as many road repair works have been kept pending for too long because of procedural delays. Shiv Sena party leader in the BMC Vishakha Raut said that while it’s important for road works to begin, it’s also important that a standard policy be made stating to what extent can contractors quote below estimates. “The civic body cannot keep retendering and it is important for works to start on ground too,” said Raut. Additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, who was present at the meeting, informed the panel that good quality works would be maintained while undertaking the repairs. However, BJP party members who were dissatisfied with the Sena-led panel passing the proposals walked out of the meeting to mark their protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-amid-oppn-protest-bmc-panel-oks-rs-1-8k-cr-rd-repair-proposal/articleshow/88399576.cms||Richa Pinto

They claim that night patrolling in the area has decreased, but Delhi Police has refuted the allegation. RWA president Mahesh Gupta said about 5,000 people live in 1,100 apartments. “The society is covered with CCTV cameras, but there are only seven private guards. We don’t have sufficient guards due to lack of funds,” he added. He claimed that 20 days ago, the windowpanes of two cars were broken and a house was burgled a few days ago. “The house belongs to an 80-year-old retired teacher of a private school. She is currently in the USA,” said Gupta. Another resident, Sanjiv Gupta, said they recently met the station house officer and raised the issue of night patrolling, but the police officer told them that they had limited staff. “We have sent an alert message to all residents to protect their SUVs because thieves are mostly targeting such vehicles,” he added. Asked about the lack of patrolling in S-Block due to shortage of staff, DCP (South) Benita Mary Jaiker did not reply to the query. However, a senior police officer said they were taking several steps for the safety of residents. “Residents should not be worried. All efforts are being made to keep the area secure,” added the officer. Asked about burglary in the house of the 80-year-old woman, the officer said nothing as such had occurred. Sonali Chaudhary, another resident, said crimes can take place with anyone, so security should be increased. “Patrolling should be increased and people should also cooperate in ensuring safety and security of the locality,” she added. Other residents said many people had lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and had taken to crime to sustain themselves. Varun Garg, general secretary GK residents’ association, said back-to-back crimes had been reported from Greater Kailash in the past month, which was a matter of serious concern. “Patrolling needs to be increased, especially at night. Residents should pay their RWA subscriptions so that more security guards can be hired,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/s-block-residents-say-patrolling-at-night-down-in-area-cops-refute-claim/articleshow/88399580.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Man pays Rs 50 lakh ransom to rescue son, probe on||NEW DELHI: A 20-year-old man was allegedly abducted at gunpoint by an unidentified man from Ghazipur Mandi in east Delhi on Friday. The man was let off only after three hours when his father paid Rs 50 lakh as ransom amount for his release. Police are trying to identify and arrest the suspect, senior police officers said. No arrests have been made in the case so far. The victim has been identified as Kinshuk Aggrawal, who works at his father’s banquet hall in Delhi. According to the police, on Friday morning, Aggarwal, along with two of his father’s employees, went to the flower mandi to buy flowers for an event. “Around 7.30am, when he was sitting in the car alone, the accused sneaked inside the car and pointed a pistol at him. He then forced him to drive towards Ashok Vihar. On their way, he asked Aggarwal to call his family and arrange for Rs 1 crore as ransom amount,” said a senior police officer. Aggarwal’s father, Vikas, tried to negotiate as he begged the accused to let his son off. “The accused, however, threatened to kill Kinshuk if the money was not paid. Finally, he settled for Rs 50 lakh and directed Vikas to reach Ashok Vihar with the money. The accused met him near a school and forced him to sit inside the car. He then took the bag and asked the father-son duo to drop him near Mukarba Chowk around 10.40am, from where he fled with the bag,” the officer said. DCP (east) Priyanka Kashyap said that they received a complaint on the next day of the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-pays-rs-50l-ransom-to-rescue-son-probe-on/articleshow/88399579.cms||---

According to the settlement, Devraj Singh and his sister Lalitya Kumari, the grandchildren of Maharani Gayatri Devi, will get back the luxurious heritage property, Jai Mahal Palace hotel, from their step uncles while they forego their stake in Rambagh Palace in favour of their uncles. Devraj Singh and Lalitya Kumari, children of late Jagat Singh, Sawai Man Singh’s lone child from his marriage with Gayatri Devi, will get back their inherited properties after the amicable settlement. Vijit Singh and his brother Jai Singh, sons of late Prithviraj Singh, Sawai Man Singh’s son from his marriage with Maharani Kishore Kunwar, agreed to hand over the Jai Mahal Palace hotel to Devraj and Lalitya according to the settlement arrived on December 15. The two will become the sole owners of this majestic property which is being run as a hotel by the Tata Group under a management contract. They will in turn forego their shares in the Rambagh Palace entirely in favour of Jai Singh and Vijit Singh. The Jaipur royal family members, who had stakes in personal properties that included luxury hotels and other immovable properties, decided to go for an out-of-court settlement following Supreme Court’s direction. This followed years of legal battle contested in various courts, including the National Company Law Tribunal. The Supreme Court had appointed retired SC judge Justice Kurian Joseph as a mediator to work out a solution. Following the settlement, Justice Joseph presented the documents before the Supreme Court. After studying the same, the court accepted the same and passed the order that would be binding on all the stakeholders.

---||Goa||Political agendas should not ruin our future: PWD enggs||Panaji: Engineers selected for posts in the public works department (PWD) on Tuesday rubbished claims by political parties and politicians that they had bribed their way through the selection process and maintained that their futures should not be ruined due to political agendas. They, however, said that they would not hinder any inquiry and urged that it be completed as fast as possible. The engineers had come to meet chief minister Pramod Sawant to request that he complete the recruitment process which has been kept on hold after Panaji BJP MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate last week charged PWD minister Deepak Pauskar of “selling engineer posts”. Monserrate had added that the recruitment scam in the department was “worth at least Rs 70 crore”. Pauskar had dismissed the allegations. The chief minister, however, was unavailable on Tuesday and is expected to meet them at a later date. Sneha Desai, who was a part of the delegation, asked why the recruitment process had been kept on hold when it was done through proper process. “We have not been selected by exerting influence but on the basis of merit. I have done my Masters. As per the list, I am third. Yet, people are making allegations against us and it appears that they are questioning our degrees. We have not obtained our degrees just like that; we have studied hard for them,” Desai said. Last week, Sawant had ordered an inquiry into the alleged PWD recruitment scam. Till its completion, the recruitment process for over 350 posts will be kept on hold. “A three-member committee has been formed to inquire into the matter,” Sawant had said. “The committee consists of principal secretary Puneet Kumar Goel, special secretary (vigilance) Ankita Anand and the director of vigilance.” All the opposition parties had demanded a judicial inquiry considering that Monserrate, along with two other MLAs, had said he has evidence of bribes given.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/political-agendas-should-not-ruin-our-future-pwd-enggs/articleshow/88420330.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Delhi man held for Rs 35L daylight robbery on WEH||MUMBAI: A 34-year-old Delhi man has been arrested for a daylight robbery on Western Express Highway (WEH) where a businessman’s SUV was smashed and Rs 35 lakh in cash was robbed earlier this month. Police said Pankaj Mishra, the arrested accused who had prepared the strategy, was handpicked for the job by a Gujarat-based gang of five. The gang is still on the run. On December 13, garment businessman Sandeep Gurjar, 32, had picked up a bag of cash from a contact at Malad’s Diamond market and placed it on the backseat of an SUV. Around 5.15pm, the car reached WEH at Kandivali with Gurjar’s friend at the wheel. Two men on a bike collided with the four-wheeler from the rear side. Gurjar got out of the SUV and went behind to check. He found an individual lying on the ground, pretending to be severely injured. Meanwhile, another motorcycle came up and the two men on it approached Gurjar's friend at the wheel. They started arguing with him about the “road crash”. While Gurjar and his friend were still talking to these men, a third motorcycle arrived and its two occupants were carrying rods. They smashed the window panes of the SUV and fled with the bag of cash. By the time, Gurjar and his friend came rushing to the car to check, the other motorcyclists had also left. “We formed four teams and checked surveillance footage from more than 100 cameras. Mishra was tracked down to Chara Nagar in Ahmedabad,” DCP Somnath Gharge said. The police recovered Rs 11 lakh from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-delhi-man-held-for-rs-35l-daylight-robbery-on-weh/articleshow/88400062.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Retired RFO threatens hunger strike against illicit tree felling||Nagpur: In an unprecedented move, a retired range forest officer (RFO) and deputy sarpanch from Akola have threatened to launch hunger strike from December 22, against the department’s failure to act against an ‘influential’ farmer and forest staff for their involvement in illicit felling of 59 teak trees on reserve forest land in Alegaon range. Talking to TOI, complainant former RFO KD Shriwas, who worked in Alegaon for 14 years, and deputy sarpanch of Pahadsinghi village in Patur tehsil, Uttam Khule, said in Navegaon village in Alegaon range, the forest department has 651 hectare reserve forest land. Adjoining the forest area, farmer Prakash Dakhore owns 1.40 acre agricultural land while his kin Laxmi Dakhore owns 3.36 acre land. “On March 15 this year, Dakhore sought permission to fell 72 teak trees claiming these to be on both the farms. The forest officials granted permission to cut these trees without visiting the spot. Tree felling started the next day and 67 trees were felled. Of these, 59 trees measuring 150 cm in width were felled on forest land and only 8 were on the farmers’ land. Five trees are still standing on forest land,” said Shriwas. Both the farmlands are tribal lands and while disposing trees on such lands, the forest department should have monitored the tree felling. However, bogus documents were prepared by the contractor and forest trees were shown as private property, said the ex-RFO. “Such huge teak trees can only be seen on forest lands. How can such small pieces of agricultural lands have so many huge teak trees where farming is also done?” asked Shriwas. He says the survey of Dakhore farms was done in 2010. However, the latest survey done by the forest department in 2021 doesn’t match with the earlier one and nowhere it says the trees were standing on the farmers’ land. The ACF put his hammer on the felled timber on May 5, and deputy conservator on May 7. Akola deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Arjuna KR tried to downplay the issue saying, “The forest surveyor’s report is not acceptable to the farmer. Hence, a joint inspection is being planned with the involvement of taluka land record (TLR) officer to demarcate the boundaries.” “We have seized the timber logs and kept them at the forest depot. If found that there is an encroachment on forest land, then action will be taken against Dakhore,” said Arjuna. Shriwas alleged that forest officials’ involvement cannot be ruled out because of the delay in taking action. “I have sent six letters and reminders to the DyCF demanding action, but even after nine months, the culprits are moving scot-free. When the inquiry officer & ACF HP Padgavhankar visited the site in August, he found that hammer marks on 16 logs were scratched raising suspicion,” said Shriwas. DyCF Arjuna says, “The hammer marks were scratched as there was doubt whether the timber was a private property or forest.” Shriwas says the forest surveyor and the inquiry officer had again visited the site on November 12 and found that 64 trees that were felled were on forest land. He demanded to file FIR against those involved. Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president, Sarpamitra Nisarga Sanwardhan Bahuuddeshia Sanstha, Akola, demanded immediate action against the ACF and RFO who granted permission to fell these trees without verifying whether the trees belonged to the private party or forest department. “Illicit felling is rampant in the district by private contractors who are hand-in-glove with sawmills owners,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/retired-rfo-threatens-hunger-strike-against-illicit-tree-felling/articleshow/88399593.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Till reports came in last, total 10 crore plus doses had been administered in the state. While above 6.4crore jabs were the first dose, 3.6crore were the second dose. “With this, 88.5% of the state’s eligible population have got at least one dose while nearly 49.1% have been completely vaccinated,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer (SFWO). The state had achieved the nine crore jab mark on November 25. On Monday, the state had about 1,67 crore vaccine doses in its stock. Total 4,760 vaccination sites, including 4,546 government sites, were put into action during the day, from where above 5.4 lakh doses were dispensed. For the past few weeks five to six lakh doses had been administered daily on almost all days of the week. Health officials said that the door-to-door campaign have also pushed the drive ahead. While the campaign helped find out those, who had missed the second dose, it also brought many to the vaccination centre for the first dose. “As for the first dose, nine health districts, including Kolkata, have already achieved above 90% coverage. While the first dose coverage for 10 districts stands at 85% to 89%, that in five other districts is between 80% and 84% and it is between 75% and 79% in two districts. It is 72% to 79% for four other districts,” said the SFWO. Apart from Kolkata, the other best performing health districts include Nandigram, Jalpaiguri, Bankura, Jhargram, North 24 Parganas and Darjeeling. Stress is being given to the districts with below 80% first dose coverage. Meanwhile the plan to introduce ZyCoV-D in the state has been kept on hold for now. The Centre had planned to role this fourth vaccine out from seven states including Bengal. “The ZyCoV-D roll out plan is on postponed for now. The plan is being re-worked,” said Das Malakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-crosses-10cr-jab-mark-half-of-state-completely-vaxxed/articleshow/88398919.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

He said that neither the chief minister nor the state police chief have any control over the police force and it is the CPM that is ruling the police stations by making the senior officers mere spectators. “The presence of communal forces inside the police force has put the law and order in the state in a dangerous situation and the home department is giving all support to the communal forces by allowing the police to allege terrorist influence in the protests against the government by the opposition,” Satheesan said. The BJP and the SDPI are trying to create a communal divide in the state, and it is the government and the chief minister who are embracing both the majority communal forces and the minority communal forces who have taken the state to this situation, the opposition leader said. He said that the murders in Alappuzha were not just political murders, but communal as well. He demanded that the government should become ready to bring the forces like RSS and the SDPI under control. If the chief minister is continuing to please the communal forces for political gains, the state civil society will have to face serious consequences, Satheesan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cm-dgp-have-lost-control-over-police-says-satheesan/articleshow/88398934.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC stays work on mega solar project in Sambhar||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan High Court on Monday ordered Hindustan Salt Ltd to refrain from any further action to set up the 4,000MW solar plant in Sambhar lake in view of the environmental damage and ecological imbalance the project would create. On December 11, TOI had reported that Sambhar Salt Ltd, the subsidiary of Hindustan Salt Ltd, had invited expression of interest (EoI) from solar power developers for setting up the mega solar plant. Amicus curiae R B Mathur applied for a stay on the project attaching a copy of the TOI report along with the EoI for the project. “The court took note of the Times of India report published on December 11 and listened in detail to the arguments before passing the order that Hindustan Salt Ltd can receive the applications in response to the EoI but cannot take any further action,” Mathur said. The court was prima facie satisfied with the concerns raised in the application and the TOI report before passing the order, Mathur said. TOI had reported that over 16,000 acres would be required to set up the 4,000MW plant. This would mean setting up solar panels in large swathes of land. It is feared that such a large-scale project on the wetland could wipe out the ecosystem with all its genetic diversity. Currently, no single entity is responsible for the management of Sambhar. But the multi-departmental Sambhar Development Agency, which is awaiting the law department’s approval, is expected to play a key role in protecting the wetland and creating a sustainable model for development for the benefit of local communities. A solar project of similar capacity was first proposed by former prime minister Manmohan Singh in 2013 when he had come to Jaipur to campaign for the party in the run up to the state elections. After Vasundhara Raje came to power, the project was junked as it would damage the wetland’s environment and ecosystem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-hc-stays-work-on-mega-solar-project-in-sambhar/articleshow/88399589.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis directing govt agencies to target me, says Nawab Malik||MUMBAI: NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik on Monday targeted leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis, saying the former CM was directing Central agencies to act against him. Terming Fadnavis as the “mastermind,” Malik said there appeared to be a conspiracy against him and his family members, but he was not scared and was determined to “expose Fadnavis over rampant irregularities and corruption during his tenure as CM.” “I suggest he gets himself appointed as the OSD (officer on special duty) for Central agencies in Mumbai, and he should appoint Kirit Somaiya as spokesperson for the Central agencies. Fadnavis has huge experience as, during his tenure, a record number of OSDs were appointed by him,” Malik said. Fadnavis did not respond to Malik’s allegations. Malik alleged that during the last seven years, Fadnavis has been giving directions to the Central agencies to take stringent action and issue notices to political rivals. “Central agencies had issued a show-cause notice even to NCP president Sharad Pawar and now, I am on the radar of the Central agencies at the instance of Fadnavis,” Malik alleged. Malik said that even if Fadnavis “misuses” Central agencies, he would not be able to topple the democratically elected state government led by Uddhav Thackeray. “The MVA government is firm in the saddle, if Fadnavis takes steps for dislodging it, it will be a futile exercise,” he said. Malik reacted sharply to Union home minister Amit Shah’s statement in Pune that Uddhav Thackeray should quit and be prepared for fresh elections. “Pahale aap, you resign first, since the Lok Sabha elections were held much before the state assembly elections in 2019. First you resign, you will not be able to regain power, and it will be a humiliating defeat for the NDA, while the MVA will win elections with a huge majority,” Malik said. Malik alleged that Central agencies were also being misused in poll-bound states like Uttar Pradesh, where “prominent leaders of opposition parties are being raided.” On Sunday, Malik had tweeted that “official guests” would visit his residence and that he was ready to welcome them with tea and cookies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-cm-directing-govt-agencies-to-target-me-says-malik/articleshow/88399604.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Over 6,600 girls saved from wedlock in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Over 6,600 child brides were rescued before the solemnization of their marriages in various parts of state since 2015. However, activists claim that some child marriage incidents go unnoticed in parts of AP while some are prevented by them with the help of police, women and child welfare and other departments. Despite parents’ best efforts to conduct the marriage of a child secretly, recently, officials foiled their attempt after receiving alert from activists. When the officials reached the village and inquired, the girl’s parents claimed that their daughter was not a minor. “Our inquiry revealed that the girl was a minor and the marriage was stopped,” the officials said.  In parts of the tribal pockets in the state, parents marrying off their minor daughters is not a rare occurrence. In some cases, girls don’t even know what a marriage exactly is but the parents perform the marriages, an activist said. “Child marriage continues to be prevalent in Andhra Pradesh, including in some urban pockets. Unless we get concrete information about such incidents, it is difficult to prevent them,” he added  Kritika Shukla, director of women development and child welfare, said they have rescued 6,622 minor girls from underage marriages in the state in the past seven years including 1,065 children in 2020 and 725 in 2021 “Centre’s decision to increase the age of marriage for girls will provide better opportunities to them to complete their education and gain financial independence before getting married. Delayed motherhood will also lead to better nutritional status for women as anemia, malnutrition and maternal mortality have been found common in younger mothers. It’s a good step towards equal opportunities for women,” Kritika Shukla said.  Officials said after the prevention of child marriages, follow-up action is also being taken by the department. Anganwadi workers are tracking each case with the help of gram/ward mahila samrakshana karyadarshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/over-6600-girls-saved-from-wedlock-in-ap/articleshow/88398136.cms||Nalla.Babu

There are about 3,100 POs in Ludhiana commissionerate as of now. In the past few days under a special drive, the police delisted 40 POs and have initiated the process for 80 more.According to the officials, most of the proclaimed offenders hail from other states. They come to the city, execute crimes and escape to their states, making it tough to trace them. As per the information received from the PO wing of the Ludhiana commissionerate, there were 3,093 POs till November 30. Of these, maximum 622 were in the cases of cheating /forgery, followed by 370 in thefts/ snatching, 299 in NDPS Act cases, 195 in Arms Act cases, 167 in burglaries, 162 in Excise Act cases, 152 in kidnapping, 137 in murder and 137 in robbery cases, among others.Deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Varinder Singh Brar said, “In the wake of the elections, the city police are nabbing the proclaimed offenders to maintain law and order in the city. In the past few days, 371 POs were arrested under a special drive. The PO wing and other special teams are on the job to nab the remaining.”  “We have started another drive to delist POs who have petty offenses against them registered decades ago. For example, if a person was declared a PO in 1980 in a case and at that time his age was 30 years, at present he would be 71-year-old. We are excluding such people from the PO list,” he added.The PO wing had prepared a list of 120 such people, who have cases like cheating, accident or armed with a knife against them. Of these, 40 have already been delisted and the file of 80 is pending with the district administration. The official said the DC has the power to delist the POs. However, even after being delisted if the person gets arrested, his file will reopen and the proceedings would start against him. About reasons for the delay in arresting them, an official of PO wing said, “Over 50% of the POs hail from other states. They execute crimes here and escape to their home states. Thus, they remain untraceable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-start-delisting-pos-facing-petty-old-cases/articleshow/88398164.cms||Payal Dhawan

Plans were made to get postponed since last year because of the pandemic and the members of the community were happy that they could finally get together at the Maidan tent of the club, which has indoor facilities at the Government Place East. The celebrations will continue throughout the year and will bring out the best of Anglo- Indian food, music and dance traditions that have been part of the Kolkata kaleidoscope since the British times, explained the president of the club and former Anglo- Indian MLA, Shane Calvert. The club was formed in 1896 and known as the Calcutta Naval Volunteers’ Athletic Club. Its first president was Captain E W Petley and secretary, LMK Macmillan. Petley remained the president of the club till 1898. Macmillan continued as the secretary when the club transformed into the Rangers Club. “We are an athletic community and we needed a club for our sports and games. We also needed space to hang around, sing and dance along with wine and dine. Rangers Cub has given the opportunity to the community to stay socially united in a unique way,” Calvert said.  “Our records show that initially, the entrance fee to club was Rs 5 and annual subscription was Rs 4! We have an interesting history to rummage through.” said Blossom Rae, social secretary of the club. “Only Anglo Indians and Europeans domiciled in India were allowed to become members at that time. These days we have associate members from outside but the club remains exclusive to the community as far as voting rights are concerned,” Rae added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rangers-club-celebrates-125-years-of-journey-with-food-music-dance/articleshow/88398937.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The irrigation department said it was not wise to put the blame on the state government without giving required clearances despite their repeated appeals. Senior officials, who were present at the DDRP meeting held in virtual mode on Monday, lashed out at the central authorities for not taking initiative for the speedy disposal of permissions and approvals. The officials said the 3D physical model study was not finalized for measures to be taken up on upstream side of spillway till December 2020 from the commencement of the project in March 2013. The officials from Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) visited the project site and readied the 3D model only after the contractor firm, Meil, stationed officials in CWPRS to coordinate with the authorities. The 3D model study was completed in March 2021. “As per the finalized 3D model study report of CWPRS, the quantum of work of several components has been increased abnormally than provisioned.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Communal forces trying to tarnish state’s image: CPM||Thiruvananthapuram: CPM’s state secretariat, on Monday, asked the public to keep a vigil against communal forces that are making deliberate attempts to mar Kerala’s image of being the state with the best law and order system in the country. In a statement issued here, the state secretariat said ‘two communal forces, engaged in the fight to annihilate one another, should put an end to the brutal political murders they commit. Those with a secular mindset should come forward against this ‘fire play’ by communal forces. “Under LDF rule, Kerala is the best state in the country in terms of law-and-order situation. Communal forces are hell bent on breaking this good will. Their aim is to spread religious hatred, create a grudge, divide one another and thus pave the way for communal riots. Social media is misused to meet this objective,” the statement read. The assassinations within a gap of few hours in Alappuzha challenged humanity and peaceful living. “While BJP cadres knocked down SDPI leader from his scooter and murdered him, SDPI workers ransacked a BJP leader’s house and hacked him to death. These attacks are part of the attempts to scuttle peaceful living in state,” the party state secretariat said. CPM said it was good that state administration and police swung into action against the attackers immediately after the murders. CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s statement that strict action would be taken against those who committed the murders indicated the government’s resolve against regressive forces, it said. CPM state secretariat said it was amusing to note that those who were behind the violence themselves were accusing the LDF government for the violence. BJP national president JP Nadda’s statement that Kerala has become a state of lawlessness reflects the political objective of BJP. “It’s the same sound of BJP that resonates in the voice of Congress leaders,” it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/communal-forces-trying-to-tarnish-states-image-cpm/articleshow/88398944.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Banning futures in 7 agri items gets flak from farm activists||Nagpur: The government’s decision to ban futures in seven agriculture commodities has raised concern among farm activists who say this would ultimately hit the farmers who could have benefited from higher prices of the items. The move, however, got support from spokesperson of Bharaitya Kisan Union (BKU) which had been leading farmers’ agitation in Delhi against the three farm laws. BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik told TOI that the union has been against futures in farm produce because it rigs the prices to disadvantage of farmers. “Market operators bring the prices down at the time of harvest benefiting the traders. After farmers end up selling the produce, the rates are jacked,” he said. The move draws flaks from outfits including the Shetkar Sangathana which had supported the three farm laws now withdrawn by the government. It’s being said that banning futures goes against the government’s own policy of dismantling price control regime, which was aimed through the laws. Even as the decision is aimed at reducing price of commodities, it would to be at the loss of farmers, said experts. The Centre through a notification issued late on Sunday has banned futures trade in non-basmati paddy, wheat, chana, mustard seeds, soyabean, crude palm oil and moong. Crops like soyabean and chana concern the farmers in Vidarbha. The cultivators here were expecting better returns due to soyabean prices touching Rs9,000 a quintal this year. A section of farmers are still holding on to the produce hoping for the rates to jump again. Currently, soyabean is in the range of Rs6,500 to Rs7,000 a quintal, said sources. Vijay Jawandhia, a veteran activist from Wardha, said that if the move may help consumers, it would affect the farmer also by bringing down the prices. “The government wants to link farmers to a high cost economy but keep their income low. It may not be possible to match the segment to high social cost due to such decisions” said Jawandhia. “Instead of banning futures there can be other controls like upper circuit if the prices go beyond a certain level,” he said. Shetkari Sangathana president Anil Ghanvat said the decision is expected to have a straight impact on the farmers’ income. He said farmers were hoping to profit out of soyabean prices which are now expected to slip even below the MSP. “The poultry lobby is already pushing for lower soyabean prices because it is the input for chicken feed. The decision will also benefit oil millers, now it is to be seen whether the reduction is passed on to the consumers,” said Ghanvat. There are already reports including government data that chana is expected to be in surplus, which means that the rates would come down after the harvest. “So, is it with mustard seeds,” he said. Meanwhile, soyabean prices were reported to have slid to Rs4,600 in Washim The average rate, however, remains in the range of Rs6,500 to Rs7,000 quintal. On the other hand, Chana is already ruling below MSP in Vidarbha’s markets. At Rs4,350 a quintal, it took a hit of Rs150 on Monday. The MSP is at Rs5,230/quintal. Kishore Tiwari, the chairman of Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, also flayed the decision.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/banning-futures-in-7-agri-items-gets-flak-from-farm-activists/articleshow/88399621.cms||Shishir Arya

Gastroenterologist Dr Saurabh Mukewar and his team performed this operation. With this, Midas has become only the third centre in the world to perform this procedure for the treatment of this condition, claimed doctors. “This girl had severe constipation since she was born. She would have one bowel movement per week. She tried various medications for constipation but had no relief. She was diagnosed with ‘Hirschsprung’s disease’ after undergoing evaluation at Midas,” said Dr Mukewar. Hirschsprung’s disease is a rare condition usually presented in childhood with severe constipation. There is a loss of nerve supply to the lower part of the large intestine. This results in the inability of muscles to relax and, therefore, the stool cannot pass across this segment resulting in blockage of stool in the intestine. Typically, management of this disease requires surgery in one or two settings. “PREM is a novel endoscopic procedure which is incision-less, scarless and painless. This was initially performed and described by Dr Amol Bapaye in Pune,” said Dr Mukewar. PREM involves creating a tunnel in the wall of the large intestine with a flexible endoscope and cutting the affected muscle. Following this, the stool can easily pass across the affected segment and the patient gets relieved of constipation. “In this particular patient, 25cm of the affected muscle in the lower part of the colon (large intestine) had to be incised, which is the longest reported till date in the world,” Dr Mukewar claimed. The patient is doing well now. She is having one bowel movement per day and no complications have been noticed in her follow-ups. Generally, Hirschsprung’s disease is diagnosed in paediatric patients only. This case was rare again because the girl was suffering for 19 years without a diagnosis. According to doctors, there could be such patients in rural parts of Central India. Rare diseaseHirschsprung’s disease is a rare condition that affects the large intestine and causes problems with passing stool The condition is presented at birth as a result of missing nerve cells in the muscles of the baby’s large intestine Surgical pull-through is the current standard treatment but causes morbidity Per-rectal endoscopic myotomy (PREM) is a novel third-space endoscopy technique currently available at only 3 centres in the world PREM was initially performed and described by gastroenterologist & endoscopist Dr Amol Bapaye in Pune Now, Dr. Saurabh Mukewar performed it in Nagpur, with 25cm incision, the longest reported in this kind of surgery to date in the world||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/unique-surgery-at-city-hospital-ends-mp-girls-19-year-old-severe-constipation-ordeal/articleshow/88399619.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Cabral was speaking after unveiling a plaque for laying of underground cabling for Mapusa town. Also present were Mapusa MLA Joshua D’Souza, chairperson of the Mapusa Municipal Council Shubhangi Vaigankar, chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni and others. The work order for underground cabling has already been issued and the project, costing Rs 117 crore, is set to be taken up in a phased manner. “The recent cyclone Tauktae created a lot of problem in the state as many wires got damaged due to uprooting of trees. With the conversion of overhead electricity lines to underground cabling, the problem of trees falling on wires will be greatly resolved,” Cabral said. Making a pitch for solar power, Cabral said, “The state government has a scheme for providing subsidy for installing solar rooftop panels wherein people can generate their own electricity and receive lower electricity bills. I urge the people of Mapusa to avail the benefit of this subsidy,” Cabral said. He further said that the electricity department is planning to generate more solar energy through fitting of solar panels. Meanwhile, D’Souza said that since electricity consumers in Mapusa had increased manyfold due to which there was an urgent need to upgrade the electricity infrastructure in the town and that it was only after constant follow-ups that the works of underground cabling commenced. “Work might take time to get completed, but I can assure the people of Mapusa that they will benefit from this underground cabling,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cabral-urges-people-to-use-subsidy-install-solar-panels/articleshow/88420323.cms||---

A notification was issued under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, prohibiting academic activities before 9am in all schools. “The decision was taken to avoid adverse effects on the health and life of children due to the falling temperature, especially in the morning hours. Strict instructions have been issued to the district education officer (DEO), sub-divisional officers (SDOs), block development officers (BDOs) and the SHOs to ensure compliance of the order,” Singh said. The DM added all schools were at liberty to start the classes only after 9am by rescheduling the timings for academic activities as per their convenience. Seema Singh, principal of St Karen’s High School, said the school administration has decided to held classes from 9am to 1.30pm from Tuesday onwards instead of the usual 8am to 1.30pm time slot. Duration of each class will be reduced from 40 minutes to 30 minutes,” she added. Mary Alphonsa, principal of Don Bosco Academy, said, “There will be winter break in the school from December 21 to January 4.

Out of these, 27 murders were political murders, as per the records presented by the government in the assembly. In a reply to a question by MLA Anwar Sadath in January this year, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the 27 murders occurred in 24 incidents. But at the same time, the government has chosen to evade questions regarding political affiliations of the victims and the culprits. Another question regarding political murders in the state during the tenure of the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government asked by Sulthan Bathery MLA I C Balakrishnan six months ago still remains unanswered. Three questions were asked as an unstarred question on June 7 this year - how many political murders happened in the state from May 25, 2016, till May 3, 2021 in the state, the political affiliation of the victims and the culprits in each of such cases, and in how many cases the court has pronounced the verdict. However, all the three questions remain unanswered. “More than six months have passed since the question regarding further details of political murders was raised by me in the assembly. No answer has been provided yet by the chief minister. The next step is to issue a notice to the speaker for breach of privilege as it is a member’s right to receive answers to the questions raised by them, within a stipulated time frame,” Balakrishnan said. Usually, the questions are accepted by the legislature secretariat from the MLAs 10 days before the assembly session begins. These are then sent to the concerned administrative departments in the Secretariat and are then forwarded to the field departments for collecting the information. Since the information submitted as answers in the assembly have to be precise, in many instances, information will have to be collated from multiple departments which may take time, leading to an inordinate delay in returning the answers. The answers for questions regarding the political murders can be easily availed from the police department as the case records are well maintained at the respective police stations. “It has been insisted that the delayed answers should be filed along with a delay statement in the assembly in the same session, or at the latest, on the first day of the next session. Even this timeframe is not met in some cases,” said sources in the legislature secretariat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-evasive-on-political-affiliation-of-victims-culprits/articleshow/88398960.cms||---

The VC is the prime accused in the scam in which an FIR was registered by the SUV on November 16. The four university officials were arrested after several hours of interrogation in Patna. Pushpendra is a non-FIR accused in the scam. Sources said the four were involved in irregularities in connivance with the VC and could have tampered with records if not arrested. The VC had proceeded on leave a couple of days after SVU’s raided his premises on November 17. The vigilance sleuths had unearthed disproportionate assets worth Rs 3 crore amassed by the VC. There is no information yet if the VC has resigned or the chancellor’s office has taken any decision to sack him. SVU ADG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said the four MU officials were arrested in Patna after thorough interrogation. “They will be produced before the court soon,” he added. Sources said the investigations revealed that Jainandan had connived with the VC in buying books for the university without any tender. “The proctor also connived with the VC in committing financial irregularities. They showed a high number of private guards in files while actual count was less in the university. They withdrew more money in lieu of paying salary to guards as per their numbers in files. Actual remuneration to guards was meagre,” a source said. Sources said Vinod connived with VC in buying e-books worth around Rs 2.5 crore while there is no e-library in the MU. “The purchases were made on VC’s direction and by diverting funds from examination section in an unauthorised manner. MU’s inquiry report submitted to SVU made it clear that Pushpendra had not signed the payment order, but signed the cheque through which payments for e-books were made,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rs-30cr-scam-mu-registrar-proctor-and-2-others-held/articleshow/88397794.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Dehradun||‘Sequential intermittent damming’ cause of Chamoli flash floods, says Uttarakhand disaster authority||DEHRADUN: A team of the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority (USDMA) has attributed February's flash floods in Chamoli to ‘sequential intermittent damming’ – referring to the recurrent obstructions in the rivers and streams of the Dhauliganga valley in Garhwal. Satellite-based observations had earlier attributed the floods, which took over 200 lives, to an avalanche along with remobilisation of trapped water from the debris of an earlier, unnoticed avalanche in 2016. However, the USDMA, which has conducted the only on-field study on the disaster so far, said that the Dhauliganga valley, which has always been vulnerable to river blockades and related floods, was impacted by recurrent obstructions. "The flash floods can be attributed to sequential intermittent damming at three different places, Raunthi Gadhera stream being dammed first in its upper reaches, Rishiganga river dammed subsequently to the north of Murunna, and the Dhauliganga river being dammed around Raini village at the upstream of its confluence with Rishiganga river," said the report, which has been published in the Journal of Environmental and Earth Sciences. The USDMA team claimed that the floods would not have been as devastating as they were had this not been the case. Two hydropower projects located at Rishiganga (13.2 MW) and Tapovan (520 MW) were damaged during the floods, which occurred during the winter season when the discharge of the glacier-fed rivers remains minimal. No rain was experienced in the region around the time of the incident. Piyoosh Rautela, executive director of USDMA, told TOI, "The initial suggestions on the cause of the flash floods made by Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, and Planet Lab were based on satellite images. They attributed the incident to an avalanche and the remobilisation of trapped water. However, we found evidence of previous damming or blockades on the left bank of the Dhauliganga river on a road section, close to the hot spring at Tapovan. The same could also be seen on the right bank of the Raunthi Gadhera, upstream of its confluence with the Rishiganga river." Elaborating on the observations further, Rautela said, "Geomorphic conditions in the Dhauliganga valley can cause river blockades and the same is testified by field evidence of damming at two places. The damming facilitated the accumulation of enough water despite the discharge of the Rishiganga river being cut off. It explains the devastating floods during a lean flow season.” The report also said that the flood history of the Dhauliganga river and evidence of previous damming were ignored while planning the hydropower projects. Rautela said that a comprehensive database of previous disasters was recommended to establish the hazard profile of the area. "Risk assessment should accordingly be undertaken. It must account for extreme events with a long recurrence period. This should be a mandatory legal requirement for all major developmental projects in the Himalayan region," he said. The USDMA team further said that the floods would not have been as devastating as they were if the warning systems in the area were better. In its report, the team recommended a "legally-binding disaster risk-assessment regime, along with robust warning generation and dissemination infrastructure for all major infrastructure projects in the region."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sequential-intermittent-damming-cause-of-chamoli-flash-floods-says-ukhand-disaster-authority/articleshow/88397460.cms||Gaurav Talwar

While the authorities have seized one engine worth Rs 40,000 used for running such a boat as a part of the crackdown, experts have pressed for more action. “The action against fuel-driven boat was taken near the Khamgao area of Newasa taluka of Ahmednagar district. An offence has been registered against an unidentified person under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” acting divisional forest officer Amit Mishra said on Monday. TOI recently carried reports on rampant use of fuel-driven boats for fishing at the sanctuary, leading to irrevocable damage to the local biodiversity and habitats of different birds. Senior birder Dilip Bhagat from Paithan, where the sanctuary is situated, said there was presence of multiple fuel-driven boats for fishing in prohibited area. “Taking action against only one boat and moreover not naming any individual while registering the offence is an eyewash by the forest department. Massive crackdown against violators is expected if the food-chain at the sanctuary has to be maintained,” he said. Yadav Tarte-Patil, member of Maharashtra State Wildlife Board who had complained about the blatant violations at Jayakwadi bird sanctuary to state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, said all-out action was needed to protect the sanctuary. “We are not against the local fishermen or farmers, but the biodiversity of the sanctuary must be kept intact at any cost. The forest department should take help of the police and voluntary groups to weed out the menace of illegal fishing as well as the wetland farming at the sanctuary,” he said. The experts have also pressed for ‘Ramsar’ tag to Jayakwadi bird sanctuary in order to protect it from irreversible dam being incurred due to the ongoing rampant violations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/forest-dept-seizes-fuel-driven-boat-at-jayakwadi-bird-sanctuary/articleshow/88397474.cms||Prasad Joshi

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Shree Cements plans Rs 1.5k crore plant in Guntur||AMARAVATI: In a prize catch, AP has roped in Shree cement group, one of the leading cement makers of the country, to set up its plant in state. The company announced investment of nearly Rs 1,500 crore in the new plant coming up in Guntur district. Shree Cement managing director HM Bangur and joint managing director Prasanth Bangur met chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at the camp office on Monday. The company came out with the big-ticket project after consultations with the chief minister. The new plant is coming up in Pedagarlapadu village of Dachepalli mandal in Gurazala assembly constituency. This is first plant of Shree Cements in AP.  Speaking to the media, HM Bangur said chief minister had been relentlessly working for the welfare of the people of the state. “The CM is working like a CEO of a firm and devising strategies for the overall development of the state. The CM is very particular about industrialisation of the state to provide big employment to the youth,” said Bangur. He said AP would definitely catch big growth under the dynamic leadership of Jagan as he has a vision to attract investment. He said tthey have decided to invest around Rs 1,500 crore in the new plant in AP only after seeing the commitment of the chief minister to encourage the industrialists and investors. He said they would be spending close to Rs 20 crore on wages to their staff in the plants which accounts to the tune of Rs 70 lakh per day. He said the CM is very keen to improve the revenues of the state, people and investors. He said the state could get better revenues only through attracting big-ticket industries. Prasanth Bangur said the big cement plant would not only bring direct employment to the locals but also indirect employment to several hundreds of people in the vicinity. He said they were targeting to complete the plant within 24 months from the commencement of the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/shree-cements-plans-rs-1-5k-cr-plant-in-guntur/articleshow/88398225.cms||Samdani MN
---||India||Informed ‘late’, opposition plans to oppose poll reforms bill in Rajya Sabha||NEW DELHI: Within hours of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill 2021 being passed amid protests in Lok Sabha on Monday, opposition parties decided to oppose it in Rajya Sabha and boycott the Business Advisory Committee meeting “called in a hurry” to slot time for it on Tuesday in the Upper House. When marshals came in around 5pm to inform floor leaders in the Upper House that a BAC meeting has been called by the Chair at 5.30pm on Monday, TMC MPs decided to oppose the bill and not attend the meeting at such a short notice. They walked out of House in protest and Congress members led by Leader of Opposition Malikarjun Kharge followed and so did CPI, CPM, RJD, AAP, SP, NCP, Shiv Sena, IUML, DMK, MDMK among others. Most opposition parties have decided to oppose the legislation and demand the bill to be sent to a Joint Select Committee. TMC chief whip in Rajya Sabha Sukhendu Sekhar Ray told TOI, “Now it seems 12 opposition members were expelled from the House with a clear motive — to pass this Bill in the last leg of the winter session.” CPM reacted saying, “This bill has the danger of violating both secrecy of the vote undermining the principle of secret ballot and the fundamental right to privacy.” Congress Lok Sabha MP Manickam Tagore said, “The government introduced the bill at 12.15pm and passed it 2.45pm, without discussion. MPs were given no time to move amendments.” Alleging that “everything has been done in a hush-hush manner and in extreme haste,” Ray said, “first, no scrutiny of the bill by Standing Committee was done. Second, there was an attempt to influence the Election Commission as PMO asked its functionaries to join a meeting which is unprecedented. Third, suddenly the BAC meeting was called today for allocation of time for this Bill,” on why TMC and other parties are against the bill.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/informed-late-opposition-plans-to-oppose-poll-reforms-bill-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/88400532.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Nagpur||Clearing exams as easy as playing mobile games||A key item on this diarist’s bucket list is getting admission into a postgraduate course. Despite having a Master’s in mass communication, getting an MSc or law degree remains an unfulfilled dream. Hope has been rekindled with the advent of mobile phone examinations. Attempted in the comfort of home, mobile exams have brought a revolution of sorts in Maharashtra’s results. In the 2020 summer exams held by Nagpur University (NU), an unbelievable 99% students cleared the papers. Never in the university’s history had its results crossed 50% before. This happened due to the ease of solving exams on mobile phones in the absence of monitoring. This diarist wrote a series of articles on students getting promoted to the next class without a test of their ability. Having covered education for one-and-a-half decades, never have the government and universities gone out of their way to pass students. It was difficult to hold offline exams due to Covid, but there are other ways to conduct them. Exams like JEE and NEET were held around the same time in online format at exam centres. If these can be held without compromising on quality, why is the government spoiling this generation? Top academics expressed their disappointment over the method. NU office-bearers too endorsed the stand, but expressed inability to do anything as they were directed by the government. Most students are happy with mobile exams as they are passing effortlessly. If an exam’s practical component bears 20 marks, someone scoring 14 there will clear the paper. Even a zero in theory will not matter. In objective-type questions, blindly clicking on the same option in all 40/50 questions yields at least four-five correct answers. This diarist has reported that students who had been failing for a decade cleared their exams in the last two years. NU passed the responsibility of conducting failure students’ papers to colleges, who used the ‘golden opportunity’ to clear backlogs of their students. NU officials were also elated as they did not have to set papers for repeaters. In the summer 2020 exams, final year students needed a 25/50 score to pass. There was no negative marking and hardly any monitoring as many students sat together to solve the paper. NU tightened the passing criteria slightly after some news reports, but it failed to make a big difference. The winter 2021 exams are being held in the same way, despite the easing of Covid conditions. NU should have been able to conduct its exams on the lines of JEE and NEET, by using college computers to maintain quality. There were calls from readers and friends from the city and other places, asking how did NU pass all the students. Many asked whether they could resume their education, which they had left midway. This is the reason for the diarist’s wishing to have secured admission last year and adding a fourth degree to one’s qualifications. By this time the third semester would have been cleared, and passing the fourth semester would have been guaranteed due to online mobile exams, which arguably are NU’s biggest failed experiment.

The event was organized by Punjab Vatavaran Chetna Lehar, a social organisation of environmentalists and religious leaders. Many eco-activists, including Padma Shri Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal, Padma Shri Sant Baba Sewa Singh, Padma Bhushan Bibi Inderjit Kaur of Pingalwara, were present on the occasion. In the demand letter, they have asked the political leaders to make environment the main issue in the upcoming elections. Ranjodh Singh, president of Ramgarhia Educational Council, said through this congregation they want political parties to spell out in their manifestos how they would tackle the worsening air pollution. Seechewal said, “It is high time we join hands to save natural resources that are on the verge of extinction. We are calling upon all NGOs, social organisations and political parties to join us in this noble cause.” Inderjit Kaur said environment must be the top priority as health of citizens was deteriorating and “medical facilities can never be enough when a polluted environment is causing diseases”.Only two politicians, BJP state vice-president Parveen Bansal and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from Atam Nagar constituency Harish Rai Dhandha, were present there, but they failed to convince the gathering about their seriousness and the plans to improve the environment. The activists have now decided to appeal to the voters in each district to raise the issue of environment with the candidates when they come for campaigning. “It is very sad that political leaders did not turn up for the event, which shows their lack of seriousness. I had called some of them personally,” Seechewal said. KS Pannu, former chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), said groundwater depletion in the state was alarming and the surface water was polluted mercilessly. The governments lack political will to take action, he added. Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja of Bhai Ghanaiya Cancer Roko Seva Society and Naroa Punjab Manch said, “Many in south Punjab are suffering from cancer. The situation is extremely bad and toxicity in the environment is causing the disease. All the toxic effluents thrown into Buddha Nullah by residents and industries mix with the Satluj water and flow from the taps of homes in south Punjab and it is their only source of drinking water. This is a violation of their fundamental right to live guaranteed by the Constitution and a genocide, but politicians hardly care.”Jaskirat Singh of Public Action Committee said, “The politicians have been ignoring the environment issues, so we provided this platform to give them a chance to fix their mistake.” However, Bansal and Dhandha said they would implement the green manifesto, but could not provide concrete plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/environmentalists-religious-leaders-put-forth-green-manifesto-for-polls/articleshow/88398239.cms||---

The SC order came after police sub-inspector Gorakh Chavan, one of the parties affected by the HC ruling, had filed a special leave petition through advocate Sudhanshu Choudhari. In the matter before the HC, businessman Ram Waregaonkar had sought compensation on the ground that police acted illegally, harassed him and illegally took from him the legal documents on the basis of which he was entitled to recover Rs6.5 lakh he had given to his contractor friend Sanjay Ambhure in January 2015. Waregaonkar had twice taken up the harassment issue with the then Aurangabad police chiefs before moving the HC. The HC had then observed, “…instances of present nature are increasing day by day. It is none of the business of police to take such steps against people who can take legal recourse for enforcement of their right in civil court.” The HC, while directing the state to deposit the compensation amount within 45 days from the date of order, had kept it open for the state to proceed against the police chiefs at the relevant time when the harassment occurred and the PSI and fasten the responsibility on them in respect of the amount which the state was required to pay in the proceeding. As a consequence, Amitesh Kumar, who was the Aurangabad city police chief from April 27, 2015 to April 28, 2017 and Yashsvi Yadav, who succeeded him and was the police chief till March 15, 2018, were facing the HC directive, besides PSI Gorakh Chavan who moved the apex court for relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sc-sets-aside-high-courts-order-asking-cops-to-pay-rs-7l/articleshow/88397479.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The meeting, scheduled to be held on Monday evening, was postponed after district BJP leaders informed collector A Alexander that they would not be participating as the meeting coincides with the funeral of Ranjith Sreenivasan, who was killed in an attack, allegedly by SDPI workers. The district collector had on Monday morning decided to change the timing of the meeting to 5pm. However, the BJP district leaders maintained that the deceased was dishonoured by delaying the autopsy and said that they would be boycotting the meet. The leaders also said that the BJP was not against the all-party meet intended to maintain peace in the region. Later, the district collector decided to postpone the meeting to Tuesday. Earlier, BJP state president K Surendran told reporters that the peace meeting could be held after Ranjith’s cremation on Monday night or in the coming days. He reiterated that the government was continuing its intolerance towards the BJP. “Though the BJP is not against the efforts to restore peace, it is hard to bear the insult towards the body of Ranjith. The government and police are ignoring it. At the same time they are giving considerations to SDPI and other extremist forces,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/all-party-peace-meet-in-alappuzha-today/articleshow/88398976.cms||---

Alerted by locals, Pamulapati Srinath Reddy, an archaeologist and member of Indian Trust for Art, Culture and Heritage (Intach), visited the village and found the temple amidst bushes and debris. He cleared the jungle with the help of locals and found the beautiful ancient structure in a ruined state. After closely inspecting the structure, Srinath Reddy said that the temple had architectural features of Kakatiya period. The temple is locally known as Mulasthaneswara. While the linga is missing from the temple, Garbhagriha was in a completely broken state. Locally available limestone slabs were used for the construction of the temple. With villagers moving towards south, the temple was left neglected and abandoned, said Srinath Reddy. He said that the temple must have been built in the 13th century and needed to be protected as heritage structure. He requested the villagers to protect such structures as they are treasures for future generations. He explained the significance of the architectural features of the centuries-old structure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ruins-of-13th-century-temple-found-in-rajupalem/articleshow/88398244.cms||---

He expressed confidence in forming Goa’s “first corruption-free government” in March. “Goans have already tried Congress for 27 years, MGP and BJP for 15 years. This time Goa should give a chance to AAP,” he said at a huge rally in Campal-Panaji on Tuesday. “The people of Goa are good but politicians are worse. Goa deserves better,” he said, adding that Goa is a first-class state with absolutely third-class politicians. He said there is no shortage of revenue in Goa but because of high corruption levels, it does not percolate down for development. Kejriwal said AAP is here to bring a change and to clean up “dirty politics which Goa is experiencing” and reiterated that the party has a model of development for the state. Taking a jibe at Congress, he said that five years ago there were 17 MLAs, of which 15 have been sold. “This stock will also be cleared within two months and new stock will come again in March,” he said. “Goa has a history of horse trading and defections. To resolve this problem, AAP candidates will sign a legal affidavit promising not to switch parties. They will distribute it among Goan voters, assuring them that they won’t jump to another party. If they do, voters can take legal action,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal reiterated his promises of 24x7 free electricity, free pilgrimage, unemployment allowance to mining and tourism dependents, employment in each house and a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 to all women over the age of 18. Taking a dig at BJP, Kejriwal said, “Every other minister is involved in some scandal or scam.” State convener Rahul Mhambre said that in just six years, AAP has brought a massive change in governance in Delhi and is ready to usher in a new era for Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-candidates-will-sign-affidavits-to-avoid-defections/articleshow/88420307.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A state power utility official assured the delegation — led by power activist Pratap Hogade, MLC Arun Lad, leaders like Vaibhav Naikawadi and Sanjay Ghatage — that the drive to snap electricity supply to the agriculture connections will be stopped immediately. The farmers had put several demands such as restoring power supply hours from 8 hours to 12 hours during the night for irrigation. The MSEDCL has reduced the supply citing shortage of coal that is required to produce electricity. Paresh Bhagat, chief engineer of the zone, said he has forwarded the proposal to increase the supply hours to the government. The farmers had claimed that the cut in supply hours is posing threat to the survival of the crops. Farmers’ representatives claimed farmers will not clear electricity dues until the bills issued are not corrected. The farmers claimed that the meters were damaged due to rains and floods and the MSEDCL issued the bills without any actual readings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/stop-action-against-power-defaulters/articleshow/88397490.cms||---

While a majority of the city-based stocks traded in line with the index, crashing during the day, some pharma stocks like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma bucked the trend and ended the day with gains With fears of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron looming large as Covid cases rise globally, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended at its lowest levels in the last four months to close at 55,822 levels, closing 1189.73 points (-2.09%) lower, and the broad-based Nifty declined 371 points (2.18%) to close at 16,614. Manish Mandhani, partner at city-based Mandhani Investments, pointed out that of the three defensive sectors—pharma, IT and FMGC, the pharma sector tried to fight back with large stocks like Dr Reddy’s, Aurobindo and Cipla ending in the green. “On Friday, when the Sensex ended at 57,011 (1.54% lower), of the defensive sectors, only IT stocks had performed well…today we see some of the pharma stocks ending in green,” he said. When it comes to major listed pharma companies from the city, only Dr Reddy’s and Aurobindo ended the day with gains whereas the rest like Laurus Labs, Natco, Gland Pharma and Granules all ended with losses. Metal stocks like NMDC as well as IT stocks such as Cyient and Kellton Tech too remained in the grip of bears and buckled under the weak sentiment like their peers. “Dr Reddy’s was one of the startling recoveries in the Sensex... but in general, the pharma sector’s performance was nothing extraordinary. In general, whenever there is a very sharp fall... companies tend to give up some of the gains or recover some of the losses,” Arun Kejriwal, founder of Mumbai-based Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt Ltd, said. He, however, cautioned that the overall market sentiment continues to remain weak and from here on every market rally will not be perceived as a sign of recovery or confidence but will remain suspect.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/monday-blues-stocks-of-city-cos-sink-as-sensex-tanks/articleshow/88398980.cms||---

Punith Dalmia is an accused in the Dalmia Cements charge sheet of quid pro quo case. In all these cases, AP chief minister Jagan Mohan Reddy is A1 accused. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan dismissed their pleas as withdrawn. Indu Projects promoter I Syam Prasad Reddy and former VC and MD of APIIC BP Acharya withdrew their pleas on Monday. CBI counsel K Surender objected to the belated withdrawals charging the accused with deploying such methods to delay the trial. They filed these pleas in the HC five years ago and got stay orders and prevented trial court from taking up cases, he said, adding, now they were withdrawing pleas because HC started hearing pleas. “Now they will go and file fresh discharge pleas before trial court and there will be another round of litigation starting from the trial court on these discharge pleas,” he said. The judge later heard the quash plea of V D Rajagopal, the former director of AP mines wing, who was made an accused in Penna Cements charge sheet and reserved his judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-more-accused-withdraw-quash-plea/articleshow/88398972.cms||---

The ministers staged a sit in, holding placards and raising slogans. The state-wide protests were held following a call given by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to exert pressure on the NDA government to buy rice and also explain to the people the alleged injustice being done by the central government to paddy farmers of Telangana. Carrying flags, banners and placards amid beating of the drums, the protesters demanded that the Centre not only lift the entire paddy of vaanakalam season but also that of ensuing yasangi season. Finance minister T Harish Rao led the protest in Gajwel while transport minister P Ajay Kumar in Khammam.

Forest minister A Indrakaran Reddy led a huge rally in Nirmal town. TRS MLA Sandra Venkat Veeraiah carried a bag of paddy on his head to register his protest at Sattupalli in Khammam district. This is the third phase of the protest organised by the ruling TRS over the issue of paddy procurement against the Modi government. Earlier, the party leaders and cadres had staged a sit-in in all assembly constituencies in November. Later, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao himself led a maha dharna at Dharna Sthal near Indira Park in Hyderabad, which was attended by ministers, MPs and other leaders. Harish Rao said the Centre should be brought down if the farmers were to be happy. “BJP is playing politics even with the lives of farmers. People should confront BJP leaders in every village and question them whether the Modi government will buy the entire paddy from Telangana or not,” he said. Seeking to explain the responsibilities of the three-tier governance in India, he said while sarpanches manage the villages, chief minister-led council of ministers the state and it was the duty of the central government to buy paddy and distribute it in places where there was need for food safety and security, he said. Harish Rao accused BJP Telangana leaders of misleading farmers by encouraging them to cultivate paddy while their government at the Centre was not willing to buy rice from Telangana. He demanded a clear response from Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay on whether the Centre would procure the entire paddy from the state. “The BJP leaders are misleading the farmers for their political benefit,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-protests-across-t-to-push-centre-on-paddy/articleshow/88398994.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ludhiana||Accused not held, protesters bring locks for police station||Ludhiana: A group of men staged a protest outside Daresi police station on Monday, accusing cops of delaying the arrest of accused in a snatching and confinement case. The agitators handed over locks to the cops to shut down the police station, as “they have failed in doing their job”. Refuting the allegations, the Daresi SHO said the police have been conducting raids, but the accused could not be traced.The case complainant, 42, along with his supporters, reached outside the police station and staged an hours-long sit-in.The complainant said, “On November 4, some men had confined me in a factory. They stripped and thrashed me, robbed me of Rs 48,000 and made me sign blank cheques of Rs 2.54 lakh. I had lodged a complaint with the police on November 13 and the FIR was registered on November 29.”The police had booked Ranveer Singh of New Subhash Nagar, Gagan of Kuldeep Nagar and their unidentified accomplices under sections 379-B (snatching), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offense committed in prosecution of common object) of the IPC. The main accused, Ranveer Singh, is the former business partner of the complainant. “The cops have done nothing to arrest the accused. I have been visiting the police station every other day and I am told that they don’t have enough police force to conduct raids. Therefore, I brought locks to make cops shut down the police station as they don’t have enough force to act on our complaints,” the complainant added.Later, senior officials visited the spot and pacified the agitators by assuring the arrest of the accused.Daresi SHO inspector Amrit Pal said, “The allegations are false as it is on record that the police conducted at least four raids to arrest the accused. However, they could not be traced. Moreover, the victim did not meet me. I do not know who told him about the unavailability of force. The accused will be arrested soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/accused-not-held-protesters-bring-locks-for-police-station/articleshow/88398294.cms||---

In 2018, applicant Bhagwat Karadkar had sought file-inspection of documents related to his employment with the Jalna-based Model College, which runs under the aegis of the university. The Bamu authorities had ruled out the plea and subsequently, also rejected Karadkar’s first appeal. The applicant then knocked on the doors of the SIC seeking justice. Even though the SIC ruled in favour of the applicant, the university allegedly failed to do the needful. Perturbed, the applicant then lodged a complaint with the SIC under section 18 of the RTI Act, 2005. During the hearing, the Aurangabad bench of the information panel, led by Dilip Dharurkar, slapped a Rs 5,000 fine on the university. In its ruling, which was officially sent to Bamu on December 9, the SIC said it is a “serious” matter as the university has denied file-inspection to the applicant despite an official order issued by it during the hearing of the second appeal made under the RTI Act. “The university should also ensure that the earlier order passed by the SIC is followed,” the bench said in its order. The deputy register concerned of the establishment section of Bamu, who has been fined by the SIC, could not be reached for his comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/state-info-commission-slaps-rs-5000-fine-on-bamu/articleshow/88397520.cms||Prasad Joshi

Forest officials said that the CCTV footage of the tiger showed that the tiger has become very weak. “There is inflammation around the wound in the neck of the tiger and the animal has become very weak. It seems the animal is finding it difficult to take food,” chief conservator of forests, north zone (Kannur), D K Vinod Kumar said. He added that while the department had installed 36 camera traps, the tiger was spotted in just one camera which was located at the Randam Gate area of WWS at 9am. Though an intense search was conducted in the area, the tiger could not be spotted. The spot where the tiger was caught on CCTV was around 3km from Kurukkanmoola. “We are planning to conduct the search in the area and also at the Oliyott forest on Tuesday as well,” he added. Meanwhile, the UDF began a relay sathyagraha at Gandhi Square at Mananthavady to protest against the delay in capturing the animal. UDF district convenor and DCC president N D Appachan led the sathyagraha from 10am to 5pm on the first day. Inaugurating the protests, Kalpetta MLA T Siddique said that the UDF will be forced to blockade ministers if they come to Wayanad before capturing the tiger. He said that it was the laxity by the authorities in addressing the issue in the initial days when cattle lifting was reported in the area which compounded the situation. Meanwhile, Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samithi said that those who are responsible for exacerbating the human-wildlife conflict in the region are themselves trying to stir up riots. Samithi leaders N Badusha and Thomas Ambalavayal said that of the around one-lakh hectares of forest land in the district, around 36,000 hectares had been converted to monocrop teak and eucalyptus plantations by the successive governments. Wild animals, including tiger, gaur and elephants are straying into human habitations due to disturbances in their remaining habitat like wild fires, grazing of livestock and tourism. “The area had in recent days witnessed the strange sight of a municipal councillor raising threats against forest officials engaged in their duty. They should make it clear what their party or government had done to find solutions to the human wildlife conflict. The forest department had invited suggestions to address the human-wildlife conflict two months ago and only WPSS had submitted proposals from the district while all political parties and people’s representatives had stayed mum,” the samithi leaders said in a news conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/elusive-tiger-udf-launches-protest/articleshow/88399008.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Man acquitted of crushing cat as no carcass found||MUMBAI: In a rare judgment under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, a magistrate’s court acquitted a 59-year-old Grant Road businessman booked for running over a building cat with his speeding car in January this year as the feline’s carcass was never found. The speedy trial that lasted six court dates saw the deposition of four witnesses including two who were purported to have seen the incident. Acquitting Percy Lentin, the magistrate said that while he was charged for the rash and negligent driving, none of the witnesses deposed the manner in which he was driving the vehicle. “Therefore, in absence of the evidence to that effect it is very difficult to hold that the accused was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. The witnesses who identified the accused has improved his version, the dead body of the cat was not recovered. All these create doubt in the story of the prosecution,” the court said. It added that the accused is entitled to benefit of doubt. The incident took place on January 20, at 6 pm. It was alleged the when Lentin was coming towards the building he ran over the cat and it died on the spot. An FIR was lodged three days later. Lentin was booked for offences relating to rash and negligent driving, killing an animal with a value of over Rs 10 and treating an animal cruelly. The maximum sentence attracted was two years imprisonment. The informant, Narayan Sainathan, deposed in court and said that usually in the evenings, the cats used to be fed in the society’s compound. He said that on that particular evening, his staff fed the building cats. He later came to know that the cat was run over and he claimed to have been seen the incident in the CCTV footage recovered from the security camera. He alleged that the car belonged to Lentin. When the footage was played in court, the witness could not identify the person driving the vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-acquitted-of-crushing-cat-as-no-carcass-found/articleshow/88399662.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In response to a question about Telangana public debt and loans, it was revealed that the state has Rs 2,34,912 crores in outstanding debt as of December 13, 2021. The parliament query also revealed that RBI has not provided any loans to Telangana government. “However, the RBI facilitates financial accommodation in the form of special drawing facility, ways and means advance, and overdraft to supplement the temporary mismatches between receipts and payments,” the Centre said.  Among these organisations are the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Development Association. The average annual interest payment to these agencies over the next three years is Rs 22 crore. In response to a question from TPCC president A Revanth Reddy, Centre revealed that as additional assistance, externally aided projects received Rs 956 crore and Rs 30 crore as grant in same year. However, no grant has been made to state since then, and the loan in the form of externally aided projects has gradually decreased from Rs 956 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 207 crore in 2019-20. “If spent on capital expenditure, it will come back in rotations. But if spent on revenue expenditure, it will cause long-term strain on state finances,” said Dr Krishna Reddy Chittedi UoH assistant professor, school of economics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/states-public-debt-stands-at-rs-2-3l-cr/articleshow/88398997.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The committee’s leaders were reacting to the minister’s statement that those who have no clue about the powers of the pro-chancellor were finding fault with her for making recommendations to the chancellor regarding appointment of Kannur University vice-chancellor. “The minister should spend some time and understand university laws. Universities are not part of the government. They are completely autonomous institutions. Ministers or the government have no authority to suggest or recommend names to the top posts of varsities to the chancellor. Pro-chancellor’s is an ornamental post sans authority,” the committee said. The committee’s chairman R S Sasikumar reiterated that the minister has violated rules by writing letters to the chancellor regarding the appointments of a university vice-chancellor. No other minister in the history of Kerala had ever done so in the past, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/do-not-blindly-follow-jaleels-path-edu-minister-urged/articleshow/88399020.cms||---

He expressed confidence in forming Goa’s “first corruption-free government” in March. “Goans have already tried Congress for 27 years, MGP and BJP for 15 years. This time Goa should give a chance to AAP,” he said at a huge rally in Campal-Panaji on Tuesday. “The people of Goa are good but politicians are worse. Goa deserves better,” he said, adding that Goa is a first-class state with absolutely third-class politicians. He said there is no shortage of revenue in Goa but because of high corruption levels, it does not percolate down for development. Kejriwal said AAP is here to bring a change and to clean up “dirty politics which Goa is experiencing” and reiterated that the party has a model of development for the state. Taking a jibe at Congress, he said that five years ago there were 17 MLAs, of which 15 have been sold. “This stock will also be cleared within two months and new stock will come again in March,” he said. “Goa has a history of horse trading and defections. To resolve this problem, AAP candidates will sign a legal affidavit promising not to switch parties. They will distribute it among Goan voters, assuring them that they won’t jump to another party. If they do, voters can take legal action,” Kejriwal said. Kejriwal reiterated his promises of 24x7 free electricity, free pilgrimage, unemployment allowance to mining and tourism dependents, employment in each house and a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 to all women over the age of 18. Taking a dig at BJP, Kejriwal said, “Every other minister is involved in some scandal or scam.” State convener Rahul Mhambre said that in just six years, AAP has brought a massive change in governance in Delhi and is ready to usher in a new era for Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-candidates-will-sign-affidavits-to-avoid-defections/articleshow/88420324.cms||---

The delegation said that they wanted a written assurance as they have had several bad experiences with the Centre’s oral assurances. The Telangana government is demanding that the Centre increase its paddy procurement target in Telangana from the present 60 lakh metric tonnes (40 lakh metric tonnes rice) to at least 90 lakh metric tonnes of paddy. Over 1.3 crore tonnes of paddy is expected to have been harvested in vaanakalam (kharif) season from over 62 lakh acres. “Following our repeated requests earlier, Union minister Piyush Goyal had assured in Parliament that the Centre was ready to procure the entire paddy crop from Telangana in the form of raw rice. We are here to request the Union minister to issue orders immediately to enhance the procurement targets by the Centre,” agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy said.  Niranjan Reddy along with his cabinet colleagues and party MPs told a media conference in New Delhi on Monday that they flew into New Delhi on Saturday seeking an appointment with Goyal, but were told by the minister’s office that he was in Mumbai on Saturday and Sunday. TRS parliamentary party leader K Keshav Rao spoke to the Goyal on phone and the TRS delegation was asked to meet the Union minister in Parliament.Delegation has also sought an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

---||India||Uttar Pradesh plays pivotal role in India’s self-reliance quest: Pradhan||LUCKNOW: A day after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the BJP government by claiming that women empowerment does not imply possession of a cooking gas cylinder or a toilet, Union education minister and BJP’s UP election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the Congress leader was not aware of ground reality. “Some people do not know the social problems faced by people, especially women, in rural households,” he said, while speaking at the inaugural session of ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organised by the Times Group in Lucknow. “Steps like construction of toilets and providing LPG connections not only ensure security to women but also elevate their dignity,” he said. Pradhan, who played a pivotal role in the implementation of Ujjwala Yojana entailing free gas connection, said the scheme was rolled out after an exhaustive research done by American scientist Kirk Smit, who pointed out that around 5 lakh women used to die due to inhalation of smoke emanating from clay stove. Pradhan said UP played a pivotal role in India’s aspirations to become self-reliant. “No one can imagine the country’s development without the empowerment of women who account for around 50% of the population,” he said, stressing that various projects, including expressways and airports, were the examples of development ushered in by the government. Stressing that democracy is strengthened when people benefit from welfare schemes, Pradhan said, “UP will not only be the destination for the development of Kashi, Ayodhya and Mathura. It will not only be the destination for investment, business or resources. It will also be the destination for the ultimate welfare of society in the time of crisis.” Pradhan also lauded the state government for Covid-19 management and for tackling reverse migration in the aftermath of lockdown.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/uttar-pradesh-plays-pivotal-role-in-indias-self-reliance-quest-pradhan/articleshow/88400590.cms||---

Telangana Congress working president and MLA T Jagga Reddy on Monday said there was never any problem about procurement of paddy during Congress governments. “The present problem is a crisis created by Telangana Rashtra Samithi and Bharatiya Janata Party, which are now trying to derive political mileage by championing the cause of paddy farmers,” MLA T Jagga Reddy alleged. He further alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were playing a double game. On the Telangana Rashtra Samithi ministers delegation’s visit to Delhi, Telangana Congress working president and MLA T Jagga Reddy said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao visited the national capital twice but the problem remained unsolved. “How will the ministerial delegation solve it,” he wondered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-trsbjp-playinggames-withfarmers-in-t/articleshow/88399019.cms||---

The woman urged the court to ensure that Red Fort, which was “illegally taken over by British East India Company” be handed over to her on the grounds that she was the legal heir. Dismissing the plea, Justice Rekha Palli said there was no justification for the inordinate delay in approaching the court after over 150 years. Petitioner Sultana Begum said she was the widow of late Mirza Mohammed Bedar Bakht who died on May 22, 1980. “My history is weak but you claim injustice was done to you by the British East India Company in 1857. Why is there a delay of over 150 years? What were you doing all these years?” the judge remarked. The court said, “Everybody knew about it. Everyone in the court must have read history that he was exiled. It was known to the world. Why was nothing filed in time? If her ancestors did not do it, can she do it now?” The petition claimed that the family had been deprived of their property by the British following the first war of Independence in 1857, after which the king was exiled from the country and possession of the Red Fort was taken away from the Mughals.  The court also rejected the submission made by the petitioner's counsel that she was an illiterate woman due to which she could not approach earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/150-years-too-late-hc-to-woman-who-wants-red-fort-handed-over-to-her/articleshow/88399677.cms||---
---||Goa||Pramod Sawant will realise Manohar Parrikar’s dream of Golden Goa: J P Nadda||MARGAO: BJP national president J P Nadda on Tuesday accused leaders of Congress of creating hurdles in the country’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic by raising questions over the efficacy of vaccines developed by India. He urged people to give a “befitting reply” to those who have come in the way of Modi’s ‘sadhana’ in the forthcoming assembly polls. “Congress misled people by raising doubts over the two vaccines developed by India in a relatively short time. They led a false propaganda against the vaccination campaign. They made politics on vaccination,” Nadda said, while addressing a public meeting at Shiroda. Listing out the state’s achievements in various sectors over the last five years, Nadda said that as the government’s “report card” was now before the people, “appreciate those who delivered, and send home those who failed to perform”. Stating that it was former CM Manohar Parrikar’s dream to see Goa become a preferred social, economic and tourist destination, and establish itself on the global scene, Nadda exuded confidence that chief minister Pramod Sawant and his team would work towards realising Parrikar’s dream of “Golden Goa.” Nadda said that the legislators who defected from other parties to join BJP have “served to strengthen the party and enriched it with a new dimension”. Earlier, upon his arrival, Nadda held a meeting with senior functionaries from across South Goa at BJP’s office in Margao. At the meeting, Nadda reviewed the party’s various election-related campaign exercises and guided the workers in the task of strengthening the party organisation in the next two months leading to the assembly polls. CM Pramod Sawant, party president Sadanand Tanavade, organisation secretary Satish Dhond and others were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-will-realise-parrikars-dream-of-golden-goa-nadda/articleshow/88420329.cms||---
---||Goa||Cong regroups for tough battle ahead in Curtorim||Margao: Notwithstanding the bravado displayed by the Congress leadership following the exit of its working president Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, the party finds itself in a pitiable condition in Curtorim, its traditional citadel. Nevertheless, acting swiftly after Lourenco’s “betrayal”, Congress has organised a public meeting in Curtorim on Wednesday, a measure aimed at reassuring party workers and sending a strong message to the electorate that the party is in control of the situation. “We have a strong base in Curtorim, we will win the Curtorim seat 100%,” Congress’ South Goa district president Joe Dias told TOI. Congress is now tasked with selecting a replacement candidate in Curtorim strong enough to take on the might of Lourenco, who is now likely to contest as a TMC candidate. The task has been rendered more difficult as Moreno Rebello, the backup candidate Congress had relied upon, has already switched over to BJP. Dias, however, said that the party was confident of fielding a “winnable candidate” from Curtorim. “The Curtorim block had shortlisted three candidates, including Lourenco. So names of the other two will be now under consideration. We may even look for more suitable candidates; the party will take a call on that. Curtorim is a Congress stronghold, and we will see to it that whoever the candidate is, they sail through,” Dias said. Barring some chance aberrations, the Curtorim constituency has generally been a bastion of Congress. Lourenco has won from this constituency three times on a trot — once on a Save Goa Front ticket and twice on the Congress ticket. Sensing Lourenco’s growing restlessness in Congress, BJP played a “masterstroke” by inducting ex-zilla panchayat member Moreno Rebello into the party recently. The inclusion of two wards from Gogol housing board area — which largely comprise BJP voters — into Curtorim following the delimitation of constituencies since the 2012 elections, has made BJP fancy its chances of a win in the constituency. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, speaking at Rebello’s induction ceremony at Curtorim recently, had assured to bring in the “much-needed” development in Curtorim constituency, even as he accused Congress of keeping the minority-dominated constituency backward over the last several decades. Nevertheless, with three-time zilla panchayat member Domnik Gaonkar having joined AAP and likely to be its candidate in the polls, and with Lourenco now likely to contest as a TMC candidate, political observers are wary of predicting voter behaviour in what is certain to be a four-cornered contest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cong-regroups-for-tough-battle-ahead-in-curtorim/articleshow/88420335.cms||Govind Kamat Maad
---||Kochi||No relief for Pink police ‘victim’: Kerala govt||KOCHI: The state government on Monday claimed before the High Court that the child subjected to ‘public trial’ by the Pink Police wing of Kerala Police alleging theft is not entitled to a compensation for her ordeal. The case relates to Pink Police officer CP Rejitha publicly accusing a father and an eight-year-old girl of stealing a mobile phone from a police vehicle and threatening to take them to the police station for a ‘search’. The phone was found within the car itself shortly thereafter. A video recorded by the public showing the girl crying had gone viral. Responding to the court’s suggestion last week that it was a fit case for granting compensation under public law remedy, the government on Monday claimed that the facts in the case are disputed and that only in an undisputed case can the public law remedy be invoked to grant compensation for violation of right to life or liberty. In support of its contention, government also claimed that visuals of the alleged harassment are not available. The court had played a video clip at an earlier hearing. Justice Devan Ramachandran pointed out that the state police chief’s affidavit filed earlier in the case also refers to a video recording. The court then ordered the government to produce the video before it. The police chief had claimed in the affidavit that the girl started crying when the public gathered and not because of the police officer’s behaviour. This stance was repeated by the government in court too while arguing that the court should limit the hearing to the materials before it. The girl was waiting at Moonnumukku near Attingal along with her father to see a giant machinery of the ISRO being transported by road when the police officer who was in the Pink Police patrol car parked nearby allegedly accused her of stealing a mobile phone from the car. The officer allegedly threatened to take the father and daughter to the police station for a search, it is alleged. While putting them on ‘public trial’, the officer also allegedly insulted and intimidated them, the girl’s plea said while pointing out that a police officer deputed to aid women and children acted in such a highhanded manner. In the plea filed through advocate AK Preetha, the girl is seeking a compensation of Rs 50 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-compensation-for-child-govt-argues-in-hc/articleshow/88399035.cms||---

To keep a check on polluting industries, mainly in the redevelopment areas, Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would be conducting fresh surveys. For this, three teams comprising eight officials have been constituted by the agency. An order issued by DJB stated: “Teams are directed to take action against the illegal water polluting industries with immediate effect. They are also directed to survey the assembly constituencies for other such illegal polluting industries and take action accordingly without the approval of the competent authority.” The first priority of these teams, including engineers, would be to check the electroplating industry being run in Moti Nagar, Mayapuri and Wazirpur. The matter of 25 redevelopment areas not being connected to water treatment plants was also discussed and DJB CEO Udit Prakash Rai, who is also the chairman of the cell, unveiled the plan to rope in Jamia Millia Islamia to conduct a survey of all such areas within the next four months. The surveyors would be assisted by officials from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and civil defence personnel. According to DPCC, around 2,000 water polluting industries currently operate in Delhi in the notified industrial areas. Rai directed the officials to find out within a week whether these units were connected to the sewerage system. Currently, 675 JJ clusters do not have sewers and untreated wastewater generated by them enters the river. Out of the 671 community toilets of Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), only 200 are connected to septic tanks. The effluent of most of these septic tanks is discharged into nearby drains. There are another 38 locations from where sewerage is directly discharged into the drains. To tackle this problem, the outfall of the storm water drainage system would be trapped and routed into the nearby DJB sewage system and pumped for treatment to the nearest STP. This would ensure that untreated waste doesn’t get discharged into the river. DJB has asked DUSIB to provide data of all storm water drains running through slums to take further action. A major hurdle faced by Delhi government to clean the Yamuna is the multiplicity of agencies. With the target of cleaning the river by 2025, a top priority of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, this cell was constituted to expedite projects and overcome any administrative hurdles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govts-yamuna-cell-lists-a-series-of-steps-for-clean-up/articleshow/88399680.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Diploma engineering: Equal weightage for standard, basic maths||AHMEDABAD: The state education department on Monday laid out the guidelines for determining the qualification criteria for diploma engineering admissions. Those who opted for basic mathematics and students who chose standard mathematics in Class 10 board exams will be given equal weightage for admissions in diploma engineering colleges for the academic year 2022-23. The education department released the information in a media statement. For disabled candidates, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHEB) has declared that 20 will be the pass marks in the board exams. The education department has collected the data on the number of seats available for disabled students and the number of such candidates who got admissions over the past three years. “A committee was set up to study the data and based on the findings the vice-chancellor of Gujarat Technological University should write to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE),” said an official aware of the developments. “The vice-chancellor should request that all students who have cleared Class 10 be allowed to seek admission in diploma engineering courses.” After cancelling the Class 10 exams for the year 2021-22 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the board had come up with merit-based progression for evaluating the performance of students. In line with the state government directive that no student is to be failed, candidates were given grace marks. “Candidates who have passed Class 10 exams with mathematics, science, and English as subjects after being given grace marks will be considered for admission in diploma courses for the academic year 2021-22, effective from November 11, 2021,” the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/diploma-engg-equal-weightage-for-standard-basic-maths/articleshow/88399037.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Linking Aadhaar with voter I-card violates fundamental rights: Asaduddin Owaisi||HYDERABAD: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday opposed linking of Aadhaar and voter I-cards, alleging that the Centre was trying to curtail the independence of the Election Commission. Through a series of tweets, Owaisi said he opposed the bill but the government passed it amidst din in the house. Stating that linking Aadhaar card with voter card violates the fundamental rights of privacy, he said the Indian democracy is too precious for experiments where one’s right to vote is made dependent on some computer algorithm that no one understands. Linking Aadhaar with a voter card will make voters easily identifiable. Parties in power will be able to profile voters based on identity and the likelihood of favourable voting. “They’ll be able to discriminate in welfare schemes to punish their opponents and reward their supporters,” he said. “Once the government is able to identify if someone is unlikely to vote for them, it will be extremely easy to delete them from electoral rolls claiming that their authentication ‘failed.’ What’s the remedy for people who are excluded in such an arbitrary manner?” asked Owaisi in another tweet “The law was passed as a farce. I wasn’t even allowed any time to raise my objections, while the chair allowed the minister to make a detailed statement. It’s quite obvious that this law was urgently passed keeping Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh elections in mind,” he tweeted. “It also violates the Supreme Court’s judgement which recognised privacy as a fundamental right. This will just simplify the process and allow exclusion at a larger scale. A similar effort in 2015 to link Aadhaar was stayed by SC,” he said. “Aadhaar data has been breached repeatedly. It was stolen and sold online for Rs 500. Data of 10 cr citizens of Punjab, AP and Telangana was stolen and used by political parties. Madras HC also raised doubts over use of Aadhaar by BJP in profiling and targeting voters for Puducherry elections. Aadhaar database is error prone and self-reported errors are 1.5 times higher than errors in electoral rolls. So why is a dubious database mandatory to authenticate the superior and reliable database of ECI?” Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/linking-aadhaar-with-voter-i-card-violates-fundamental-rights-owaisi/articleshow/88399026.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Goa||In Banerjee’s presence, Lourenco joins TMC||Panaji: Former Curtorim MLA and Congress’ ex-working president, Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, joined TMC on Tuesday in the presence of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata. Lourenco said that Congress was in government for many years, it made money, but they don’t even have a proper office. He also said he is “sorry” if anyone is hurt by him leaving the party. “I am a servant of the people of Goa,” he said after his return from Kolkata. “I don’t have a bank balance, I have not made money, I don’t have big cars, I don’t have big assets. There is no compromise on the interests of Goa. TMC has the same ideology (as Congress) and that is the reason I have taken this step.” Reacting to allegations on social media that he took money to join TMC, Lourenco said, “I want to answer those who say that I have taken money. I am grateful to the people of Goa, my heart goes out to my people. I will tell you: Till I die, I will remain this (grateful). I will not go for money, (only) the interest of Goa and my people, which I have always kept first”. Earlier, Banerjee tweeted: “I extend a warm welcome to Goa assembly’s best performing MLA, @ReginaldoGoa ji to the @AITC4Goa family. Well-intended individuals like him, whose foremost priority has been the interest of the people, strengthen our spirit in this fight against divisive forces! #GoenchiNaviSakal”. Lourenco said that after becoming a Save Goa Party MLA, he supported Congress. “In 2007, the then CM Digambar Kamat government was about to fall, and we merged the Save Goa Party... I have never fought because I did not get anything. I have fought for my people,” he said. The former Curtorim MLA said that even after being in the opposition, he worked for the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-banerjees-presence-lourenco-joins-tmc/articleshow/88420342.cms||---

Yuri Alemao from Cuncolim, Sankalp Amonkar from Mormugao, Sudhir Kandolkar from Mapusa, Rajesh Verenkar from Ponda, and Tony Rodrigues from Taleigao, addressed a joint press conference at the party headquarters in Panaji. The candidates condemned Lourenco for “betraying” the party at the eleventh hour. Alemao said that those who have left Congress to join parties have done so for “self-development” owing to the lure of money. “However, people’s sentiments are against defection and corruption that these parties are involved in. What we are seeing is a vulgar dance of money,” he said. Rodrigues said Lourenco’s act of “betraying” Congress amounted to insulting the people of Curtorim in particular and Goans in general. He stressed that the rest of the candidates are united and that they would stay united. Amonkar said that while Congress has taken up people’s issues, the agenda of other parties was to “buy leaders” from other parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/faithful-to-party-will-help-cong-win-say-first-list-candidates/articleshow/88420337.cms||---
---||Kochi||Panel may review relaxations mooted in area devpt scheme||Thiruvananthapuram: The special committee of the city corporation may reconsider the set of relaxations that have been proposed in the Kovalam-Vizhinjam area development scheme. In a meeting held here on Monday, it was observed that there were far too many relaxations being proposed by the town and country planning department. The committee also decided to circulate the Malayalam version of the summary of changes proposed in the area development scheme among the nine councillors of wards coming under the scheme. At present, only three councillors from the wards are members of the committee. However, as regarding incorporating the set of recommendations in the new master plan of the city, it was cited that the process would take more time and in the meantime, the variations proposed for the Kovalam-Vizhinjam area development scheme may be deliberated and finalized. The special committee has flagged reservations mainly regarding the relaxations with respect to height and coverage. The coverage, height restrictions and plot size have been modified as per the new set of variations. The town planning department has also proposed taking away all the architectural controls prevalent in 2010 regulations.  While the coverage for buildings under the public and semi-public use was limited to 40% and height below 9m as per the old plan, the height and coverage will be determined as per the building rules in force, the proposal says. According to the special committee, opening up construction regulations to the provisions of building rules and setting aside all other existing regulations pertaining to height and coverage would require more deliberation. Multiplex complexes have been added to the zoning regulations under ‘uses restricted by chief town planner’. As for buildings under the tourism development, the coverage was limited to 30% and the height of the building was below 9m. This provision has been taken off and proposed variation says that coverage and height restrictions in the 2010 regulations have been modified and it will be governed by Kerala municipality building rules. Hotels, resorts, cottages, homestays, hostels, boarding houses, convention centres and commercial buildings are included under uses permitted. New relaxations have also been proposed for residential buildings. Residential buildings up to 300 sq m and commercial buildings up to 150 sq m are permitted in both the zones as per compliance with the paddy and wetland act of the state, the proposal says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/panel-may-review-relaxations-mooted-in-area-devpt-scheme/articleshow/88398351.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC gives Varavara Rao time till Jan 7 to surrender||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday allowed Elgar Parishad accused P Varavara Rao, 82, time to file an additional affidavit response to a report submitted by Nanavati hospital for its analysis in his plea for extension of his medical bail. The private charitable hospital had last week submitted a report to say that Rao’s vital parameters were normal. The HC bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal said to Rao’s senior counsel Anand Grover that the affidavit be filed by the end of the month, and posted the matter to January 4, while extending the time till January 7, for Rao to surrender. For the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the additional solicitor general Anil Singh contended that Rao be sent back to Taloja jail and opposed his plea for extension given that the Nanavati hospital report said his condition was stable. The court, however, observed that even in the earlier bail order, the Nanavati hospital (where Rao was hospitalised following HC orders) had said he was fit to be discharged, and yet the “bench analysed the medical reports and observed that the case of the applicant that he needs to be released in light of his health condition was to be accepted”. Since the earlier division bench had followed this course of action, the request of the applicant to follow the same approach even in this application will have to be accepted, said the HC. The ASG then said he would leave it to the court to set the next date for hearing. The NIA has charged Rao and 14 other accused with terror offences under the Unlawful Activities (prevention) Act for having alleged Maoist links. The Nanavati hospital said multiple doctors and consultants from across departments had examined Rao on December 1. Its report was that Rao, “has minor symptoms such as lack of sleep and slight exhaustion. His vital parameters are in normal range, however, the blood pressure was found to be on a slightly higher side by cardiologist…’’ Grover, on the other hand, said Rao’s health is deteriorating and he suffers from multiple ailments for which his medical bail should be extended as it will enable him to receive prompt medical attention. Grover read out few paras from the February 2021, order for a six-month medical bail passed by Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale which said the Nanavti reports “cannot be appreciated in isolation and they have to be read along with the entire set of medical papers placed before this court, tracing the health condition of the undertrial from July, 2020, till date.” The bench had at the time said, “On an overall analysis of the material on record, we find that placing the undertrial in custody or even in the prison ward of the J J Hospital upon his discharge is incompatible with his health conditions, and that it would run the risk of deterioration of his health to the point of no return.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-gives-varavara-rao-time-till-jan-7-to-surrender/articleshow/88400137.cms||---

In a meeting held on Monday, the task force has recommended treatment of patients at either the state-run hospital or private health facilities. The private hospitals have also been asked to increase Covid testing by making RT-PCR testing mandatory for suspected Covid patients in their out patient department (OPDs) Stating that the new strain of Covid was highly transmissible, authorities said any possibility of such unconfirmed Covid patients isolated at home may spread the infection rapidly to others Dr Paras Mandlecha, the health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), who is also a part of the district task force, said a slew of measures are being planned to avoid a possible surge in Covid cases due to the detection of Omicron strain in parts of Maharashtra.  “The option of home isolation is discouraged amid the threat of Omicron strain. Both municipal limits and rural areas have a sufficient number of beds available to treat Covid patients,” he said.  The municipal limits of Aurangabad had 41 active patients by Sunday, of them, nine were in home isolation. A total of 15 patients were undergoing treatment at private hospitals whereas 12 were admitted at the Government Medical College and Hospital.  Speaking on the OPDs run by the private hospitals, Mandlecha said these facilities have been told to ramp up Covid testing. Among other instructions, the district task force, headed by the Aurangabad district collector, has pressed for strict compliance to Covid prevention norms during the imminent wedding season and the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-dist-task-force-discourages-home-isolation/articleshow/88397581.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Ahmedabad||Electric vehicles pushed but only 27 public charging stations||AHMEDABAD: Even as state and central governments push for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) through policy initiatives and subsidies, the EV demand has failed to change gears because charging stations are still inadequate in Gujarat. According to the data tabled in the Parliament by the Union ministry of power, Gujarat has only 27 public charging stations. The state currently has about 13,270 active electric vehicles. Charging infrastructure is a pre-requisite for EV adoption. But the number of public charging stations in Gujarat is dramatically lower than in various other states such as Delhi (322), Maharashtra (88), Uttar Pradesh (108), and Tamil Nadu (94). The Gujarat Electric Vehicle Policy 2021 provides a subsidy of up to Rs 20,000 for EVs in the two-wheeler category, Rs 50,000 for three-wheelers, and up to Rs 1.5 lakh for cars. Over and above this, even the central government has extended subsidies under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME)-II. The subsidy is based on the battery capacity. Dealers said that the limited number of public charging stations across Gujarat is one of the major problems in selling EVs, particularly cars. Interestingly, EV sales in Gujarat reported at least a tenfold growth in November with 1,755 vehicles sold this year against 149 sold last year, according to the data of Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). In the recently concluded Navratri-Diwali festive season, 2,471 EVs were sold across Gujarat — up 846% against the sale of 247 EVs during last year’s festive season, according to FADA’s data. “Most of these vehicles are two-wheelers. The proportion of car sales is significantly less. The main reason is poor charging infrastructure here,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, FADA. “People buy two-wheelers largely to commute within the city. However, car buyers always consider travelling over longer distances.” Shah added: “With limited charging infrastructure, car sales are still relatively muted.” Industry stakeholders emphasized the need to improve charging infrastructure and to set up more public charging stations to propel EV sales. “Customers want to invest in EVs particularly because of the subsidy and lesser cost of ownership as compared to vehicles powered by petrol and diesel,” Shah said. “However, because of inadequate charging infrastructure, reluctance prevails among customers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/evs-pushed-but-only-27-public-charging-stations/articleshow/88399058.cms||Niyati Parikh

This is apart from the cash and valuables worth Rs88.49 lakh the police recovered from Supe’s residence a day after his arrest last Friday. The fresh raids were necessitated after the police realized that Supe had instructed his son and daughter to move the cash bags out of his house to some other places while he was being questioned prior to his arrest, a police officer said. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said, “During the questioning of Supe, we came to know to that he was hiding cash at different places in Pune and we decided to conduct fresh searches.” Deputy commissioner of police (Cyber) Bhagyashri Navatake said, “Before formally arresting Supe in the Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET) 2020 malpractice case, we had grilled him. However, we allowed his daughter and son to meet him on the day. During this meeting, he asked his daughter and son to move the bags containing cash.” “We called his daughter and son-in-law for questioning and following this, we realised that a bag was kept at a flat located at Charholi near Alandi and another bag was kept at a flat located at Wagholi. The keys of the Wagholi flat were with his son-in-law’s friend. We then called his son-in-law’s friend. We found cash of Rs 97,000 from Charholi flat and Rs 1.58 crores at Wagholi flat,” she said. “We have seized the cash and other valuables. We are verifying from where and how the cash was collected by Supe. We are verifying the flow of the cash,” Navatake said. The cyber police had arrested GA Software company’s director Pritish Deshmukh of Chinchwad on the midnight of December 11 in connection with the MHADA recruitment exam question paper leak case. During the questioning, police realised that Deshmukh was also involved in the malpractices in the TET examinations. Following this, police arrested Supe and Abhishek Savrikar, a consultant to the education department were arrested last Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/raids-yield-rs-1-64cr-in-cash-valuables-from-supe-kin/articleshow/88399050.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Several colleges remain shut over student suicides||HYDERABAD: Demanding that all intermediate first-year students be given pass marks and officials who conducted the exam in haste should be sacked, hundreds of junior colleges in the state remained shut on Monday as a bandh by the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) took hold. Several other organisations, including Save Education Committee, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), Students Federation of India (SFI), among others also joined in and are demanding that the state award pass marks to all students who failed in the examination. “Exams were conducted in haste and amid a lot of confusion. How does it make sense to conduct exams for first-year students when they are in the second year and that too without conducting regular classes,” questioned Venkat Balmoor, state president, NSUI. Protesters demanded that all students from some 2,000 junior colleges should be given pass marks and improvement exams should be conducted so that they can better their scores. They also demanded that families of three students, who committed suicide, should get justice. “Those who committed suicide are meritorious students. They died as they could not secure more marks, not because they failed in the exam,” added Balmoor.  K Chakradhar Rao, president, Save Education Committee, said students are dying from suicide as they are under tremendous stress and confused as they are unable to figure how they are going to pass the intermediate exam. “The board announcing that there won’t be supplementary exams and that students who failed in exams will have to appear for the failed papers along with second-year exams is only adding to their stress. The state should stop playing with the lives of students and immediately award pass marks to all students,” he added. The SFI members, who took out a rally from Kachiguda to RTC X-roads, said that along with graduating students, the state should conduct improvement exams without charging any fee from the students. “The chief minister should give assurance to families who lost their children,” said RL Murty, state president, SFI. The ABVP members, who gave a call for bandh of junior colleges on Tuesday, burnt symbolic effigies at Osmania University Arts College, Alwal, among other places on Monday. Their demands include free re-evaluation of papers, sacking of inter board secretary and education minister for not conducting online classes and conducting exams without a proper plan and quick remedial measure. Cops caught protesters at various places and took them to the respective police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/several-colleges-remain-shut-over-student-suicides/articleshow/88399048.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The tribunal accepted the submission made by Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), who stated that the structure already had permission for the construction. The GCZMA said that it had wrongly recorded the survey number in its records and it was corrected later, which could have led to the applicant before the tribunal to believe that the structure did not have approvals. The water resources department (WRD) had backed the GCZMA’s submission, whereas the Captain of Ports (CoP) had agreed to the applicant’s allegations that the structure was in the no development zone. “The appellant filed a complaint dated June 30, 2021, which stand is also supported by the Captain of Ports. However, executive engineer, work div-I, water resource department, Porvorim, took the stand that permission existed but the number was not correctly mentioned. This was upheld by GCZMA,” the tribunal noted. The coastal authority said that it found that in its records the WRD had wrongly mentioned that the work will be carried out in ‘survey no 3589 of village Anjuna’ which was later corrected. “In view of the reasons given in the order of the GCZMA that the issue only involved correction of particulars of the property for which permission had already been given, we do not find any merit in the appeal, which is hereby dismissed,” said the tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/crz-issue-ngt-upholds-coastal-authoritys-order/articleshow/88420406.cms||---

Raji Sivan co-owned the factory along with her husband Sivan. They stayed at Nedunguzhi and the factory functioned nearby. Police said that she may have committed suicide on Sunday night. Police have garnered from residents and relatives that Raji was concerned about the mounting debts they had taken from Kerala financial corporation (KFC). She had handed over documents of her property at Vilappilsala to the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU). She hoped to get a decent compensation for the land that shall be acquired for the construction of the university. However, she was later told that their land was not included in the area that would be acquired. Raji was distraught after learning this and they also couldn’t get back the documents which further added to their misery, said Pavithran, a neighbour. “They were planning to pay off loan and debts using the compensation,” he said. Along with her husband, Raji had been running the hollow bricks manufacturing unit for over a decade. The lockdown induced by Covid-19 had also affected their business and the debts had increased. Her body was taken to Medical College Hospital. Inquest procedures have been completed and the body will be released to relatives after postmortem and Covid-19 test. She has a son who studies in Class VII. The death of Raji has intensified the ongoing protest by the action council formed at Vilappilsala against the delay in acquiring the land for the technological university.

---||Pune||Ganeshkhind Modern College gets autonomy||Pune: The Modern College of Arts, Science & Commerce, Ganeshkhind, has been granted autonomous status by the University Grants Commission. Principal Sanjay Kharat said that the college would introduce an indigenous curriculum that will focus on the employability, practical, project-based learning, and skill development of its students. Kharat said, “Autonomous status will enable the college to design a curriculum that will enhance employability and entrepreneurship skills among students.” A committee constituted by the UGC, under the chairmanship of Renu Jain, vice-chancellor of Devi Ahilya University, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, visited the college on October 25 and 26. After inspection of the facilities offered by the institution and interaction with all its stakeholders, the committee recommended the college for autonomous status. Kharat said, “Research component will be included in the regular curriculum to promote research aptitude among students. As per the NEP 2020, the institution will collaborate with national and international universities for academic exchange programmes,” he said. The college has already received approval for setting up fish disease diagnostic centre under the Pradhanmantri Matsya Sampada Yojana. This centre will help aqua culturists in timely detection of diseases in fish and thereby help production. he added. The college has received sanction under DBT Builder Scheme for promotion of research activities. Accordingly, the college has presented an Indo-Portugal collaborative research project. In addition to this, the college has submitted an Indo-UAE research project at Sharjah University, UAE. The affiliating system of colleges is unwieldy. The colleges do not have the freedom to modernize their curricula or make them locally relevant which autonomy provides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ganeshkhind-modern-college-gets-autonomy/articleshow/88399067.cms||---

The plea was supposed to come up for hearing in the court of the district and sessions judge on Monday. Speaking to TOI, Singh said he would file a fresh plea soon. “We wanted to make certain changes in the application which is why we decided not to press for it.” Three bail applications of Ashish Mishra have so far been rejected by the district courts. Earlier, the special investigating team (SIT) probing the matter, had claimed that the attack on farmers was a “premeditated conspiracy” and added more IPC sections, including "attempt to murder" and provisions under the Arms Act, in the FIR against Ashish and 12 co-accused. Arvind Tripathi, district government counsel, said, “The counsel of Ashish filed an application for withdrawal of the bail application as it has been disposed of as ‘not pressed’. The applicant’s counsel can file a new bail application after the chargesheet is filed in court and they have a copy of the charges presse against their client.” On December 14, the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) had dropped the IPC sections of accident and included sections 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt using weapon which is likely to cause death), 34 (criminal acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), along with provisions of the Arms Act to go along with the sections of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy against the accused at the request of the SIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-counsel-withdraws-ashish-mishras-bail-plea/articleshow/88397594.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Delhi||Delhi government extends free ration benefit till May||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that the Delhi cabinet has decided to extend the benefit of free ration till May 2022.“Ever since the pandemic struck Delhi, we have been giving free ration to the people of Delhi. Those who come to get their ration from the ration card are given free ration. The period of giving free ration is getting over and thus is being extended further for six months,” Kejriwal said in a digital press briefing. “Now, the facility of giving free ration to the people of Delhi has been extended till May 31,” he added. The Delhi government said in a statement that the pandemic is still prevalent and everyone has been hit by it. “The pandemic has affected earnings of the common man and also left many people unemployed.” It further said that the central government has not announced the extension of the free ration scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana beyond November 30 as of yet. In such a situation, the Delhi government has extended the initiative of free ration for another six months, the statement said, adding that 72.8 lakh people will benefit from the free ration initiative of the Kejriwal government. The CM had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in November on this issue. “During the Covid period, the central government had given free ration to every ration card holder across the country in addition to the ration that was being made available every month. The Delhi government made the monthly ration supply free from its own end,” the letter read. The CM had further written that due to these steps of the central government and the Delhi government, the poor got a lot of relief during the pandemic. “Many people lost their jobs during the Corona period...In such a situation, I request you that the central government further extend this scheme of giving additional free ration to the people for six more months. The Delhi government is extending the scheme from its own end to provide people free additional ration for six months,” he wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-extends-free-ration-benefit-till-may/articleshow/88399702.cms||---

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the minimum temperature could reach 13 degrees on Tuesday. ‘Gradual rise in minimum temperature by 2-4 degrees during the next 3-4 days very likely over the region,’ it states. Met officials said the increase will be caused by a change in the wind direction to north-easterly to easterly. Cold wave conditions in Kutch may end by Monday, they added. Naliya, with a minimum temperature of 7.1 degrees, was the coldest weather station in Gujarat, followed by Deesa at 8.2 degrees and Kandla at 8.9 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/minimum-temperatures-set-to-rise/articleshow/88399069.cms||---
---||Pune||No extension likely for caste certificate submission||PUNE: Students applying for engineering courses under the reserved category have been told to submit their caste certificates before the end of the second round to confirm their admissions. Many students, who are yet to receive their caste certificates, will forfeit their seats if the certificate is not submitted on time. Youth groups have written to the Common Entrance Test cell to extend the date of certificate submission but the cell has refused it stating that it will be unfair to other students who have a valid certificate but are unable to get the seats allotted. A student from Latur, who was allotted a college in Wagholi, Pune said that she had applied for a caste validity certificate almost six months ago, got the receipt in August, but has not been able to get the certificate as yet. “There should be some measures to speed up the process for students. Tuesday is the last date for the submission of the certificate. If it is not issued before 3pm, we lose the seat. We cannot afford the open category seat in a private college. Without the scholarship that is offered to reserved category students, we would not be able to pursue the course,” she said. Kalpesh Yadav, joint secretary of Yuvasena, said since there are students who had applied long ago and have yet not received their certificates, they must be given some leeway. “The receipt of submission of application for caste validity certificate must be taken as proof and the students must be allowed some more time,” said Yadav. However, CET cell’s commissioner RS Jagtap reasoned that already one extension of almost 15 days has been given to the students. “The first round was supposed to end on December 7 and the students were told to submit the caste validity certificate then. However, considering the requests from students to extend the dates, we told them to submit it by December 21. The second round is ending on December 21. After this, there will be admissions at the college level. If we give another extension, then students who have not been allotted any college but have a valid certificate will be at a loss,”  He added that they will will lose out on rightful seats. “Also, another extension cannot be given in the rounds itself because it will delay the academic year. Lastly, the process takes a lot of time and hence students could have applied for the certificate maybe two or three years ago. Till the time we see the certificate, we are not sure whether the student is genuine of the caste or not. Considering all this, we cannot give another extension,”Jagtap said .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-extension-likely-for-caste-cert-submission/articleshow/88399062.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||Delhi||HC: Remove illegal temple structure on public land||New Delhi: Taking a dim view of the Delhi government’s dilatory tactics, the high court on Monday ordered removal of an illegally constructed temple in south Delhi. The court underlined that it was the government’s “own stand” based on a report by Delhi Police that the encroachment was on public land and was not being used for religious purpose, didn’t have a priest, and no offering was being given. “The whole city has been taken for a ride for so many years... When the Supreme Court and the high court find encroachment, where is the question of the religious committee?” Justice Rekha Palli remarked before fixing a 10-day deadline for the government to remove the structure. Once the Supreme Court has directed that no unauthorised construction will be permitted in the name of a temple or a gurdwara, there is no question of not removing the encroachment so that it is not misused, the high court added when the government cited a note by the lieutenant governor to contend that it is awaiting for the religious committee’s nod. “Where does it say the court cannot order demolition of an illegal structure?” it asked. The order followed a plea by a resident that during the Covid-19 pandemic, somebody trespassed and illegally constructed a temple on a footpath on Bhishma Pitamah Marg, right in front of the petitioner’s property. The court asked Delhi Police to provide assistance in the removal while directing the local station house officer to ensure that the idols and religious pictures put inside the illegal structure are placed in a nearby temple so that their sanctity is preserved. During the hearing, the authorities said a proposal would be sent again to the religious committee headed by the LG for seeking consent to demolish the structure. However, referring to the 2009 Supreme Court order, the high court underlined, “Now the respondent cannot take shelter that the matters to be sent to the religious committee as it is a religious structure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-remove-illegal-temple-structure-on-public-land/articleshow/88399712.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The woman who tested positive for the new strain of the virus has received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccination, and, having fully recovered from her illness, has been asked to quarantine herself at home for a week.Dharwad deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said that swab samples were collected from the woman after she developed a fever on December 4. “A day later, reports confirmed that she was infected with Covid-19. We subsequently dispatched her samples for genomic sequencing, the reports of which arrived on Monday, confirming that she was infected with the Omicron variant,” Patil said.Pointing out that the woman had been hospitalised for five days since she had a fever, Patil added, “We collected swab samples from her ten days after she was admitted. The results of the latter test confirmed that she had recovered. Protocol dictates that we have to test those confirmed infected with the Omicron strain twice in the span of 24 hours before they are discharged, and these tests have confirmed that she has recovered. But we will collect her swab samples once more, to be on the safer side.”The DC said that the woman had not visited another country, adding that the fever she contracted was the only symptom of the Covid infection. “The 137 people who were identified as primary and secondary contacts have all been tested, with reports confirming that none of them is infected. We are also testing the staff at the hospital where the woman was treated. Since she was fully vaccinated, her symptoms were not severe, and she recovered in a week’s time,” Patil added.The DC said that, in the aftermath of the cluster outbreak at the SDM College, the district health department was ensuring that swab samples of all those testing positive for the novel coronavirus were sent to Bengaluru for genomic sequencing. “But positivity rate in the district is now in the 0.1 to 0.2% range, with only three to four fresh cases being reported daily,” added Patil.Fine for violating rules to be hiked?Dharwad DC Nitesh Patil said that the district administration would consult experts, and issue a fresh set of guidelines to curb the spread of Covid-19 infection during the forthcoming Christmas and New Year celebrations. “We will also keep a close watch on events where a large number of people are likely to assemble such as weddings, jathres, where we will ensure that Covid protocol is strictly adhered to,” Patil said.He added that, besides ramping up testing across the district, the district administration would increase the penalty for violation of Covid rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dharwad-dist-reports-first-omicron-case-administration-to-step-up-vigilance/articleshow/88397612.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

A female raptor bird was found near the Ellora caves, around 30 km from here, sparking huge excitement among the local birding community. The iconic bird, which every year undertakes migratory journeys of up to 22,000-km, is one of the most celebrated winged creatures among the birding community. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak, who spotted the bird sitting on an overhead power cable in a turmeric farm on Sunday, said it was the first record of Amur falcon in Aurangabad district. “It is a first recorded appearance of the bird as the passage migrant enroute to its astonishing migratory journey. If the rare sighting does not turn out to be a one-off, and more such appearances of Amur falcon are witnessed in our area in the next few years, it will be a topic of study whether the migratory path of the bird is evolving,” he said. “Known for feeding largely on insects, Amur falcon breeds in eastern Siberia and winters in South Africa. Sized around 28 cm to 31 cm, these birds with exceptional flying ability and resilience, has the highest recorded stay in India at Nagaland where it halts for around three to four weeks before flying across Peninsular India,” Pathak added. Protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, Amur falcon is categorised as the ‘Least Concern’ in the Red List of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/iconic-amur-falcon-spotted-for-the-first-time-in-aurangabad-dist/articleshow/88397608.cms||Prasad Joshi

Many schools, including those run by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), greeted students by offering roses and sweets. School campuses were decorated to mark students’ return. A section of schools, however, has decided to resume classes after the Christmas vacation. AMC education officer Ramnath Thore said the majority of schools reported moderate turnout of students on day one of the schools’ reopening. “While the offline classes for students of Class I to Class VII have resumed after a huge gap, all schools have been asked to show strict compliance with Covid prevention norms and follow SOP issued by the civic administration,” he said. The civic administration has already announced five days a week of schools. There will be no school on Saturdays and Sundays. “The holidays are expected to be used for sanitising classrooms and putting in place other Covid prevention arrangements,” Thore said. Jay Washikar, a parent, said it was heartening to see the children return to classrooms. “Learning in a classroom has no match with virtual learning, especially when the children are involved. We pray that the schools run uninterrupted and effective teaching-learning process becomes norm during the current situation,” he said. As reported by TOI, a section of schools from Aurangabad has refused to offer transportation services to students as the classes are resuming ‘abruptly’ in between the stipulated academic year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/schools-reopen-students-get-warm-welcome/articleshow/88397610.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Court stays pharma firm from using brand for its painkillers||Ahmedabad: An additional district judge at Kalol in Gandhinagar district has ordered a local pharmaceutical company not to temporarily use brand TEPALS for its painkiller tablets after a Hyderabad-based pharma company alleged infringement on its trademark rights on TAPAL . The court felt that there is visual similarity in mark with substitution of capital A with capital E, and the words are phonetically similar which could cause confusion among consumers. MSN Laboratory Pvt Ltd from Hyderabad has filed a suit against Kalol-based pharma company, Elikem Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, complaining that the latter is infringing upon its trademark rights and sought Rs 1 crore in damages. MSN’s counsel Samrat Mehta submitted that the company had got TAPAL registered for its products in April 2010 for treatment of acute and chronic pain conditions like osteoarthritis, low back pain, spondylitis etc. It has different product variants of TAPAL registered, and this brand cannot be used by others. MSN Laboratory complained that it came to know that Elikem started manufacturing and marketing its painkillers under brand TEPALS in July this year. Despite issuance of a legal notice, the company did not stop using the brand, which is identical and deceptively similar including drug colour and package code of TAPAL. The Hyderabad company alleged that continuation of use TEPALS would dilute and damage its goodwill in the market. After preliminary hearing, the court said the defendant (Elikem) has substituted one vowel A with E. “In terms of pronunciation, nobody is going to make the distinction between TAPAL and TEPALS. The two are likely to be confused. Visually, the defendant’s mark is far too similar to the plaintiff’s mark to allow to be continued. There seems no reason for the defendant to have adopted a mark so close to that of the plaintiff’s,” the court observed that posted further hearing on December 22.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-stays-pharma-firm-from-using-brand-for-its-painkillers/articleshow/88399088.cms||---

---||Kochi||Not cohabiting with first wife ground for divorce: Kerala HC||KOCHI: A Muslim man refusing to cohabit with his first wife after marrying another woman amounts to unjust treatment and it is a valid ground for divorce, the Kerala High Court held in a judgment on December 1. Bring to the fore the often-neglected Quranic injunction that Muslim men marrying more than once should treat their wives equally, a division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Sophy Thomas granted divorce to a 50-year-old woman who got married in August 1991. Thalassery family court had declined to grant divorce on her plea filed in 2019. The 51-year-old husband, who was abroad, had married another woman and had stopped visiting the appellant since February 2014. The husband did not deny the allegation about his subsequent marriage before the court. Seeking a divorce, the woman cited section 2(viii)(f) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. It allows a woman to seek a divorce if the husband, who has more than one wife, fails to treat them equitably in accordance with the injunction of the Quran, in verse 3 of the chapter titled ‘An-Nisa’. In the judgment, the court said it is the burden of the husband to prove that he treated his wives equitably. Staying away from the first wife for five years itself would show that he had not treated them equally, the court said. “The refusal to cohabit and perform the marital obligations with the previous wife is tantamount to the violation of the Quranic injunctions which command equal treatment of the wives if the husband contracts more than one marriage. In such circumstances, we have no hesitation to hold that the appellant-wife is entitled to get a decree of divorce,” the court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-not-cohabiting-with-the-first-wife-ground-for-divorce/articleshow/88399092.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Two RSS men, including 'main accused', held for Shan's murder||A day after two political murders in Alappuzha rocked Kerala, police on Monday said two persons have been arrested for SDPI state secretary K S Shan's murder and they have got substantial leads in BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan's killing. Those arrested are Rajendraprasad alias Prasad (39), Kavachira House, Ponnadu, Mannanchery and Ratheesh alias Kuttan (31), Kulamaki Veliyil, Kattoor, according to Alappuzha district police chief G Jaidev. Both are RSS workers and they were arrested by a team led by Alappuzha crime branch DSP K V Benny.  ADGP Vijay Sakhare said Prasad was the main organizer of the crime as he had arranged the men and vehicle besides planning it. "We have caught the main accused. We know the identity of the others involved and police teams have been deployed to nab them. As of now, there are 10 persons involved," he said.  Police have also found a car suspected to be used by Shan's assailants. The white car was found abandoned at a remote place near Kanichukulangara temple in Cherthala. Forensic and fingerprint experts examined the vehicle after local people informed police about it.  On Ranjith's murder, Sakhare said the probe team has got substantial leads. "There are 12 people involved... We have the names of suspects and we are probing them," he said and added that strict action would be taken against those involved in the conspiracy as well.  Sakhare said there were some developments in the case which he can't disclose at the moment. “It is being probed whether there was any larger conspiracy in both these murders," he said.  On charges of lapses in police intelligence in preventing the murders, Sakhare said the BJP leader's murder was unexpected. “Nobody expected that Ranjith would be targeted. If we had any information, we could have prevented it," he said.  Ranjith's body was cremated on Monday evening at his ancestral home in Valiazheekal. The body was handed over to relatives after autopsy around 11am and it was kept at Alappuzha bar association for a while for the public to pay homage. It was later taken to his house in Alappuzha, where Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai paid his respects. Several BJP leaders, including state president K Surendran, were among those who attended the cremation.  The district collector has, meanwhile, extended the prohibitory orders in Alappuzha under Section 144 CrPC till 6am on December 22, based on a report from the district police chief on possibility of violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/two-rss-men-including-main-accused-held-for-shans-murder/articleshow/88399087.cms||---

Twenty-two teams have been formed in Ghaziabad to conduct the survey, officials said. This will be the third serosurvey to be conducted in the district. While a state-wide serosurvey was conducted after the Covid second wave in June, the Ghaziabad administration had in September last year carried out its first serosurvey. In a recent letter to the state health department, additional chief secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad stated that in view of the transmission of Omicron, a new strain of coronavirus, an updated assessment of the existing antibody level among the people was necessary for policy formulation. For the study to gauge the immunity generated against the disease among the masses, as many as 4,696 samples from different districts would be collected and sent to King George’s Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow for examination, Prasad said. The five districts have been asked to ensure that all samples reach KGMU’s microbiology laboratory by December 25. On Monday, Ghaziabad district surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said the survey would be conducted in several urban areas besides rural localities of Loni and Muradnagar among others. Altogether 640 samples would be collected from the district for which medical staff underwent training on the day. Till Monday, Ghaziabad has reported 55,718 cases with 55,234 recoveries and 461deaths. In the last two months, the district saw an overall rise in positivity rate from approximately 0.01% to 0.04%, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/amid-omicron-concerns-5-day-serosurvey-begins-in-ghaziabad/articleshow/88400144.cms||Aditya Dev

The entrance examination will be conducted either through Central University Common Entrance Test (CUCET) or Delhi University Common Entrance Test (DUET), the varsity stated. In the notification issued, the university said, “The Executive Council of the University of Delhi at its meeting held on December 17 resolved that the admissions for the academic session 2022-23 onwards in all undergraduate courses of DU shall be made through CUCET or DUET.” Further details of the entrances will be released soon. DU’s statutory bodies had earlier approved the proposal to conduct entrance examinations from the next academic session. A group of teachers has, however, opposed it. Abha Dev Habib, secretary of Democratic Teachers’ Front (DTF), said, “The notification clearly shows that the move towards admission through entrance tests is coming as a part of the NEP rather than our own organic need. With the fixed number of seats, there is no new opportunity created for students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-all-ug-admissions-via-common-test-from-next-yr/articleshow/88399718.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Residents want Sus hill robbers nabbed soon||PUNE: Friday’s incident of violence and robbery perpetrated against two friends on an evening stroll at Sus hill in Pashan has shocked residents, who climb the hill on a daily basis. The hill and surrounding areas have largely been considered safe by people who frequent the green lung for their exercise routine, often alone. WhatsApp groups of residents are now flooded with discussions about the crime, with suggestions flying on safety precautions to be taken, such as carrying whistles, going in groups, etc. The residents also want the perpetrators to be nabbed, so that it becomes a deterrent for others. TimesViewThe steady rise in crimes on hillocks dotting the city is of concern for sure. The shocking incident of the duo being assaulted and robbed on Sus hill in Pashan last week during a casual stroll may lead to many residents giving up the practice of walking up to natural spots. Police should deploy personnel on the hillocks for patrolling in the early morning and evening hours to prevent such crimes in future. Also, exemplary action should be taken against the criminals involved in last week’s incident.TOI visited the hillock on Monday and found that the main path is usually bustling with people climbing up and down. However, there are several secluded patches, quiet and hidden from the main path due to trees in the rocky, uneven terrain — and many such spots were strewn with liquor bottles, cigarette packets, water bottles and other leftovers. Rajini Nair, a resident who goes to the hill every day with her husband for many years now, said such incidents make one look at everyone with suspicion, destroying any feeling of safety on a walk. “It makes you fearful. Every man or group of men makes one look over one’s shoulder constantly. I go alone sometimes, but such incidents make you wary. The police must arrest the culprits soon. They should also have someone patrolling the area at least once every evening,” she said. Kalpana Salunkhe, Kanchan Londhe and their friends are also regulars to Pashan-Baner hill. “It is shocking to note that such incidents are reported every three or four months, whether a chain snatching or a robbery. Perhaps many cases go unreported, too. There should be police presence in the area, at least alternate days, if not daily. It will automatically put fear in the minds of criminals,” said Salunkhe. Tai Arjun and Rajeshwari Yadav, who are college students, often come to the hillock to sit and study quietly. While they generally do not venture too far from the main pathway and come when it is still daylight, they say they have seen a rising number of people who are drunk or carrying liquor onto the hillock. “This can get dangerous. We do not know what they will do. Tekdis (hills) are the only open spaces left in the city, for one to enjoy some peace amidst nature without having to pay for it. Efforts must be taken by officials to ensure that such areas remain safe for the common public,” said Yadav. A 34-year-old lab technician and his 30-year-old woman colleague were robbed of cash and valuables worth Rs1.07 lakh by three men on the Pashan-Sus hill around 6.45pm on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-want-sus-hill-robbers-nabbed-soon/articleshow/88399083.cms||Ardhra Nair

The man’s son was earlier arrested for kidnapping and raping a minor girl and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for sexual assault. Majiullah Khan, a resident of Antop Hill in Wadala, was arrested by the Colaba police after the officials of the Mumbai sessions court filed a complaint against him for submitting a fake birth certificate of his son and misleading the court. In March this year, the Santacruz police arrested Amjad Majiullah Khan (21) under the IPC sections for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor girl. As the girl was a minor, police also invoked the stringent sections of POCSO. However, the accused's father, Majiullah, through their lawyers produced a birth certificate that showed Amjad was 16 years and 10 months old. The Santacruz police, which had raised suspicions about the accused’s age, started a probe led by police sub-inspector Vishal Gaikwad. Gaikwad visited Amjad’s native place in Gonda district in UP to verify the birth certificate presented by Amjad’s father. The village development officer in Gonda said that no such certificate had been issued by them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-man-submits-sons-fake-birth-cert-held/articleshow/88399737.cms||Ahmed Ali

The court, however, granted bail to two co-accused, Imran Ansari and Kareem Dhanani, from whom no recovery was made in the case. The NCB had booked them for illicit trafficking, abetment and conspiracy.Kohli was arrested on August 28 under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. The NCB, through Additional Solicitor General of India Anil Singh and Shreeram Shirsat, argued that for bail, a case can’t be dissected for each accused, as the crime is all part of the same conspiracy. Senior counsel Aabad Ponda for Kohli said no case of illicit trafficking is made out, and only a small quantity was alleged to be recovered. Ayaz Khan counsel for Kareem said it was at best a case of consumption of small quantities which attracts maximum sentence of a year, hence bailable. Advocate Sonal Parab for Imran also sought bail on similar grounds. The reasoned order by HC will be available later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-denies-actor-arman-kohli-bail-in-drugs-case/articleshow/88400143.cms||Swati Deshpande

Many teachers said they were noticing that the writing speed of students had decreased while answering question papers. Teachers said that not only were the children easily distracted, but thetwere also many careless mistakes while writing answers. . The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education announced that the board examinations for Std XII and Std X will be held offline from March 4 and March 15, respectively Bhagwan Pandekar, a mathematics teacher, said that generally the syllabus is completed by mid-December. However, this time it will be completed by the month-end or January first week. “When schools reopened, the students were lagging in problem-solving speed. But now it has picked up to a certain extent. They are also making small mistakes because of the lack of focus. Hence, we are advising students to set a timer and solve problems,” said Pandekar. Pradeep Thakar who has been an English teacher for the past 27 years said t while the top 10-20% of the students have been able to cope, the same could not be said about the remaining. “If the physical classes had started from June, we would have had remedial classes and could have easily brought the low performing students at par with the others. Also, during online classes, writing was limited. Hence their speed has reduced,” said Thakar. Swati Rairikar, a science teacher for over 17 years said that sitting in one place for three hours would take a lot of practice. “Kids are easily distracted now and they end up making careless mistakes. Tthey need to solve mock question papers, apart from the prelims, which would anyway be conducted by the school,” said Rairikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/practise-completing-papers-on-time-teachers-advise-board-students/articleshow/88399077.cms||Ardhra Nair

There are no directions regarding allowing only fully vaccinated people to use buses, reducing the capacity, among others. We are worried the new variant might take us back to square one.

Pointing out that raw materials have become dearer by over 70% in the last two years, MSMEs said they were forced to compromise on their profit margin. Representatives of Madurai district tiny and small scale industries association (Maditssia) and 20 affiliated associations demonstrated in front of the district collectorate.While fresh job orders available for Trichy-based MSMEs into the production of thermal power plant components are already down due to policy changes, the surging prices of steel, aluminium, plastic and other raw materials have sounded the death knell for recuperating MSMEs. A tonne of steel sold at Rs 38,000 as of October 2019 has surged to Rs 71,000 in the corresponding period. Similarly, aluminium that was sold at Rs 1.44 lakh a tonne until two years ago is being sold at Rs 2.43 lakh, MSMEs said. “Governments can form a committee to find the reasons for the frequent rise in prices. Even the raw materials produced within the country are becoming costlier while the production cost has not changed significantly,” N Kanagasabapathy, chairman, Trichy trade centre said. MSMEs in Trichy directly employ about 50,000 people. While the MSMEs are on the verge of closure due to debt, entrepreneurs said such uncontrolled surge in prices of raw materials would force small scale industries to cut down jobs. “Our profit margin is becoming slimmer and it will be difficult for us to pay wages, taxes and loans if there is no control in prices of steel,” said, P Rajappa, president of Tiruchirapalli District Tiny & Small Scale Industries (Tiditssia). MSMEs have planned to sustain the protest until a decision is taken by the Union government on controlling inflation.Maditssia president M S Sampath said the nearly 10,000 MSME units across sectors in Madurai employ nearly 70,000 people. Around 90% of the units are micro and tiny units with a workforce of less than 10 people. At least 75% of the units depend on iron and are hit by the price escalation. Sampath said iron manufacturers and traders are minting money as their cartels decide the market price. There are 15,000 units in Tamil Nadu that are into manufacturing plastic materials and plastic packets and sachets and they are hit by the plastic price hike. Manufacturers also suggested that the government introduce materials banks like land banks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/msmes-shut-for-a-day-over-surge-in-raw-material-prices/articleshow/88399096.cms||---

The same highway before and after the stretch is maintained respectively by the state highways and Thirupparaithurai toll plaza and those parts are smooth.While the highway was recently widened and upgraded by the state highways covering Allur and Mallachipuram villages, the 2 km stretch between Andhanallur and Dindukarai remains highly inaccessible. The state highways maintain the portion of the highway till Andhanallur and the toll plaza operator at Thirupparaithurai manages the other stretch of the highway from Dindukarai. However, the intermediate 2 km long stretch was abandoned by the authorities.“Two-wheeler riders and outsiders accessing the stretch are not aware of the deep potholes, they slip frequently as they approach the bad stretch in the same speed as they access the smooth portion of the highway. Villagers are rescuing them frequently,” P Aiyarappan, a road safety activist said. Even though the villagers repaired the damaged road recently under the MGNREGA scheme by roping in locals to fill the potholes, it did not help much. The stretch remains unattended because of a jurisdictional confusion between the concessionaire managing the toll plaza nearby and the NHAI. The toll plaza operators claim that the stretch was not part of their jurisdiction.Even as the NHAI was recently identified as responsible for maintaining the stretch, no work has been carried out to repair the stretch. “Within a week, we will do patchworks in the damaged stretch,” an official source in the NHAI said.Meanwhile, the villagers along Karur NH are disappointed over their grievances not being redressed and have planned to stage a protest to attract the attention of the district administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-karur-nh-stretch-filled-with-potholes-poses-threat-to-commuters/articleshow/88399090.cms||Deepak Karthik

The incident occurred when the 42-year-old owner of the workshop was on his way to drop the suspect to catch the bus. “Two days after the chain snatching, the workshop owner came to us and filed a complaint. He claimed that he was scared after the incident,” said sub-inspector Balwant Gavit of the Talegaon Dabhade police. Gavit said according to the complainant, the suspect was working as a daily wage worker in his engineering workshop. Gavit said that on December 17, the suspect wanted to go to his native place in Uttar Pradesh. After the work was over, the complainant decided to drop the suspect at the Chowk, so that he could get the bus, the sub-inspector added. “When the complainant stopped the motorcycle, the suspect got down and snatched his gold chain. Within no time, he fled into the jungle,” Gavit said. The complainant did not know the full name of his employee. He had not taken his Identity proof as well, the sub-inspector said. “Now, we are investigating the case from all the angles. We are working on certain clues. Futher probe is on,” the sub-inspector of the Talegaon Dabhade police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-files-snatching-plaint-against-staffer/articleshow/88399095.cms||---

A 150% increase over the base fine of Rs 4,000 has been proposed for a second offence, and a 200% increase for the third offence. The proposal is yet to be placed before the standing committee, and will then be further sent for approval to the state government. There are roughly 51,000 registered cattle in the city, of which 37,000 have RFID tags implanted. Municipal officials say that apart from getting ear tags, a small chip is implanted under their skin when they are impounded. “Many stray cattle we find on the roads are those that have been abandoned as they no longer have economic value to the owner. A large part of these are without any RFID chips, so tracing the owner is next to impossible. A clear sign of the economic angle to the issue is that we hardly find stray buffaloes,” said a senior AMC official. What is taking the AMC long on RFID chip implantation? “It is a process that requires time. We are able to implant RFID chips in 37 to 40 animals a day. Every day, we can send about 21 animals, whose owners are untraceable, to shelters run by NGOs in central Gujarat,” the official said. From April 1 to December 18 this year, the civic body caught 10,524 heads of stray cattle and lodged 777 police complaints against cattle owners. Of the cattle caught in this period, the owners of just 1,349 animals reclaimed their cattle after paying fines totalling Rs 77.5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stray-cattle-amc-wants-higher-fines-for-repeat-offenders/articleshow/88399094.cms||---

The QR code-based cards, which will have complete demographic and key clinical details, along with information about the individual’s eligibility under various health schemes of Delhi government, will be issued on the basis of voter IDs. Clinical data, including blood group and drug allergies, and medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension — vital for doctors to provide personalised healthcare services — will be included in the e-health cards. The latest diagnosis and details of recent surgeries will also be available. Residents will get a temporary card for one year, which will be converted to a permanent one after their details are validated by a team engaged by Delhi government in a door-to-door survey. The teams will update the details, along with geo coordinates, on an app. Each resident will be issued two permanent cards — one large with detailed information and a smaller one the size of an ATM card. Along with the permanent card, a kit containing a letter from the CM, brochure on benefits, usage, dos and don’ts and 10 printed stickers with a QR code will be sent via Speed Post. The e-health card will have the emblem of India at the top, followed by the name and logo of Delhi government. It will contain the card holder’s name, father’s name, date of birth, age, gender and address. A unique health ID will be assigned to the individual as per National Digital Health Mission guidelines. The Delhi government plans a centralised health helpline, which will be provided on the card. Residents can register themselves at the facilities, Delhi health card web portal, mobile app or during the door-to-door survey. Each family will have the option to use a single or multiple phone numbers for registration. However, a phone number already registered for a family cannot be used for another. HIMS will be implemented in all government hospitals first and then private hospitals will be connected to the system in a phased manner. All services related to patient care, like hospital administration, budgeting and planning, supply chain management, backend service and processes, will be brought under this system. Earlier this year, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, after reviewing the HIMS project, had said: “Delhi government is committed to providing the best and most modern healthcare facilities to people. We want them to access the most modern and world-class health facilities without any problems.” He had added that HIMS is a “monumental step in this direction, so we must be extremely serious towards its implementation and expedite the timelines”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/e-health-card-rollout-likely-in-feb/articleshow/88399729.cms||Sidharatha Roy

While random sampling is under way at the schools where cases were reported, the education department has asked all school managements to follow the standard operating procedures (SoP) stringently and report suspected cases to the health department for limiting the spread.The health department said that seven positive cases were identified in a private school near Samayapuram since December 13. While it is unclear how the spread was caused, most of those infected were hostellers, officials said. With a cluster emerging, the school management was asked to keep the premises closed for three days. The incident came to light after the health department found several positive cases from the private school during a contact tracing. “The school was told to carry out disinfection. We have collected over 100 samples randomly from students, teaching and non-teaching staff. Vaccination status of the teachers was sought,” A Subramani, deputy director of health services, Trichy, told TOI. As hostel students are most prone to infection while using restrooms and canteen, the health department has directed colleges and schools with hostels to ensure mask adherence in common access areas except during eating. The students must be screened while entering the campus and on noticing symptomatic children, the management must inform RBSK health teams available in every administration block.  Meanwhile, one positive case, a class VII student of a government school in Seerathoppu village, was identified by the health team separately. Over 100 samples from the contacts were collected at the school. “Headmasters in all schools including private were asked to follow the SoPs. Schools with limited classrooms are conducting classes on a rotational basis to avoid overcrowding,” R Balamurali, CEO, Trichy said. Insisting tha parents need not panic, officials urged the them to keep a close watch on their children’s health for symptoms. The health department said that notices will be sent to all educational institutes to alert the nearest PHC if any positive case was confirmed through RT-PCR test for following isolation and contact tracing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/8-test-covid-ve-in-two-trichy-schools/articleshow/88399101.cms||Deepak Karthik

As the session resumed in the council, opposition members demanded the resignation of minister Basavaraj, accused in a land grab case. In the assembly, the Congress legislators demanded a debate on the ongoing clash between the MES and pro-Kannada organisations. They asked the speaker to allow a debate on the 40% kickback charges by the Karnataka State Contractors Association. Protests marred the first part of the session, and question hour was also disrupted by loud noise and sloganeering. For six days in a row, not a single topic relating to North Karnataka has been mentioned, disappointing people of the region who were hoping for solutions to a range of issues.Farmers want legislators to raise issues including the Kalasa-Bunduri project, Upper Krishna project (phase 3), desilting of the Almatti dam, and relocation of offices to the Suvarna Vidhana Soudha. A day before the commencement of the winter session, the farmers had provided a list of 21 important issues to be discussed.Chamarasa Malipatil, honorary president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, told TOI that the sugarcane industries owe farmers Rs 3,000 crore, while numerous irrigation projects are stalled. "It is unfortunate that elected representatives are raising trivial subjects and ignoring the issues concerning North Karnataka despite the fact that the session is being held in Belagavi," he remarked.Despite the Supreme Court's green signal to issue a gazette notification for Kalasa-Bunduri, work has yet to begin. According to Ashok Chandaragi, a political activist from Belagavi, the union government's reluctance to provide environmental clearance is a major cause for the delay. Mahadayi issue should be extensively debated in both houses, but it is disappointing to see the elected representatives engaging in issues that are irrelevant to the region.Eranna Gowda, a farmer leader from Bagalkot, said increasing the height of Almatti dam from 519.6 metres to 524 metres under the Upper Krishna (phase 3) is a crucial project because an additional 100tmc water may be stored for irrigation.K T Srikantegowda, JD(S) MLC during the session urged the chairman at the council to allot dedicated time to discuss NK issues. Ignoring the problems of this region is insulting the people here. The house should take up the discussions on priority, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/issues-related-to-north-karnataka-relegated-to-back-seat-at-belagavi-session/articleshow/88397629.cms||Shreyas HS

Presiding over a pre-Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) event on ‘Local Goes Global’, he said exporting locally-produced goods will increase foreign exchange earnings and realize the vision of an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ through the ‘Vocal for Local’ initiative. Patel said Gujarat was at the forefront of exporting pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals, plastic materials, textiles, gems and jewellery, organic chemicals, dyes, ceramics, etc. Gujarat has also successfully bagged GI tags for traditional products like Patola from Patan, embroidery from Kutch, furniture from Sankheda, and Bandhani from Jamnagar,among others. With facilities and assistance provided to exporters through the ‘One District One Product’ programme, Gujarat has emerged as a leading exporter with a 30 per cent contribution to India’s total exports, the CM said. An official statement said the state has 10 air freight terminals equipped to handle perishable goods meant for export, along with a well-connected network of roads, rail, waterways and airways.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Path labs run by unqualified persons’||AHMEDABAD: The next time you use a pathology laboratory for medical diagnosis, be sure to verify that the reports are certified by a qualified pathologist. While numerous pathology laboratories have sprung up in the last 18 months due to the Covid pandemic, many of them are run by unqualified professionals, which is not only unlawful but also in violation of Supreme Court directives. According to Dr Dilip Dave, president of the Gujarat Association of Pathologists and Microbiologists, there 1,800-2,000 laboratories in the state that are run by qualified professionals who hold an MD Pathology degree or a diploma in Clinical Pathology, which are done after MBBS. “Compared to this, there could be about 5,000 laboratories in Gujarat that are not following the Supreme Court directive of 2017, according to which only an MD pathologist or MD microbiologist doctor can examine, authorize and sign pathology laboratory reports,” said Dr Dave. Dr Rajendra Lalani, a pathologist and past president of the association said they raised the issue of pathology labs being run by unqualified persons many times but in vain. “Just like crackdowns on quacks, the administration should ensure that pathology laboratories which are key to disease diagnosis are run by qualified professionals,” said Dr Lalani. Experts say a large number of pathology laboratories in the state are owned, run and operated by laboratory technicians, who need to work under the supervision of pathologists. Moreover, these technicians also seem to be authorized to sign reports without the presence of pathologists, according to the association. Many qualified professionals are allegedly involved in certifying pathology lab reports without personal supervision and allowing private laboratories to use scanned copies of their signatures. “It has come to our notice that some pathologists working at government colleges are also involved in these unlawful practices by ‘selling’ their signatures to private laboratories,” said a medical expert. In one instance, the signature of a pathologist working at a government hospital was used by nine different laboratories in Vadodara, Karjan, Bodeli, Halol and other places, which shows the severity of the issue, the expert said. Lalani said the association filed a review petition in the Supreme Court on the grounds that the apex court’s orders were not being followed. He said that in many instances, pathologists were just signatories for reports, for which they charge huge fees. “They charge a lab between Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 a month to use their signature in reports,” said Lalani. Such laboratories often “tie up” with qualified professionals who “sell” their signatures and authorize technicians, sometimes qualified BSC- MLT and many times with no qualifications at all, to use their names and signatures on reports. This practice is rampant, he said, and prevails across the country. Signatures of pathologists on lab reports make it difficult for patients to get legal redress at consumer courts, he further said. “Laboratory reports play an important part in health diagnostics. There are cases, such as for low platelet counts, where pathologists verify the figures shown by the machine. The issue at hand is that in the absence of a pathologist, there can be loopholes in the report which can compromise treatment of patients,” said Dr Mehul Shah, secretary of the Gujarat chapter of the Indian Medical Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/despite-sc-order-pathology-reports-being-generated-by-unqualified-persons/articleshow/88399102.cms||Bharat Yagnik

The district reported its sixth Omicron case on Monday, traced back to the Nursing College cluster. The student was confirmed infected on Saturday. Dakshina Kannada district surveillance officer Dr Jagadeesh said, “All the six who have tested positive for the Omicron strain are students, four of whom are from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya. However, none of them has travelled outside the country.” Dakshina Kannada Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Ashok H said that, “The only person who is still infected with the new strain of the virus is a nursing student, and is displaying no symptoms of the infection. We have spoken to the student, and sent her samples for an RT-PCR test.” Meanwhile, two more people were confirmed infected with the new variant of the novel coronavirus in neighbouring Udupi district. Officials in both Dakshina Kannada and Udupi have directed authorities in their respective health departments to trace the source of the Omicron infection. Officials of the health department in Udupi had sent samples of two individuals for genome sequencing after a family of four tested positive for the novel coronavirus. An 82-year-old man and his 73-year-old wife have both tested positive for the Omicron variant. Udupi deputy commissioner M Kurma Rao said, “Neither of them is displaying any symptoms although the woman is a cancer patient.” Rao said that swab samples from 167 people had been sent to be tested using genome sequencing thus far. “We have received results of 33 of them,” the DC said. Udupi district health officer Dr Nagabhushan Udupa said that both the husband and wife who were confirmed infected with the new variant had received both doses of the Covid vaccine – the first dose in March, and the second in May. “In fact, an 11-year-old girl in the family was tested for Covid-19 since she wanted to go to Bengaluru to attend classes on campus. When she was confirmed infected on November 26, her family members were duly tested,” Dr Udupa said. 11 cases in DK, Udupi districts The coastal districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi on Monday reported 11 fresh cases of Covid-19. While Dakshina Kannada reported six new cases, taking its tally of active cases to 168, five people in Udupi tested positive.

The decision comes on the backdrop of instructions of senior officials of the state health department to district health department. Commissioner of state public health department Ramaswamy N was recently in Nashik during which he instructed the district health machinery to be prepared in case of resurgence of Covid cases in the district. During the visit, deputy director of health of Nashik division PD Gandal conducted a meeting of all the officials concerned to take necessary steps to curb spread of the infection. Zonal manager of BVG Ashwin Raghamwar said, “As per instructions from deputy director of health all necessary steps would be taken by us to ensure Covid patients are provided transportation from their residences to hospitals or from one hospital to another for treatment.” He added, “During the second wave of Covid-19, we had reserved 18 of the 47 ambulances with us for ferrying Covid-19 patients. However, over a period of time as new cases started to decline the ambulances dedicated for ferrying only Covid patients were then utilized for ferrying non-Covid patients after properly disinfection the ambulances concerned.” Raghamwar said that if there is a resurgence in cases of Covid 19, as per instructions from senior officials of the health department, they would again deploy the same number of ambulances for ferrying Covid patients. Ever since the outbreak of the pandemic, the BVG ambulances in the district have ferried over 22,000 Covid patients.

---||Delhi||Construction ban in Delhi lifted, trucks allowed||NEW DELHI: The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) on Monday allowed resumption of construction and demolition (C&D) activities in Delhi-NCR and the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items into the capital with immediate effect. The panel had ordered a slew of measures in view of alarming levels of pollution in Delhi and its neighbouring cities. Only CNG and electric trucks or those carrying essential commodities were allowed to enter Delhi while construction was banned, with exception given to some projects, including railways, ISBTs, airports, hospitals, sanitation and public utilities. Lifting the ban, the commission noted an improvement in air quality and IMD’s weather forecast, which indicated continuation of favourable trend of wind speed and climatic conditions to facilitate dispersion of pollutants from the region. The CAQM order said persons or agencies undertaking C&D activities must strictly comply with directions for dust-control norms issued by the commission, Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules and various CPCB guidelines. However, the commission said sites or units where construction activity was stopped or suspended cannot resume work now. CAQM also ordered that the construction projects that come under the jurisdiction of Delhi and the NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh have to immediately register on web portals that were launched for online remote monitoring by agencies for dust pollution management. CAQM has asked Haryana and Rajasthan to commission the portal by January 20. The commission on Friday had allowed authorities in Delhi-NCR to resume physical classes for students in Class 6 and above, colleges and other educational institutions with immediate effect. It had also said that physical classes for students up to Class 5 can begin from December 27. It had also ordered operations of thermal power plants located within a 300km radius of Delhi and given relaxation to industries. Meanwhile, after the ban was lifted, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said the anti-dust guidelines, which are in place to control pollution at construction sites, must be strictly followed by all agencies, whether private or government. “The night patrol teams will monitor sites to ensure that all 14-point norms are being followed. The anti-dust campaign will continue,” said Rai. The minister said Delhi government will continue other measures like water sprinkling, anti-open burning campaign and PUC checks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/picking-up-the-tools-again/articleshow/88399749.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: KT Rama Rao keeps pedal on road closure issue in Secunderabad Cantonment||SECUNDERABAD: A day after alerting defence minister Rajnath Singh on closure of civilian roads in Secunderabad Cantonment, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao raised the road closure issue again with Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy urging him to keep the roads open for the benefit of millions of commuters and locals. In a fresh message on Twitter, KTR sent a list of 21 civilian roads closed by the local military authority (LMA) and tagged a map showing the number of roads that were closed to Kishan Reddy, who represents Secunderabad in the Lok Sabha. “Hope you (Kishan Reddy) can do justice and ensure LMA reopen all roads for the benefit of millions of our citizens,” KTR tweeted. With KTR himself championing their cause, Cantonment TRS party cadre staged a protest at Tadbund demanding that all civilian roads be reopened. Led by M Krishank, newly-appointed chairman of Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation, the cadre shouted slogans. Welcoming KTR’s initiative, members of Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad (FNECS) said: “Instead of a single party, all political parties should join hands to resolve the road closure issue in Secunderabad Cantonment.” “Our goal is to ensure reopening of 21 public roads which were shut by the LMA,” secretary of FNECS CS Chandrasekhar told TOI. Towards achieving their goal, FNECS also launched a Twitter campaign ‘Greensainikpuri’ and sent nearly 400 posts to the ministry of defence highlighting the LMA’s posturing on the civilian roads. FNECS said Centre’s reply in the Lok Sabha on only two roads being closed was unacceptable. “We have been fighting with the LMA to reopen all the roads. We have appealed several times to the MoD to send senior defence officers to Secunderabad Cantonment and study the civilian roads closure issue,” a FNECS member said. Recollecting deliberations at a round table organised by TOI recently, people of north-eastern colonies urged MA&UD special chief secretary Arvind Kumar, who attended the round table, to take a delegation to MoD to resolve the issue. On Sunday, KTR tweeted on the issue tagging Rajnath Singh. Meanwhile, M Krishank tweeted: “Sir @KTRTRS, request you to ask @kishanreddybjp garu to come to FAFA Gate.. That will prove how they’e lied in Parliament... Residents have been suffering and due to this road closure, School children are forced to use main road which has seen accidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ktr-keeps-pedal-on-road-closure-issue-in-secbad-cantt/articleshow/88399387.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Private hospitals to have special wings for foreign returnees||HYDERABAD: Amid growing worries over the Omicron variant of Covid-19, health authorities have urged private hospitals to have separate outpatient wings and inpatient treatment facility for foreigners and those who have travelled abroad recently. Officials have ordered that RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 be done in all the private hospitals and that the state health department be notified if any of these patients develop symptoms. According to the authorities, the rule applies to both risk and non-risk countries. The same system that was in place during the second wave will be in place again, they said. Separate outpatient and inpatient services will have to be in place for foreigners in both government and private hospitals. “Anyone approaching hospitals with any kind of illness should be subject to the same rules,” the officials said. “We do not want the hospitals to become hotspots again like in the second wave,” an official said. There are only a few dozen hospitals that provide medical tourism services and a majority of foreign patients visit these hospitals only. The authorities have directed that if positive results are found, the samples should be sent for genome sequencing. All the hospitals were also asked to keep detailed records of foreign patients who come for treatment. Meanwhile, the test results of those whose samples were taken from Paramount Colony and Tolichowki area are kept under wraps as officials are refusing to reveal the results. Health staff have collected more than 1,000 samples from these areas. While officials say there are no plans to impose any restrictions anytime soon in the state, the government is taking inputs from various departments and stakeholders in the wake of Omicron cases in the state. Officials are concerned that Omicron is likely to speard faster than other variants. They say that if restrictions on large gatherings are imposed, they will only apply to the city because majority of cases appear to be from Hyderabad and that the majority of Omicron positive patients are in Hyderabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-hosps-to-have-spl-wings-for-foreign-returnees/articleshow/88399629.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||High seropositivity may help in Omicron fight: Ex-CCMB chief||HYDERABAD: CCMB former director Dr Rakesh Mishra said high seropositivity is a huge advantage for India despite the worries over a possible third wave of Covid-19. Though Telangana is among the top three Indian states in Omicron cases, Dr Mishra told TOI that high seropositivity and vaccine coverage were the most significant advantages to minimise the third wave. “In the country, around 70 to 80 per cent population is seropositive and in cities like Hyderabad the seropositivity is around 90 per cent. This means that they have antibodies due to previous infection and as well as double vaccination. The hybrid immunity makes them asymptomatic when infected with Omicron. However, they can spread the virus to others. So Covid-19 protocol has to be followed thoroughly,” said Dr Mishra. He further said: “Currently, unvaccinated younger people and less immune older people with comorbidities are vulnerable. Even if 2 per cent of the population is infected, then there would be a huge demand for hospital beds as it happened in the second wave. To prevent this, wearing mask and following Covid-19 protocls is important.” The former CCMB chief said India has the advantage of weather. “We do not need central heating. We can keep the windows open.” Dr Mishra said people should use N95 masks and avoid crowded places. “Otherwise, the virus will spread and there can be new mutants that may come up. Currently, the variants are only affecting the upper respiratory system and not infecting the lungs due to which we are not witnessing a situation like lack of oxygen supply,” he said. The former CCMB director also said that sewage surveillance would play a key role in identifying the spread of the infection. According to Dr Mishra, the population’s hydbrid immunity (through previous infection or vaccination) makes them asymptomatic when infected with Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/high-seropositivity-may-help-in-omicron-fight-ex-ccmb-chief/articleshow/88399656.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The blueprint for the beautification plan is now being made. However, before the beautification works can be carried out, it must be ensured that sewage stops flowing into the lake. Accordingly, on Monday morning, Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) administrator Kadambari Balkawade visited the areas from where sewage flows into the lake. A survey of the Sarnaik Colony, Datt Tarun Mandal, Shreyas Terraces, Pushkaraj Terraces and surrounding areas was done jointly by Balkawade, city engineer Netradip Sarnobat, former deputy mayor Ravikiran Ingavle, former corporator Tejaswini Ingavle, Ruturaj Khirsagar, health inspector Dinesh Shinde and others. Balkawade said, “There will be a detailed study on waterlogging at Sarnaik Colony; how or from where the sewage gets here; how the sewage gets mixed with the lake water; what alternative measures can be adopted to avoid this; if a filteration plant can be set up here etc. We have asked the officials to submit a blueprint soon so that the required funds can be provided to implement a permanent solution.” Ravikiran Ingavle, the former deputy mayor of Kolhapur, said, “Since many years, the dispersion of rain and sewage water has not been taking place at Sarnaik Colony and Datt Tarun Mandal areas. The drain water coming from the Timber Market area is stagnating here. The same water then mixes with the Rankala lake water causing pollution. The beautification works will get carried using the Rs 15 crore budget, but we request the KMC to stop the Rankala lake’s water pollution on priority first.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/rankala-lake-gets-rs-15cr-fund-must-stop-sewage-issue-first/articleshow/88397648.cms||---

Reading gave me a wide view on the lives of people belonging to different cultural backgrounds,” he said. While addressing the new and aspiring writers, Sharma said, “Young writers should inculcate personal experiences in their work which provides more authenticity and makes the reading interesting for their readers. They can mix fiction, but in order to serve an enhanced story to the people, one needs to introspect and pen their thoughts.” Author Chirta Mudgal shared a similar advice while in conversation with Kanak Rekha Chauhan at another session. Mudgal said, “My anger for the ills in the society got portrayed when I penned the instances from my life I faced while living in different cities and villages in India. It is really important as writers to add value to literature by the progressive thoughts which could change the view of society towards the oppressed sections.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/read-books-before-you-start-writing-aspiring-writers-told/articleshow/88399752.cms||---

The parking lot is expected to ease the parking woes in Mussoorie, especially during peak season. The parking has a capacity of 212 vehicles while the Town Hall building has parking lots on two floors with a space to accommodate over 150 vehicles. However, both these parkings are yet to become operational. Public Works Department officials who constructed the parking at Kincraig said that the parking will be managed by the tourism department and handed over to them soon. The parking at Town Hall will be managed by the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority and officials said that it will be operationalised in the next few days. After inaugurating the parking, Dhami said,“Mussoorie is a premier tourist destination of Uttarakhand and the development of parking lots in the town would help in reducing traffic bottlenecks and promote tourism in the hill town.” He added that another parking space for 500 vehicles was being planned at Zero Point. Dhami also laid the foundation stone for a residential complex for families evicted from Shifan Court due to the Mussoorie-Dehradun ropeway project. Foundation stone for the Mussoorie-Dehradun drinking water project was laid as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/respite-from-parking-woes-for-mussoorie-tourists-as-multi-level-car-parking-inaugurated-in-hill-town/articleshow/88398423.cms||Anmol Jain

---||Hyderabad||Telangana to come up with own policy for Omicron cases||HYDERABAD: In view of the increasing number of Omicron cases, the state is set to break away from current central guidelines of 15 days of compulsory quarantine for all patients and come up with its own policy. State health authorities are in favour of allowing asymptomatic patients to remain at home while field surveys will be taken up to trace symptomatic cases. Terming the Centre’s policy unfeasible, the health department stated that since 95 to 97 per cent cases of Omicron are expected to be asymptomatic, putting everyone in quarantine centres will be a waste of resources. “Since they do not have any symptoms, they do not require any treatment. Instead our concern is the remaining symptomatic patients who might require hospitalisation. The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly and is bound to spread further. In this scenario putting asymptomatic patients in quarantine may be useless. WHO’s policy and the Centre’s policy in this regard are not feasible,” said Telangana director of public health, Dr G Srinivasa Rao. Substantiating the decision, the director of public health said that all 20 patients detected with the Omicron variant and admitted at the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) are asymptomatic. “There is no clear basis on which they can be discharged. There is no recovery to base it on as they were not having any symptoms in the first place. Currently, we are following the Centre’s guidelines on keeping them for 15 days before we can discharge them. However, there is no use of this quarantine. Instead of this, the policy should be to find symptomatic patients, test them, quarantine them and treat them before discharge. In Telangana, we want to stick to that,” Dr Srinivasa Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-come-up-with-own-policy-for-omicron-cases/articleshow/88399633.cms||Amrita Didyala

Speaking at The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave on Monday, the CM said by the time his “friends in the Opposition” would wake up, he would have already toured several districts. “There are people who think my touring is unupyogi but the people of UP have already made them unupyogi. Our government is working with three targets: nationalism, good governance and development. We are not among those who practise our religion within our homes or put tika but wipe it off when we come outside. If we don’t have hesitation in saying Bharat Mata Ki Jai at home, then we do not hesitate in saying it in public either,” the CM said. He added that by connecting good governance with nationalism, his government had focused on providing better security, stopping corruption completely and improving ease of living and ease of doing business. “UP was believed to be a hurdle in the progress of the country. In the past five years, UP has proved it is not a hurdle but ahead of all others in leading India on the path of development,” he said. Referring to previous governments, Yogi said that for them, development was limited to self or family and if extended to anyone, it would only include people of their caste. His government, on the other hand, had recognised UP as a large family and implemented a sustainable model of development, he said. The state, he added, was being developed under 734 urban local bodies. The Centre had identified 10 smart cities while the UP government had added another seven to the list. We are improving basic facilities and now, in 50 parameters in ease of living, UP is first, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/those-opposed-to-development-find-my-tours-unupyogi-uttar-pradesh-cm/articleshow/88400614.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Similar conditions will continue on Tuesday. Relief is expected on Wednesday with gradual rise in temperatures by couple of degrees. Normal weather conditions will prevail till the weekend, but there are possibilities of winter rains next week. As icy winds continued to sweep the city and the state, the minimum temperature in Lucknow recorded in the wee hours on Monday was 5.5 degrees Celsius, 3.2 units below normal. It was almost a cold wave like condition. However, there was some improvement in the afternoon when the speed of the wind dropped. As a result, the “wind chill” effect that was making people shiver despite bright sunshine eased. But even then the maximum temperature did not rise above 20 degrees, which was 4.2 notches below normal. State Met director JP Gupta said that a western disturbance is expected to hit the northern hill states on Tuesday, which will cut off the flow of icy winds towards the plains. Its impact would be felt in the state and the city on Wednesday with gradual rise in temperatures. “The western disturbance would cause rains and snow in the hills. It is expected to prevail till the weekend. Thereafter, flow of cold winds from the snowfed mountains would resume. Conditions may also become favourable for rains in the state by next week.

The shutter number 3 of the dam was closed at 12 noon after informing it to Kerala. During the past one-week TN had kept the spillway shutter raised up to 10cm. According to sources, it was the longest period in recent times for which the shutters of the dam were kept opened. “After 2018, water level rose to the upper rule level of 142ft for the first time this year. The number 3 spillway shutter had been continuously kept open to the minimum for the past 20 days as the water level reached the maximum level or close to it,” said a source. “The extreme rainfall received in the catchment area resulted in keeping the water level in upper rule level for more days. Due to the extreme rainfall, TN reduced the tunnel discharge from Mullaperiyar which also contributed to the increase in the water level,” said the source. In the last one-month TN released a huge amount of water from the dam to Periyar. “TN opened the shutters during night for more than five times and released huge amounts of water, causing flooding in the areas downstream of the reservoir” said Shaji Kurismumood, a resident in Vallakadavu. .Meanwhile, the water level in Idukki reservoir declined to 2,399.48ft on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tn-closes-mullaperiyar-shutter-after-a-month/articleshow/88399135.cms||---

The first lot of Alphonso mangoes from Devgad in the Konkan reached the fruit yar of Agriculture Produce Market Committee on Monday. Though still raw, the entire lot of 25 dozen was sold within a minute of its arrival. The mangoes could turn up to a week to ripen, said a seller. Traders at the market claimed that the wholesale rate for the mangoes is around Rs 3,000 a dozen and in the retail market, it is expected to be Rs 4,000 per dozen. Regular arrival of the fruit is likely to begin from early January. The 300 mangoes were to trader Sanjay Pansare. The first lot was supplied by Arvind Valke from his farm in Valkewadi of Devgad, Sindhudurg district. According to a source who is familiar with the mango trade, farmers who managed to save mango flowers by covering them with plastic during monsoon are now harvesting the pre-season Alphonso fruit and this crop is small in terms of its quantity. In the next fortnight, some 50 boxes of six dozen each are expected to hit the market. Navi Mumbai resident Samrat Shetty said the price is too exorbitant. “The premium Alphonso is not our cup of tea now. Prices should dip in a couple of months after which the common man will be able to afford it,” he said. Traders in the market said they expect prices to fall in the coming days, anticipating a good season with more produce. Pansare said he expects a good arrival of famous Devgad Alphonso mangoes next month with a bit cheaper rate. “In peak season last year, same varieties of mangoes were sold at Rs 500 a dozen and this season too, rates will fall considerably.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-1st-lot-of-25-doz-konkan-alphonso-reaches-vashi-sold-out-in-a-minute/articleshow/88398443.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi civic bodies resume work on key projects put on hold||NEW DELHI: The municipal corporations have resumed work on projects that were put on hold for over one month due to the pollution-forced construction ban in the city. The civic bodies are feeling pressured to complete the work with municipal elections to be held in the coming year. The construction ban further delayed projects that had already failed to meet deadlines, among these the Kishanganj underpass project of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and the Shahdara recreation park of the east corporation. Other projects facing March 2022 deadlines include the parking lots at Nizamuddin under SDMC, Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk and Shiva Market in Pitampura. “As soon as the resumption order was received, we got the work started at Gandhi Maidan on Monday. Work on the Kishanganj project will restart on Tuesday,” said a north corporation official on Monday. “Work has also begun on the Qutab Road parking and the heritage park opposite Red Fort.” Some civic officials argued that while the Commission for Air Quality Management permitted construction to resume on December 17, the ban on the entry of trucks into the capital hit the supply of construction material, making it “impossible” for contractors to start work in a full-fledged manner. They also claimed to be taking the prescribed steps to mitigate pollution at construction sites, such as installing smog cannons and dampening of dust. Due to delayed funds from the central government and also the construction ban, EDMC has extended the deadline for the Shahdara jheel recreation park to March-April 2022. “Though we have received the pending funds, there were other activities to be carried out simultaneously. So, we will take some time completing the Shahdara project. We will open the park to the public by the beginning of April,” said an official. Other work, including the construction of fixed compacting stations at 10 places, operation of trommel machines at the Ghazipur landfill and carpeting of roads, were also rebegun by the east body. Apart from the Nizamuddin parking project, SDMC’s engineering department claimed to have begun construction of biogas plants at Nangli and Kakrola, resumed operation of the trommel machines at the Okhla landfill, and resumed construction of an engineered landfill and of roads works for which funds were received from the Centre’s Urban Development Fund. “Since NHAI has decided to accept the inert material generated by the biomining of waste at Okhla landfill for road construction, we began work immediately,” said colonel B K Oberoi (retd), chairman, SDMC standing committee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-resume-work-on-key-projects-put-on-hold/articleshow/88399765.cms||Vibha Sharma

The court also held that in event of conflict between the RERA Act and the recovery proceedings of the bank under Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, RERA Act would prevail. The decision was given by the divisional bench comprising chief justice Akil Kurashi and justice Uma Shankar Vyas while deciding the writ petitions filed by the Union Bank of India against the order passed by Rajasthan RERA wherein while cancelling the bank auction, RERA directed the bank to hand over the possession of the semi-constructed residential project to RERA. Appearing on the behalf of the allottees, advocate Mohit Khandelwal said this order was given in the context of an under construction residential complex project titled ‘Sunrisers’ in which the entire project building was mortgaged by the developer to Union Bank of India (Erstwhile Andhra Bank), for obtaining a term loan of Rs 15 crore, though several flats were already booked by the allottees even before the said term loan. Later, due to non-repayment of the said loan by the promoters, the entire project building was attached by the Union Bank of India. Earlier, Rajasthan RERA in its judgment cancelled the auctions proceedings of the bank and ordered the bank to hand over the possession of the flat to RERA, which would get the project completed at its own level. “The Union Bank of India challenged the order by stating that the RERA does not have any jurisdiction over the bank as banks do not fall under the definition of ‘Promoters’ for the purpose of RERA Act. Moreover, the recovery proceedings of the bank cannot be halted by RERA,” said Khandelwal. The court rejected the claims of the Union Bank and ruled that pursuant to taking possession of the project, the bank enters into the shoes of the promoter and becomes the assignee of the promoter and thus, amenable to jurisdiction of RERA. Moreover, the RERA would prevail over SARFAESI, meaning thereby that the rights of the realestate allottees shall not be subservient to that of Bank. It was further held that the single member of RERA is competent to hear and decide the complaints filed before the authority. In the decision, the rights of the allottees have been considered paramount by court and it would confer wide powers to RERA. Further, the rights of the allottees cannot be infringed by the bank while exercising its legal rights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-hc-holds-banks-accountable-under-rera/articleshow/88399136.cms||Ajay Singh

For this, an aluminium box has been kept near Shangumugham bus stop. The initiative is the brainchild of Ajith Shankumukham. He said that he had experienced poverty and when he started earning, the first thing that came to his mind was to feed the hungry people. He did not hesitate to spend half of his earnings to feed the people. The box is made in such a way that one can donate food inside the box and the needy people can take it. The service is available for 24 hours daily. Rino Chandran, a friend of Ajith who lives abroad, had helped him by donating an amount of Rs 10,000 to launch the scheme. It has been 22 days since the scheme was launched and it has turned out to be a huge success as residents have also joined hands with Ajith. Around 100 food packets are being received per day. During some days, the number of packets even go up to 500. If the food packets are not available, Ajith with the support of residents deliver the food immediately. “A mother will never let her children starve, no matter what. This is the idea behind naming the box as ‘Ammayoonu’,” he said. “For me, success depends upon the number of people getting the food. There will never be a shortage in food. When I am at work, my friends and my natives will deliver the food. In case people cannot donate food packets, we will cook the food and packets will be kept inside the box. I have only one thing to say, please do not waste food,” said Ajith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ammayoonu-feeds-hungry-people/articleshow/88398451.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Modi govt has accomplished what was considered impossible: UP CM Yogi Adityanath||By: Adeeb Walter LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said the Narendra Modi government accomplished three things – scrapping of Article 370, construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya and Kashi Vishwanath Corridor – which were considered to be impossible. “No one would have thought that Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir would be scrapped. Everyone believed that it was their destiny, but when the people gave their blessings to the PM, he delivered it,” the CM said while addressing the audience at the Drone Show organised as a part of Azadi Ka Amrit Utsav at the Residency to mark the 75th year of India’s Independence and 100 years of Chauri Chaura incident. “Similarly, everyone believed that Ram Temple can never be built in Ayodhya but the construction of a wonderful temple has started. PM Modi also gave the country the new Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. This is New India,” he said. The CM also recalled the contributions of revolutionaries from Uttar Pradesh in the freedom struggle. “The First War of Independence revolt began from UP. On the one hand, we had Mangal Pandey while, on the other, we had Rani Lakshmi Bai. All the revolutionaries had only one vision and that was to get freedom from colonial rule. Chauri Chaura and Kakori Train Action are also among important events that shaped the freedom struggle. We all belong to a generation which is fortunate to celebrate 75 years of Independence,” the CM said. Yogi said the BJP government tackled Covid-19 pandemic effectively. “There was an outbreak of epidemic in 1917-1928 across the world in which crores of people lost their lives. No one was there to help people at that time, but the way India tackled Covid-19 outbreak is being hailed by the entire world,” he said. The CM also released a book on India’s First War of Independence. Union minister Meenakshi Lekhi, who was the special guest at the event, said: “Residency is the place which is witness to the First War of Independence. Every wall here has bullet marks that reminds us about the revolution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-govt-has-accomplished-what-was-considered-impossible-says-cm-yogi/articleshow/88399775.cms||---

Despite several warnings in the past, most of the commercial buildings in the city do not have fire NOC. Now, JMC-Heritage has started this campaign that will continue till next month where notices will be served to commercial building owners. JMC-Heritage chief fire officer Devender Meena said, “We have already sent more than 600 notices to various commercial building owners. Moreover, we are also making people aware of the importance of fire NOC. If all the building owners deposit the Fire NOC amount, then it is expected to give more than Rs 50 crore revenue to the corporation.” Most of the commercial buildings like shopping malls, rooftop restaurants, hotels and clubs are situated in Raja Park and Civil Lines. Rooftop restaurants, however, are yet to take fire NOC from the municipal corporation as per the bylaws launched by UDH three years ago. There are more than 300 rooftop restaurants in the Walled City without any safety measures, risking the lives of people. A cylinder blast at a rooftop restaurant on Tonk Road forced the government to form bylaws but very few rooftop restaurants have taken the NOC in JMC-Greater. Most have not even applied. Officials at JMC-Heritage said that not more than six applications have been received so far regarding fire NOC, but none have been granted NOC. Most of them have not complied with the guidelines. It is difficult and a major financial stake for these owners as they have to do a lot of changes as per the bylaws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-to-serve-notices-to-2k-bldgs-for-not-having-fire-noc/articleshow/88399137.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Officials had earlier ignored MPSC aspirants’ exam malpractice alerts||AURANGABAD: MPSC Samanvay Samiti — an organisation formed by aspirants of the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC) — has alleged that their members have been lodging written complaints about the alleged malpractices in recruitment exams with different authorities for quite some time now, but their concerns were not heeded to. The malpractices in different recruitment exams came to the fore only after the cybercrime branch of the Pune city police initiated a probe and uncovered the alleged scam in three different recruitment exams conducted recently. The three recently concluded recruitment exams for posts in the departments of health, education (TET) and MHADA have now come under the cloud. The health department and the Maharashtra State Council of Education authorities refused to comment on the matter. Rahul Kawthekar, the chief of MPSC Samanvay Samiti, told TOI, “We have been raising the issue since 2018, and have lodged complaints with the former chief minister and the current CM, apart from the police and different departments, but in vain.” “The response to our complaints has been indifferent, but for the first time, someone from the police department has taken cognizance of our complaint,” he said. Currently, the scam is being probed by Pune city police’s cybercrime branch and economic offences wing headed by deputy commissioner of police Bhagyashree Navtake. Navtake told TOI, “After going through the complaint, our seniors felt that there is a substance to the complaint. So we proceeded with the probe, only to uncover this recruitment scam.” Apart from lodging multiple complaints since 2018, Kawthekar lodged a complaint through email on October 31, stating that the question paper for the health department’s recruitment exam was leaked and the answer-sheets were making rounds since morning. The police and the cybercrime personnel, however, failed to take cognizance of the complaint. This was followed by Kawthekar sending an email on December 10 to the Aurangabad city police and Pune police commissioner, to alert them of the plan by three suspects to leak question paper of the MHADA exam scheduled on December 12. The complaint also stated that he has audio call recordings to support his statement and he also shared the phone numbers of the suspects. When contacted, Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta said as Pune police had started the probe, Aurangabad police did not interfere in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/officials-had-earlier-ignored-mpsc-aspirants-exam-malpractice-alerts/articleshow/88397669.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nashik||4 districts asked to ramp up Covid tests||NASHIK: The state health department has directed four districts of north Maharashtra — Nashik, Nandurbar, Ahmednagar and Jalgaon — to ramp up daily Covid-19 tests immediately. Dr P D Gandal, the deputy director (Nashik region) of the state health department, has written to the health administrations of the four districts expressing the department’s unhappiness on the issue. This comes in wake of the recent letter from the additional secretary of the Union ministry of health & family welfare Arti Ahuja, who drew the state health department’s attentions to the declining trend of weekly Covid tests in these four districts.  Sharing data, Ajuha said there has been a 35% drop in the weekly Covid tests in Nandurbar in the second week of December as compared to the first week of the month. Similarly, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts had also registered over 6% drop in Covid tests and Jalgaon saw a drop of less than 1%. “Nandurbar’s average tests (121) per million per day is below the World Health Organisation recommended number of 140, which is a cause of concern,” said Ahuja in her letter adding that it is imperative that the ongoing strategy of test-treat-track-vaccinate- follow Covid-appropriate behaviour is adopted to control the spread of the infection. According to Dr Gandal, the four districts have been directed to immediately ramp up their daily testing amid the threat of the Omicron variant. Officials of the four districts said with the number of Covid patients dropping, the number of tests also have reduced as tests are carried out on high and low-risk patients of Covid patients. District health officer of Nandurbar Dr Mahendra Chavan admitted that daily tests had dropped as there was no Covid patient in the entire district for the last two of months. But at present, there are five fresh cases in the district. “We have decided that any patient visiting the government hospitals, including the primary health centres, with Covid-like symptoms will have to mandatorily undergo RT-PCR test,” he said.  Medical superintendent of Nashik Municipal Corporation Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje said the NMC has already increased its daily tests||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/4-districts-asked-to-ramp-up-covid-tests/articleshow/88397670.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Delhi||Delhi reels under cold wave, temperature as low as s 3.1°C at Lodhi||NEW DELHI: The city continues to shiver as the cold wave swipes it on Monday with the weather department recording the minimum temperature at Safdarjung, considered the average for Delhi, at 3.2 degrees Celsius. Lodhi Road continues to be the coldest area at 3.1 degrees Celsius. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the national capital is likely to see some changes in the weather phenomenon over seven days from Wednesday due to arrival of two consecutive western disturbances. It may end cold waves, lead to cloudiness, change the wind directions to warm and moist easterly winds, and a possible drizzle by the weekend. IMD said the minimum temperature might hover around 4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. “Chances of cold waves from December 22 are very low due to the arrival of two back-to-back western disturbances, the first on Wednesday night and the other on December 24. The city will start seeing moist easterly winds and cloudiness from December 23, which may bring down the day-time temperatures. But the minimum temperatures will increase as the heat gets trapped due to clouds,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD. “The second western disturbance may lead to light rains or drizzle on December 26 and 27. Most of the remaining week will see easterly winds unlike the current northwesterly winds,” he added. While Monday saw light-to-moderate icy cold northwesterly winds at 10-15kmph, leading to the cold wave, Tuesday will see mostly calm winds as a prelude to the upcoming western disturbance, Jenamani pointed out. On Sunday, the wind speed was 15-20kmph. The drop showed a direct effect on the city’s air quality that dropped on Monday from “poor” to “very poor”. The cold wave or harsh winter conditions in the region are directly dependent on the speed of cold northwesterly winds, while with western disturbance, the wind directions change and the mercury rises. The city had already experienced a cold wave on Sunday at isolated regions of Lodhi Road. The western disturbance is a flow of high moisture winds and clouds from Mediterranean Sea to the Himalayas that sometimes leads to thunder activities in north India. It also leads to change in the direction of the winds from cold and dry northwesterly to warm and moist easterly that lead to clouding. According to IMD, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 3.2 degrees Celsius, five notches below the season’s average, as against 4.6 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature was 21 degrees Celsius, a notch below the season’s average, as against 19.2 degrees on Sunday. The maximum and minimum temperatures at Lodhi Road were 21 and 3.1 degrees Celsius as against 19.8 and 3.6 on Sunday. On Tuesday, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 21 and 4 degrees Celsius, with IMD forecasting mainly clear sky over the day but shallow fog in the morning. A cold wave is realised when the minimum temperature is lesser or equal to four degrees Celsius or at least four degrees Celsius below the season’s average. Meanwhile, the air quality index, on a scale of 0 to 500, was recorded at 332 as against Sunday’s 271. According to SAFAR, it will degrade further, but remain “very poor”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-reels-under-cold-wave-temp-as-low-as-3-1c-at-lodhi/articleshow/88399785.cms||Kushagra Dixit

Order to this effect were issued by Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta on Monday evening, asking all police station incharges as well as the respective branches to implement the same with immediate effect. The orders, however, are limited to woman cops of constable to assistant sub-inspector ranks. Gupta said, “The move is aimed at giving the woman constables more time to have a work-life balance.” The officer said that due to our social structure, women, irrespective of their profession, are expected to take care of their families and children. “At times, the work demands putting in more hours, which directly affects their personal responsibilities and lives,” Gupta said, hoping that the move will bring about a positive change As per the latest order, female police personnel will have to serve four less hours than their male counterparts. Of the 3,539 sanctioned posts of constables in Aurangabad city, there are 3,197 serving constables including 506 women, including three ASIs, 36 head constables, 99 Naik police constables and 365 constables. The initiative was first taken in the state by Nagpur commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar and the plan was successfully followed by the police units of Pune, Amravati and Navi Mumbai. The order is also in the line with th plan of director-general of police Sanjay Pandey, who — impressed by the initiative to take a considerate view in terms of duty hours for the women in the constabulary — in September this year decided to get it replicated across the state in a phased manner.  Pandey had said that when the metropolitan cities can implement this idea swiftly, other parts of the state also should be able to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-city-woman-cops-to-have-8-hour-shifts/articleshow/88397675.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Renowned social activist Aruna Roy flagged off the rally from here and called the law a potent weapon to curb corruption, ensure time-bound delivery of government services and make officials accountable for citizens’ sufferings. The bill was drafted by the government in 2020 but is yet to be tabled in the assembly. Over 100 civil society groups, including Suchna Evam Rozgar Abhiyan (SR Abhiyan), are participating in the rally aiming to educate civilians about the importance of the law. On Monday, around 100 activists collected at Shaheed Smarak, braving the cold temperature, and marched towards Civil Lines Phatak holding banners and posters reading bring ‘Jawabehi Kanoon’ (accountability law). “Gehlot government should bring the law in the budget session in February-March. The law was part of Jan Ghoshna Patra (election manifesto) which was officially adopted by them as part of the government agenda,” said Roy, while addressing the gathering at Shaheed Smarak. Reportedly, SR Abhiyan had drafted the bill and given it to the government in 2019. Thereafter, the government formed a committee under the IAS officer Ram Lubhaya who studied the draft and prepared it for the government in 2020. “A section of bureaucrats has raised objection against some provisions of the law calling it has more potential for ‘misuse.’ The provisions that even a senior officer can be held accountable and is answerable for delay in services is most objected by the officials,” said an official. Roy and Nikhil Dey have been working for the law since 2011. They held 100-day state wide campaign in 2015 for the same. Dey explained with examples that how the bill would empower the last man standing who faces difficulty in getting benefits of government schemes. In the next 45 days, the team including NGO workers, volunteers and interns would be holding discussions with the locals on the law’s importance and would submit the memorandum to district collectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civil-groups-begin-45-day-campaign-for-accountability-law/articleshow/88399147.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||DM to take charge of Christian College society: High court||LUCKNOW: The high court has directed district magistrate Lucknow to take over charge of the society that runs Lucknow Christian College and four other institutions in the city in order to manage their affairs properly. It has directed persons managing affairs of the said society to immediately hand over the charge to the DM who will act as administrator. The society runs Lucknow Christian Intermediate College, Christian Training College, Christian College of Physical Education, Centennial Higher Secondary School and Lucknow Christian College School. A bench of Justice DK Singh passed the order on a petition filed by Bishop Subodh C Mondal. The bench said “affairs of the educational institutions, particularly run by the charitable/religious organisations, such as the church and the society, should be conducted in a proper and transparent manner. The properties of the society should not be disposed of in the manner in which they have been disposed of in the past.” The bench further said, “It is evident that the affairs of the Lucknow Christian College are wholly mismanaged.

---||Lucknow||Broke neta-criminal nexus for better law, order: UP minister||LUCKNOW: State MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh on Monday said the BJP government’s primary challenge after coming to power in 2017 was to improve the law and order situation in UP. Speaking at the Conclave, the minister said, “The government was accused of political vendetta when it went after people from Opposition parties but what one did not realize was that these people were part of a nexus between politicians and criminals. It was necessary to break this nexus to improve law and order situation.” Claiming that industries which existed in the state before 2017 functioned as ATMs for criminals and politicians, Singh said, “The situation in the state was not so rosy when the BJP took over the state’s reins. UP was known as a BIMARU state. A nexus existed between politicians and criminals who were controlling UP. No tender could go through the system if these people were left out. It was necessary to weed out such elements and that is why CM Yogi Adityanath is called ‘bulldozer baba’ for taking action against them.” Speaking about the need to convert UP’s demography into an asset from a liability, Singh said that to provide an ecosystem for UP’s rural population to participate in improving the state’s GDP, it was necessary to ensure security and improve ease of living. “ODOP scheme helped in involving small industries in the growth of UP and bringing traditional industry into the economic fold. If people want to be a part of economic activity, they should also enjoy ease of living. The large force that exists in UP is from the rural belt. If they are fighting for daily livelihood, how do you draw them in? Government needed to give houses, toilets, ration, electricity and roads to them,” he said. The minister said when Yogi Adityanath became the CM, he came up with his own model of development. “Therefore, I call him the ‘Monk with an economic model’,” Singh said. Elaborating UP’s strategy, he said it was necessary to bring in contemporary industrialisation. “Working with the same bureaucrats who were a part of previous dispensations, the current government ensured that UP achieved second spot in ‘ease of doing business’ rankings,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/broke-neta-criminal-nexus-for-better-law-order-min/articleshow/88399801.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Hyderabad||Staying connected in Covid-19 times||By Preeti SinghLONDON: One of the many challenges of living in a Covid-19 world has been visiting family, home and friends beyond borders. Since it’s onset in March 2020 the pandemic has caused unprecedented uncertainty with countries shutting borders at short notice and limiting international travel due to a spike in cases. Flight cancellations, expensive quarantines and testing rules have meant the planning budget for travel is now double of what it was before the virus struck. Couple this with the anxiety for loved ones, many of those living outside have had to learn and adapt to new ways of staying connected, providing support and taking care of mental wellbeing. “I was five months pregnant and this was the time when not much was known about how the virus affects pregnant women. I was anxious and extra careful, not stepping out of the house. We then found out that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I have never felt this helpless in my life as my parents had to go through this all alone because we couldn’t reach India. This sort of settled it for us, to move back to Hyderabad and stay close which we did in June 2021,” says Yamini Nair who moved back to Hyderabad after her baby was born earlier this year. The Indian community groups on social media platforms are flooded with queries regarding the constantly changing rules around international travel and testing. Strangers have offered help to each other agreeing to carry prescribed medicines and important documents. “My father-in-law’s stay in the UK was prolonged due to flight cancellations and he was running out of his cardiac medication. I put up a request on the local Facebook group asking if anyone can carry the medicines for me and a very kind soul not only agreed to bring them along but also bought the expensive medicines even as he was returning from his own father’s funeral,” remembers NV Bhaskar Sarma, an engineer living in the UK. Weddings, funerals, birthdays have been quieter missing those who couldn’t reach due to covid-19. While many have waited months on end to see their families and friends, it has also been the constant worry of them staying safe that has added to the sense of unease. Neighbours and family friends are now on speed dial as turnaround times for visas increase given the pandemic induced backlogs. “My wife and I tested positive for Covid-19 and she was hospitalised for a few days too. It was just us without any help, however our family in India was our moral support. They checked on us constantly while friends and neighbours here helped us with food and medicines till we recovered,’ says Sandeep Kudupudi who works as an Admissions Manager at the University of Sunderland, London. As new variants make their way and living with the virus and the cycle of vaccinations becomes the norm, for those living abroad the reassurance of being only a flight away now comes with some conditions. Community support, online services and the hope to meet soon are some of the ropes that everyone is holding onto. “Most important thing is to keep the communication going. Checking in every day on my mom, sometimes even multiple times in a day has helped me. Her living closer to people she knows makes it a little easier to help in case of emergencies. We need to focus on the positive,” reminds Nidhi Chillakuru who lives in Germany. Grandparents are learning tech tools to celebrate occasions over video calls, whatsapp group chats have spiked and online game huddles are all part of staying connected during the pandemic. As one waits to meet in real life, the seamless virtual get togethers perhaps remain the safest bet for now.

---||Nagpur||Over 5L due for second dose in dist, Raut wants all covered in 10 days||Nagpur: Guardian minister Nitin Raut on Monday directed the officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Zilla Parishad (ZP) to complete Covid vaccination of those due for the second dose within the next 10 days. The officials are reportedly in dilemma as there is a difference of 13,67,532 between the first and second dose, and of them over 5 lakh beneficiaries are said to be due for the second dose in the district.Raut gave the directions at the review meeting on preparations to tackle Omicron variant of Covid-19 and to expedite vaccination.Raut confirmed to TOI that the deadline is 10 days for completion of second dose of people who are due for it.As per data of state’s public health department, the estimated population of the district is 52,72,665, of which 37,44,103 are eligible for vaccination. As on Monday, 35,48,396 (94.77%) of total eligible persons have taken the first dose. It means 1,95,707 (5.23%) eligible persons are yet to take vaccine.The NMC has claimed all eligible persons in the city have been covered with first dose. Appreciating the civic body’s achievement, Raut has directed the ZP and collector office to identify and ensure completion of first dose of remaining people in rural parts of the district.As per data available on central government’s website, 21,80,864 people from the district have taken second dose, which is 61.46% of those who have taken the first dose. Second dose of 13,67,532 persons is remaining (38.54% of first dose coverage).As per norms, gap of 84 days is required for those who took Covishield and 28 days for Covaxin. Around 90% of vaccinated people have taken Covishield. If an average of 10,000 people per day is considered, over 5 lakh people are due for second dose in the district.Average vaccination is 10,000-12,000 per day in the district. Considering the current vaccination, meeting the deadline given by Raut is a very difficult task for the NMC and ZP.Considering rise in cases due to Omicron variant in foreign countries, Raut directed the GMCH and IGGMCH to open separate wards with oxygen supply and other necessary mechanism for patients testing positive for Omicron. It means patients testing for Delta and other variants will be in same wards and Omicron will be in a dedicated ward.Divisional commissioner Prajakta Lavangare-Verma, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, CEO of ZP Yogesh Kumbhejkar, collector R Vimala, district task force and other officials were present at the meeting.The District Task Force informed Raut that Omicron variant is less effective on vaccinated population.Raut said that 750 people have arrived in the city from foreign countries. “They should be traced and tested. Testing of all flyers from foreign countries should be done,” he said.The guardian minister also gave directions to prepare task force of paediatricians as it is feared unvaccinated population below 18 years will be infected to a great extent if the third wave strikes. “Planning should be in place in city as well as rural parts for quick vaccination of population below 18 years, whenever it is allowed,” he said.He also ordered engaging special staff in all wards of the city and tehsil offices in rural parts of the district to receive and do needful for giving compensation of Rs50,000 to dependents of Covid victims. He said over 8,000 applications have been received — 4,500 from city and remaining from rural parts of the district.He also held meeting with working committee of district planning committee (DPC) to take review of funds and works approved for the current fiscal.Other Directions And Decisions* Develop special ward at GMCH for diagnosis, treatment and guidance of patients recovered from Covid-19* Ensure sufficient availability of oxygen, drugs, ventilators and other necessary materials* Police, NMC and district administration should hold meeting with various organizations to monitor and spread awareness about Covid appropriate behavior during Christmas, marriages and New Year celebrations* Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar from IGGMCH, who was presented Covid Yoddha award by Indian Critical Care Society recently, appointed in Covid Grievances Committee constituted by NMC* Utilization of funds approved under DPC unsatisfactory till December, expedite it* 100% funds should be utilized before code of conduct for civic polls come into place||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-5l-due-for-second-dose-in-dist-raut-wants-all-covered-in-10-days/articleshow/88398492.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Only N95 mask can protect against Omicron, make it mandatory: Doctors||Nagpur: With one case of reinfection and many cases of fully vaccinated people testing positive for the new Omicron variant, doctors in the city say the government needs to make the use of N95 masks mandatory. Only this mask and no other mask can guarantee full protection from the Omicron virus, which is highly communicable, they add. Pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar said, “To counter the threat of Omicron, which is very transmittable, everyone should wear N95 masks. No other mask should be allowed in public places. This is now the rule in Germany and other developed countries. N95 masks are cheapest in India.” Pulmonologist Dr Ravindra Sarnaik said which mask should be used is an old debate. “It depends on who has to use it and where. If it is in a hospital, N95 is the best possible mask. The same way, a high-risk person needs to wear it. At the community level, if one is moving in a relatively less crowded place then a simple mask is also enough. But N95 helps in protection of self and others too,” he said.Dr Sarnaik added that in March, when patients were serious, every other person was getting infected. “People were asked to use masks at home too then. Yet, the concept of masks is still not popular here. N95 gives 98% protection. But if one is out for a walk, any mask which covers the face is recommended. If in a market area or mall, a place with considerable public interaction or one where people have to speak a lot, they need double surgical masks,” he said.Internal medicine expert Dr Mohan Nerker said any mask is good, but N95 is excellent. “Protection varies depending on the type of mask. One should avoid coming in direct contact of droplets. Cost of N95 may be an issue for some people,” he said.Critical care expert Dr H Bora said N95 is a proven entity. “It filters 95% of our air. The government should also make it mandatory. People must voluntarily use it for each other’s protection and as a social responsibility,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-n95-mask-can-protect-against-omicron-make-it-mandatory-doctors/articleshow/88398499.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No opinion yet on MSRTC, state merger, panel tells HC||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Monday reiterated its concern over the suffering caused to students who rely on ST buses even as the state-appointed committee, set up to look into grievances of the union, in its interim report said that it has not yet formed any opinion on the merger of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) with the state government. The HC bench of Justices P B Varale and S M Modak said it would like to issue a notice to MSRTC employees in a contempt petition filed by the corporation, but posted the matter to Wednesday afternoon as the court day came to an end. “If students residing in rural areas are suffering, if there is some disturbance in their education, we will take care of it,” assured the HC. Advocate Gunratan Sadavarte, representing the union, said he would prove at the next hearing that the employees did not violate the court order by participating in the strike. He further said that 50 staffers have ended their lives and there ought to be an early resolution to the standoff between employees and the state so that the figure does not rise. The bench told Sadavarte that the employees “are also causing some financial burden on common citizens as private bus operators are charging more” after senior counsel S U Kamdar, for MSRTC, said that only 3,400 of the 13,000 ST buses are currently plying across Maharashtra. The HC bench said: “Let them go to work; [let] preliminary mode of transport be made available…There are commuters who may opt for daily commuting through ST service... since this is cheapest mode available; many of them are students.” Kamdar and counsel G S Hegde, also representing MSRTC, said the industrial court had granted a stay against the strike and the HC, on November 3, had restrained the employees from stoppage, strike and abstaining from work, and hence their strike amounts to contempt of court orders. Hegde informed the HC that it has made 342 employees and one union as parties to its contempt petition. The state, though special counsel Shailesh Naidu and its pleader P P Kakade, tendered the interim report which said it is yet to consider three aspects—legal, financial and administrative terms—and their impact on the state coffers and its budget. The committee, headed by chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty, said salaries of MSRTC employees are almost on a par with that of state employees after the pay hike announced by transport minister Anil Parab on December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-opinion-yet-on-msrtc-state-merger-panel-tells-hc/articleshow/88399903.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||GHMC demolition drive leads to tension in Hastinapur||Hyderabad: A demolition drive against illegal shelters and commercial structures by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) led to tension in Hastinapur area in LB Nagar on Monday. Demolition notices were issued to around 10 structures and officials said that most of them were under-construction buildings with neither approved plans nor permission from GHMC. As the excavators and labourers went about their work, the demolition of a ‘goshala’, which is a part of Santhoshi Mata Temple in Hastinapur, led to tension in the area. The temple priests and local BJP leaders staged a protest outside GHMC office in LB Nagar against the demolition. The temple staff claimed that they did not receive any notice, while the BJP leaders alleged that the ‘goshala’ was demolished under the instructions of local TRS MLA Devireddy Sudheer Reddy. “The ‘goshala’ must be built again at the space where they demolished it. The goshala shed is within the compound wall of the temple and still they demolished it,” Sama Ranga Reddy, BJP leader in-charge of Rangareddy Urban district, said while addressing the media. But GHMC officials maintained that none of the constructions that was demolished during the drive had permissions from the civic body. The demolition comes a little over a week after special chief secretary of municipal administration Arvind Kumar issued instructions to municipal authorities to inspect all ongoing constructions within their respective jurisdictions and act against ones that do not have appropriate permissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-demolition-drive-leads-to-tension-in-hastinapur/articleshow/88399165.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath’s tenure weighs heavy on opposition’s 7 years: UP deputy CM||LUCKNOW: UP deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said on Monday that there was “no anti-incumbency” against the Yogi government and reiterated that the BJP was poised to get a dedicated vote share of 60% in the state assembly elections. Speaking at the Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave organized by The Times of India, Maurya said the state government has its ear to the ground and knows the situation at the grassroots. “Our government did not discriminate with the people while implementing the various welfare schemes,” he said and emphatically stressed that BJP would again win more than 300 seats in UP elections. Maurya said people have understood that seven years of the Narendra Modi government has delivered more governance than what was seen for the past 70 years. Similarly, five years of Yogi government weighs heavy over the past seven years when opposition parties ruled the state. “If we strived for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya and rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi, then we also provided 30 lakh houses to the poor under PM Awas Yojana and more than 2 crore toilets to the poor households,” the deputy chief minister said. Maurya, who also holds the portfolio of PWD, claimed that the BJP government has doubled the length of national highways in the state from 6,000km to 12,000km in the past five years. He said the state government laid special focus on construction of rural and district roads to provide better connectivity to the people. This was done despite the pandemic which slowed down the economic and development activity in the state, he added. “All this happened because of the double engine government of the BJP at the Centre and the state,” he said. Maurya highlighted how the martyred defence and police personnel, meritorious students and sportspersons were given due respect by the government with the construction of roads leading to their houses. Maurya said people should only compare the work done by the Yogi government with both the previous SP as well as BSP governments to ascertain the change in the ground situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogis-tenure-weighs-heavy-on-oppns-7-yrs/articleshow/88399818.cms||Pankaj Shah

Addressing public meetings in Jaunpur and Mirzapur districts after dedicating a number of highway projects to the nation and laying foundation of several projects on Monday, Gadkari said, “In the past five years of Yogi regime, highways and expressway projects of Rs 3 lakh crore were completed in UP. Retain Yogi in UP for next five years and I will ensure more road projects worth Rs 5 lakh crore. UP’s road infrastructure will match the standards of Europe and will be better than in US.” The infrastructure development work done in UP so far is just a trailer and the real film is yet to come, said Gadkari, mentioning, “I do what I say. UP will have roads on which moving at speed of 200 km per hour and competing bullet trains will be possible.” There were days when people spent four hours to cover the distance between Delhi and Meerut, but today this journey takes just 40-45 minutes, he added. Endorsing Yogi strongly, Gadkari said, “The rule of goonda and mafia elements in UP has ended, Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of Ramrajya is being realised, the condition of education, health, farm and all other sectors has improved due to good governance of Yogi.” I have travelled in UP a lot earlier and remember how the people were deprived of power supply and other facilities before 2017, he added. “Today, the country has changed. I appeal to you to support Yogi once again and continue the double engine government to ensure good law and order attracts investment which will end the problem of unemployment,” Gadkari said. In the coming days, the farmers of state will also help in emerge as producers of energy as ethanol will reduce dependency on petroleum and end the problem of payments of sugarcane farmers. Production of plastic from ethanol will also boost economy and farmers will help in producing green hydrogen, he added. Highlighting the development of waterways, Gadkari said he ensured clean Ganga before Prayagraj Kumbh as well as execution of Haldia-Varanasi waterway, which is going to be extended up to Prayagraj via Mirzapur. We are also exploring the possibility of operating seaplanes in Mirzapur, he added. Gadkari dedicated four completed highway projects worth Rs 3,037 crore in Mirzapur after dedicating three national highway projects of Rs 1,538 crore in Jaunpur apart from dedicating and laying foundation of 348 projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bring-yogi-again-get-roads-like-europe-us-gadkari/articleshow/88399178.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji was hearing a public interest petition filed by a Medak-based social activist Rathod Subendar Singh, who challenged certain provisions of the Telangana State Private Universities Establishment and Regulations Act 2018. The Clause 33 of the Act along with certain portions of the state higher education department’s GO MS No. 26 issued on August 20, 2019, restricted the entry of local students to 25%, he said. Since these provisions were contrary to the Presidential Order, they should be declared unconstitutional and illegal, he said. State’s special counsel A Sanjeev Kumar said that the Presidential Order was applicable to only state-run educational institutions. It cannot be made applicable to a private university, he said. The bench directed the state government to file its counter and posted the case to April 13, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/clarify-local-quota-in-pvt-varsities-hc/articleshow/88399171.cms||---

In the last five years, the public perception about UP has improved drastically, he said. “We maintained financial discipline despite the corona pandemic and our revenue collection has increased in the current financial year. In 2020-21, the revenue collection was 39.9%, while it was 48.5% till November this year, which is 8.5% more than last year,” he said. There is a lot of discussion on inflation, but VAT on diesel and petrol in our state is much less than that in other states, including the Congress-ruled ones, he added. “The prices of petroleum are governed by rates in the international market, still our government made enough arrangements to not let it affect people,” Khanna said. The prices of petrol and diesel are much higher in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Andhra Pradesh, he added. “Our government cut down unwarranted expenses. There was a system under which Income Tax on the salary of ministers was paid by the state government. This arrangement was in place since 1981 but was never discussed or opposed in the cabinet or Vidhan Sabha. We were surprised on coming to know about it and ended it,” he said. “As many as 67 treasuries were closed and 50 allowances were done away with, and all this helped us in maintaining fiscal discipline, he added. The government also stressed on generating employment in the state and organised 3,470 job fairs in which 5.28 lakh jobs were provided in the last five years, the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/positive-changes-on-various-fronts-since-17-says-khanna/articleshow/88399839.cms||Neha Shukla

The same narrow vision of dynastic politics and nepotism forced the society and state towards backwardness,” said Yogi on Monday while addressing public meetings in Jaunpur and Mirzapur after Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari dedicated highway projects and laid foundation of projects worth over Rs 4,500 crore. Speaking about road infrastructure development, Yogi said, “Gadkariji has done more work on road and highway infrastructure development in just seven years than that done between 1947 and 2014. Due to the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gadkariji, Ganga became pollution-free before Prayagraj Kumbh.” Today, bulldozers are being used for road construction and to crush the empire of criminals and mafia elements, he said, adding that BJP believes in providing solutions to problems of people and provided government jobs to 4.50 lakh youths with full transparency in the state whereas the dynastic rulers in the past used such opportunities to mint money. “They promoted enmity among youths in the name of caste. In BJP rule, people are getting free double doses of vaccine to combat Covid-19 and the poor are also getting ration,” Yogi said. Appealing to people to get both doses of Covid-19 vaccine in view of the threat of Omicron variant, Yogi taunted opposition leaders for mocking the vaccine by terming it as Modi and BJP vaccines. Highlighting the big boost to health infrastructure in UP, Yogi said admissions in the new medical colleges will start in the new academic session. These good roads will help people reach Mirzapur smoothly to offer prayers at Vindhyachal temple as Vindhya corridor project is also getting completed on the lines of Kashi Vishwanath Dham, the CM said while telling people of Mirzapur to be ready for a major boost in influx of pilgrims. Referring to PM Modi’s honouring labourers at KV Dham during its inauguration and washing feet of sanitary workers during Kumbh, he said no one had ever imagined that labourers and workers will be honoured in this way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/dynastic-politics-nepotism-inprevious-regimes-hit-devpt-cm/articleshow/88399181.cms||---

Of the 1,200MT garbage the city generates every day, the agencies are dumping over 70% mixed garbage at Bhandewadi.On December 19, of the 180 trips of compactors, as many 112 dumped mixed garbage at the yard. About 737.64 MT mixed garbage was dumped at Bhandewadi, while 364.62MT wet and 74.09MT dry waste was transported there.The data revealed that the situation has not improved since December 15. On the very first day, both the agencies had transported 799.45MT mixed waste and collected only 381.730MT wet and 56.43MT dry segregated garbage from across the city.Sources pointed out that both the agencies are lifting mixed garbage just to ensure they continue getting tipping charges from the NMC. If mixed garbage is not lifted, the quantum of waste dumped in Bhandewadi will be far less. So, they are ignoring the diktat of municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, the sources alleged. NMC is paying Rs1,950 per MT to AG Environment and Rs1,800 per MT to BVG India. Both the agencies are getting over Rs500 more per MT for garbage collection from NMC as compared to earlier contractor Kanak Resources Management Limited.There is a provision in the agreement that NMC can impose a fine of Rs100 per vehicle from day one for collecting and transporting mixed waste. Both firms had pressed around 472 vehicles into action, including 300 vehicles for door-to-door garbage collection and transportation.SWM’s nodal officer Dr Gajendra Mahalle clarified that penalties will be imposed on both the agencies for dumping mixed garbage.Activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said: “It will take time to achieve 100% segregation of waste. NMC failed in the past due to non-cooperation from citizens but this time it must remain firm.”According to Chatterjee, citizens too should be penalized in case they are not segregating waste. “As per Municipal Solid Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, segregation of waste is the duty of waste generators,” he said.Meanwhile, corporator Rupali Thakur and BJP leader Parshu Thakur on Monday started distributing twin bins (for both wet and dry) to around 5,000 residents in Prabhag 34. The bins will be distributed from December 20 to 25 to mark the death and birth anniversaries of Sant Gadgebaba and former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Weddings and tourists rush have brought back the similes that the Covid pandemic had wiped out. But the industry is not out of woods as Omicron has again made the industry jittery. UB Srivastava, president of United Hoteliers of Udaipur, said, “The past two months have been good for the industry that suffered the most during the pandemic. Currently, the occupancy in Udaipur market has risen to over 60% and will go up to 80% by the end of the month.” But Srivastava said the industry is keeping its fingers crossed given the emergence of Omicron. “If there are no surprises from Covid front, the industry should be on its way to normalcy. Rates in city hotels are yet to reach pre-Covid levels. There are fixed costs like electricity, and manpower. The current trend needs to continue for the industry come out of the pandemic woes.” In Jaipur too, the city hotels are unable to raise the rates to the extent Resorts on the city outskirts have done. While week-ends are going full, the weekday occupancy still a concern. Kuldeep Singh Chandela, president of Hotels and Restaurants Association of Rajasthan, said, “Weekday occupancies in city hotels are about 50-60%. This will go up significantly as we enter the last of the month. But the rates are still below the pre-Covid levels unlike resorts. Tariffs in some resorts have gone past the pre-Covid levels by 10-15%.” Tourism industry in Jaisalmer is almost back to normal. Besides ther hotels, the tents in Sam dunes and Khuri are receiving good number of tourists. Vikram Singh Bhati, a hotelier who runs tents as well and the chairman of INTACH-Jaisalmer, said, “The occupancy in hotels and rents have increased significantly, near the pre-Covid levels. Similarly, the rates have improved proportionately.” Jaisalmer tourism industry was one of the hard-hit markets during the pandemic. After the lockdown was lifted, tourists drive in to border destinations like Mount Abu, Udaipur, Jaipur, Pushkar and Alwar received week-end tourists after, but Jaisalmer did not benefit because of the distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/year-end-tourism-on-the-rise-despite-omicron-scare/articleshow/88399187.cms||---

The number of beds in the rural areas has now gone up from 1,300 to about 3,000 now. The number of beds with oxygen support too has increased from 200 to more than 1,000. “We have increased number of general beds across all rural hospitals (RHs) and sub-district hospitals (SDHs), and have also provided oxygen support to more beds,” civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said. The number of general beds has also increased at the civil hospital and the SMBT Medical College in Igatpuri. “While these will be dedicated Covid hospitals to treat serious patients and even have ICU beds, the dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC) will treat asymptomatic patients who may have comorbidities. The provision of oxygen supply is also being made for the DCHCs so that patients need not occupy DCH beds,” another senior officer said. During the second wave of the pandemic, patients from the rural areas had to look for beds in the DCHs in the urban areas (Nashik and Malegaon). Many could not find beds. “To ensure there is adequate medical oxygen available in the rural areas if and when the infection surges, the health department has made the arrangements of about 1,000 beds. There are about 280 ICU beds spread across five SDHs,” the officer said. The oxygen beds are being provided with 29 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants installed across the SDHs and RHs. Moreover, the ZP health department has said that Covid care centres would be set up at the village-level and if the number of cases rise, local schools would be converted into CCCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-health-dept-increases-number-of-o-beds-in-rural-areas/articleshow/88397726.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Houses are decorated with lights, stars and cribs as families come together to celebrate the festival. “This year, most Catholic churches are holding midnight mass by following all Covid-19 precautions.

Close to 10,000 people are expected to join the feast for which the city traffic police has also planned traffic diversions to avoid congestion on roads leading to LB Stadium. With temperatures dropping, some people are donating blankets and warm clothes during the festive season. Ahead of Christmas, Sainikpuri residents have launched a charity jumble sale wherein they are seeking donations of household items such as clothes, footwear, electronics, toys books, decor items etc. from people. “During festival time, people generally declutter their houses. Our idea is to collect all these items, sell them for meagre prices and donate the money collected from it to the needy,” said Deepa Shailendra, one of the organisers.

With more companies aiming to introduce the NextGen vehicles, in 2 years cost of EVs will be equivalent to vehicles that run on fossil fuels, said Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Sunday. “Not just passenger vehicles, but the government wants to see even trucks to run on the technology of the future,” said Gadkari, adding use biofuel can also be helpful to operate construction equipment to achieve the goal of zero pollution in India. Already, some manufacturers have started working on advanced batteries which will help run EVs for longer distances, he said. On flex engines, which he was promoting in a big way, Gadkari said his ministry would soon issue an advisory for the automobile manufacturers to use it in two, three and four-wheelers. “It will not be made mandatory, as many companies like Toyota and Hyundai have already launched those engines. Even two-wheeler makers like Bajaj and TVS would be launching these engines,” he said. On shortage of bio-LNG and bio-CNG, the senior BJP leader said everything depends on demand and supply. When CNG was introduced in Delhi, there was shortage initially, but now many outlets have opened there. In Mumbai, when CNG taxis started plying, there were a lot of problems initially and people had to wait in queues the whole night to refill. However, the things have changed now,” he said. “Our government has already granted policy clearance for starting ethanol pumps. These are now available in many parts of the country. There is 136% increase in ethanol pumps in India,” said Gadkari. The minister said he aims to build all roads at par with standards of the United States. “When I took over the MORTH’s mantle, about 96,000km length of roads existed. “Now, we have laid 1.47 lakh km roads and target is to cross 2 lakh km in next two years. We want to have good roads connecting Kashmir to Kanyakumari. We are also working on many tunnels in states like Jammu and Kashmir with a view to reduce distances and provide all-weather roads in hilly areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/evs-to-cost-same-as-petrol-vehicles-in-2-years-gadkari/articleshow/88398541.cms||---

Following a tip-off, members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation rushed to the spot along with Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) zonal officer (Dharampeth) Deendayal Tembekar and his team.On enquiry, it was found that 60-year-old resident Achyut Shankar Shaniware had ordered felling of the trees as the “premises of his house were getting littered with the falling of leaves. As per given information, Shaniware hired a gang of illegal tree fellers who agreed to cut all three trees against Rs1,000 and take away the timber. “With lot of efforts and arguments, we stopped the tree cutting. One mango tree was saved from being cut but the other one had already been brutally chopped except the stem. The stem too was axed badly. All branches of crape Jasmine tree were also cut,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of Green Vigil. The NGO also informed about the incident to NMC’s garden department, officials of which carried out a spot inspection followed by a panchnama. According to officials, a show cause notice will be served to Shaniware. The Dharampeth zone officials have already seized ropes and two axes.TOI had recently reported that the garden department has authorized zonal officials to take action against illegal tree felling and give permission for felling only those trees which pose threat. “Trees inside residential premises too are the property of the NMC. No citizen can cut them without taking official permission,” said officials.The NMC has warned citizens to be aware of gangs of illegal tree fellers who are roaming in different areas. “No citizen can cut such huge trees by themselves, hence, they take help of illegal tree felling. Citizens should refrain from cutting trees for such petty reasons,” added Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/40-year-old-mango-tree-axed-as-its-leaves-were-littering/articleshow/88398556.cms||Manka Behl

With assembly session going on, the Muslim Arashkan Sangharsh Samiti (MASS) and Bhartiya Muslim Parishad (BMP) have decided to stage statewide agitation to press the demand of reservation on Friday.“We have started roping in support of many organizations from across the state to raise our demand of reservation for backward class Muslims. The agitation will be simultaneously staged at all the district headquarters and taluka headquarters on Friday to highlight the demand,” said Farhat Baig, president of MASS. He said that the demand of reservation for backward class Muslims is based on the reports of the Mahammadurrahman committee and of Justice Sachchar. The Maharashtra government had provided 5% reservation in backward jobs and education in the state under Ordinance dated July 9, 2014. The Mumbai High Court granted stay on the job reservation, but had allowed to continue the reservation in education. The previous BJP government did not introduce the ordinance in both the houses. The ordinance became absolved depriving the reservation to Muslims. “The ruling Congress and NCP had promised to provide reservation to backward Muslims if they come to power. Even CM Uddhav Thackeray had assured to consider the demand during the protest march taken during the last winter session. Now that Congress and NCP are in power, it is obligatory for them to deliver reservation to backward Muslims provided during their previous regime,” said Javed Pasha, president of BMP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/muslim-organizations-rekindle-reservation-agitation/articleshow/88398560.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Nagpur||NMC brings OTP system to prevent payment scams||Nagpur: To prevent more irregularities like the bogus contracts scam, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has introduced the system of one time password (OTP) for generation of bills and approval by head of departments online on the payment module developed under e-governance. Show cause notice has been issued to executive engineer Naresh Borkar and junior engineer Sanjay Ingale in the scam case.The civic body has already implemented OTP system in property tax department after the revenue scam that came to light a couple of years ago. For best reasons known to NMC officials, the system was not applied for payment module. In alleged connivance with contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode, two clerks — Mohan Padwanshi and Sanis Gokhe — had allegedly generated and approved bills using user ID and passwords of their head of departments. The accounts and finance department would not have approved bogus contracts of Sakode had these two clerks not generated and approved bills online.In the revenue scam, computer operators on contractual basis had reduced property tax amount of many taxpayers using user ID and passwords of their head of the departments.NMC official told TOI, “An OTP is sent to contact number of head of department after putting the username. Password can be put only after keying in the OTP. Then, the head of department can use his powers online. The same system has been started in payment module now taking cognizance of bogus contracts sScam. OTP will come on mobile of head of departments before putting password. No one will be able to misuse it,” he said.After the scam was unearthed, many head of departments have shared their user ID and passwords with subordinates. Their online work is being done by subordinates.Assistant commissioner of general administration department Mahesh Dhamecha is facing show cause notice and departmental enquiry (DE) as he shared user ID and password with Padwanshi.Similarly, Borkar and Ingale were served show cause notice on Monday for sharing user ID and password with Gokhe.Irregularities may happen in the new system only if head of departments share even the OTP with the subordinates.An NMC official said that plan is to also implement OTP system to give provisions of funds for preparing file of any work. “Provision is made at the initial stage.

Speaking at the 72nd annual general body meeting of the District Cooperative Bank at its headquarters in Etawah on Monday, he said, “Who will contest from where will become clear soon,”. Shivpal said PSPL has entered into alliance with the SP on the voice of the people of the state, and that the Samajwadis are not afraid of phone tapping, ED and income tax raids, or any other kind of harassment. “There is a tremendous threat to democracy from the BJP government due to its dictatorial attitude. Institutions are not able to function in a fair manner. Every class of people is unhappy. That’s why it is necessary to remove the BJP government from power,” he further said. Later, talking to media persons, Shivpal said a strategy will be prepared after sitting with the national president of SP Akhilesh Yadav for ticket distribution, election symbol and fielding of candidates. “The way PM Modi is making rounds of UP, it has become clear the BJP is losing badly”, he said. He has to reach each and every Assembly of the state with SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, he added. The Prime Minister announced demonetisation of currency without the advice of the cabinet and the approval of the President. “Only three Gujaratis and bank officials benefited from it. The step was taken only to weaken the cooperative of the state and the work of exchanging notes in cooperative banks was stopped”, Shivpal alleged and added demonetisation ruined the economy and took away people’s jobs. Farmers too are in distress under the BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/seat-distribution-with-sp-will-be-decided-after-announcement-of-polls-shivpal-yadav/articleshow/88399221.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

All the four Omicron cases in Ajitgarh of Sikar have tested negative for Covid and all have recovered,” said Dr Ajay Chaudhary, chief medical health officer (Sikar). Since the genome sequencing report comes after five days of collecting the sample, the girl had already recovered when her report came on Monday. However, health department officials said they have asked the family to remain isolated for at least seven more days, even though they have recovered. Officials said all the four cases of Omicron did not have any complications as they had mild symptoms. Besides, a person (suspected case of Omicron variant) who arrived from the UK a week ago where cases of Omicron are being reported in increased numbers was tested positive for Covid on Sunday. “We have shifted him to RUHS Hospital today. He was reluctant to get admitted. Since we have to follow the Centre’s guidelines on international travellers, we told him to get admitted otherwise action will be taken against him,” said Dr Hansraj Bhadaliya, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-II). He said the UK-returnee is asymptomatic and he was found infected with Covid during mandatory sampling of international travelers of high-risk countries. Four persons from a family in Mansarovar tested positive for Covid here on Monday. They were found infected during contact tracing of a woman, a member of the same family who was found infected with Covid two days ago. “The woman along with three other members of the family had gone to Vaishno Devi pilgrimage.When they returned, the woman in the family tested positive. Three other members who had gone along with her also tested positive in contact tracing. Another member who had did not accompany them also tested positive.

About 10% said they had switched to buses from personal vehicles during the pandemic, with the lockdown hitting household income and expenditure. The study, titled ‘Bustling Through the City’, was done in collaboration with Reclaiming The Bus campaign, Delhi Bus Yatri Union and Sustainable Urban Mobility Network India and covered 505 people. The survey said 80% of respondents welcomed free services for women. Around 40% said services should be made free for all and can be made more convenient with facilities like toilets at bus stops. Nearly 71% said their average daily travel time is less than 30 minutes. The study said Delhi currently has 25 buses per lakh people, which is less than half of what is required for a population of above 20 million. “More buses should be procured on a priority basis and commitment must be made to achieve a target of adding at least 1,000 buses per year,” reccomends the study. “This report supports our demand for more and safely accessible buses connecting all areas in Delhi. The government should focus more on bus users while planning as about 70-80% of people in Delhi do not own private vehicles and use shared transport,” said Nishant from Delhi Bus Yatri Union. Avinash Chanchal, senior climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace India, said, “The authorities must understand that public transport, especially buses, can help cities to be more productive, resilient, safer, cleaner and socially inclusive.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/income-down-due-to-covid-10-shifted-to-buses-study/articleshow/88399247.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat pips all states in exports, clocks 118% rise||RAJKOT: Exports from Gujarat have touched a record high, crossing the Rs 5 lakh crore mark for the first time ever. Importantly, the feat has been achieved in the first half of 2021-22. Experts believe that the annual exports from the state were likely to cross Rs nine lakh crore this fiscal. Gujarat had been exporting goods worth about Rs 4.50 lakh crore annually. However, in the current financial year, the exports have touched Rs 5.16 lakh crore in the first six months (April to October), which is a 118% jump compared to the same period last year. A senior official of the commerce ministry said the main reason for the higher export figures of Gujarat was due to the GST regime. “The major reason for the higher exports is the GST regime. Goods manufactured in Gujarat and exported from Mumbai were earlier counted as export of Maharashtra. But now, after the successful implementation of GST, the state of origin is now correctly recorded,” he said. According to the figures released by the Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, working under the commerce ministry, Gujarat pipped Maharashtra in 2020-21 itself. The business community however says that it is not only the recording of the correct state of origin, but exports itself has increased. Parth Ganatra, vice president of Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industries (RCCI) said, “I used to export only 8-10 submersible pumps per year to Saudi Arabia as they used to get it cheaper from China. But now, I have an order of 2,000 pumps pending. Other countries are shifting towards India, Turkey and Taiwan. It is in the case of many commodities,” said Ganatra. ASSOCHAM Gujarat chairman Chintan Thaker said, “Countries are looking for alternatives to China and India is at an advantage. Loss to China is Gujarat's gain. I believe that the exports will only improve in the next six months of the financial year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gujarat-pips-all-states-in-exports-clocks-118-rise/articleshow/88397784.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

While two of them died on the spot, the third man is battling for life at the district hospital. The carcasses of two bulls were also found near the fence. Police have registered an FIR under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the farm owner, Bhola Ram, and further investigations are on. Bhola Ram had electrified the fence to protect his wheat crop from stray cattle but apparently, did not have the permission to do so from the authorities concerned. The two dead men were identified as Ankit Kumar (25) and Arvind Kumar (23) while 26-year-old Shobhit Kumar is in hospital. All of them hail from Lakhuya village under Powayan police station. Police said Ankit along with his neighbours, Arvind and Shobhit, had gone out at dawn. Out in the fields, Arvind accidentally touched the fence and suffered an electric shock. He screamed for help. Seeing him withering in pain, Ankit and Shobhit rushed to his aid and tried to save their friend. They too received electric shocks. By the time locals reached the spot, Arvind and Ankit were dead while Shobhit was unconscious. The carcasses of the two bulls were also found lying near the fence. Apparently, they had been electrocuted. BS Vir Kumar, circle officer, Powayan, said, “We carried out an inspection and found that electric fencing was erected around the crop field. As per law, electrification of fences by individuals or organizations without permission is not allowed. Even in cases of permission, there is a limit to the level of current that can be passed through the wires. We have booked the farm owner under the relevant sections of the IPC and for cruelty against animals. The bodies of the two men were handed to their families after autopsy. The condition of the survivor, admitted at the district hospital, is stable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/illegal-electric-fence-results-in-2-deaths-one-hurt/articleshow/88397780.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Poll-like measures to scale up vaccination in 5 districts||PUNE: Intensified vaccination drive with poll-like preparations would be conducted on all seven days of the week till December 31 in the five districts registering the lowest first dose vaccination percentage so far. Hingoli, Gadchiroli, Beed, Nanded and Nandurbar are the five districts with the lowest first dose vaccination in the range of 69-74%. The average first and second dose coverage of the state till December 19 was 86.19% and 53.56%, respectively. According to the plan of the collectors of the five districts lagging on the vaccination front, as many as 800 teams would go door-to-door to reach the beneficiaries. The names of those not staying in the district have been deleted to ensure that all beneficiaries are covered with the first dose. The Hingoli district administration has introduced “no vaccine, no fuel, no ration” rule. The others are trying to intensify the drive by constituting teams like those formed during elections. A senior official from the Hingoli district administration said, “Stringent measures are in place, wherein people are not allowed to enter banks if they are not vaccinated or even not given fuel or ration. The next step is listing those not yet vaccinated, as done during a poll process. We have little over 74% coverage and we want to ensure that the remaining 25% is covered this week. Teams are being sent to every block like elections.” Gadchiroli collector Sanjay Meena told TOI that they were planning to conduct special door-to-door vaccination this week. Over 200 teams will conduct around 1,152 sessions, covering 614 villages and 1.7 lakh population in seven talukas having around 60% first dose coverage. “We have sought additional doses to scale up our drive this week,” said Meena, adding that the reasons for the slow coverage were difficult terrain, geography and the reluctance of villagers. Beed, Nanded and Nandurbar districts’ officials said they would ensure that the vaccination was scaled up. Nanded collector Dr Vipin said vaccine hesitancy and migration had been big hurdles in vaccination. “Over 1,200 teams are there in the villages to ensure everyone get their first dose. Nearly 25,000 -27,000 vaccinations are being carried out daily to touch the state’s first dose average by the end of this month,” he told TOI. Nandurbar collector Manisha Khatri said they had scaled up vaccination and established checkposts to examine every vehicle going to hilly terrain and ensure that everyone is vaccinated. People are also being inoculated on agricultural fields, sugar factories and even marriage functions in Nandurbar. State immunisation officer Dr S Desai said these five districts had scaled up inoculation of late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/poll-like-measures-to-scale-up-vaccination-in-5-districts/articleshow/88399248.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The ED is also investigating Touchwood Real Estate Pvt Ltd, a company linked to the accused, in which Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik’s son Faraz Malik reportedly holds 25% stake. It is alleged that Associate High Pressure Technologies had diverted a part of the cheated money into Touchwood Real Estate. Among the searched premises included Darvesh and Agicha’s homes at Bandra (W). The factory of Associate High Pressure Technologies is situated at Kandla SEZ in Gujarat. Several teams of ED officials flew in from Delhi on Sunday and commenced the raid early Monday in Mumbai. Nawab Malik had recently made several allegations against NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, accusing him of violating service rules and making a false case of drug seizure from a cruise ship. Malik is at loggerheads with the Centre and has accused it of using government agencies to target political opponents. On Sunday night, Malik through a tweet hinted ED may raid his premises. ED has not searched his or his son Faraz’s premises in the case but it is investigating Touchwood Real Estate linked to Faraz. A person close to Faraz Malik said, “Faraz had no connection with the transaction between the two companies. He or his family is not a beneficiary. He just holds a 20 % stake on a 700 m plot in Kurla that is on the company’s name. The money came into the company in the knowledge of one of its office-bearers who had signature authority. He diverted Rs 14 crore into his personal account fraudulently and a related case was registered against him with EOW, police. Police had arrested him in the case and he was in jail for 3 months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-searches-co-premises-probing-firm-of-netas-son/articleshow/88399252.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||81% of Omicron patients in Maha were fully vaxxed||Mumbai: Eighty-one percent of the 54 patients detected with the Omicron variant in Maharashtra are cases of breakthrough infections, meaning they got infected despite being fully vaccinated. A few have even taken a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine. According to experts, this is in sync with growing evidence that the variant can escape immune response and that most vaccines may be unable to stop transmission of Omicron, even if they are efficient in controlling serious disease. Of the 54 patients in the state detected with the new variant, 44 have taken two doses. The ten unvaccinated include two adults and eight minors. One of them who’s from Nagpur had suffered from Covid in April and is the only case of reinfection so far. Virologist Dr Shahid Jameel told TOI that breakthrough infections from Omicron are common among the vaccinated. The virus has more than 50 mutations of which 30 are in the spike protein that binds to ACE2, a protein on the surface of the human cell, and that could be adding to its transmissibility. Immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from Pune's Indian Institute of Science Education and Research explained that most available vaccines, including Covaxin and Covishield, are not transmission-blocking. “They are given as intramuscular injections. Their effect on the site of entry of the virus, which is the nose and throat, exists but it's not strong enough to locally destroy the virus,” she said. So, even if a person has antibodies, there will be some virus that will get transmitted. “It may even gain a foothold and start dividing in the body, but by that time the rest of the immune system will come into action and prevent further spread and seriousness,” she said, underlining the importance of immunisation. Experts say the jury is still out on whether vaccination protects against a severe attack or if Omicron itself has only a mild effect. Health officials said almost 50% of infected individuals didn't have any symptoms, while the symptomatic ones had symptoms such as cough, fever, and itchy throat. Not a single patient, either from vaccinated or unvaccinated groups, saw progression of symptoms. Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer, said the role of vaccination cannot be ruled out completely. Based on preliminary information from South Africa, Dr Bal said the variant seemed to have high transmission, but low disease-causing potential compared with Delta and the original Wuhan strain. The world is looking at the UK now, which is witnessing an Omicron surge, to provide more information. "What’s crucial now is to use N95 masks that are most effective in preventing transmissions," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/81-of-omicron-patients-in-maha-were-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88399270.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The letter written on December 18 reached Raj Bhawan ahead of the scheduled meeting. The governor took to Twitter expressed his “displeasure” but rescheduled the meeting “to ensure that education environ looks up” again on December 23. Unlike the state-run universities where the governor is the chancellor, he is a “visitor” in private universities. The December 18 letter signed by 11 chancellors, and vice-chancellors, said, “Although we confirmed our presence in the meeting, given the recent danger posed by the new wave of Omicron, and the fact many of us are senior citizens and suffer from comorbidities,” the top academics urged the Governor to defer the meeting till the situation normalises. The Governor responded, “Such a stance, after having confirmed participation in the said meeting, on the day of the meeting, indicates unionism and is totally unconvincing.” The governor linked this to “authoritarianism in government.” The issue brings to fore the Raj Bhawan’s stand-off with the vice-chancellors of state-run universities who skipped a similar meeting invite citing rules. According to these rules, all communication from the Raj Bhawan must be routed to the universities through the state higher education department. Raj Bhawan had in that case chosen to write to the VCs directly. “Private universities are governed by different statues, unlike the state universities. But it is the higher education department which can issue directions to private universities,” said an official requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poulami-guv-pvt-chancellors-tiff/articleshow/88398609.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Srinagar Medical College professor caught stealing students’ mobile phones||DEHRADUN: In a curious case of theft, a professor at Srinagar Medical College in Pauri Garhwal was found with almost a dozen stolen mobile phones, which he had allegedly swiped from his own students or acquaintances. The stolen phones were found at his residence, inside the medical college campus, where he stays alone. The theft came to light after the professor, who hails from Bihar and has been working in the college since 2010, was caught on CCTV while stealing the mobile phone of an MBBS student, who was writing his exam. When the student complained that his mobile phone, which was kept outside the examination hall, had been stolen, the head of the department requested authorities to scan the CCTV footage. Upon inspection, it was revealed that the professor, who is from the anatomy department, had swiped the device and walked away with it. “A team searched the professor’s room and found to their surprise almost a dozen other stolen mobile phones in his possession,” said Dr CMS Rawat, principal, Srinagar Medical College. Later, a five-member internal committee was formed to probe the matter. The initial surmise by college authorities is that the professor is a kleptomaniac who has a habit of stealing things although they are also exploring whether he was involved in illicit activities using the stolen phones. Meanwhile, the accused professor has denied stealing the phones. “The professor has denied any wrongdoing but it is also a fact that he has been found with the phones in his possession. Besides, it is suspicious that he formatted the phones after taking them,” said Rawat, adding that police will be involved after their internal probe report comes in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/med-college-prof-caught-stealing-students-mobile-phones/articleshow/88397132.cms||Shivani Azad

They claimed that the post of chief information commissioner and four posts of information commissioners have been lying vacant since October. “The government should fill these posts as no public hearing would take place in the commission until a commissioner is appointed. Also, with the Code of Conduct set to be implemented in the state next month, it seems that the government is intentionally delaying the appointment. The vacancies are diluting a fundamental right -- the right to information -- of citizens,” said Amar Singh Dhunta, general secretary of the state RTI Club. Meanwhile, BP Maithani, president of the state RTI Club, “A lack of senior officers in the commission has derailed the addressing of the complaints who have filed the RTIs.

---||Dehradun||Stretch to Thamri Kund lake, a nature lover's delight, reconstructed for tourists in Munsyari||Pithoragarh: The research wing of the state forest department has reconstructed a four-kilometre track leading from Betuli Dhar to Thamri Kund, a freshwater lake in Munsyari. According to the district administration, the lake has immense tourism potential due to its scenic beauty. Also, the herds of musk deer, barking deer, hog deer and the flock of monal birds that come to the lake for water draw several wildlife enthusiasts. Officials said that footfall to the lake would increase due to the reconstruction of the road from Betuli Dhar, which is located six kilometres away from Munsyari. The 150m long, 70m wide Thamri Kund is situated 9,100 feet above the sea level. Tourists can reach here after covering 7 km by vehicle to Betuli Dhar from Munsyari and then 3.5 km on foot, according to Sanjeev Chaturvedi, a conservator at the research wing of the forest department. The entire track is covered with oak, pine, Rhododendron (buransh) and alpine trees, and the lake has a water hole for wild animals. "The route from Betuli Dhar to Thamri Kund is in poor condition and tourists face difficulties. Hence, the research wing is reconstructing it at a cost of Rs 5 lakh. Benches have been installed along the trek route and people can enjoy the beauty of the Himalayas. Bio-toilet facilities have also been set up," Chaturvedi added. "Munsyari is a popular tourist destination and thousands of people visit the place every year. But, there are only a few places for sightseeing. So, the forest department has decided to develop it," Devendra Singh, a hotelier in Munsyari said, adding that tourists can come here now even for a day's sightseeing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/stretch-to-thamri-kund-lake-a-nature-lovers-delight-reconstructed-for-tourists-in-munsyari/articleshow/88397164.cms||Prem Punetha

Most of these are heinous crimes and some petty crimes. However, even during the winter break, members will be available for any emergency case as some JJB members work on a rotational basis during breaks,” said JJB member and board psychologist Pooja Sharma. The JJB handles cases pertaining to child conflict while the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) takes care of children who have been victims of crimes and need care or protection, Sharma said. The JJB of any district usually decides on the trial path for child offenders in the age group 16-18. The focus is mostly on the rehabilitation of detainees and the cases need to be resolved within four months. Among the JJB members, it is mandatory to have a magistrate, a psychologist and a sociologist.

A circus was last held in 2013. Thereafter, permission at the venue was withdrawn due to the construction of Maa flyover that led to diversion of traffic. “We have not ruled out either Park Circus (Ajanta Circus) or Patuli (Kohinoor Circus) as a venue. But allowing a circus is a problem as there will be a spurt in demand for car parks that cannot be arranged at two places,” said a police officer. The police had earlier objected to the proposed start time that circus management had agreed to amend and hold the first show at 3pm on weekdays and 1pm on weekends and holidays. Jainul Haque, partner of Ajanta Circus and Kohinoor Circus, said they were willing to publicize that there would be no car parking available at the venues. “We are the only circus company in Bengal and are willing to abide by all norms, including 70% capacity for Covid. We have around 250 people on our payroll and have paid visa charges for gymnasts and trapeze artists from Belarus, Mexico and Ethiopia. In 2019, too, the permission was held back,” said Haque. KMC member mayor-in-council parks and squares Debasish Kumar has written to KP joint commissioner. “Tender for holding circuses has already been called by KMC and processed but requires a no-objection from KP from traffic point of view only. I sincerely request your intervention so that NOPC is given to KMC at the earliest,” Kumar wrote. Ajanta Circus has offered Rs 27-28 lakh to KMC as rent for using the Maidan for 75 days. “We had initially applied from first week of December to first week of February. But given that cops were busy with civic elections, we are seeking fresh dates in January. Even a three-week window to hold circus at Park Circus will help,” said Haque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-hurdle-for-circus-return-to-park-circus-this-winter/articleshow/88398647.cms||Saikat Ray

AAP workers were registering their protest over the recent head clerk recruitment examination paper leak. The police detained a number of political activists, including state AAP president Gopal Italia and leader Isudan Gadhvi, whom BJP workers alleged was in an inebriated condition. AAP workers were registering their protest over the recent head clerk recruitment examination paper leak, they forcibly entered Kamalam; About 20 AAP workers were detainedAbout 20 AAP workers, including leaders, were detained as the police filed an FIR against Gadhvi, Italia, Shiv Kumar, Pravin Ram, Nikhil Savani, Hasmukh Patel and about 500 others, booking them under 18 sections of the IPC which include criminal trespass, molestation, unlawful assembly, causing hurt, conspiracy and destroying public property among others. The protest turned ugly when AAP workers took the fight against state government and broke into BJP headquarters after they found the secretariat doors closed. “AAP workers forcibly entered ‘Kamalam’ after breaking the main gate, which led to an altercation between BJP and AAP members. Some persons got injured in that altercation. We then rushed to the spot and detained over 20 AAP workers, including women. No one was injured in our lathi charge,” said M K Rana, deputy superintendent of police, Gandhinagar. Gadhvi was taken to the Gandhinagar civil hospital for a medical check-up after some women workers of the BJP alleged that he misbehaved with them in an inebriated state. “Some AAP workers and leaders came drunk and misbehaved with us. They hit us on our back using sticks. Though we were polite with them, AAP workers created a ruckus and uttered derogatory words for our leaders,” alleged BJP leader Shraddha Jha. Gadhvi said, “BJP has cheated lakhs of youth of Gujarat. We decided to protest and demand justice for Gujarat's youth. We had planned to protest at the secretariat but the doors were closed, so we decided to have a peaceful protest at BJP headquarters. We were attacked by their workers and bouncers and the police have also beaten us. To distract from the issue of injustice to youth, BJP women workers have made allegations of us having consumed liquor. We have cooperated with police, and have got ourselves tested. All tests have come negative.''  The suddenness of the AAP swoop on Kamalam caught most BJP workers and leaders unaware, as AAP leaders not only barged into the state BJP headquarters, but squatted on the stairs and raised slogans demanding ouster of Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB) chairman Asit Vora in the paper leak case. Woman BJP members allege molestation Ahmedabad: Gandhinagar police officers said that BJP workers alleged that AAP workers, headed by Shivkumar, Pravin Ram, Ishudan Gadhvi, Gopal Italia, Nikhil Savani and Hasmukh Patel, not only broke into the gates and attacked the male members but also molested, snatched dupattas and gouged women workers of the ruling party. “A mob of AAP workers pushed us (BJP women workers) and attacked us. Some of the women attacked us with sticks of their banners and then some of the male members of the AAP manhandled us and molested us,” said a woman worker of the BJP in her FIR with Infocity police. She said that many male members of the AAP gouged them, and they wanted to click selfies with the injured BJP women workers, said the party worker in the FIR. She said that the accused were controlled by the police and the women workers of the BJP were rescued. ‘IB fails to pre-empt move’ The violence at Kamalam during a protest by the AAP workers showcased the failure of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), said BJP sources. “The AAP workers planned the protest and they called their party workers from various parts of the state. They stealthily brought the workers so that no one could see them gathering. This was a planned attack but the state IB could not sense it which led to a violence at the BJP office,” said a BJP leader. The Infocity police also mentioned in its FIR that the alleged attack by the AAP workers was a pre-planned criminal conspiracy against the ruling BJP workers. It all started at sachivalaya Apprehending trouble from AAP workers at the secretariat, the BJP government increased vigil at the gates of the sachivalaya and AAP workers were prevented from entering the premises of the secretariat. However, AAP changed its plan and the workers decided to stage a protest at the state BJP headquarters instead. AAP workers had announced that they would protest at the sachivalaya, seeking the ouster of Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB) chairman Asit Vora in the paper leak case. AAP ‘barges’ into opposition space Even as the opposition Congress party was busy with office meetings, the AAP looked to consolidate itself in the opposition space by taking up the head clerk examination paper leak issue in a big way. The Congress later announced that it will organize a bike rally from the party headquarters to the collectorate on Wednesday. “A meeting of Congress MLAs has also been convened on Tuesday, after which a delegation will meet the CM on the paper leak issue. The CM ought to ask pardon for the fiasco,” said a party release quoting GPCC president Jagdish Thakor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aap-volunteers-clash-with-bjp-workers/articleshow/88399329.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Paper leak: Asit Vora under scanner||AHMEDABAD: A team of Gandhinagar and Sabarkantha police investigating the leaking of the head clerk examination paper of the Gujarat subordinate services selection board (GSSSB), have allegedly found criminal negligence on the part of the board chairman Asit Vora, who is a former mayor of Ahmedabad. A senior Gujarat police officer told TOI, “We have been investigating how the same press in Sanand was awarded the printing contract for question papers for the government exams by the GSSSB for the last three years.” The officer said the tender procedures were not properly followed by GSSSB chairman Asit Vora, and may point to criminal negligence on his part. “We have been investigating if any of the accused persons have been in nexus with the GSSSB chairman and as and when we get corroborative evidence, we will take legal action against him,” said a Gujarat police officer. Vora had in September this year got his second term as GSSSB chairman and this is not the first time that a question paper has been leaked under his regime. In 2019, the question paper for the non-secretariat clerk exam was also leaked, and at then too Vora was chairman of the board and the question paper was printed at the same press in Sanand, where the paper for the December 2021 exam was printed. The head clerk exam was held on December 12 for 186 posts, for which some 88,000 candidates applied. Leaders of the opposition parties, Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), have been constantly demanding a fair investigation in the case, Vora’s resignation and action against him. Even after answer sheets for the paper went viral on social media, Vora denied the leak for around a week. As the matter heated up, Sabarkantha police began to act and filed an FIR against 11 accused persons and nabbed eight of them. On Sunday, Gandhinagar police officers announced that they had arrested three main accused, including one Kishor Acharya, a supervisor at the Sanand press who allegedly leaked the paper to other accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/paper-leak-vora-under-scanner/articleshow/88399315.cms||---

Inspector general (Nagpur range) Chhering Dorje, appointed special officer of the court, submitted a report of his visit to the affected areas. Dorje said tribal areas were influenced by culture, customs and belief. He spoke of seasonal migration to urban areas in search of work for nearly six months. When tribals return to cultivate their land, they are usually weaker and their health compromised. Dorje said they are reluctant to access medical care at public health centres. “Institutional deliveries have increased but against medical advice women visit bhumkas. When the case becomes serious they go to hospitals,’’ he added. Dorje said there is a need for coordination by state departments. “Not just health but other State government agencies must work simultaneously. We have to know why they are not cooperating.’’ He said he visited primary health centres and sub-centres for interactions and households where children had died. He said tribal houses are “in a line’’ and poor ventilation causes disease. The judges said, “We can respect their traditions, culture but when it comes to healthcare, tribals have to join the mainstream.” Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said, “Somewhere the fault lies with us as we have not been able to instill confidence. The (tribal) lady feels scared of surgery. Government workers and doctors must inspire confidence.” “You (State) also explore what can be done…prepare a plan of action,” said the CJ. The judges recorded “appreciation for the endeavour of Dr Dorje to prepare a comprehensive report...” They directed the State to submit the short-term plan to be submitted on January 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cj-seeks-plan-for-tribal-areas-after-hearing-of-conditions/articleshow/88399483.cms||Rosy Sequeira

State government officials said many applicants have not given proper bank details, which has delayed disbursement. The Supreme Court recently asked states to commence with the disbursement at the earliest. “There were issues with forms not being filled correctly, and incomplete bank details. The district authorities are verifying and the amount would be disbursed soon,” said officials. Nearly 1.41 lakh deaths have been registered in the state. The state has allocated around Rs700cr towards disbursal. After a delay of nearly three months, the state government launched a website early this month for kin of covid victims to file applications. “The process is simple as the applicant has to apply with Aadhaar proof,” stated officials. Families without positive RT-PCR, RAT results and Covid death certificates would also receive ex-gratia if the deceased had died within 30 days of being clinically diagnosed with Covid-19. The government has also appointed committees in every district under the additional collector to take care of any grievance redressal. The affected families have to submit claims through a form issued by the state authorities along with specified documents, including those certifying the cause ofthe death. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ex-gratia-for-kin-of-25000-victims-this-week-officials/articleshow/88399324.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Covid positivity rate in Delhi touches over 5-month high of 0.2%||NEW DELHI: The national capital on Monday reported 91 new Covid-19 cases and zero deaths. The positivity rate increased to 0.2%, the highest in over five months, according to the data shared by the health department. The number of Covid cases in Delhi has now reached 14,42,288, out of which over 14.16 lakh patients have recovered the bulletin stated. The Covid death toll stands at 25,101, it said. Three deaths due to the viral disease have been recorded in December so far, seven in November, four in October and five in September. On Sunday, the city reported 107 cases, its highest daily rise since June 25, and one death with a positivity rate of 0.17%. On June 25, Delhi logged 115 cases and four deaths. The city reported 86 cases on Saturday and 69 on Friday with a positivity rate of 0.13% and 0.12%, respectively. A total of 46,193 Covid tests, including 43,971 RT-PCR tests, were conducted in the city the previous day, Monday’s bulletin stated. “There is a constant increase in the positivity rate, which is not a good sign. It is possible that the Omicron variant is more widespread and leading to a spike in cases than the numbers are suggesting,” said a senior doctor. The number of active cases in the city is 531 and that of containment zones has also gone up to 163, compared with 113 red zones on December 12. Of the total number of Covid-19 patients, 197 are being treated in various city hospitals and 243 patients are recuperating in home isolation. According to city hospitals, the rise in admissions due to Covid-19 is significant and most doctors blame it on the lack of Covid-appropriate behaviour among people. Health experts also have an apprehension that the Omicron variant, which is known to be highly transmissible, may cause further spurt in cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-positivity-rate-in-delhi-touches-over-5-month-high-of-0-2/articleshow/88399343.cms||---
---||Delhi||Another reopening: Thin attendance in private schools in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Several private city schools that reopened on Monday after a gap of more than two weeks saw a low turnout. While attendance for classes 9 to 12 was over 50%, barely any students in junior classes turned up despite consent from parents. Some heads of schools have cited the cold wave conditions and Omicron fears as possible reasons. Some schools that earlier planned to reopen from December 27 said they may do so only after the scheduled winter break now, at least for junior students. “We have not opened the school yet. It is cold and our winter break will be from December 25 to January 2. A decision on reopening the school will be taken only after that,” said Savita Mehta, VP (communications), Amity Education Group. Manav Sthali School, which will reopen from Tuesday for classes 6 to 11, said only 10% of the parents had consented so far to sending their children for classes. “Our winter break starts from December 30, so there’s no point in calling junior students, i.e. classes1 to 5, from December 27. For classes 9 to 12, we are planning online classes from January 3 to 7. They can go on a break till January 13,” an official at the school said. At MM Public School in Pitampura, the attendance in the senior section was around 60% and much lower for classes 6 to 8. “Considering the consent we received from parents, the number of students who finally came was much less. It may be due to the cold or the recent rise in Covid cases,” said principal Rooma Pathak. Mount Abu Public School in Rohini was among the few institutes where attendance was good. About 70% of the students turned up for classes, according to principal Jyoti Arora. Government schools, which had resumed classes on Saturday, reported better attendance on Monday. At School of Specialised Excellence, Kalkaji, over 80% of students were present. The turnout was similar at Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8. “The attendance in all the classes is good. Students are happy to be back and we hope that the school does not have to close now,” said principal A K Jha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/another-reopening-thin-attendance-in-pvt-schools/articleshow/88399346.cms||---
---||Mumbai||81% of Omicron patients in Maharashtra were fully vaccinated||MUMBAI: Eighty-one per cent of the 54 patients detected with the Omicron variant in Maharashtra are cases of breakthrough infections, meaning they got infected despite being fully vaccinated. A few have even taken a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine. According to experts, this is in sync with growing evidence that the variant can escape immune response and that most vaccines may be unable to stop transmission of Omicron, even if they are efficient in controlling serious disease. Of the 54 patients in the state detected with the new variant, 44 have taken two doses. The ten unvaccinated include two adults and eight minors. One of them who’s from Nagpur had suffered from Covid in April and is the only case of reinfection so far. Omicron variant: Follow live updatesVirologist Dr Shahid Jameel told TOI that breakthrough infections from Omicron are common among the vaccinated. The virus has more than 50 mutations of which 30 are in the spike protein that binds to ACE2, a protein on the surface of the human cell, and that could be adding to its transmissibility. Immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal from Pune's Indian Institute of Science Education and Research said that most available vaccines, including Covaxin and Covishield, are not transmission-blocking. “They are given as intramuscular injections. Their effect on the site of entry of the virus, which is the nose and throat, exists but it's not strong enough to locally destroy the virus,” she said. So, even if a person has antibodies, there will be some virus that will get transmitted. “It may even gain a foothold and start dividing in the body, but by that time the rest of the immune system will come into action and prevent further spread and seriousness,” she said, underlining the importance of immunisation. Experts say the jury is still out on whether vaccination protects against a severe attack or if Omicron itself has only a mild effect. Health officials said almost 50% of infected individuals didn't have any symptoms, while the symptomatic ones had symptoms such as cough, fever, and itchy throat. Not a single patient, either from vaccinated or unvaccinated groups, saw progression of symptoms. Dr Pradeep Awate, state’s surveillance officer, said the role of vaccination cannot be ruled out completely. Based on preliminary information from South Africa, Dr Bal said the variant seemed to have high transmission, but low disease-causing potential compared with Delta and the original Wuhan strain. The world is looking at the UK now, which is witnessing an Omicron surge, to provide more information. "What’s crucial now is to use N95 masks that are most effective in preventing transmissions," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-81-of-omicron-patients-in-maharashtra-were-fully-vaxxed/articleshow/88399333.cms||Sumitra Debroy

A fine example of such determination is seen in the dense man-made forest on a four-kilometre belt between a railway track and the old NH-8 — created with citizens’ unity and some help from the authorities that redesigned the barren landscape. The citizens’ council of Bharuch planted thousands of trees in the under utilized land belonging to the railway department and converted it into a jungle of hope and home for birds in future. Founder member and trustee of citizen council of Bharuch, Manoj Anandpura said, “In the current scenario of concrete development, we thought of creating some green space and members of the council contacted the district collector on July 15, 2019 with a proposal. With his support we met the social forestry department asking to allow us to plant trees on their land. We signed an MoU with the forest department and this is how the Reva Aranya, our little forest grew.” Anandpura further said that the council is also creating a green cover near Narmada riverbanks and that their green endeavour is also getting financial support from a few industries too. An organic farmer of Amleshwar village, Nitin Bhatt, who is also a part of this tree plantation project since inception said that he used his experience in organic farming to plant different species that will help attract different types of butterfly, honey bees, and birds to the forest. “I am entrusted with taking care of the plants, cleaning up the plantation site and also nurturing the saplings too. We choose 80% local species that can survive easily while the remaining 20% belong to species that can adapt to the soil her and grow,” Bhatt added. Mohamad Jagdiwal, 50, a businessman and avid nature lover said that the project aims for the next generation. “There are around 55 different bird species, many of which aren’t seen regularly. We have planted a variety of trees following traditional procedure and using natural compost only,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/citizens-unite-to-expand-bharuchs-green-lungs-on-4km-barren-land/articleshow/88397856.cms||Mehul Jani

Based on a complaint filed by the victim’s parents, the police arrested Sujish, 24, her classmate and resident of Palakkad in Kerala, who was staying in the same apartment building as the victim.

Son of sitting Congress president Subhash Chawla is not heading his father’s election campaign as he did before. Now, he is contesting as Congress candidate from ward 14, where the party has a lot at stake. It is Sumit’s father who is seeking votes for him this time. Besides Sumit, he is also campaigning for all Congress candidates in the 35 wards of the municipal corporation. On Monday, Sumit’s day started at 7am, with a hearty breakfast of Makki Ki Rotiand Sarson Ka Saag, with his father, wife and other family members. Talk on the breakfast table revolved around his election schedule for the day, during which his father made calls to some prominent ward residents. After taking blessings from his father, Sumit started his day at 9.30am with a campaign trip to Dhanas. Before starting his door-to-door campaign, Sumit held a meeting with prominent residents of Milk Colony, Dhanas and discussed the day’s plan. Thereafter, he started the campaign. His poll pitch was a mix of sentiment and logical vision as he reminded people of the work done by his father and promised that he would also work in the same vein for overall development of the ward. Going for one-to-one connect rather than impersonal public meetings, Sumit knocked on every door. He met youngsters with camaraderie and took elders’ blessings dutifully. He also campaigned in the double housing board area of Dhanas. He told voters that his father developed a number of green belts and parks, besides improving the condition of roads and addressing the parking problem at Aman colony and Chaman colony in Dhanas. Sumit and other Congress supporters distributed pamphlets of the work done during Subhash Chawla’s term. Sumit told residents that he was involved in all these works as he was looking after ward development on his father’s behalf, because of which, he had experience of how works were done in the MC. His promises for the future included beautification of the remaining area, installation of high mast lights, extension of the community centre, Dhanas, upgrade of the dispensary to a 20-bedded hospital and establishment of an indoor stadium for ward residents. In the afternoon, he had lunch with Congress workers, after which he continued his door-to-door campaign. Through it all, he kept coordinating with his father and team members. In the evening, he held another meeting with his team and went to the Returning Officer’s office to collect the voters’ list.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sumit-chawla-falls-back-on-fathers-legacy-personal-touch/articleshow/88398657.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

The suspects wrote ‘Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Ki Jay’ and ‘Jay Maharashtra’ on the buses and also blackened the vehicles. They damaged the windshield of one bus by throwing a stone, the police said. One of the bus drivers (55) lodged a complaint with the police later in the day. The police said the buses were parked at the open space and there were no passengers. Before leaving the spot, the men shouted anti-Karnataka government slogans. The bus drivers were chatting when the suspects reached the spot. An officer from the Khadki police said, “It is primarily suspected the men were protesting against the desecration of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Bengaluru a few days ago. The men claimed the Karnataka government was not cracking down on the suspects and in a move to protest against it, they painted and blackened these buses”. “The 14 men came to the spot on bikes. They told the bus drivers not to meddle in their work and then they painted and blackened the buses. One of the 14 men hurled a stone at a bus and damaged its windshield,” he said. Police registered the case under relevant sections of the IPC and also invoked provisions of the Defacement of Public Property Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/14-men-deface-four-ksrtc-buses/articleshow/88398663.cms||---
---||Mumbai||RT-PCR pre-booking confusion for international arrivals in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Yet another mismatch between Central and Maharashtra government rules has led to fresh confusion among arriving passengers, leaving international ones in a tizzy this time. The Centre has mandated that from Monday (December 20), people flying from ‘atrisk’ countries to the six metros need to pre-book their onarrival RT-PCR test. But the Air Suvidha portal home page has a passenger advisory that asks “all” international arrivals in Mumbai—and not just those from at-risk countries—to pre-book the test. System error on portal, it shows old advisory: MaharashtraWhile Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said information on the Air Suvidha portal asking “all” international arrivals in Mumbai — and not just those from at-risk countries — to pre-book the RT-PCR test “is not correct”, Delhi Airport operator (DIAL), which maintains the portal, cited a “latest advisory” from Maharashtra for it. The state advisory says not just at-risk arrivals, but “passengers from any other country… will have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test at the (Mumbai) airport on arrival.” State government officials said this is a “system error.” The web portal is still reflecting an old order, which has been revised and most of these requirements have been done away with, said an official. The Maharashtra government on November 30 issued an order seeking all international travellers to take an RT-PCR test on arrival and also required fully vaccinated domestic travelers to carry an RT-PCR negative report. However, after a snub from the Centre, the state issued revised guidelines on December 2 doing away with these conditions. A MIAL spokesperson said they have written to DIAL to remove the line specific to Mumbai as the Union health ministry requires only those coming from ‘at-risk’ countries or those who have been to ‘at-risk’ countries in 14 days before coming to India to pre-book on-arrival test. “(There is) incorrect information on Air Suvidha (about all international arrivals requiring to pre-book the test) regarding Mumbai airport. We are writing to those managing the portal. Only passengers arriving from at-risk countries or those who have travelled in the last 14 days to these countries are required to pre book their test,” said a Mumbai airport spokesperson. The passenger advisory that pops up on the portal’s home page says: “As per latest government guidelines, it is mandatory for passengers arriving from at-risk countries in six metro cities—Mumbai (All international passengers arriving in Mumbai), Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad to pre-book their Covid-19 test from December 20, 2021, onwards.” Delhi airport sources cited the Maharshtra advisory which said, “International passengers arriving from at risk countries shall have to undergo mandatory 7-day institutional quarantine and RT-PCR test to be carried out on days 2, 4 and 7 for these passengers. If any is found to be positive, the passenger shall be shifted to a hospital. In case of all tests coming negative, the passenger will have to undergo a further 7 days of home quarantine. Passengers from any other countries except the at risk countries will have to compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test at the airport on arrival.” Given the constantly changing rules in states, the Air Suvidha portal late on Monday carried an advisory, asking passengers “to check latest guidelines from the state APHO (airport health officers) or the airlines concerned before starting their journey.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/system-error-on-portal-it-shows-old-advisory-maharashtra/articleshow/88399354.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Delhi||Don’t panic, ready for new variant: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: Amid rising cases of fresh Covid-19 infection, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal assured there was no need to panic as Delhi government was prepared to deal with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. Kejriwal, however, urged the central government to allow fully vaccinated Delhiites to take a booster shot, starting with healthcare workers. In a digital press briefing on Monday, the CM dismissed any panic over the Omicron variant and it was a very mild variant and Delhi government was prepared for it even if some citizens required hospitalisation. “We have made adequate preparations for beds, oxygen, medicine and everything else that may be needed to fight the virus,” he said. “We won’t let the people of Delhi face difficulties in treatment.” Kejriwal promised genome sequencing of every positive sample to determine the variant. Till now only people arriving at the airport were being tested for variants, but with over 100 positive cases on Sunday, genome sequencing of all positive tests will be done, he said. The CM said that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) met on Monday under the chairmanship of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to discuss the Covid situation. “We assessed the impact and problems posed by the variant with experts, who informed us that the Omicron variant spread rapidly but was mild in nature,” said Kejriwal. “One might get fever and other symptoms. The need for hospitalisation is very low overall and the chances of death are very low too.” He said that 99% of Delhi’s eligible population had received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine while 70% were now fully vaccinated. He appealed to the Centre to allow booster doses. “We have the infrastructure to administer booster doses. We can start with our healthcare workers and then the rest of the population,” he said. The CM requested everyone to wear face masks in public places. “We’ve seen how people have reduced the use of masks in markets. Our safety is in our own hands and masks are the best defence against Covid. Everyone must take the situation seriously and start wearing masks again,” he exhorted. He added, “After discussion with experts we have come to the conclusion that this time, home isolation would be best to deal with infection and so have decided to bolster our home isolation programme.” The CM chaired a high-level meeting with all the authorities concerned on November 30 to review the state’s preparedness against Covid. Delhi government said in a statement that 30,000 Covid beds were assessed to be ready in the city, with 100 beds per ward to be arranged as and when required on a two week notice, taking the total bed capacity in Delhi to over 64,000 beds. Additionally, 6,800 ICUs would also be ready soon, the statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dont-panic-ready-for-new-variant-cm/articleshow/88399360.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC to Maharashtra govt: Reply on aggregator cab rules||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday directed the state government to submit its reply on the statutory regulations for aggregator cabs and the terms and conditions attached to their licences. “What is the state doing?” asked Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Makarand Karnik at the hearing of a PIL by advocate Savina Crasto, citing two personal experiences from November 2020. Crasto said when she tried to write to Uber, its app had no option to lodge complaints. Crasto argued customers have to select from issues listed on the app and cannot file complaints beyond what is listed. She said during the pandemic, drivers were permitted to cancel a ride. “The driver is right in front of me. He cancels the ride. I have been charged,” said Crasto. Uber’s advocate argued it only acts as a facilitator or agent between the driver and the customer. “It is entirely app-based,” he said, adding Uber has redressed complaints and has a 24x7 helpline. When asked to show the statutory permission to Uber and Ola, the state’s advocate Jyoti Chavan said a regulatory policy, Maharashtra City Taxi Rules, was framed in 2017. It was challenged and HC directed a status quo. HC noted the state had then said it would take no coercive measures against aggregators. In the order, the judges said, “The consequences of such a statement is serious, as even if an aggregator does not possess a licence, the state would not be in a position to take action against it.’’ HC directed Uber to inform if it has obtained a licence to operate. HC said Uber cannot claim it did not apply for a licence because of HC’s order. “It does not absolve you from the Central (Motor Vehicles) Act. The statutory mandate is that you cannot function unless you obtain a licence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-to-state-reply-on-aggregator-cab-rules/articleshow/88399370.cms||Rosy Sequeira

---||Surat||Surat airport to get CISF cover from December 28||SURAT: The Surat airport will finally get the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) cover from December 28, meeting the long-pending demand of aviation activists and local businessmen. A total of 226 trained male and female security personnel will be deployed at the airport whose security was till now handled by the state police, a top official confirmed to TOI. In 2019, the union home ministry had approved the demand for CISF. Looking at the increase in passenger traffic as well as the number of flights from Surat, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has agreed to deploy CISF here. Deployment of CISF will also help the airport attract more airlines. Sources said following the approval of CISF deployment in 2019, the airport authorities started making arrangements for the facilities of the security personnel like housing etc. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, the plans got delayed. CISF has different wings and they train their personnel looking at requirements of the place of deployment. One of the wings is the Airport Security Group (ASG). They are fully trained to provide safety to people as well as the entire airport infrastructure. The official said arrangements of their stay and food have already been made. However, local police will not be completely withdrawn after CISF takes charge as the former will look after outside security and law and order situation. Recently, a major tragedy was averted at the airport after an alert pilot of a private airline aborted landing, the permision for which was granted despite police’s mock drill being conducted at the runway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/surat-airport-to-get-cisf-cover-from-dec-28/articleshow/88397870.cms||---

There was about 90% decline in sanitizer sales in Pune after the second wave of Covid-19, and conditions are still similar. We are offering to sell sanitizers at a no-profit margin if that helps in boosting the sale. Very few people carry sanitizer bottles these days unless they are on a long trip,” said Anil Belkar, the secretary of Chemists’ Association of Pune. Jagannath Shinde, the president of All India Organization of Chemists and Druggists, said sanitizer sales had gone up only marginally. “If the supply to a chemist was limited to 100 bottles from August to November, it has gone up by around 105 bottles. It’s not really an increase. The Omicron scare is there but we are not witnessing a major increase in sales,” Shinde said. Not just sanitizers, sales are similar for masks too. “In early December, the sale of masks increased marginally for some time before dropping again. The reason could be less number of institutional buyers. The market doesn’t run on individual customers rather institutional buyers such as hospitals and government agencies drive the sales. It seems such clients have decided to wait and watch the Omicron unfold,” said Anshumali Jain, the president of All India Mask Manufacturers’ Association. He added, “There is also confidence among the general mass that nothing would happen to them if they are fully vaccinated. A large number of people nowadays wear cloth masks rather than wearing the proper surgical varieties such as the N95 and others. Though a good quality cloth mask is safe if a person is in a small surrounding with limited people, one needs to wear surgical masks while travelling.” Omicron cases have crossed the 100 mark in the country and Maharashtra has more than 50 cases. The Pune district stands at the top in the state with 21 cases. Swapnil Gundecha, the owner of Pune’s Kalash Manufacturers and Traders that makes surgical masks, said the demand has fallen. “At present, positive cases are down and hence, the demand is lesser. If cases start rising again, demand will climb up too,” he said. A representative of a medical store in the Kondhwa area said there were hardly any customers buying sanitizers these days. “People found without masks are fined and thus they buy and wear them. We are keeping designer cloth masks because people prefer them more than the surgical ones. Sale of sanitizers have, however, gone down drastically. Until July-August this year, I was selling around 200 to 300 small and big bottles of different kinds of sanitizers every month. Now, I sell 20 to 25,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/sale-of-sanitizers-masks-stands-still-despite-new-variant-scare-in-city/articleshow/88399359.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: MSRTC key union ends stir, others to continue||MUMBAI: A union of the state transport agency, MSRTC — Kanishth Shreni ST Karmachari Sangh — which had given the call for an indefinite strike called off its protest on Monday evening after detailed discussions with transport minister and MSRTC chairman Anil Parab. However, a few other unions and several workers said they would continue with the strike. The key union’s president Ajay Kumar Gujar, a respondent in a court case, said that the minister has assured to look into all demands including financial aid to kin of workers who committed suicide and to bring salaries on par with state government staff. He said his union is firm on the demand for merger of MSRTC with the the state government, but will withdraw from the strike. He said the union will appeal in a higher court on the ‘merger’ issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaimsrtc-key-union-ends-stir-others-to-continue/articleshow/88399957.cms||Somit Sen
---||Goa||Goa: Separated by parties, Vishwajit Rane prepares to take on father Pratapsingh Raoji Rane in Poriem||PANAJI: Pratapsingh Raoji Rane versus Vishwajit Pratapsingh Rane in Poriem is turning out to be a reality rather than a fantasy. The Ranes—father-son duo—are now separated by parties. While senior Rane has been a loyal Congressman for 45 years and MLA for 50 years, junior Rane was elected on a Congress ticket in 2017 but immediately resigned, contested on BJP ticket and won with ease. Should both father and son stick to their respective stands, it will be for the first time in Goa’s electoral history that a father-son duo are battling for the same constituency. Both have never lost an election. “If my supporters want me (to contest state assembly election in 2022), I cannot say no,” senior Rane, a 10-time legislator and five-time chief minister, told TOI on Tuesday. “I am the sitting MLA from Poriem. If the workers desire that I should contest, I cannot just ignore them. If they decide that I should contest, I have to. All the workers have come to me. They want me to contest and I have decided to contest.” Junior Rane, the state’s health minister, was quick to respond. “My father is misguided and I feel bad making this statement, but I will contest against my father in Poriem on a BJP ticket,” said junior Rane. “He is my father and I respect him. He is now 83 years old and disconnected with youth. For the last 20 years, I have been looking after his constituency. Congress is non-existent there. I have got all panch members elected and they are all with BJP.” In the past, Goa has seen father-son duo contest for two different seats on different party tickets—Joaquim Alemao (Congress, Cuncolim) and Yuri Alemao (NCP, Sanguem), in 2012—but never in the same constituency. Churchill Alemao (Navelim) and his daughter Valanka (Benaulim), besides Ravi Naik (Ponda) and son Ritesh (Marcaim) all contested on Congress tickets the same year. In 2012 and 2017, the Ranes contested on Congress tickets from Poriem and Valpoi, winning both seats. “I feel, under pressure from Congress high command and local functionaries, he must have made the statement, but I don’t think he will contest. After completing 50 years in assembly and at 83 years (of age), he should gracefully retire. I have requested him (to retire),” said junior Rane, who switched allegiance to BJP in 2017 and has now promised to win his father’s Poriem seat with a margin of 10,000 votes. Senior Rane was emboldened after Congress Poriem block members and his main supporters held a meeting with him at his residence at Karapur on Tuesday and urged him to contest the upcoming election. “Why he (Vishwajit) is leaving Valpoi, I don’t know. I cannot advise him as he is an adult, and he belongs to BJP. I don’t know BJP’s game plan,” said senior Rane, one of the two Congress MLAs who have not resigned or switched allegiance. He has completed 50 years as a member of Goa’s legislative assembly and has never faced electoral defeat. “This is not father versus son but competent versus more competent, who can deal with the issues of Poriem. It is not the issue between father and son, it is between BJP and Congress,” said Vishwajit. He said Congress will soon be wiped out from the state. “I have to contest from Poriem on the BJP ticket. It would be a messy thing (to contest against father), but I hope it will be sorted out. Let him fill the nomination, I will also file mine. There is no time to convince him as hardly 20 days are left,” he said. Vishwajit said his father will not be able to do anything for the people as Congress is in no position to form the government. Later in a tweet, Vishwajit said, “Shri Pratapsingh Raoji Rane is my father and we shall sort this issue amicably. Although I have decided to contest from the Poriem constituency, we will resolve this internally within the family.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/separated-by-parties-vishwajit-rane-prepares-to-take-on-father-in-poriem/articleshow/88420520.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Chandigarh||Cycling on crash course as garbage covers tracks in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: The administration may be trying to motivate residents to take up cycling but when it comes to ground realities, words are all that the administration has. Laid for the express purpose of facilitating cyclists and inspiring people to take up cycling, cycle tracks are now barely functional because of garbage heaps, broken tree branches, gravel, building material and debris. Even if an ardent cyclist decides to risk it, injury would be a possibility. Its not just cyclists who find it difficult to negotiate such stretches. The foul smell emanating from festering garbage heaps also forces pedestrians to cover their nose. Cycle tracks in the southern sectors are worst affected. At many places, cycle track lights have been installed but the track itself is missing. With the administration playing sitting duck, thieves recently made off with six cycle track lights. As heaps of gravel or building material cover cycle tracks, which have even been left incomplete in some places, cyclists face the risk of accidents, especially at night. Under the circumstances, many cyclists are forced to ride on the main roads along the cycle tracks, defeating the purpose of the project. Cycle tracks laden with gravel and building material can be seen opposite Rock Garden in Sector 4, along parade ground, opposite Sector 43 bus stand and on the road dividing Sector 52 opposite Sector 51. Chandigarh Cycle Riders Club member, Gurjasjit Singh said, “As the MC is going for elections, responsibility of the area councillor must be set to check and maintain cycle tacks. UT administration has just made a formality to construct these cycle tracks. We face garbage dumps, dumping of construction waste, dug up land, and dark spots on tracks which discourage cycle riders.” Another cyclist said, “We have been raising the issue of poor condition of cycle tracks with the UT administration, but no action has been taken. The concept is losing sheen with cyclists refraining from riding on such dangerous tracks.” “While riding a cycle track at night on my way back home, I fell down when my cycle struck a pile of bricks on the tracks. I sustained injuries and since then, I have stopped riding on cycle tracks,” another cyclist said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cycling-on-crash-course-as-garbage-covers-tracks/articleshow/88398681.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Vadodara||MSU senate poll: BJP’s gamble of ‘mandate’ misfires||Vadodara: BJP’s decision of issuing an official mandate for election of MS University’s highest body – the senate – has fallen on its face.  Just two out of eight candidates, whose candidature was backed by the party’s city unit won, as results of the nine seats of the registered graduates’ category were announced on Monday. It was for the first time that the party had issued an official mandate for an election which largely remains a university centric affair.  The saffron camp of MSU referred as ‘Team MSU’ which was at odds with BJP’s city unit on the other hand bagged four seats. Congress had not issued any mandate. But candidates linked with the party bagged three seats. Elections for the nine seats in this category in which 27 candidates were in fray was held on Sunday. With 6,428 voters out of total 11,616 exercising their voting right, the voter turnout was 55.34 %. As results started pouring in, supporters busted crackers, danced to the tunes of garba and DJs at the university head office. Sitting syndicate member Dinesh Yadav, whose name did not appear in the BJP’s official mandate despite being an active worker, won with the highest lead of 719 voters to represent Faculty of Arts in university’s senate body.  Apart from Yadav, advocate Avadhoot Sumant, Abhilasha Agrawal and Vinod Patel who were backed by Team MSU won the polls to represent Faculty of Law, Faculty of Family & Community Sciences and Faculty of Performing Arts in the senate.  BJP’s micro-planning that involved MLAs, corporators and ward presidents did not help it win two crucial seats of Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) and Faculty of Commerce in which party’s city unit president Vijay Shah was personally involved.  All JP leaders who were seen actively involved in Sunday’s election were conspicuously absent when the results arrived. From FTE, Congress leader Narendra Ravat retained his senatorship with 785 votes defeating BJP-backed Kashyap Shah who bagged 697 votes.  Similarly, former senate member Amar Dhomse won at Faculty of Commerce by garnering 945 votes defeating BJP-backed Sushant Makhijani who bagged 288 votes. Both Kashyap Shah and Makhijani were declared as common candidates by BJP and ‘Team MSU’. The only solace for BJP and ‘sankalan samiti’ was victory of Hasmukh Shah from Faculty of Pharmacy and Bipin Patel from Faculty of Fine Arts.  Interestingly, sitting senate member Kapil Joshi emerged as giant killer. Unlike several other candidates who had made elaborate arrangements including food and refreshments to keep their voters happy on election day, Joshi had not made any such arrangements. He, however, defeated Arjun Solanki, whose candidature was backed both by the BJP and ‘Team MSU’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/msu-senate-poll-bjps-gamble-of-mandate-misfires/articleshow/88398711.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Neighbours accuse donor family of organ sale, officials intervene to set record straight||Kolkata: When family members of Surjyakanta Mondal consented to donate the farmer’s organ on December 8, they had just one fear — stigmatization by the villagers — for their act. Officials at IPGMER, where the organ donation took place, had promised to stand by the family in case of any such issue. True to the promise, health officials reached out to the family with the help of an NGO when they were accused of selling Mondal’s organs. The 56-year-old farmer, a resident of Baikola Baneshwarpur, had suffered brain death at IPGMER two days before the donation. His heart, liver and two kidneys were transplanted to four patients. During counselling, the wife of the deceased, Lilabati, who is barely literate, agreed to the donation but feared a backlash from villagers. According to the family, some villagers were teasing and taunting with the accusation that the family had sold Mondal’s organ. They called up ROTTO-IPGMER transplant coordinator Nirmal Dutta a few days ago. On hearing their plight, ROTTO-SOTTO officials rushed in with help. While ROTTO roped in NGO Barasat Samajik Seva Pratishthan (BSSP), SOTTO (State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization) sent doctors from the block primary health centre to organize an awareness campaign in the village. On Saturday, the villagers were invited in the campaign where the family was felicitated while the doctors and the NGO members cleared all doubts and misconceptions the villagers had in their mind. “On our part, we even requested Bagda block panchayat samity president Paritosh Kumar Saha to attend the event. His presence helped in interacting with the villagers. We have also promised to support the education of the deceased's younger daughter who is studying in a college,” said Sujan Bhattacharya, coordinator of Samajik Organ Harvesting Aid Group. West Bengal SOTTO nodal officer Tamal Kanti Ghosh, ROTTO director and joint director Manimoy Banerjee and Arpita Ray Chaudhuri have lauded the efforts of the NGO and appreciated the deceased's family.“The meeting with doctors and the NGOs have brought in much change in the mindset of the villagers. They seem to know what organ donation is. We feel so much assured and at ease after the awareness campaign,” said a family member of the deceased.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbours-accuse-donor-family-of-organ-sale-officials-intervene-to-set-record-straight/articleshow/88398690.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Ahmedabad||Omicron: Most patients in Gujarat needed re-test||AHMEDABAD/VADODARA: What was common about the cases recorded in Vadodara on Monday and in Ahmedabad on Sunday? The patients had tested negative with RT-PCR tests twice — but the third test detected the presence of Covid-19 and subsequently genomic sequencing found the Omicron variant. In the case of a 27-year-old woman in Vadodara, she developed symptoms such as low-grade fever after returning from the UK last week. “She underwent the RT-PCR test before boarding the flight according to the requirements. Upon arrival in Mumbai, she again took the test and the result was negative,” said a senior health department official. “She then returned to Vadodara. As she developed symptoms, she was advised another test and the presence of the virus was detected.” In the case of a couple from Tanzania, the chance discovery was due to a pre-procedure RT-PCR test that gave the positive result. They had tested negative in Mumbai and Ahmedabad and even at the time of boarding the flight. Experts pointed out that the milder symptoms or the lack of symptoms make detection all the more difficult. Senior state health department officials were not available for comment on whether multiple testing could be the norm for passengers from ‘at risk’ countries. Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, an Ahmedabad-based pathologist, said that the way in which the samples are collected matters as much as the kits do. “Both nasal and throat swabs can give results, but if the viral load is low, the virus may not get detected immediately,” he said. “It’s possible that the first two tests are carried out at a short interval, and by the third test the viral load required for detection is achieved.” Dr Maheshwari added: “The kit should include S-gene too for better results. In Delta, we did not have such a method to see if multiple tests are required for detection.” He went on to say: “In the case of Omicron, the requirement for RT-PCR tests before travel and upon arrival give us reference points.” An analysis of the 14 cases so far show that only four were symptomatic, 12 were below 50 years of age, all were fully or partially vaccinated, and 12 were already under medical observation when their Omicron status was known. In two cases, some close relatives have also tested positive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/omicron-most-patients-in-guj-needed-re-test/articleshow/88399385.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Mumbai||Shiv Sena hits back at Amit Shah for ‘Hindutva betrayal’ remark||MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena on Monday hit back at the BJP for Union home minister Amit Shah’s remarks that the former had betrayed Hindutva for power after the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls. A day after Shah dared chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who leads the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state, to resign and re-contest the election, Sena MP Sanjay Raut challenged BJP to ask its 105 MLAs to quit and see how many of them win without the support of Sena and central agencies. Last week when he was in Pune, Shah had said that he was in Maharashtra before the polls in 2019. “I had a conversation with Sena. I want to reiterate that it was decided that polls would be fought under the leadership of Devendra Fadnavis and the CM would be from BJP. But they [Sena] denied and compromised with Hindutva for power,” he had said. But Raut said that in February 2019, at a press conference at Blue Sea Banquet in Worli addressed by Shah, then CM Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray and Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray, Fadnavis had announced the Sena-BJP alliance. He reiterated that the 50:50 power-sharing deal between Sena and BJP, which included the sharing of the CM’s post, for the assembly polls was agreed upon at the meeting. “Sena has never abandoned Hindutva. On the other hand, since 2014, BJP has insulted Hindutva step by step,” claimed Raut. “Before the assembly elections, a meeting was held at Blue Sea Banquet...a word was given by both. The share of power was 50:50. Power sharing means equal sharing of power which includes the CM’s post. Amit Shah must tell everyone who wants to keep the Sena out.” He added: “Shah said BJP should contest polls alone. I wa-nt to tell him that we (Sena) contested solo in 2014 against a massive wave of money power and Centre’s power. We fought well under Uddhav Thackeray’s leadership and won.” Sena minister Subhash Desai also lashed out at Shah. “It is good that you are concerned about Maharashtra’s past glory. But, first stop taking away glorious institutions from Maharashtra to the Centre and Gujarat. Even during the tenure of Fadnavis, industries were sent away. We will not keep quiet now,” he said, referring to setting up a financial centre GIFT in Gujarat instead of IFSC in Mumbai and the shifting of the labour training institute from Nagpur to Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sena-hits-back-at-shah-for-hindutva-betrayal-remark/articleshow/88399389.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Of the new patients, four are admitted to Lok Nayak, while five are at Max Smart. Most of the patients have a history of travel and they are asymptomatic, sources said. A senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital said they have received 24 Omicron cases since December 2. Of them, 12 have been discharged, he added. Initially, only Lok Nayak was designated for the isolation and treatment of Omicron cases. However, the Delhi government recently asked four private hospitals to establish separate isolation units for patients infected with the new variant. These are Max Smart Super Specialty Hospital, Saket; Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlaqabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital. An order issued by the health department stated, “To augment the capacity of institutional isolation facility in the private sector for Covid-positive international passengers, who have travelled from or transited through at-risk countries, as per Centre’s guidelines, the authorities of Batra Hospital & Research Centre, Tughlaqabad Institutional Area; Fortis Super Specialty Hospital, Vasant Kunj and Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital are hereby directed to establish separate units for such passengers on a payment basis with immediate effect... and to follow the SOPs issued by MoHFW, GoI”.

Authorities said that the wildcat that eluded the cameras installed by the forest department could be the same that had strayed in Thane city last week and was sighted outside a few commercial and residential buildings. Officials said that the leopard could now be trying to find its way back to the forest. “We were informed by locals that they spotted the leopard at Patonpada area that is on the fringes of Sanjay Gandhi National Park. We assume the cat is the same that was spotted in Pokhran area and could now be finding its way back to its natural habitat. The leopard had preyed upon a few stray dogs in the city,” said Sandeep More, forest officer. Officials said they would nonetheless continue to keep track of the animal’s movements for the next few days before they suspend their daily night rounds. “Leopards are shy animals and are unlikely to attack humans, unless provoked. The cat has so far remained elusive to our cameras installed to track its movements. We feel it will slip back into the jungles but as a precautionary, we have conducted awareness camps in the societies near the park to avoid any man-animal conflict,” said Rakesh Bhoir, range forest officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/leopard-that-visited-thane-heading-back-to-the-forest/articleshow/88377207.cms||Manoj Badgeri

Water will be sprayed along roads to coalesce finer particles into bigger ones to keep them grounded. A Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) study shows over 30% dip in particulate concentration in the air following the use of dust-suppressant sprinkling. “We used water sprinklers in the last two years and the outcome was very satisfying. So we will be using it across the city and recommend other civic bodies to follow suit,” said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra after flagging off the first vehicle. To start with, 16 such sprinklers will be deployed along the most-polluted stretches of the city’s road network. “We are extremely careful not to use drinking water in the sprinklers. I have asked to use untreated water,” Rudra added.  This is on and above similar vehicles deployed by KMC. The source apportionment study and emission inventory study — carried out by NEERI — had earlier revealed that road dust is the source of 66% of PM10 pollution. Road dust is also a major contributor to PM2.5 pollution. “We will be running the vehicles across major corridors of the city. Each vehicle will cover 50km in each trip. So, our three vehicles will cover 150km in the morning and another 150km in the evening. But we are going for re-tendering so that we can deploy more such vehicles,” said a WBPCB official. At each site, particulate matter concentration would be monitored before and after the dust suppressant is sprinkled. PM10 and PM2.5 concentration will be monitored each time at different time intervals (10 minutes, one hour, two hours, three hours and six hours) after sprinkling the dust suppressant to understand the duration of its efficacy. A CPCB study showed 50% to 60% initial reduction in dust concentration 10 minutes after spraying the suppressant. About 30% drop in dust concentration was observed after six hours. WBPCB provided Rs 6 crore to KMC for procurement of 10 water sprinklers and 10 mechanical sweepers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/water-sprinklers-to-keep-dust-grounded-on-roads/articleshow/88398703.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The girl was bitten numerous times and died on the spot, according to police. Laxmi lived with her parents, Gopi Ram and Vimla Devi, and a 6-year-old sister, in a camp near the DDA park, where her father was a gardener. Police said the canines attacked the girl when she was playing in the park. “Both the parents were working and had made Laxmi sit on a bench nearby. They were familiar with the dogs and did not expect them to attack the girl,” said a police officer. “Around 20 minutes later when they heard the snarls of dogs and children screaming, they rushed to check on Laxmi only to find her bleeding profusely. They took her to a hospital where the doctors declared her dead.” Urvija Goel, DCP (West), said the cops received information about the incident from the hospital around 2.45pm. "The girl’s body was taken to DDU Hospital for the autopsy. The parents claimed that their daughter was mauled by dogs at a park,” said Goel. “We are investigating the incident and have recorded the statement of the parents, who were present in the park.” The local residents were outraged at the incident. Some of them alleged that a group of children had pelted stones at the dogs because of which the canine pack had chased the kids. “While the older kids managed to escape, Laxmi could not sense the danger and was attacked by the dogs,” said a police officer. “Many people also claimed that dog bites are frequent in the locality. We are verifying such allegations. Meanwhile, a letter has been written to the sub-divisional magistrate's office asking them to look into the matter.” Police said Laxmi’s family were natives of Bihar’s Madhubani district but were living in Delhi for over a decade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-year-old-girl-mauled-by-a-pack-of-dogs-dies-on-spot/articleshow/88399422.cms||---
---||Delhi||Omicron symptoms mild, mostly cold-like: Doctors||NEW DELHI: The initial reports of the treatment of patients infected by the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the symptoms caused by both of them are markedly different. For example, doctors treating patients affected by the new variant in Delhi say Omicron does not cause loss of taste or smell, which was one of the defining symptoms caused by the Delta variant. “We have treated 24 Omicron-positive patients so far, but only two were symptomatic. One had low grade fever, sore throat, headache and body ache, while the other suffered from sore throat and loose motions. Their condition improved with symptomatic treatment and none of them required steroids, antiviral drugs or oxygen therapy that were the mainstay of treatment for the Delta variant,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital. Data released last week by Covid Symptoms Study conducted by a health science company called Zoe and King’s College, London, where Omicron has led to a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, also showed that the top five symptoms reported for Omicron infection were runny nose, headache, fatigue (either mild or severe), sneezing and sore throat. “Omicron seems mild, but these are early days. Most patients are healthy and relatively young people are returning from other countries. The real test of the virulence of the new variant will be when it starts spreading. We need to see how it affects the elderly and those with compromised immunity, for example people suffering from cancer or chronic kidney disease,” said Dr Kumar. However, one thing is clear about Omicron — it is far more transmissible than the previous variants of SARS-CoV-2, including Delta. Asked the reason behind the increased transmissibility and seemingly milder symptoms, immunologist Dr NK Mehra referred to a study conducted in Hong Kong where scientists infected the human lung tissue with different variants of SARS-CoV-2 to assess its effect. “The study found that the Omicron variant replicated about 70 times higher in the bronchus than the original SARS-CoV-2 and the Delta variant,” said the honorary emeritus scientist of Indian Council of Medical Research. Dr Mehra added that the experiment also showed that the Omicron variant replicated with much less efficiency in the lung. The immunologist further stated, “The new variant makes the virus stay longer in the throat, which makes it more transmissible. However, because its capacity to replicate in the lungs is less, it doesn’t cause severe symptoms, mainly breathing difficulty.” However, he warned that higher transmission could put pressure on community immunity leading to severe disease in a fraction of cases and an increased burden on the healthcare system. “It is important to identify and isolate positive cases to prevent clusters,” said Dr Mehra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omicron-symptoms-mild-mostly-cold-like-doctors/articleshow/88399416.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Chandigarh||Encroachments in commercial areas across Chandigarh increase fire risk too||CHANDIGARH: Despite claims otherwise, encroachments in the commercial areas across the city still remain an unsolved issue. The antiencroachment drives are hardly making any effect on the ground. Since the fire safety is also directly connected with it, the authorities have their hands really full, especially during the festival seasons. Though all commercial areas of the city are encroached upon, Shastri Market in Sector 22, Sadar Bazar in Sector 19, Patel Market in Sector15, commercial areas of Manimajra, Sector 41 and Sector 45 have real problem. The encroachment is these areas have increasing significantly despite discussions and many ‘action plans’ to stop the occupancy over the government land. The increasing encroachment is a serious concern considering what was widely thought as a solution — earmarking vending zones across the city and allotted the spaces to the eligible vendors to settle their business — seems to have failed. The civic body has an enforcement department, and its officials keep removing encroachments from the markets and commercial areas. But soon after the action, the encroachers again occupy the government land. In the past, scuffles and fist fights were also witnessed between the encroachers and the staff of the enforcement department. Many cases were also registered in the police stations of the city. But nothing had helped in the long run. These encroachments have increased the chances of fire hazard. The passages of these markets are too narrow to walk and nightmare waiting to happen in case of a fire accident. The fire and emergency department of the municipal corporation also issued fire safety notices to these markets, but the encroachers seem unperturbed by these dangers. The situation is so bad that during the festival season the authority has to set-up temporary fire stations adjoining key commercial areas to take quick action in case of any fire emergency. Firemen on motorcycles also move in these congested and encroached markets to keep a regular vigil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/encroachments-in-commercial-areas-of-city-increase-chances-of-fire-hazards-too/articleshow/88398688.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Goa||App-based taxis possible with digital meters: Mauvin||Panaji: Even as implementation of digital taxi meters is a big step towards digitisation, state transport minister Mauvin Godinho has requested the National Informatics Centre to develop an app to support these digital meters. “It will be like an app-based taxi as a result. This way, we will not require other service providers,” he said. Godinho was responding to a query on the possibility of introducing app-based aggregators Ola and Uber in Goa, following the launch of the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) in the state on Tuesday. “Goa is a small state and has a tiny population, owing to which it becomes important to protect the local taxi industry. Perhaps we can bring about changes such as introducing app-based aggregators Ola and Uber after having a dialogue with them. But for now, we are letting that go because we want Goa to remain a peaceful state and for the taxi operators to be on the top of the chain in Goa tourism,” Godinho said. He also shared a comment on the current developments in the political scenario with functionaries resigning from BJP and others joining the party. “There is a lot of political churning taking place, with newer players coming into the picture. Ultimately, it is advantage BJP. Based on the performance and development, maximum people will ultimately figure out the party that has done something for them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/app-based-taxis-possible-with-digital-meters-mauvin/articleshow/88420571.cms||---

Rajinder Rana, vice-president of HPCC and Congress coordinator for MC polls said, “People of Himachal Pradesh have shown the way to the ruling BJP in Himachal Pradesh by giving Congress one Lok Sabha and three assembly seats in the bypolls held recently. The BJP is going to meet the same fate in Chandigarh. People are not going to be lured by false promises of BJP.” Rathore said the Narendra Modi government was forced to reduce excise duty on petrol and diesel after their resounding defeat in the by-elections. The fear of electoral defeat had forced the government to take back the farm laws.” Rathore, who has lived in Chandigarh for many years, lamented the miserable civic conditions in the city due to “rampant corruption that prevailed in the corporation during last six years”. Rana, while addressing public meeting in different MC wards, said, “It is a habit of BJP leaders to make promises in the run-up to elections and turn their back on them once they are over. These lucrative promises will not work as people have made up their mind to oust BJP from Chandigarh MC,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/like-hp-bypolls-bjp-will-loses-mc-polls-cong/articleshow/88398715.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Goa||In a first, Goa may get green booths for 2022 elections||Panaji: Not very often is much thought given to the fact that elections generate a lot of non-biodegradable material, which are used in campaigning as well as at polling booths. Now, the office of the chief electoral officer, Goa, and the Goa state biodiversity board (GSBB) have taken an initiative to design a model for eco-friendly  booths with fully biodegradable material. The concept is expected to be implemented in at least one booth per taluka for the upcoming 2022 state polls. The material used at the booth is not only environmentally-friendly, but has been made entirely by local traditional artisans hailing from Sattari and Ponda. “A lot of non-biodegradable material is generated during elections, so this concept of a green booth has been created, using entirely locally-sourced materials which are eco-friendly,” said GSBB member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam. “Also, having green booths will also mean that instead of engaging a contractor, the money spent on making material for such green polling booths will go to local artisans. A decision is yet to be taken on how this can be implemented, but it is the first time anyone has proposed this idea of a green booth and it's a start.” A selfie booth has also been created by the artisans, where voters can pose post the polling. “New eco-friendly selfie board created for Goa elections. It is made locally by artisans under GSBB using bamboo and other materials. #GetReady to Vote,” said chief electoral officer Kunal in a social media post. Suryakant Gaonkar from Bhuipal, Sattari, Navso Parwar from Saleli, Sattari, and Shailesh Mangesh Chari, are the main artisans under whom the green booth model has been created. “The booth has been created mainly by weaving bamboo and coconut fronds. We engaged many youngsters from Sattari, including Navso’s sister Pramila, to execute the work. Some of the décor has also been made by weaving together hay derived from paddy fields,” said Gaonkar. “Not many are aware of the handicrafts of Goa, even within the state,” said Gaonkar, who won the 2020 state biodiversity award for his work on promoting the use of eco-friendly colours and decor. “And I think even if one or two such green booths are set up for the upcoming state polls, it will help raise awareness about this craftsmanship. We will engage traditional artisans and work under their guidance, if the booths are approved. We will engage local women’s self-help groups too to execute the work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-goa-may-get-green-booths-for-2022-elections/articleshow/88399417.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

Police have booked Nilesh Lathia, a resident of Sai-Shraddha residency in Mota Varacha, for rape based on a complaint lodged by the married woman with Sarthana police on Sunday night. According to police, the woman who lives with her husband and child had come in touch with Nilesh a year ago. The accused promised to get the woman a job and asked her to meet at a hotel, where he allegedly raped her. Police said that Nilesh also clicked nude pictures of the woman which he later used to blackmail her. Ten days after the alleged rape, Nilesh again contacted the woman and threaten to make her pictures viral if she did not adhere to his demands. Over the past year, Nilesh allegedly raped the woman at his sister’s place in Bharuch several times. When she could not take the sexual exploitation any longer, the woman gathered courage and told her husband about Nilesh and how he had been blackmailing her. On Sunday, the woman filed rape and blackmailing complaint with Sarthana police against Nilesh.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: No GST on transport cost partially borne by staff||Mumbai: In its recent order, the GST-Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR), Maharashtra bench, has held that partial recovery of transport costs from its employees by a private company is not a “supply” and hence not subject to the goods and services tax (GST). This ruling will gladden companies that increasingly provide transport facilities to their employees. Companies across sectors are gradually asking employees to return to their workplace, either full-time or based on a hybrid model.This ruling, which has a persuasive effect, will come in useful in similar situations. Integrated Decisions and Systems India, a private sector company, is engaged in software development and allied services which it provides to its overseas parent company. Between July 2017 and March 2019, it spent Rs 1.6 crore on hiring cars and cabs for transporting its employees. It paid GST on this entire sum. Several companies ask employees to bear a certain portion of the cost—be it for canteen or transport facilities. During the given period, this company recovered Rs 29.3 lakh from its employees, as their share of transport costs. The issue was whether GST would apply on the amount recovered from its employees. For GST to be levied, there needs to be a supply of goods or services. The GST-AAR bench, in its order, stated: “The provision of transport facilities to the employees is a welfare, security and safety measure and is not at all connected to the functioning of its business.” It also noted that the partial amounts recovered from the employees for use of such transport facilities are part of the amount paid to the transport vendors, on which the full GST has already been paid. Thus, the amounts collected from employees will not be subject to GST. A similar view was taken earlier by the Maharashtra bench, in the case of Tata Motors. Sunil Gabhawalla, indirect tax specialist, sums up: “The correct view is that there should be no recovery on nominal sums received from employees as there is no taxable supply.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-gst-on-transport-cost-partially-borne-by-staff/articleshow/88399981.cms||Lubna Kably

Holding children, they raised slogans against the state government for not paying heed to their demand for hike in salary. One of the female protesters, Sunita, who came from Rohtak said, “We cannot leave our children alone at home but the protest is important for us to show our unity. The government must listen to our demands.” The protesting women vocational teachers announced that they would reach the Haryana Assembly in Chandigarh but the duty magistrate convinced them to sit on the dharna ground saying that talks with the government would be held after the end of the Assembly session on Monday. Protesters raised slogans like ‘Service Bylaws 2013 laagu kiye jaye’, ‘Samaan Kaam, Samaan Vetan laagu kiya jaye’ and ‘assurance of job till 58-years of age’. Haryana Vocational Teachers president, Anup Dhillon said that women protesters from across the state, many with infants and toddlers, came to express their support. “Our main demands are to get equal pay for equal work and job assurance till the age of 58 years so that we can work with a free mind without worrying about job loss. We also have houses to run and without job security and less pay, it is hard to survive,” said the protesters. The protesters have been raising their demands for the last 57 days and hope to get themselves heard during the winter assembly. On November 24, when protesters started to march towards the CM house in Chandigarh, they were booked under various sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kids-in-arms-women-teachers-join-protest-for-pay-job-security/articleshow/88398732.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

At least 16 children suffered from poisoning due to the cough syrup and were admitted to Kalawati Saran Children’s hospital. Three of them died, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Union health ministry stated in a letter sent to the state health officials last week. The letter directed Delhi government to issue a notice to all dispensaries/mohalla clinics to not prescribe the drug – a cough suppressant – to children who are less than four years of age. On Monday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the death of the children is very unfortunate and proper investigation will be done to get to the bottom of the matter. “At present, the services of three doctors have been discontinued and a high level inquiry has been ordered,” he said.  “This drug is a centrally acting cough suppressant. It causes side-effects such as sedation and, therefore, it is not given to children. It is possible that the drugs were contaminated or there were other issues,” a senior paediatrician, who did not want to be quoted, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-sacks-3-mohalla-clinic-docs-for-giving-kids-cough-syrup-meant-for-adults/articleshow/88399446.cms||---
---||Agra||‘No development’: 28 Agra colonies to boycott polls||AGRA: To protest against the lack of basic amenities, people of 28 colonies under Sadar sub-division of Agra district have declared to boycott the upcoming assembly elections. There are around 25,000 families in the Devretha area, where these colonies are situated, who are alleging they will not cast their votes until issues like water-logging and pothole-riddled roads in their areas are resolved. In many colonies like Dhanoli, Ajeejpura and Siroli, residents have placed "for sale" posters outside their houses. Residents said they were “frustrated at pursuing their demand for construction of a proper drainage system in their area since years.” Mansarovar Nagar resident Rajendra Singh told TOI, “We have been demanding construction of proper roads and drainage systems, which are both basic necessities, since the last 13 years. Our colony gets severely water-logged.” He added that “there is a lack of adequate street lighting, too, due to which accidents take place every other day.” Talking about the lack of sanitation and hygiene in the area, Singh said, “We have complained to local authorities umpteen times in the last one year, but to no avail." “We have finally decided to boycott the upcoming assembly elections, if our grievances are not addressed and work is not commenced in the area before the announcement of the model code of conduct," he added. Another resident of the area, Manoj Kumar said, "In the past 40 years, local authorities have not been able to develop even basic infrastructure in our area. In 2008, Agra Development Authority had begun construction of the road in this area for an event. However, the construction was left incomplete after the event. Ever since then, the road has been in the same condition.” Social activist Savitri Chahar, who is leading the protest, said, “We had staged a protest over these issues last year too. Back then, the local authorities had promised to sort the water-logging menace, but no action was taken. Even public representatives have turned a blind eye towards our problems.” When queried, additional district magistrate Anjani Kumar said, “We are working to eradicate the issue of water-logging on Dhanoli road and other surrounding colonies. Arrangements are also being made for maintaining sanitation and hygiene. She added that “to boycott elections is no solution.” ReplyReply allForward||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/28-agra-colonies-housing-25k-families-to-boycott-polls-over-lack-of-development/articleshow/88397931.cms||Deepak Lavania

Of the 1.26 lakh applications received, the maximum has been from Pune (18,000) and Mumbai (16,000), with more number deaths registered in these two cities. State government officials said many applicants have not given proper bank details, which has delayed disbursement. The Supreme Court recently asked states to commence with the disbursement at the earliest. “There were issues with forms not being filled correctly, and incomplete bank details. The district authorities are verifying and the amount would be disbursed soon,” said officials. Nearly 1.41 lakh deaths have been registered in the state. The state has allocated around Rs 700cr towards disbursal. After a delay of nearly three months, the state government launched a website early this month for kin of Covid victims to file applications. “The process is simple as the applicant has to apply with Aadhaar proof,” stated officials. Families without positive RT-PCR, RAT results and Covid death certificates would also receive ex gratia if the deceased had died within 30 days of being clinically diagnosed with Covid-19. The government has also appointed committees in every district under the additional collector to take care of any grievance redressal. The affected families have to submit claims through a form issued by the state authorities along with specified documents, including those certifying the cause of death. The district disaster management authorities would ensure that the process of claim, verification, sanction, and disbursal is simple, robust, and people-friendly. According to the guidelines, all claims must be settled within 30 days of submission of required documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-govt-to-pay-ex-gratia-to-kin-of-25000-covid-victims-this-week/articleshow/88399425.cms||Nisha Nambiar

JJP workers led by the party’s Panchkula City president, O P Sihag reached the protest site in Sector 20 and raised their voice against the paid parking system of the BJP-led MC. Shopkeepers of Sector 20 plan to close their shops on the last day of protest. O P Sihag demanded removal of the paid parking from Sector 20 and said that the local government should make a decision in residents’ favour. “We extend our full support to residents of Sector 20 in their protest,” he said. On the other hand, BJP MLA Gian Chand Gupta and mayor Kulbhushan Goyal claimed that the paid parking was helping the civic body generate funds for the city’s development and that they would not step back from the decision. Former mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwalia of the Congress also participated in the dharna. K K Jindal, president, Sector 20 RWA, an umbrella body of 115 societies, said that a meeting would be held with shopkeepers on Tuesday to take a final call on closing the market on the last day of protest on Wednesday. He said that the protest aimed at pressurising the administration to withdraw “anti-public” decisions. He added that the sector was introduced on a policy of no profit and no loss and that they had paid for all common areas. Due to this, he said, the MC did not have the right to impose paid parking in the area. The protesters asserted that they would continue their agitation with or without the support of political parties till December 22. “Residents of all age groups are sitting with us to end this paid parking from Sector 20, which is imposing extra burden on citizens,” said Jindal. Residents also accused the administration of planning to deforest 10 acres of land having mango trees between the Sector for construction of flats. Association general secretary Avinash Malik criticised HUDA for “looting and torturing the public mentally and economically” for the last 20 years. Association vice-president Yoginder Kwatra said that the treatment plant was not working properly and HUDA had failed to lay sewerage pipes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jjp-goes-against-ally-bjp-over-paid-parking-in-pkl/articleshow/88398742.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

---||Pune||Minimum temps unlikely to drop below 10ºC in next few days in Pune: IMD||PUNE: The city experienced its coldest morning so far in December on Monday, as the mercury plunged further to 11.2ºC in Shivajinagar. Locations such as Pashan, Lohegaon, Chinchwad, Magarpatta and Lavale recorded higher minimums in comparison to the temperature of Shivajinagar. Monday’s minimum temperature was very close to the lowest minimum temperature, 10.9ºC, recorded for the season so far on November 11. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, told TOI, “The minimum temperature in Pune this season so far has not doppped to single digit like in earlier years in December. As per the current forecast, the minimum temperature in Pune is unlikely to fall below 10ºC during the next few days because the wind pattern has already started changing to easterly. It will furtherslowly change to southeasterly and then to southerly from Tuesday onwards.” He said winds blowing into the state were the cold northerlies after the passage of the recent western disturbance, which led to a drop in the minimum temperature. “Now the effect is gradually reducing. However, two other western disturbances are now approaching north India (western Himalayan region) in quick succession, the first from Wednesday and second from Friday. Due to these systems, the minimums are unlikely to see a drop in Maharashtra at least till month-end,” he said. The arrival of western disturbance is associated with the rise in the moisture levels and the partly cloudy conditions, which can cause a rise in night temperature in places such as Maharashtra. Kashyapi said, “It is after the passage of the western disturbance that night temperature usually falls. Due to the influence of the arrival of western disturbances, an induced cyclonic circulation may form over north India’s plain regions and some moisture incursion could also take place over Maharashtra.” On Monday, Nagpur recorded the lowest minimum temperature in the state at 7.8ºC. Single digit minimums were also recorded in Amravati (8ºC), Gondia (8.2ºC), Jalgaon (8.7ºC), and Wardha (9ºC).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/minimum-temps-unlikely-to-drop-below-10c-in-next-few-days-imd/articleshow/88399431.cms||Neha Madaan

The court was hearing the bail petition of Manikandan alias Santhanamanikandan who was arrested by Kulasekarapattinam police on December 2. The prosecution case was that the petitioner along with other accused had transported huge quantities of banned tobacco products to his shop for sale. The additional public prosecutor strongly opposed the grant of bail to the petitioner since he indulged in such activities continuously.  During the course of hearing, the petitioner stated through his counsel that he would give an undertaking to place a display board in front of the shop stating “no banned products will be sold”. Taking into account the undertaking, Justice G Ilangovan granted bail to him on condition that he not only puts up a display board in front of his shop but also produces its photograph before the concerned court. If any new case is registered against him, the bail granted by the court shall stand automatically cancelled, said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-who-transported-banned-tobacco-gets-bail/articleshow/88398765.cms||---

The judge said that petitioner Mathivanan went on a sightseeing pleasure trip with his daughter and son-in-law to Sirumalai hills on September 16. He put out the photographs taken on the occasion on his Facebook page with that caption. “Revolutionaries, whether real or phoney, are not usually credited with any sense of humour (or at least this is the stereotype). For a change, the petitioner tried to be funny,” he said. Vadipatti police in Madurai thought the petitioner was making preparations to wage war against the state and registered a case against him under several Sections of IPC. The judge said they arrested the petitioner and produced him before the jurisdictional magistrate. Mercifully, M C Arun, the Vadipatti judicial magistrate, had the good sense to refuse remand. The judge observed that for an act to constitute a crime, there are four stages - intention, preparation, attempt and accomplishment. While penal laws intervene only at the third and fourth stages, even preparation is made an offence in certain cases. Sections 399 and 122 of IPC are such provisions. Any penal provision has to be strictly construed. Application of the provisions which penalize even preparation must meet a higher threshold. In the case on hand, the 62-year-old petitioner has not done anything else apart from posting the picture with a caption. His daughter and son-in-law are standing next to him. Other photographs capturing the scenic beauty of the place have also been posted. The judge observed that no weapon or proscribed material was recovered from the petitioner. He neither intended to wage war nor did he commit any act towards preparation. Any normal and reasonable person coming across the Facebook post would have laughed it off. Observing that none of the offences are attracted against the petitioner, the judge held that the very registration of the FIR is absurd and an abuse of legal process and hence quashed it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-quashes-fir-against-man-62-held-for-funny-fb-caption/articleshow/88398762.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The PM had commented on “the bold action of the state government to crack down on the market” at Shahjahanpur while inaugurating the Ganga expressway on Saturday. Senior superintendent of police Prabhakar Chaudhary said that police have completed an almost six-month-long probe, in which several traders were found to be indulging in illegal activities. “We cannot comment on the names and numbers of those involved in illegal activities so far but there are several traders in Sotiganj who have 25 to 30 police cases on them. These cases include charges of theft, robbery, cheating, and attempt to murder. We will take stringent action against those found guilty and the Gangster Act will be slapped on them,” he said. A senior police official who did not wish to be identified, said that police are set to book 25 defaulters after preparing a list of suspicious traders, verifying their details, and scanning their properties and social network. The market has over 300 shops and employs roughly 1,000 people. It has been shut since December 12. Cops over the past five months have taken action against Haji Galla, Iqbal Kabadi, Galla’s alleged rival, Mannu Kabadi, and Zeeshan Pava. Properties of these traders, worth around Rs 50 crore, have been attached.

Cops have now called tenders to sell off 300 such vehicles that include trucks, mini-trucks, SUVs and two-wheelers to clear up some space. Among the vehicles to be scrapped is also a breakdown van seized by Jadavpur Police. The seizures are from 26 of the city’s 70 police stations. Hastings, Shyampukur and Sarsuna Police Stations have the maximum vehicles on the scrap list. “There is a need to clear up spaces around police stations so that newly-seized vehicles can be parked. For that, it is important that we clear the dumpyards so that we can move the old seized vehicles from the police stations to the dumpyards. The top brass also wants police stations and the surroundings to be clean. We are being repeatedly told to clean up and sanitize the area around the police station. Seized vehicles gather dust and become an eyesore. During rain, water accumulates and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” said an officer. “Around 80% of vehicles being e-auctioned are two-wheelers. We are also selling off cars, autos, taxis and even trucks. Once the contract is awarded, the vehicles have to be removed within a month,” he added. According to cops, many of these seized cars don’t have legitimate papers and a number of them were seized from accident sites. “There is no particular time frame for seized cars to be disposed off. But, when we do launch bigger drives like last year, we sold 631 vehicles. We have a big dumpyard near Vidyasagar Setu and another small one near Pragati Maidan, but not all cars are sent there due to space crunch,” said an officer. In July last year, cops had held a mass auction at the Vidyasagar Setu yard to scrap older cars and transfer the new ones from the police stations there. The maximum bikes being sold off were seized by Beniapukur, Topsia, Parnasree and Bhowanipore police stations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-dumpyards-run-out-of-space-as-vehicle-seizures-rise/articleshow/88398761.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The woman had returned from UK and had not come in contact with many persons. The woman was the third case of the Omicron variant detected in the city. Earlier an elderly couple residing in the Harni area of the city were found infected with the variant. The 27-year-old woman had returned form UK on December 13. She had been tested in UK and at Mumbai airport and was negative for Covid-19. On the next day of her arrival she had fever and was tested again. This time she was found positive and was in home isolation. The lady had only two close contacts who were tested on December 15 and found negative. After she was found positive, her samples were also sent for genome sequencing. The report of sequencing arrived on Monday and revealed that she was infected by the omicron variant. She is under hospital isolation in a private hospital. Officials of the health department are also awaiting the reports of genome sequencing of a boy studying in the Cygnus School in the city. While he had tested positive on December 16, he had not gone to school since December 10. The concern regarding the boy is that he was a close contact of the elderly couple from Harni who had tested positive and were found infected with the omicron variant. The boy’s samples had also been sent for genome sequencing. “The school has taken the necessary precautions despite very little chances of the boy contacting or spreading the infection there,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/omicron-variant-cases-in-vadodara-rise-to-three/articleshow/88398791.cms||---

The flyover is a part of double decker facility in which Metro viaduct is placed at top and a vehicular flyover below it. Both facilities are coming up on same pillars. “About 70% work of flyover has been completed so far, and there is an attempt to complete the remaining work at the earliest, MahaMetro officials said. The project is being executed jointly by MahaMetro and PMC. City mayor Muralidhar Mohol had asked MahaMetro to consider the vehicular flyover under the priority work to restrict delay and reduce hardship of daily commuters on Karve road. A MahaMetro official said, “We have pressed in maximum workforce at the site to expedite work. The work of ramps is underway at present. The completion is not possible by December-end. However, we are eyeing a January-end deadline. The work of Metro’s viaduct, which is placed above this flyover has already been completed.” The flyover will primarily eliminate stoppage of vehicles on Karve road at Nal Stop chowk. Vehicles coming from Law college road and from Mhatre bridge will, however, pass through the chowk. Meanwhile, those who commute regularly through Karve road said that the work should not be delayed further. “Only a single lane on both sides of the road has been kept open for vehicles over the last few months, which has restricted traffic movement,” said Paresh Kale, a daily commuter. Asmita Samant, another commuter, said, “The lanes that are being utilised by vehicles are not in good condition. Regular repairs should be carried out by the PMC and MahaMetro.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nal-stop-flyover-likely-to-be-ready-by-next-month/articleshow/88399444.cms||Sarang Dastane

Though it brought smiles on the faces of traders and others depending on the tourism sector, people of Courtallam and Tenkasi expressed concern over lack of compliance to Covid-19 norms. The falls – Main Falls, Five Falls and Old Falls – were last open from December 14, 2020 to March this year but were closed again due to the spread of the second wave. These falls remain closed even during the peak of Saaral season from June to August. However private falls in the district took advantage of it and fleeced tourists. Tenkasi MLA S Palani Nadar and a few others sprinkled flowers in the Main Falls and fireworks were burst before it was opened to tourists from 6 am to 6 pm. Though the district administration had stated that only 16 people (10 men and six women) would be allowed at a time, more than a hundred people bathed simultaneously while thousands queued for their turn, most of them Sabarimala devotees. The only norm that was properly followed was checking of tourists for fully vaccinated certificates. Courtallam Vyabarigal Sangam’s S Kavaihya said it is good to be back to business, and appealed to the district administration to permit bathing round-the-clock. However, locals fear that tourists without masks and not being controlled by any authorities could result in further spread of Covid-19 in the district, which has only 16 active cases at present. The district had even recorded zero or one case daily over the last few days. Crowds were relatively lesser in the Five Falls and Old Courtallam as there was no access by buses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/big-crowds-throng-courtallam-falls-ignore-covid-safety-norms/articleshow/88398772.cms||---

Sisodia said Delhi government has given the civic bodies 75% of the funds in three instalments so far while the remaining will be dispersed in January. Since its formation, it has not only given corporations their share of the budget, but also a loan of Rs 6,889 crore, he added. “Despite knowing this, BJP functionaries controlling the corporations are crying that the Delhi government did not give money to us. The question is, where did all this money go under the BJP’s watch?” he said. “BJP functionaries are claiming that they do not have enough money to pay their employees. On the contrary, corporation is being hollowed out because of rampant corruption while BJP functionaries are filling their pockets day by day,” alleged Sisodia. The deputy CM alleged that BJP had sold 13 parking lots in north corporation to private mafia “for pennies” and waived crores in property taxes for them. “The BJP-led corporation has taken crores of rupees from markets in the form of conversion fees and parking fees, but is yet to solve the parking problem,” he claimed. Sisodia also claimed that the BJP-led corporation pays a rent of Rs 6.3 lakh for a waste management machine costing Rs 17.5 lakh instead of purchasing it, and that it is selling corporation properties at “throwaway prices”. Terming the allegations “baseless”, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “The deputy CM said the government has released three-fourths of municipal funds for 2021-22, but didn’t mention that the amount paid was fixed for the year 2012. After that, the recommendations of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Delhi Finance Commission doubled the amount. Despite accepting the suggestions, Delhi government has not implemented them.” Kapoor denied that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation sold any car parking and said it is getting them constructed under the PPP model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-accuses-corpns-of-graft-says-govt-has-already-paid-them-rs-2588cr/articleshow/88399456.cms||---

Das has had an incurable wanderlust since his childhood. The rickshaw, he said, has added wings to his dream. Acutely conscious of the environmental degradation around him, Das carried the messages of environmental conservation all along by planting date palm seeds which can grow absorbing the earth’s moisture. Earlier in 2017, he embarked on a similar journey from Kolkata to Ladakh on the same cycle-rickshaw. This time, he went further to Siachen glacier, the final frontier for the Indian Army. His route was Kolkata-Benaras-Lucknow-Ambala-Jammu-Vaishnodevi–Srinagar-Zojila Pass-Kargil-Ladakh and Siachen. Das who ferries passengers to and from Gitanjali metro station for a living said, “I used to wander aimlessly. But Tarun Biswas, an environmentalist, added a purpose to my journeys. He taught me the importance of the environment and why I should make people aware of environmental degradation to people on my way. Biswas is not only my true guru, but a guiding light in my life. I look for him whenever I am in trouble,” said Das. He always associates nature and environment with his journeys. At Siachen glacier, he almost lost his life. “I lost consciousness in the extreme cold. When it happened I did not know as I was asleep inside my sleeping bag. There was 8-9 inch thick ice on the tent. Finally, Army people rescued me. As I was battling for life, I was profusely thanking people who gave me money, proper shoes, sleeping bag and tent to make my journey possible,” said Das. His daughter Sukanya is now in Class XII. “I want her to pursue environmental science. My daughter and my wife Munna are two rock solid supports in my life. Without them, I could never undertake such a long strenuous journey.” Das was overwhelmed by the warm reception he received after entering Bengal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cycle-rickshaw-puller-spreads-message-of-environmental-conservation-from-kolkata-to-siachen/articleshow/88398798.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

The area has heavy police deployment in the wake of ongoing winter session of the assembly. Locals were outraged at the rash driving, despite barricades and police deployment in and around the region. The deceased has been identified as Nikhil Kumar (22) alias Deepu. He was a student of Yogada college. Deepu was out on morning walk when the incident took place. Two other passersby — Dipak and Rahul — were also injured after being hit by the SUV. Rahul is undergoing treatment at a hospital, while Dipak has returned home after minor treatment. Local residents burnt tyres on the raod to block traffic and demanded immediate arrest of the culprits. Based on the CCTV footage, the police arrested the driver, Nitesh Kumar, and seized his SUV. Officer in charge of Dhurwa police station, Praveen Singh, said, “Over-speeding is common in the area as the roads are wide and generally remain vacant, especially in the morning. The accused would be forwarded to the jail.” Over-speeding has led to many accidents and casualties in Ranchi in the recent past. Ranchi witnessed 509 accidents between January and October this year.

While addressing the 45th vice-chancellors (VCs) convention of Indian Agricultural Universities Association (IAUA) at Birsa Agricultural University (BAU) on Monday, Bais also urged the scientists to devise strategies to make sure that soils’ health cards are available to all the farmers. “The cards would help the farmers use fertilizers according to the requirement of the soil as an overdose of nutrients will adversely affect the health of the soil,” he said. The governor stated that since 80% of farming operations in Jharkhand are performed by women, scientists should also device ways and means for improving their conditions. He said farmers belonging to low soil fertility regions should incorporate horticulture, animal husbandry and fisheries in their farming system. Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s deputy director general (education) Dr RC Agrawal stated that nearly 80% of National Education Policy’s recommendations, like development of entrepreneurship, community connect and four-year degree programme, are already being implemented in agriculture-based universities. Dr R K Mittal and Dr R C Srivastva, who are the VCs of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture and Technology, Meerut and Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Samastipur, respectively, dwelt on the role and activities of IAUA for betterment of agricultural education. BAU’s VC Dr Onkar Nath Singh underlined the importance of coordination among farm varsities.

---||Ranchi||Govt eyes 1k startups in next 5 yrs||Ranchi: The state information and technology department (IT) is soon going to come up with ‘start-up policy 2021’ which is aimed at developing an environment of entrepreneurship to facilitate the growth and development of at least 1,000 direct start-ups and support 1,500 start-ups virtually in the next five years. “It will be placed before the cabinet soon and if all goes well, it will be implemented by January,” a department official said on Monday. Though the state IT director, Manoj Kumar, couldn’t be contacted for a comment, his department’s officials said the policy’s draft has been uploaded on the state government’s website for seeking suggestions from the people. Under the policy, the government has proposed a two-pronged approach — first through action plans and second by playing the role of an enabler. “Under the action plan, we aim to offer tailored support to the needs of each and every entrepreneur for the development of his/her idea till it grows into a venture. Any individual or group of individuals can submit their idea with the state evaluation board. Once selected, the government will provide a stipend of Rs 15,000 per group member (maximum 3) per month for a year. Women, SC/ST and differently-abled will be eligible for an additional Rs 2,000 per month,” the official said. The selected idea/concept will be also eligible for maximum financial support of Rs 10 lakh for the development of the prototype of one’s product/solution. “All the selected ideas/concepts will be provided mentoring free of cost, access to lab facilities and other facilities available in the incubation centre for a maximum period of one year,” the draft read. It further stated that a one-time marketing grant of up to Rs 10 lakh would also be provided to start-ups for the successful launch and marketing of the product/solution in subsequent phases. The government also intends to build connective infrastructure between academic and research institutions, industry and funding institutions. “To do so, it has planned a Hub and Spoke (HAS) model for developing the start-up ecosystem. The government will set up a central incubation lab as the hub of all government/government-aided incubation centres in Jharkhand. The state shall help the institutions of higher learning with one-time endowment funds to create new or upgrade their existing incubation centres which would act as the spoke or the peripheral incubation centres.” A Jharkhand Entrepreneurship Development Fund will also be set up where a separate corpus fund which will be created for promoting entrepreneurship and developing infrastructure in the state. “The state schools’ curriculum will be updated to incorporate modules on basic electronics, entrepreneurship, digital and basic financial literacy to develop an aptitude for entrepreneurship among the students,” read the draft. Regarding incentives, the policy proposes reimbursement of GST paid by start-ups. “Those registered in Jharkhand will be entitled for 100% reimbursement of GST, government shall reimburse 100% of patent filing cost, registration fee/stamp duty/ transfer duty. A three-year reimbursement on payment of all municipal duties by the start-ups is also proposed, besides reimbursement of 50% on lease rentals up to Rs 5 lakhs per annum for a maximum period of three years depending on the place they are located,” the draft read. In cases where private premises are taken on lease/ rent basis, a rental reimbursement at government approved rates will be given per sqft per month or 50% of the actual rent paid, whichever is less, for a period of 2 years with the maximum cap of Rs 3 lakh. A similar policy was also introduced by the previous BJP regime which governed between 2014 and 2019 and close to about 100 ideas were selected for funding but the policy failed to achieve the intended results, leaving many start-up enthusiasts in the lurch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-eyes-1k-startups-in-next-5-yrs/articleshow/88397933.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government higher primary school is in Kodapadavu, Vittalpadnur, under the Bantwal BEO limits. In 2016, the Bantwal BEO had ordered the demolishing of the building and the construction of new classrooms. However, after five years, students continue to attend classes in the same about-to-collapse building. The school development and monitoring committees (SDMC) president, Umar Farooq, said that Rs 21.20 lakh that was released from the Public Works Department in 2018 for the construction was diverted to another school. Farooq told TOI that currently the school has only four classrooms, of these two in a dilapidated building to accommodate 132 children from classes I to VIII. The rest of the children are taught in a 15-year-old new block which has two classrooms. One classroom is divided into three to accommodate Classes I to III. Another two classes are held in the open. “We are conducting class at a dilapidated building as there is no other way,” Farooq said. In 2016, the BEO of Bantwal who ordered the demolition and construction of two new classrooms estimated the cost at Rs 32 lakh. In 2018, PWD sanctioned Rs 21.20 lakh for the construction. “The funds were diverted to another school in Kanyana. We need at least six good classrooms to run the school. The school SDMC members have been running from pillar to post but officials have not considered our pleas.” Villagers pointed out that they had done house visits to increase admissions in the school. “It worked, we had received good admission and now we are struggling for classrooms. The government must step in immediately to construct the classrooms to retain the students. The parents may remove their children from the school next year because of fear,” a villager said. When TOI contacted Jnanesh MP, BEO, Bantwal, he said there is a proposal to sanction three classrooms for the school. The funds were delayed because of the pandemic and even the school had not addressed the issue to the BEO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dilapidated-school-built-in-1932-holds-classes-risk-to-132-students/articleshow/88398119.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

The college has BCom and BCA courses that can accomodate 60 and 50 seats, respectively, however, it has managed to admit only 12 students for the BCA course, and five students for the BCom course. As per the rules, a college can start only if there are 10 or more admissions. Rajashekar Hebbar, principal of the evening college, said since there are less students admitted, they cannot start courses. A total three students joined the day college, and one student got admitted to the BCA evening college course. Another student joined the University Evening College in Hampankatta. “This year, we will start with only the BCA course, and we will start the BCom course from next year. All enrolled students will receive similar facilities offered to their day college counterparts. The evening college was proposed during the 2021-22 state budget.” Hebbar said, “A majority of students got admitted in private evening colleges in the city, as we received the order very late. Our admissions will improve next year for both courses.” Some of the senior lecturers blamed that evening college would have received good admissions if the people in charge worked well and promoted the courses. “This was not done here and it is sad to see that a lot of seats are vacant,” criticised a senior lecturer. Jenifer Lolita C, joint director, Collegiate Education, Dakshina Kannada, declined to comment on the issue. Apart from Dakshina Kannada, the department of higher education has also sanctioned 10 more evening colleges in 10 municipal corporations in the state this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/dks-first-govt-evening-college-has-few-takers/articleshow/88398477.cms||---

It is also keeping a watch on anti-social elements to prevent them from indulging in illegal activities during the festive season. A large number of visitors throng several waterfalls, including Dasam fall, Johna fall and Hudru fall located around the Ranchi city during Christmas and New Year through most of January. SP (rural Ranchi) Naushad Alam said, “Instructions have already been issued to police stations concerned to intensify patrolling around the picnic spots. Our main aim is to prevent over-speeding and group clashes after drinking.” He said policemen would be deployed at the picnic spots as and when the number of people increases. The dangerous spots of the waterfalls would also be barricaded to prevent any mishap. SP (Ranchi city) Saurav said parks, restaurants, bars and picnic spots located in the city would be under tight vigil. “There would be adequate deployment of force at picnic spots and parks to ensure that people feel safe while celebrating Christmas and New Year. We would ensure there is no clash at the public places, including at bars and restaurants.” Meanwhile, the traffic department is gearing up to start drives against drink driving, over-speeding, riding without helmets and other violations at important crossings in the city. Last year, one person was killed and around half-a-dozen were injured in two separate incidents under the Sikidri police station area of Ranchi during the 2021 New Year celebrations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/police-on-toes-to-ensure-peaceful-x-mas-new-year/articleshow/88398176.cms||Sanjay Sahay

A photograph of a CHC staff pushing the ambulance to start it has also gone viral on social media. Agitated by the incident, family members of deceased Shishil Prasad accused the CHC staff of mismanagement and failing to keep ambulances in working condition, thereby playing with the lives of the common people. The family members said Prasad was brought to the CHC after his health deteriorated suddenly while battling high blood pressure. After finding his condition serious, the doctors referred him to the Bokaro sadar hospital. Kundan Prasad, a relative of the deceased, said, “He was to be ferried by a 108 ambulance and was waiting on a bed. However, the ambulance failed to start. Prasad died due to lack of timely treatment after the ambulance failure.” Sources said the ambulance has been facing technical issues since last month and had to be repeatedly pushed to start. Bokaro DC, Kuldeep Kumar Chaudhary on Monday said he has ordered a probe into the incident. “We are investigating the matter to find out the problems in the ambulance and fix accountability,” he said. Gomia health centre director Dr Halan Barla said, “The hospital staff tried to start the ambulance by pushing it but didn't work. A second ambulance was also arranged, but the patient’s health deteriorated and he died.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/77-year-old-dies-after-ambulance-failed-to-start-in-bokaro/articleshow/88398510.cms||Divy Khare
---||Ranchi||BJP ‘Braminical’ and against SC, ST, Dalits getting jobs through JPSC: Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren||RANCHI: Protests by opposition BJP members over the JPSC row sent the state assembly into pandemonium for the third consecutive day on Monday, washing away the only Question Hour of the CM, scheduled specially for the ongoing winter session. The opposition is demanding cancellation of the preliminary examination of the 7th to 10th combined civil services examination and removal of the JPSC chairman, citing irregularities in the examination and the results. The first half, including the question hour, was adjourned around 11.30 because of the commotion. When the session resumed at 12.30, chief minister Hemant Soren agreed to make a statement on the floor of the House after a call by Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto and by the BJP members over the Jharkhand Public Service Commission (JPSC) issue. Soren, however, ended up creating more ruckus after he accused the opposition of politicking over the issue and called them “Brahminical”, who are against SC, ST and Dalits getting jobs through the commission. The CM also said his government will not intervene in the issue, saying JPSC is an independent body capable of resolving the problems on its own. “I call upon the 81 members of this House to prove if the government has intervened into the functioning of the JPSC,” he said, shrugging off allegations of patronizing corruption in the commission. Expressing anguish over statements of BJP leaders, both inside and outside the House on the issue, Soren said the previous BJP government is “known to intervene into the functioning of the JPSC”. “We need not say anything about the previous BJP government which could not conduct a single civil service examination during its five-year tenure and prior to that, the chairman and members of JPSC, who were at the helm of affairs, are in jail for their misdeeds,” Soren said. Soren further said the SC/ST and OBC candidates have emerged successful in the examination this time and even broke into the general quota. Without revealing the figures, he claimed that it was because of the “selection of non-general candidates in large numbers that the ‘manuvaadi’ (Brahminical) BJP MLAs are having butterflies in their stomach”. “Aaj kamzor bachche aage aa rahe hain toh manuvaadi logo ke pet me dard ho raha hai. (Since the weak candidates are coming forward these Brahminical MLAs are having troubles). For the sole purpose of agitation, they are pushing members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to stage the dharna,” he said, creating a furore. Though the House was adjourned for lunch break soon after the CM’s statement, the BJP leaders lashed out at the government outside the assembly. BJP’s Babulal Marandi claimed that the government was patronizing corrupt practices of the JPSC and its chairman. “The state government in its advertisement had announced to make the OMR sheets public. Why is it not doing so?” he said and termed it as sufficient ground to gauze the “malafide intentions” of the government. Marandi also said that if the JPSC was neat and clean, what was its need to cancel the result of 49 candidates, who were earlier declared passed. “Nothing would have come out in the open if the students had not protested. The JPSC had to admit that 49 candidates were declared passed and later disqualified them after the agitation. It is enough evidence to establish that the examination process was not free and fair and warrants cancellation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-braminical-and-against-sc-st-dalits-getting-jobs-through-jpsc-hemant/articleshow/88398559.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: Petrol pumps to go on 12 hour strike today demanding VAT slash||RANCHI: Around 1,450 fuel stations in Jharkhand will remain shut for 12 hours (from 6am to 6pm) on Tuesday as a mark of protest against the Hemant Soren government’s stance of not reducing the value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel. The Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers Association (JPDA), the recognized body of petrol pump operators in Jharkhand, on Thursday announced that fuelling stations will remain shut state-wide. These stations are authorized dealers of PSU oil companies such as the Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited. JPDA declared the closure after the state government did not pay heed to their demands of reducing VAT by 5%, did not clear the outstanding dues of the government departments and did not regulate the unabated adulteration of biodiesel in various districts within three weeks. As per the JPDA, various government departments are yet to pay up Rs 50 crore in cumulative for the fuel they procured for their vehicles from scores of pumps state-wide. Besides inconveniencing the citizenry, the 12-hour strike will also cost the state government approximately Rs 10.5 crore in terms of its earnings from VAT on petrol and diesel. Most fuelling stations in Ranchi put out public notices on their premises on Thursday to inform the customers in advance. Many stations saw queues as commuters fuelled up late in the evening. JPDA has been demanding the reduction of VAT from 22% to 17%, citing business losses in commercial vehicles and in the industrial sector. “While the gross sale of petroleum in Jharkhand was 1.28 lakh kiloliter each month when the VAT was revised to 22% from 18% in 2015-16 FY, the sales have plummeted to 1.16 lakh kiloliter now. On the contrary, other states have witnessed a rise in 8% petroleum sales during this period,” the JPDA said. The high VAT was eating away their businesses as industrial units and heavy vehicle operators were meeting their fuel needs from neighbouring states such as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where VAT was lower and fuel is cheaper, the JPDA had informed state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon in a meeting on December 3 this year. Oraon had rejected the proposal stating that cash-strapped Jharkhand would lose Rs 400 crore annually for every rupee of VAT reduced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/petrol-pumps-to-go-on-12-hour-strike-today-demanding-vat-slash/articleshow/88398543.cms||Dhritiman Ray

DC Suraj Kumar has directed the officials of the three local urban municipal (LUM) bodies of the Steel City to issue notice in this regard. Besides, he has asked the municipal authorities to give permission to the future building projects only when waste management facility is inclusive in the construction plan. “Those who will fail to comply with the rules will face penal action under relevant provisions of the Jharkhand Municipal Act,” the DC said. The administration has announced a slew of measures, including the compost facility for buildings, as part of preparations for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan 2022. Also, all three LUMs of the industrial town, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC) and Jugsalai Municipal Council (JMC), will conduct checking of the residential flats to see whether basement/parking place is being misused for commercial purpose. The ground floor/basement, meant for vehicles parking, shouldn't be used for commercial purpose. Violators will be identified and notice will be served, said DC. Incidentally, a legal case pertaining to the misuse of the ground floor for commercial motives by way of deviation from the approved building design in the three urban bodies limits is at different stages of hearing in the Jharkhand high court. Among the other measures, all footpath vendors have been asked to keep two separate dustbins - one each for the dry and wet trash. If found dumping the organic waste on the roadside, vendors will face action. Municipal officials have been asked to increase visits to markets and food joints to regulate the affairs. The industrial town produces 300 tonnes of municipal waste daily, a chunk of the waste comprises the organic waste generated by the food stalls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/east-singhbhum-admin-makes-waste-compost-facility-must-in-all-buildings/articleshow/88397924.cms||B Sridhar

---||Chandigarh||No non-academic work for teachers in school hours, says Haryana minister||CHANDIGARH: The teaching staff in the state-run schools of Haryana would not be assigned any nonteaching work during the school hours. The state has also decided that teachers would be paid, in case they are assigned any non-teaching work by the state authorities in addition to their teaching work, during the non-school hours. State education minister Kanwar Pal provided this information while replying to a question by Meham MLA Balraj Kundu during the ongoing winter session on Monday. Kundu had asked the reasons for which teachers in schools are being assigned non-teaching work against the rules and despite the Supreme Court instructions. The minister said in addition to their primary duty of teaching, teachers would be required to undertake only statutory duties like election and census work. For any other work that teachers may be asked to do, deputy commissioners or any other department will seek the prior approval of the director general school education, who would then ensure that it has the least adverse effect on teaching. The minister said instructions in this regard were issued in September 2005 to all administrative secretaries, department heads and deputy commissioners in the state. “It has also been decided that for any duty other than teaching, which teachers may be assigned assigned/required to undertake, they should be asked to do this duty only after school hours and they should be paid honorarium suitably by the department concerned for undertaking the work so allowed by the education department,” the minister stated. Recently, teachers were assigned survey work for the Haryana government’s much touted project Parvivar Pahchan Patra (PPP). Those connected to teachers’ associations had informed TOI that in most parts of the state teachers were not paid for the survey work done by them for PPP. Some teachers were even assigned work in the state revenue department’s survey regarding updation of land falling under “lal dora”. Apart from this, teachers are even deployed for voter verification-related duties. However, Haryana School Lecturers Association president Satpal Sindhu said teachers should not be given any kind of non-teaching duty even after the school hours as it “affects teaching work because teachers have to prepare the lesson plan for the next day”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/teachers-not-to-be-assigned-non-academic-work-in-school-hours-haryana-minister/articleshow/88400080.cms||Ajay Sura

Three other bills were also tabled in the House — The Haryana Pond and Waste Water Management Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2021, The Haryana Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 2021 and The Panchkula Metropolitan Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2021 — and will be passed later after a detailed discussion. The Private Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021 has been passed to further amend the Haryana Private Universities Act, 2006. In order to accommodate the unprecedented growth of students in higher education, and also to cross the target of 50% gross enrolment ratio (GER), as per National Education Policy, 2020, there is a need to roughly double the number of institutions at all levels and the government intervention would not be adequate to meet this benchmark. Haryana Private Universities Act, 2006, has been brought essentially to rope in private sector to supplement the government initiative in expanding the capacity in higher education and upscaling its standards. To achieve the objectives of the Act, proposal has been made to setup Geeta University in Panipat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/private-universities-bill-passed/articleshow/88400082.cms||---

In the speaking orders, Punjab principal secretary (local government) said the execution of resolution, passed on November 25, was suspended in accordance with the law and the House of Patiala municipal corporation (MC) directed to take up the supplementary agenda regarding “no confidence motion” if again pressed in writing by the councillors who made the suspension under Section 39 of the act. The principal secretary also observed that Section 39 of Punjab Municipal Corporation Act stated that mayor, senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor could be removed from office by a resolution of the corporation passed by at least two-third majority of the members of the House present and voting. A requisition letter of ‘No-confidence', signed by 39 members of Patiala MC House, was sent to Bittu on November 18, following which Bittu issued two separate agendas on November 22 — first to ‘obtain the vote of confidence’ and second to invite members, including ex-officio members, to prove the no confidence. On November 25, 35 councilors and Patiala Rural MLA Brahm Mohindra, as officiating member, voted against Bittu, while 24 councillors, including the only SAD councillor and Patiala Urban MLA Capt Amarinder Singh, voted in Bittu’s favour. Bittu later filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against his suspension and the proceedings on that day. Mayor Sanjeev Sharma said, “The court has given me relief. I would continue as mayor. I was targetted as I had shown interest in contesting assembly elections from Patiala Rural, being represented by local bodies minister (Mohindra).” Mohindra could not be contacted, but Y S Yogi, who recently claimed to have taken charge of officiating mayor, said, “The court has asked Bittu to continue till January 21 as mayor. We will abide by the order.” There are 60 wards in Patiala MC, of which 32 falls under Patiala Urban assembly segment being represented by Capt Amarinder and 26 under Mohindra’s Patiala Rural constituency. Two wards fall under Sanaur segment represented by SAD MLA H S Chandumajra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-hc-punjab-admits-to-error-in-patiala-mayors-suspension-bittu-to-continue/articleshow/88400085.cms||Bharat Khanna

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia of AAP had visited the same school on December 2 and shot a video showing rundown condition of some parts. On Monday, Channi walked from Morinda to Sri Chamkaur Sahib, some 25km, and stopped at the school. The CM claimed that he had already sanctioned Rs 50 lakh for this school, besides astroturf worth Rs 70 lakh for the school. Attacking AAP leadership, he claimed as compared to any school of their frivolous ‘Delhi Model’, the said school had one of the best infrastructure, computer laboratory, library, eduset online facility and modern projector room. “Ironically, the same school was visited some days ago by self-contradictory Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who tried to show it in bad light by showing a storeroom. Even the storeroom was alright but Sisodia opted to switch off the lights of the room when they failed to find anything wrong there. This exposes the propaganda unleashed by outsiders of AAP to fulfil their lust for power,” alleged Channi. “AAP leaders are clamouring for power but their nefarious designs will be thwarted by the wise people of Punjab. AAP leaders should desist from spreading false stories about education and health system of the state, which were one of the best in the country,” he claimed. Later, Channi paid obeisance at Gurdwara Sri Qatalgarh Sahib. People joined him on the way from the villages he was passing through. He said since the past many years, whenever the Shaheedi Jor Mela reached Sri Chamkaur Sahib, he undertook a march to pay obeisance at Gurdwara Sri Qatalgarh Sahib.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channi-visits-school-after-sisodia-declares-it-best/articleshow/88400109.cms||---

On September 30, the Punjab government had sent a panel of 10 seniormost IPS officers to the UPSC. Now, the UPSC will shortlist the names of three most eligible IPS officers, based on merit-cum-seniority, in the meeting and send these names to the state government. Finally, it is the state government’s prerogative to pick one of those three police officers to head its police force. IPS officers whose names are included in the panel earlier sent on September 30 by the Punjab government to the UPSC include those of now officiating DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya (1986-batch), Dinkar Gupta (1987-batch), M K Tiwari (1987-batch), V K Bhawra (1987-batch), Prabodh Kumar (1988-batch), Rohit Choudhary (1988-batch), Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota (1988-batch), Sanjeev Kalra (1989-batch), Parag Jain (1989-batch), and Barjinder Kumar Uppal (1991-batch). Among these, five officers are superannuating next year - Tiwari (February 28), Chattopadhyaya and Choudhary (March 31), Uppal (May 31) and Sahota (August 30). After Charanjit Singh Channi replaced Capt Amarinder Singh as the chief minister in September, he chose Sahota as officiating DGP on September 25 till the permanent DGP is appointed through the UPSC process. Then permanent state police chief Gupta was sent on leave. Sahota’s appointment was strongly opposed by Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu on the ground that he (Sahota) was head of the SIT probing sacrilege cases in 2015 that had arrested two innocent Sikhs but had to leave them later. Finally, Sidhu succeeded and Sahota was replaced by Chattopadhyaya as officiating DGP on December 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/upsc-meeting-today-for-selection-of-punjab-police-chief/articleshow/88400114.cms||---

The HC also suspended recovery of 50% of the total fine imposed on the dera chief and other accused by the trial court but ordered them to pay the remaining 50% of the fine as compensation to the victim’s family. “Matter heard and admitted. Recovery of 50% fine shall remain suspended during the pendency of appeal as the remaining 50% is to be paid as compensation to the legal representatives/dependants of victim/deceased Ranjit Singh,’ the HC division bench comprising Justice Augustine George Masih and Justice Sandeep Maoudgil ordered. On October 18, the special CBI court in Panchkula had awarded life imprisonment to Gurmeet and four others — Avtar Singh, Krishan Lal, Jasbir Singh and Sabdil Singh. One of the accused died during the trial. The CBI judge had also slapped a fine of Rs 31 lakh on the dera chief, Rs 1.50 lakh on Sabdil, Rs 1.25 lakh each on Jasbir and Krishan and Rs 75,000 on Avtar. Ranjit was shot in 2002 on the directions of the dera chief for his suspected role in the circulation of an anonymous letter regarding sexual exploitation of women by the dera head. In its detailed verdict passed in October, the CBI court, Panchkula, had held that there is no doubt that it was the dera chief, who was feeling aggrieved by the circulation of the anonymous letter in question wherein severe allegations of sexual exploitation of sadhvis of the sect were levelled against him only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-admits-dera-chiefs-plea-for-hearing-against-conviction-in-ranjit-singh-murder-case/articleshow/88400118.cms||---

Maharashtra added 544 cases and four deaths-the lowest toll since three fatalities on April 1, 2020, while Mumbai added 191 cases and saw no deaths. It was the fourth time this month that the city reported zero deaths. Officials, however, attributed the decline to the dip in testing during the weekend. The total caseload of the state has risen to 66.5 lakh while the fatalities have touched 1,41,353. The four deaths reported on Monday came from Thane, Raigad, Pune and Sindhurdurg districts. Due to the increase in cases over the past few days, active cases in the state have seen an increase. There are a total of 7,093 active cases in the state, of which over 2,000 are in Mumbai. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid taskforce, said the focus should be zero Covid deaths and less severe cases. "All eyes are on Omicron now and how it will play out in Maharashtra, where Delta caused a huge second wave," he said. No new Omicron casesDr Joshi said Mumbai has been doing a good job in keeping Covid deaths and severe cases low, adding, "Now, people have to focus on masking and Covid-appropriate behaviour, while the state has to reach out to each unvaccinated person." Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer, said they have heightened surveillance and made several testing facilities available. "The moment people have symptoms, they must get tested," she said. On Omicron, Dr Gomare said the city has treated 23 confirmed cases but only 10 of them are Mumbai residents. "Most cases could be detected at the airport before they went home or mingled with families. Therefore, we didn't have many positive contacts," she said. Maharashtra's Omicron tally remained unchanged on Monday as no new cases were detected. The state has reported 54 cases till now of which 31 have already been discharged. State officials said drop in temperatures may lead to a rise in other ailments such as cold and cough and with year-end festivities, there is a need to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour is public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/four-covid-deaths-in-maharashtra-lowest-since-april-2020-no-fatalities-in-mumbai-again/articleshow/88400849.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Lifting Chandrapur liquor ban: Nagpurbench to hear PILs||Chandrapur: The bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice MS Karnik at the Bombay high court in Mumbai on Monday clubbed all the PILs filed by social workers and organizations challenging state government’s decision to repeal liquor ban in Chandrapur district and transferred the matter to its Nagpur bench. Liquor ban was imposed in Chandrapur district on April 1, 2015, based on the Sanjay Deotale committee recommendations. The state government repealed the ban vide a GR dated June 8, 2021, claiming that prohibition was a complete failure. The decision was based on report submitted by a committee headed by retired principal secretary Ramnath Jha. Social worker Dr Abhay Bang, former MLA Wamanrao Chatap, social activist Devaji Tofa had filed public interest litigations (PILs) in the high court challenging the revocation of the prohibition. Maharashtra Nashabandi Mandal, Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti, Vasudha Sardar of Pune district and Ranjana Gawande of Ahmednagar too had filed PILs in this regard. The petitioners had separately filed these PILs through Uday Varunjikar, Nitin Deshpande and Ashutosh Dharmadhikari. The pleas argue that Deotale committee as well as Jha committee had favoured the liquor ban in Chandrapur. Moreover, the petitioners termed it as “illegal” to repeal the prohibition when gram panchayats and gram sabhas across the district had passed resolutions seeking continuation of liquor ban in their areas. “Maharashtra government considered only financial gains while revoking the ban even as law and order, public health, domestic violence and rise in crime and accidents were at stake,” the petitioners argued.
