"He (Akhilesh) deliberately took the name of Jinnah. The remark was made during a programme organised on the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel (on October 31). He knew there would be some backward leaders from the Kurmi community. It was done to insult Patel and the backward community," Singh said, in an exclusive interview with TOI.  Singh's attack marks BJP's fresh attempt to thwart SP bid to consolidate the other backward classes (OBC), the community which holds the electoral key in the UP assembly elections due early next year. The BJP has been seeking to cement the backward bloc, which accounts for 40% of the electorate in poll-bound UP. Experts interpreted Singh's observation as the one to draw a contrast between the political interests of the backwards, specially non-Yadav OBC and the Muslims.  Singh also brushed off SP's endeavour to position itself squarely against the BJP as nothing but a "dream to attain power", which would "never come true" just through "minority appeasement". Citing the reported instance of meeting between Akhilesh and father of former JNU student Umar Khalid, Singh said that "politics of SP revolves around terrorism, SIMI and naxalism".  Khalid’s father, Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, who is the president of Welfare Party of India (WPI), had met Yadav on October 2. The WPI had announced support for the Samajwadi Party for the state assembly election.  Singh further hit out at the SP accusing it of running the government with the help of criminals and mafia. “One may ask any builder or a contractor, just a call from SP leaders would get them a work contract," the UP BJP boss charged.  Insisting that the gathbandhan of mafia and criminals has been "shattered" by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Singh said that most of the criminal leaders of SP are behind the bars. "This is happening for the first time that they are facing the heat. Else they have been enjoying all the privileges irrespective of whoever was in power," he observed.  Dismissing the large gathering in Akhilesh's ongoing Vijay Rath Yatra as mere "bheed bhaad (crowd)", Singh said that it is making the SP chief think that he is contesting for the "number one spot" in UP and will come back to power. "This is not going to happen because of the popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi," he said, maintaining that the BJP has taken care of all sections of society, including Dalits, poor, farmers, youth or women by implementing various public welfare schemes without discrimination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/akhilesh-compared-jinnah-with-sardar-patel-to-belittle-backwards-up-bjp-chief/articleshow/88079945.cms||Pankaj Shah

The banking system saw a net addition of 13,36,000 new credit cards in October, which is a monthly addition of 22 per cent, led by healthy traction by ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. This takes the total credit card base to 6.64 crore, a growth of 11.7 per cent annualised growth, which is the highest in the past 14 months, according to an analysis of the latest RBI data by brokerage Motilal Oswal. More significantly, monthly card spendings crossed the Rs 1-lakh-crore-mark for the first time at Rs 1,01,200 crore in the reporting month, aided by the festive season according to the report which also attributed the overall economic recovery and rising share of e-commerce transactions for the strong growth, and would keep spends buoyant as robust performance by SBI and ICICI is likely to continue, along with the strong HDFC recovery. While ICICI Bank was the largest issuer in the month, adding 26 per cent more or 2.78 lakh new customers in the month, followed by RBL Bank (16.7 per cent), IndusInd Bank (15.5 per cent), and SBI Card (14.5per cent) in October in percentage terms. In absolute terms, HDFC Bank came second issuing 2.58 lakh new cards followed by Axis Bank 2.20 lakh, SBI Card 1.84 lakh new cards and RBL Bank added 1.51 lakh new customers cards. On the other hand foreign players like Stanchart, Amex and Citi saw decline of 15,000, 6,000 and 6,000 in their card base. While the monthly card spend clipped at 26 per cent in October at Rs 1,01,200 crore on-month, the same grew by a whopping 56 per cent on-year and over 19 per cent on a two-year annual rate. When it comes to spends, Axis Bank clocked the highest growth rate of 36 per cent on-month in October, followed by HDFC Bank (32 per cent) and SBI Card (30 per cent), ICICI and Indusind saw a growth of 25, and 26 per cent, respectively, RBL 21 per cent and Citi and Amex 16, 18 per cent, respectively. While Stanchart grew 9 per cent, KMB declined 2 per cent. SBI Card and ICICI Bank added 47 bps and 205 bps annual increase in their market share in outstanding cards to 19.2 and 18 per cent, respectively in the month, followed by RBL, Indusind and Axis Bank, while HDFC Bank, Citi, Kotak, Stanchard, and Amex lost market share, with HDFC Bank losing the highest share by 256 bps. But on monthly basis, HDFC Bank saw a strong recovery with an incremental market share of 22 per cent and the same trend is likely to gain pace as the bank is aiming for a monthly incremental issuance of over 4 lakh cards. Spends per card rose due to an increase in ticket size and number of transactions. Monthly spends per card rose to Rs 15,200, from an average of Rs 10,700 crore over the past one year, which is higher than pre-pandemic levels. This was due to an increase in the ticket size to Rs 4,700 crore, the highest in the past many years, while the number of transactions per card too rose to 3.3 in October from 2.8 in September and 3.1 in March 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/credit-card-spends-jump-12-to-cross-rs-1-lakh-crore-mark-for-first-time/articleshow/88079847.cms||---
---||World||Israel confirms 7 cases of omicron, 27 others suspected||JERUSALEM: Israel's health ministry said Friday it has confirmed seven cases of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus, stoking fears of a pending surge in infections. Four of the confirmed cases are unvaccinated individuals who had recently returned from South Africa. The other three include two people who returned from South Africa and from Britain and who had received two doses and a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The third person returned from Malawi and had been inoculated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Israel was one of the first countries to close its borders to all non-Israeli citizens following the discovery of the first case of the omicron variant last week. Israelis from abroad are allowed to return home. The ministry said it has a ``high suspicion'' that another 27 identified cases of the coronavirus are also the new variant. Eight of them are individuals who had either traveled abroad or been in contact with a recent arrival who has tested positive for omicron. The rest could not be connected to foreign travel an indication the omicron variant could now be spreading within Israeli towns and cities. On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in conjunction with Israel's Ministry of Health drafted a set of new measures designed to fend off the spread of the omicron variant. These include fines of 2,500 shekels, or about $790, for returning Israeli travelers who fail to take a second PCR test, as well as an initiative to promote vaccination in schools and by local authorities. Israel had announced it would use the country's controversial phone tracking technology to help trace possible cases of the new coronavirus variant. That plan was however halted on Thursday, following widespread criticism that it would violate individuals' privacy rights. Israel, a country of over 9 million people, has reported 8,199 deaths from the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Most of its population over 6.3 million people has received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and more than 4 million Israelis have received a booster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/israel-confirms-7-cases-of-omicron-27-others-suspected/articleshow/88080011.cms||---
---||World||Vaccine makers can make Omicron-specific booster, says Fauci||WASHINGTON: Covid-19 vaccine makers have contingency plans to deal with the Omicron variant that include a combination vaccine against the original version and the variant as well as a variant-specific booster dose, a top United States health official said on Friday.  The US government is working with Moderna, Pfizer and J&J on multiple contingency plans, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told reporters at a White House briefing.  "One is to rev up the production of the vaccines that they already have. The next is to make, for example, a bivalent, where you have the vaccine against both the ancestral strain and the new variant, and the other is to make a variant-specific boost," said Fauci.  "They are now assuming they may have to do that and are being prepared for that," he added.  Data from a National Institutes of Health study strongly suggest that existing boosters provide cross protection against a number of variants, including Omicron, Fauci said.  "Although we haven't proven it yet, there's every reason to believe that if you get vaccinated and boosted that you would have at least some degree of cross protection, very likely against severe disease, even against the Omicron variant."  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with local authorities to investigate suspected cases of the Omicron variant in states other than those where cases have already been reported, Director Rochelle Walensky said at the briefing.  There have been cases of Omicron detected in about 40 countries, she said, but the Delta variant remains the dominant strain in the United States.  "I know that the news is focussed on Omicron. But we should remember that 99.9% of cases in the country right now are from the Delta variant. Delta continues to drive cases across the country, especially in those who are unvaccinated," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/vaccine-makers-can-make-omicron-specific-booster-says-fauci/articleshow/88080012.cms||---

---||World||Graduate student fatally stabbed, man wounded in NYC||NEW YORK: A Columbia University graduate student from Italy was fatally stabbed and another Italian man was wounded in separate attacks near the university's upper Manhattan campus, authorities said Friday.  The stabbing suspect was arrested in Central Park while menacing a man with a knife, police said in a news release.  The attacks started just before 11 pm Thursday when Davide Giri, 30, was stabbed in the stomach on Amsterdam Avenue near the Columbia campus, authorities said. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  Columbia president Lee Bollinger identified Giri, a student in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, as the victim in a campus-wide email Friday.  "This news is both unspeakably sad and deeply shocking, as it took place only steps from our campus," Bollinger wrote. "On behalf of the entire Columbia community, I send my deepest condolences to Davide's family."  A second stabbing victim, a 27-year-old man, was discovered about a dozen blocks to the south of the location where Giri was attacked, police said. The 27-year-old was taken to the same hospital and was in stable condition Friday, police said. Police did not release the second victim's name.  A 25-year-old man who fit the description that had been provided to police of the suspect in the two stabbings was arrested in Central Park several blocks from the location of the second stabbing while menacing a third man with a knife, police said. Charges against the suspect were pending Friday. His name was not immediately released.  Giri came to Columbia after studying at universities in Turin, Italy, and Chicago, according to his Columbia website.  The Italian foreign ministry said that both Giri and the surviving stabbing victim were Italian citizens. The ministry said in a statement that it was offering assistance to the wounded man and to Giri's family. The ministry did not indicate that Giri and the other man knew each other.  The Italian news agency ANSA said Giri was from the northwestern Piedmont city of Alba, and the local paper Gazzetta di Alba said he was an active volunteer for the Santa Margherita parish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/graduate-student-fatally-stabbed-man-wounded-in-nyc/articleshow/88080020.cms||---

Alert has been sounded and the matter is being verified,” said a police source. Meanwhile, similar long trails of blinking lights were seen along the LoC in parts of Rajouri and Poonch, and the international border in Jammu’s Akhnoor, triggering panic among residents who said it was the first time that they had witnessed something like this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/flying-objects-with-blinking-lights-seen-along-international-border-loc-in-jk-districts/articleshow/88080165.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Children orphaned by Covid in Kashmir are falling prey to adoption rackets run by dubious organisations that masquerade as charities and put up such kids for sale at prices ranging between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh each, J&K Police had said on Thursday after sealing the office of Global Welfare Charitable Trust, the unregistered NGO, and arresting two accused — Mohammad Amin Rather of Srinagar and Ajaz Ahmad Dar of Pampore. Speaking to reporters, Kamili said that police are ascertaining the background of the NGO in question. She admitted that ICPS was caught unawares in this particular case, although they worked really hard and were on the ground round-the-clock for the welfare and protection of children. “Unfortunately, no missing report about any child was registered and that is why we were caught unaware. Guardians, who sell their children for money, are also equally responsible like the unregistered NGO in question,” she said. Kamili claimed that the issue of “suspected organisations” was brought to the notice of the cyber police and the crime branch, but no action was taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/illegal-ngos-dealing-with-orphans-in-jk-to-be-penalized/articleshow/88080179.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Priyantha Kumara, in his 40s, had been working as operational manager at a private factory on Wazirabad Road in Sialkot, in Pakistan’s Punjab province, for the past seven years. According to the police, violence broke out after factory workers claimed that Kumara was seen tearing posters bearing the name of Prophet Muhammad and throwing it into a dustbin. “The victim was accused of desecrating Islamic stickers,” said Anwar Ghumman, a senior police officer. He said that the manager was lynched inside the factory. “Kumara allegedly tore a poster of the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in which Quranic verses were inscribed and threw it in the dustbin. The poster of the Islamist party was pasted on the wall adjoining the office of Kumara. A couple of factory workers saw him removing the poster and spread the word in the factory," PTI quoted a Pakistan Punjab police official as saying. Locals said as rumours that Kumara had committed blasphemy started spreading across the locality, a mob started gathering in the morning vowing to lynch the foreign national. Ishtiaq Hussain, a local resident, said that people from adjoining areas also joined the mob in the lynching. When the police arrived at the scene, Hussain said, the victim had already been “tortured to death” and his body was being set on fire. Videos shared on social media showed hundreds of men and young boys gathered at the site, with groups of them chanting Islamic slogans. Most of the people surrounding the burning corpse were seen recording it. Police said that video footage from inside the factory, where the torture took place, has been seized to identify the suspects and added that efforts to make arrests were underway. “Some people have already been arrested,” Ghumman said. Blasphemy charges are often enough to prompt mass violence in Pakistan. Observers claim such accusations are often aimed at settling personal scores in the conservative Muslim nation, especially against minorities. Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar said that “no one is allowed to take law in their hands”. “I am extremely shocked at the horrific Sialkot incident,” he posted on Twitter. “Rest assured, individuals involved in this inhuman act will not be spared,” he vowed. Human rights activist Hina Jilani said that such lynchings were quite frequent in Pakistan, “which should be alarming for the society and the state.” “There are several laws already but still there is no safeguard for the minorities and citizens, and unless the state does not formulate any social policy things will not get better,” she told reporters. Amnesty International said it was “deeply alarmed by the disturbing lynching and killing of a Sri Lankan factory manager in Sialkot, allegedly due to a blasphemy accusation”. The latest horrific incident comes days after an angry mob in the northwestern district of Charsadda, near Peshawar, set fire to a police station, police checkpoints and parked cars, demanding that the police hand over a man to them suspected of burning a copy of the Quran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/mob-in-pakistan-lynches-sri-lankan-citizen-over-alleged-blasphemy-burns-his-body/articleshow/88080201.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Later, the embassy in Serbia also claimed that its account was hacked and a “baseless” tweet posted on it from a device in Karachi. The tweets were subsequently deleted and an investigation was launched. The tweet from the embassy’s verified account stated: “With inflation breaking all previous records, how long do you expect @ImranKhanPTI that we (government) official will remain silent & keep working for you without been paid for past 3 months & our children been forced out of school due to non-payment of fees. Is this #NayaPakistan?” The tweet accompanied a video parodying Khan’s “Ghabrana nahin hai” (don’t worry) slogan. In a subsequent tweet, it said: “I am sorry (PM Imran Khan), am not left with another option.” The tweets provoked a storm on social media until the Foreign Office issued a statement. “The Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts of Pakistan’s embassy in Serbia have been hacked. Messages being posted on these accounts are not from the Embassy of Pakistan in Serbia.” The Foreign Office said someone in Karachi hacked into the account through a “desktop” and a “baseless” and factually incorrect “post was made regarding non-payment of salaries”. The embassy in Belgrade also made a similar statement, saying it was not responsible for the posts. Earlier this week, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed that inflation in the country rose up to 11.5% in November from 9.2%, the highest increase in the past 20 months influenced by a record hike in fuel prices in October. Massive depreciation of the Pakistani rupee fuelled import-led inflation. Prices of daily consumables have been rising consistently in urban and rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistans-serbia-embassy-twitter-handle-hacked-post-targets-imran/articleshow/88080258.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The move is part of a reform package announced by the government in September. "Bank guarantee (BG) of around Rs 4,000 crore has been released for Bharti Airtel and Rs 2,500 crore for Vodafone Idea (VIL). BG of around Rs 2,700 crore of Reliance Jio was released last month," a source told PTI. Email query sent to Bharti Airtel, VIL and Jio did not elicit any reply. DoT slashed performance and financial bank guarantee requirements of telecom operators by 80 per cent in October. Under the amended norms, telecom operators will be required to provide a performance BG of up to Rs 44 crore for each service for the telecom licence compared to Rs 220 crore mandated under the old rule. Similarly, telecom operators will need to provide a financial BG of maximum Rs 8.8 crore per circle now, against the previous requirement of Rs 44 crore. The rules will not be applicable in cases where BGs have been furnished due to any court order or are subject to any litigation, the licence amendment note said. The rules will not apply to telecom operators currently going through the liquidation process. The move will unblock the cash of telecom operators that they keep with banks to furnish BGs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dot-releases-bank-guarantee-of-around-rs-9200-crore-of-airtel-vil-jio/articleshow/88080035.cms||---

---||Business||Vodafone files application with govt for settlement of retro tax dispute||NEW DELHI: British telecom giant Vodafone on Friday said it has filed an application with Indian authorities for settlement of their retrospective tax dispute. Vodafone further said it has "always been confident" that no tax is due on the company. The government in August enacted a law to end all retrospective taxation imposed on indirect transfer of Indian assets. The rules under the law seek to withdraw tax demands made using a 2012 retrospective legislation to tax the indirect transfer of Indian assets and also refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest. Asked if the company has filed an application with the Indian government to settle the retrospective tax dispute, a Vodafone spokesperson said, "We can confirm we have filed an application". The spokesperson added, "We have always been confident that no tax liability arose in respect of our acquisition of the Indian business, and this was borne out by the decisions of the Supreme Court of India and the International Court of Arbitration. On October 13, the finance ministry notified a fresh set of rules to facilitate settlement of the retrospective tax dispute with British telecom giant Vodafone Plc. The 'Relaxation of Validation (Section 119 of the Finance Act, 2012) Rules, 2021', prescribed the forms and conditions for the declaration to be filed by the company for settling its case. Vodafone had 45 days to approach the government for a settlement -- a timeline which ended in November. Taxes were sought from the company by validating an October 2010 order of the I-T department that demanded Rs 11,218 crore in taxes from the British firm over its 2007 acquisition of Hutch-Essar through a deal in the Cayman Islands. The Supreme Court had in January 2012 quashed the tax demand but the same was sought to be revalidated through Section 119 in the Finance Act, 2012. A penalty of Rs 7,900 crore was also imposed on Vodafone. With this, as many as 15 companies against whom retrospective tax demands were raised have approached the government to settle cases. The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, enacted in August, scraps the tax rule that gave the tax department power to go 50 years back and slap capital gains levies wherever ownership had changed hands overseas but business assets were in India. The 2012 legislation was used to levy a cumulative of Rs 1.10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities, including UK telecom giant Vodafone. Last month, Cairn Energy Plc too approached the government to settle retro tax cases and gave required undertakings indemnifying the Indian government against future claims as well as agreeing to drop any legal proceedings anywhere in the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/vodafone-files-application-with-govt-for-settlement-of-retro-tax-dispute/articleshow/88080518.cms||---

He dispelled fears on the new coronavirus variant, saying the first thing he told himself once the symptoms manifested was to stay calm, get tested immediately, self-isolate and seek treatment. His wife and children too quarantined themselves at home. The doctor is now “absolutely fine” but is still in isolation at a hospital in Bengaluru as a precautionary measure. He told TOI that his symptoms included severe body ache, chills and a mild fever, but stressed he had no breathing difficulties and his oxygen saturation level was normal throughout. The body pain [myalgia] and mild fever began on the night of November 21. He gave swab samples for RAT and RT-PCR test at his hospital lab the next day. Both showed he had Covid-19. “I did not have a cold, cough or any breathing difficulty,” the doctor said. “The fever was at a maximum 100 degrees Fahrenheit.” Read AlsoBengaluru doctor with no travel history infected with Omicron, his 5 contacts test Covid-19 positiveA 46-year-old doctor from Bengaluru without travel history has been infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, raising concerns about its presence in the community. The doctor’s five contacts have also tested positive for Covid, and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing toThree days into home isolation, he experienced spells of dizziness, and with concern growing among his family, decided to get admitted in a private hospital. While his oxygen saturation level was 95, the fever had gone up to 101 degrees. An HRCT scan showed very minimal changes in the lungs, which is typical in a Covid patient with 3-4 days infection. “I was given a dose of monoclonal antibodies on November 25 and that made a lot of difference,” he said. “The next morning, I was absolutely normal with zero symptoms. I felt as though I had never had Covid at all.” A few days ago, virologists had apprehended that Omicron may not respond to monoclonal antibody therapy, also known as the cocktail treatment. While the doctor was in hospital, his wife, also a doctor, began showing the same symptoms, including body pain and chills on November 26. She tested positive for Covid the same day. The couple’s elder daughter was RAT positive, but she and her sister were later found RT-PCR negative. The doctor was discharged on November 29.

I have no symptoms now,” said the doctor, who was re-admitted to a designated hospital on Thursday after it was confirmed that he had been infected by the Omicron variant. His wife and children too are in the same hospital. The doctor said his younger daughter, aged five, thought they were going on a picnic when they were taken to the designated hospital, and had happily packed her books and bag. “The children may be exposed but they are asymptomatic and negative for Covid,” he said. Genomic sequencing reports of the doctor’s five positive contacts, including his wife, are pending. On Wednesday, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) conducted tests on the doctor’s extended family, including his parents and brother’s family who live in the same building.

I don’t know where I picked it up. We don’t know much about Omicron but going by my experience over the past 12 days, it does not seem serious and does not call for worry. However, one must remain cautious. Some people may require hospitalisation but it is not life-threatening.” The doctor couple said the infection may not have been severe since they are fully vaccinated. “One must follow precautions like using a mask and sanitising hands despite being vaccinated. Those who haven’t taken the shot must first get themselves vaccinated,” the doctor said, a point stressed by his wife too. They said their house being sealed was a bigger concern, especially since there are elderly people at home. “The stigma hurts more than Covid but we must follow government protocol. Our children can only attend online classes and their school authorities are aware of us testing positive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/absolutely-fine-says-omicron-infected-doctor/articleshow/88080413.cms||Sunitha Rao R

The recommendations are part of the Consortium’s weekly bulletin dated November 29. In its November 30 edition, TOI reported that the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) is considering recommending an additional dose to those who are immunocompromised or the elderly. Speaking in Parliament on Friday, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said a decision on booster doses and shots for kids will be taken on scientific advice. The decision on boosters, officials said, will be based on evidence of waning immunity — whether data warrants such a decision. Till then the focus will be on upping second dose coverage with 12 crore people overdue for the jab, which INSACOG has also underlined. NTAGI will further deliberate on the issue in a meeting next week and submit its proposal to the government. “Vaccination of all remaining unvaccinated at-risk people and consideration of a booster dose for those above 40 years of age, first targeting the most high-risk / high-exposure may be considered, since low levels of neutralising antibodies from current vaccines are unlikely to be sufficient to neutralise Omicron, although risk of severe disease is still likely to be reduced,” INSACOG said in its bulletin. INSACOG is a network of national testing labs set up by the government to monitor genomic variations in SARS-COV2. Demand of booster dose has been debated amid concerns over the new variant, which is expected to be far more infectious than the previous ones. The health ministry also maintains that while there is no evidence to suggest that existing vaccines do not work on Omicron, some of the mutations reported on the spike gene may decrease the efficacy of existing shots. Moreover, possible waning immunity in some people as well as with some particular vaccines may make them vulnerable to the new variant, which is seen as much more infectious. The World Health Organisation will also deliberate on the issue of booster dose on December 7 and may come up with a guidance. The government here maintains that it is keeping a “close watch” on the emerging scientific evidence and a decision will be taken based on expert advice. Besides, the government is also closely tracking the data to analyse trends such as severity of infection among new Covid-19 cases, especially those who are getting hospitalised even after vaccination, and deaths from the infection. “This will be crucial to ascertain the need for a booster dose in the country and if at all then to whom and when,” said an official. The INSACOG also said that genomic surveillance will be critical for early detection of the presence of this variant, to enable necessary public health measures. It also recommended monitoring travel to and from the known affected areas, and contact-tracing of Covid-19 cases with an epidemiological link to the affected areas has been implemented along with increased testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-consider-booster-dose-for-40-plus-age-group-say-genome-scientists/articleshow/88080550.cms||Sushmi Dey

The storm, expected to intensify into a severe cyclone for a good six hours on Saturday, is likely to make landfall near Puri in Odisha around Sunday noon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said once the cyclone moves close to the coast, it is likely to recurve north-northeastwards and move along the Odisha coast, hitting land close to Puri. Subsequently, 'Jawad' — a name given by Saudi Arabia as per standard protocol in the list of tropical cyclones — is likely to continue moving north-northeastwards along Odisha coast towards West Bengal, bringing heavy rainfall in the region. Read AlsoJawad to be first cyclone to hit Odisha in December in 130 yearsBHUBANESHWAR: If Cyclone Jawad hits Odisha coast on Sunday as predicted, it will be the first one to do so to the state in December in India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s nearly 130 years of recorded history. The coastal state has been hit by more than 100 cyclones since 1891, when IMD started“The cyclone would bring with it heavy to very heavy rainfall. Wind speeds ranging up to 90-100 kmph accompanied by tidal waves are expected. Accordingly, warnings have been issued in coastal areas where evacuation of people from low-lying areas is taking place. We have been constantly monitoring the situation," said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD. “Jawad is expected to be much less intense than other major cyclones in the region such as Titli (October, 2018), and nowhere near extreme ones such as Phailin (October, 2013), Fani (May, 2019) or Hudhud (October, 2014),” Mohapatra said. Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba on Friday chaired the second meeting of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) to review the preparedness of states and central agencies. He was informed that cyclone shelters had been readied and evacuation of people from the low-lying areas was being carried out. “All actions have been taken to stock food grains, drinking water and other essential supplies. Teams for maintenance and restoration of power, roads, water supply and other essential services have also been positioned. Harvesting of standing crops is also being done to minimise damages,” said an official statement. Meanwhile, NDRF has deployed 46 teams in the states that would be affected and kept an additional 18 teams on standby. A single NDRF team comprises 30 personnel who are equipped with necessary tools and gadgets for relief and rescue operations. “Rescue and relief teams of the Army and Navy along with ships and aircrafts are ready for deployment as required... The states were also advised to ensure uninterrupted functioning of Covid hospitals,” said the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cyclone-jawad-set-to-impact-andhra-pradesh-odisha-from-today/articleshow/88080587.cms||---

He started showing symptoms the very next day. As we have seen so far, the virus shows symptoms after at least 5-10 days of the incubation period. Maybe he was infected with the virus even before he attended the conference,” said an organiser of the 28th annual conference of the Indian College of Cardiology (ICC). Read AlsoBengaluru doctor with no travel history infected with Omicron, his 5 contacts test Covid-19 positiveA 46-year-old doctor from Bengaluru without travel history has been infected with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, raising concerns about its presence in the community. The doctor’s five contacts have also tested positive for Covid, and their samples have been sent for genomic sequencing toThe organiser said the gap between attending the conference and the doctor showing symptoms was less than 24 hours. “He may have been hosting the virus in his body while attending the conference,” the organiser said, adding that doctors are suspected to have compromised on wearing masks at a dinner at the ICC conference. Read Also‘Absolutely fine,’ says Omicron-infected doctorThe stigma of having his home sealed was more painful than the disease itself, says the 46-year-old doctor, one of the two patients in India infected with Omicron. He dispelled fears on the new coronavirus variant, saying the first thing he told himself once the symptoms manifested was to stay calm,“Five doctors from a hospital have tested positive for Covid, of whom three were found to be affected with Delta and one with Omicron. The genomic sequencing of the fifth doctor’s swab sample is awaited. At least three of them attended the conference but there were contacts for each and they’re overlapping,” said another senior doctor who attended the annual conference. The organiser said that not more than 60 healthcare workers attended the event physically and all international speakers had joined online. “As there were doctors involved, we were extremely careful. All participants were fully vaccinated,” said Dr BC Srinivas, organising secretary of the conference. The organisers said that 163 operation theatre staff of a hospital, some of whom attended the conference, and their colleagues and patients, have tested negative. “None have symptoms. We’ll also retest them. It’s already been 12 days since the conference got over. It is not a cluster but has to be seen only as isolated cases,” said organisers. However, according to health department authorities, the state government learnt about the conference only after the Omicron infection was known. “We still do not have confirmation if all of them attended the conference at the same time,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-doctors-meet-in-bengaluru-super-spreader-event/articleshow/88080646.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Hence, vaccines are expected to still offer protection against severe disease and, vaccination with the available vaccines is crucial. If eligible, but not vaccinated, one should get vaccinated,” the health ministry said. Though scale and magnitude of rise in cases as well as disease severity are still unclear, the government is hopeful that disease severity will be low in India due to the fast pace of vaccination and high exposure to the Delta variant as evidenced by high seropositivity. “However, scientific evidence is still evolving,” it said. “It is important to highlight that Omicron has been declared VoC (variant of concern) based on the observed mutations, their predicted features of increased transmission and immune evasion, and preliminary evidence of detrimental change in Covid-19 epidemiology, such as increased reinfections. The definitive evidence for increased remission and immune evasion is awaited,” it added. The government maintains that so far the rate of re-infections or breakthrough infections have been very low. It also underlined the need for full vaccination as there is still no evidence to suggest that existing vaccines are not effective against the new variant. Reports from South Africa suggest a jump in reinfections with the arrival of Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/omicron-will-spread-fast-says-government-hopes-it-will-be-milder/articleshow/88080742.cms||Sushmi Dey

Chakrabarty took charge after Sitaram Kunte retired three days back. A doctor who did not want to be identified said when the vaccination drive began, politicians, bureaucrats and doctors took the first shot to build public confidence in the vaccine. There is no record of how many senior officials are yet to be vaccinated, but those who have not taken the vaccine yet or have delayed it have mostly done so due to health reasons. When contacted, Chakrabarty told TOI that vaccination is a matter of individual choice. “I can take the vaccine anytime,” he said. “These are matters of individual choice or there could be other issues with health also. There is nothing like coercion in this,” he said. Till he took the Covaxin shot on Thursday, Chakrabarty was one of the 1.6 crore adults in Maharashtra who had not taken even one shot since the Covid vaccination drive began on January 16. At present, 45% of the state’s 91.4 million adult population is fully vaccinated. For the chief secretary, his immunisation status is important because vaccination is a requirement to attend the assembly’s winter session scheduled for later this month. Parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab has said that due to the Omicron threat the administration had decided to only allow fully vaccinated individuals along with an RT-PCR negative report to enter the Vidhan Bhavan premises. Most government offices in the state have a ‘fully vaccinated’ requirement for entry into the premises. A few days back, the state administration said that only fully vaccinated individuals could travel by public transport or enter public places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/10-months-on-chief-secretary-of-maharashtra-takes-his-first-shot/articleshow/88080789.cms||Malathy Iyer

In a letter to all states and UTs, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked all states to immediately act upon any uptick in cases and positivity. “Keep actively following up the number of cases, rate of testing and positivity district wise in all districts. Any uptick in cases and positivity must be immediately taken cognisance of and addressed through public health measures such as contact tracing, quarantining of contacts, isolation of those found positive and ensuring proper containment,” Bhushan said. The health ministry also asked states to send samples of all those who test positive for whole genome sequencing only to laboratories tagged to each state or UT in the INSACOG network. “Put in place a system to ensure that sample quality is good and transportation to INSACOG labs is quick. As already intimated, ideally no samples should be sent to any lab which is not part of the INSACOG network,” Bhushan said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/worried-by-covid-clusters-govt-asks-states-to-heighten-vigil/articleshow/88080829.cms||---

---||India||Supreme Court frowns upon ‘trend’ of acquittals in workplace sex misconduct cases on hyper-technical grounds||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday expressed concern over “a rising trend” of courts invalidating proceedings into sexual misconduct at working place on “hyper-technical” grounds saying that it would defeat the law and would turn judicial process into a punishment for the victim. “We implore courts to interpret service rules and statutory regulations governing the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace in a manner that metes out procedural and substantive justice to all the parties,” a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna said while seting aside the order of Calcutta High Court which had acquitted a BSF personnel from charge of commiting sodomy on his subordinate on the ground that the order of Commandant for preparing an additional RoE (Record of Evidence) was beyond jurisdiction. The HC had set aside an order passed by Summary Security Force Court which held him guilty. The apex court said that the approach of HC was “callous” in this case as there was sufficient evidence against the accused. It said that the HC was incorrect in its interpretation of the jurisdiction of the Commandant and the obligation of the SSFC to furnish reasons under the BSF Act. “...we would also like to highlight a rising trend of invalidation of proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct, on hyper-technical interpretations of the applicable service rules. For instance, the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act 2013 penalizes several misconducts of a sexual nature and imposes a mandate on all public and private organizations to create adequate mechanisms for redressal. However, the existence of transformative legislation may not come to the aid of persons aggrieved of sexual harassment if the appellate mechanisms turn the process into a punishment,” the bench said. “It is important that courts uphold the spirit of the right against sexual harassment, which is vested in all persons as a part of their right to life and right to dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is also important to be mindful of the power dynamics that are mired in sexual harassment at the workplace,” the bench said. The court said there was discrepancy regarding the date of occurrence in this case but it was minor in nature since the event occurred soon after midnight and on the next day. “Deeming such a trivial aspect to be of monumental relevance, while invalidating the entirety of the disciplinary proceedings against the respondent and reinstating him to his position renders the complainant‘s remedy at nought. The history of legal proceedings such as these is a major factor that contributes to the deterrence that civil and criminal mechanisms pose to persons aggrieved of sexual harassment,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-frowns-upon-trend-of-acquittals-in-workplace-sex-misconduct-cases-on-hyper-technical-grounds/articleshow/88080906.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Not just this, an amin (surveyor) had to be called to measure the area and demarcate the jurisdiction to resolve the issue. Bikramganj deputy superintendent of police Shashi Bhushan Prasad said the report of the unclaimed body was prepared jointly by the Natawar and Sanjhauli police stations, but after the amin’s report, a case was lodged with Sanjhauli police station. After getting the information from a resident of Dhantolia village, Natawar police station SHO Santosh Kumar reached the spot but refused to initiate legal procedure, pleading that the area was under the jurisdiction of neighbouring Sanjhauli police station. After spot verification, Sanjhauli SHO Dharmendra Kumar described the area under Natawar police station. As verbal duel followed, the Bikaramganj DSP was called. Later, Sanjhuli block circle officer was requested to provide an amin to decide the jurisdiction. The amin came with the map and after measurement, he declared that the body was lying under the Sanjhauli police station area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/body-lies-in-open-thanas-use-tapes-to-find-out-jurisdiction/articleshow/88080912.cms||Alok Chamaria

A senior officer explained that many state police were already overburdened with law and order duties and criminal investigations and lacked the resources and wherewithal to investigate significant drug seizure cases with pan-India and global linkages. “Since there is a specialized agency to conduct investigation into the larger organized crime, drugs syndicates with international reach and narco-terror angle, all that the NCB DG did was remind the states that NCB could always be entrusted the probe into these cases, if they deemed appropriate. The NCB DG’s letter in no way suggests that any narcotics case being probed by a state police will be taken up by the Central agency, if the state concerned is not willing,” the officer told TOI. Sources said the letter is not a “direction” but only an “advisory” or “reminder” to the states that NCB is there to carry out in-depth investigations into major narcotics cases. The letter written by NCB DG Satya Narayan Pradhan had, citing the Centre’s vision of ‘Nasha Mukt Bharat’ and the need for Central and state narcotics crime investigation agencies to work in close coordination, stressed that states may, if found appropriate and expedient, identify cases (preferably 3-5) having inter-state and international ramifications and consider handing them over to NCB to undertake the task of trying to unearth the entire network. “The identification of such cases may kindly be done on priority at the earliest,” Pradhan said while asking the states to furnish an action taken report to NCB so that MHA could further be apprised. The letter evoked a sharp reaction from Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik, who tweeted: "Motive and intention of NCB upon reading this letter appears questionable. Why are they trying to infringe upon the rights of the state government when there is no provision in NDPS Act to do so. Is there an ulterior motive. NCB must answer the citizens of India".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/in-advisory-ncb-asks-states-to-shift-some-cases-to-agency/articleshow/88080995.cms||Bharti Jain

The department's Civil Rights Division since President Joe Biden took office in January also has launched investigations into police practices in Minneapolis , Phoenix, Louisville and Kentucky, following protests in many US cities last year against racism and police brutality.  Kristen Clarke, assistant US attorney general for the civil-rights division, and Manhattan's US attorney Damian Williams announced the investigation into possible abuses by the city of Mount Vernon, which has a population of roughly 70,000, and its police department.  Clarke said investigators will look at evidence suggesting that Black residents are targeted for "abuse and excessive force", and that police supervisors may be teaching this targeting.  The inquiry, she said, was prompted by tips and publicly available information.  "We have received information about the repeated use of excessive force, often against individuals who are handcuffed," Clarke said. "Similarly, reports indicate that officers routinely conducted searches without sufficient legal basis, including strip searches."  A spokesperson for Mount Vernon said the city was preparing to issue a statement and hold a news conference on the matter. Biden has made the issue of racial justice a priority in the aftermath of the May 2020 police killing of a Black man named George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer who was later convicted of murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-government-opens-civil-rights-probe-into-police-practice-in-new-york-suburb/articleshow/88081033.cms||---
---||World||State Department employees' phone hacked by NSO Group: Source||WASHINGTON: The phones of 11 US State Department employees were hacked using technology from Israel's NSO Group, the world's most infamous hacker-for-hire company, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The employees were all located in Uganda and included some foreign service officers, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. Some local Ugandan employees of the department also appear to have been among the 11 hacked, the person said.  It was not known which individual or entity used NSO technology to hack into the accounts, or what information was sought.  News of the hacks, which were first reported by Reuters, comes a month after the US Commerce Department blacklisted NSO Group, limiting its ability to use US technology. And Apple sued NSO Group last week seeking to effectively shut down its hacking of all iPhones and other Apple products, calling the Israeli company "amoral 21st century mercenaries".  The State Department employees were hacked on their iPhones, the person familiar with the matter said.  NSO Group said in a statement that it had terminated the "relevant customers' access" to its hacking system, but did not say who the customers were. The company said its spying technology is blocked from hacking phones based in the US and only sells to licensed customers.  "NSO has no way to know who the targets of the customers are, as such, we were not and could not have been aware of this case," the company said.  In announcing the lawsuit, Apple sent out notifications globally to people whose iPhones were hacked with Pegasus in countries ranging from El Salvador to Poland. The targeted State Department employees were among them.  Apple declined comment Friday on the Uganda hacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/state-department-employees-phone-hacked-by-nso-group-source/articleshow/88081041.cms||---

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha has not received any reply from the government in response to its letter to the PM, where the Morcha had raised six key demands as a pre-condition for withdrawal of the farm movement,” said farmer unions in a statement on Friday. It said the permanent ‘morchas’ (protest sites) at dozens of places continue at Delhi borders and elsewhere, reflecting the discipline and determination that protesting farmers have. Referring to one of its six demands for the withdrawal of cases registered against the protesting farmers, the SKM said, “Hundreds of frivolous and false cases have been registered against thousands of farmers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farm-unions-to-take-call-today-on-next-move/articleshow/88081044.cms||---
---||India||Covid-19: Mandaviya criticises opposition on oxygen issue||NEW DELHI: Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Friday that the opposition parties should “stop playing politics” over oxygen shortage during the second wave of Covid-19 infections and focus instead on the efforts the government has made to strengthen the health infrastructure and ramp up production of oxygen to meet the surge in demand. Addressing Lok Sabha during Question Hour, Mandaviya said the government made “all possible efforts” to ensure the availability of oxygen and increased its production following a rise in demand during the second wave of the pandemic. In a replay of the political feud over the shortage of oxygen during the second wave, the minister also went on to ask the opposition to stop seeing the issue through the prism of political partisanship. “Sadly, even in such a situation, many people did not refrain from playing politics... I appeal, take note of our honest efforts. This is not a subject of politics,” he said in reply to a question on the issue raised by Congress MP Suresh Dhanorkar. Mandaviya also hit out at the opposition over claims about deaths due to oxygen shortage during that period, saying the Centre sought data from states and only Punjab replied saying there were four suspected cases of oxygen-related deaths. Probes into these are under way, he said. “I want to say that PM (Narendra Modi) had said at the chief ministers’ meeting that there was no need to hide the number of deaths due to oxygen shortage. It (numbers) should be reported,” he said. The health minister said the Centre wrote to states thrice to demand this information. “A total of 19 states responded and it’s only Punjab which stated in writing that four suspected deaths were there (in the state) and that too being investigated. We made it public. Still, politics is happening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-mandaviya-criticises-opposition-on-oxygen-issue/articleshow/88081094.cms||---

Union minister and BJP’s in-charge for Punjab Gajendra Singh Shekhawat welcomed them into the party and said that their induction will further strengthen the organisation in the state. Virk, former chairman of Punjab cooperative bank Avtar Singh Zira, industrialist Harcharan Singh Ranauta and former SAD member Sarabjit Singh Makkar were among those who joined BJP. Several noted personalities from Punjab have joined the party in the past few days and some more are expected to join the party. SAD functionary Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who had organised the farmers’ protests in New Delhi and other nearby places, joined the saffron party two days back. After joining, Makkar said he had announced earlier that the day the three contentious farm laws were withdrawn, he will join BJP. “I have joined the party as I had promised earlier,” Makkar said. Virk said he was inspired to join BJP over the policies and functioning of the Narendra Modi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ex-dgp-former-sad-neta-industrialist-join-bjp-before-punjab-polls/articleshow/88081125.cms||---

The government takes sovereign decisions based on threat perception, operational and technological aspects to keep the armed forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges,” junior defence minister Ajay Bhatt told Lok Sabha. “The S-400 missile is a potent system in terms of its operational capability to provide a continuous and effective air defence system to a very large area. With the induction of this system, air defence capability of the nation will be significantly enhanced,” he added. India has now begun to get initial deliveries of the first S-400 squadron from Russia, which will be operational on the north-western sector early next year, as was reported by TOI. All five mobile squadrons of the highly-automated S-400 systems, under the $5.43 billion (Rs 40,000 crore) contract inked with Russia in 2018, will be progressively delivered by 2023. The S-400 system can detect, track and destroy incoming strategic bombers, jets, spy planes, ballistic missiles and drones at a range of 380-km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/induction-of-russian-s-400-missile-system-a-sovereign-decision-minister-tells-lok-sabha/articleshow/88081160.cms||---

Goyal’s remarks followed RS Chairman Venkaiah Naidu’s said: “I hope that all of us will work together to resolve the issues, if any, and I also suggest to the Leader of the House as well as the Leader of the Opposition and other leaders to sit together, discuss and find a way out for the smooth functioning of the House.” The issue came up in the House when RJD functionary Manoj Kumar Jha said that some BJP members “gatecrashed” the site in the Parliament complex where the suspended members are staging a sit-in. Goyal said the kind of provocative statements that are being made by the leaders of some of the parties whose members were present during the ugly scenes and the behaviour of members outside the House in the last few days only point to their endorsement of the “unruly” behaviour by the suspended members in the House during the last session. “I was approached by certain members of the opposition ... but broad parameters should be that, at least, as courtesy to the Chair and House, an apology is required, but they refused,” Goyal said. The Opposition has termed the suspension as “undemocratic” and in violation of all the Rules of Procedure” of the Upper House.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-reconciliation-sans-apology-piyush-goyal/articleshow/88081171.cms||---

Officers should be good team leaders who are concerned about the interests of their colleagues...only then can they take everyone along and bring about a change in the image of the police,” Shah told the 122 probationary officers of the 2020 Indian Police Service batch. Asking the young officers to not lose sight of basic policing, the home minister told them to make the police station the focus of their activities and the beat officer focus of their information. Shah said that only when an IPS officer understands the language, history and social structure of the state of his cadre well, can he discharge his duties well. Asking the officers to pay attention to issues related to the internal security of the country “in totality”, he stressed on the need for coordination at the national level without infringing upon the rights of the states and respecting the spirit of the Constitution to prevent crimes such as smuggling of fake currency, arms smuggling, and narcotics. Shah particularly asked the women officers to visit schools and interact regularly with the girl students so that the latter are also inspired to come forward and serve the country. He told the officers that under PM Narendra Modi, the Centre has been taking many steps to prevent and fight cyber crimes. Also, the government is emphasising on the use of forensic science in collaboration with the state governments, with efforts being made to set up mobile forensic laboratories in every district of the country. Applauding the work of the police and Central para-military forces during the Covid-19 pandemic, Shah said it had changed the attitude of the people towards the police. “We need to take this forward,” he suggested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rise-above-why-should-i-care-attitude-amit-shah-tells-ips-probationers/articleshow/88081191.cms||Bharti Jain
---||World||Russia registers record for virus-linked deaths in October||MOSCOW: Russia's state statistics agency says that 74,893 people with Covid-19 died in October — the highest monthly tally in the pandemic that comes as the country grappling with a major surge of coronavirus infections and deaths. A report by Rosstat on Friday brought the overall number of virus-linked deaths between April 2020 and October 2021 to over 537,000 — almost twice the widely-cited toll reported by Russia's state coronavirus task force to date. Rosstat uses broader criteria in its tallying system than the task force. According to the report, out of nearly 75,000 deaths in October, 58,822 were directly caused by confirmed Covid-19; 9,912 other deaths were likely caused by the virus, but it wasn't confirmed by a test. In 1,141 cases, the virus “significantly” contributed to fatal complications of other diseases, and 5,018 people tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, who also heads the task force, said Friday that Russia's overall mortality grew by 20.3% in October this year, compared to the same period in 2020, and ascribed all of the growth to Covid-19. Russia in recent months has faced its deadliest and largest surge of coronavirus cases, with officially reported infections and deaths regularly hitting all-time highs and only slowing in the past couple of weeks. The surge came amid low vaccination rates and poor compliance with public health measures, and more regions this week have made Covid-19 shots mandatory for residents aged 60 and over in an effort to boost vaccine uptake and keep contagion and fatalities down. Authorities in the northern region of Komi said Friday that people in that age group are required to get fully vaccinated by Feb. 1. The Omsk region in Siberia introduced a more stringent timeline Thursday that obligates those 60 and above to get their first vaccine dose by Dec. 24 and their second dose by Jan. 15. Several other regions, including Lipetsk, Kurgan and the city of St. Petersburg, adopted similar mandates in recent weeks. Dozens of regions also imposed vaccine mandates for certain categories of essential workers. About 40% of Russia's nearly 146 million people have been fully vaccinated, even though the country approved a domestically developed Covid-19 vaccine — Sputnik V — months before most of the world. Two people who returned to Russia from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid-19 and their test samples are being studied to determine whether they have the new omicron variant, Russian authorities said. The two have been hospitalised, Russia's public health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said in a statement. It wasn't immediately clear whether their condition required hospital care or they were admitted to a hospital for additional testing because of the variant. Russia restricted entry for all foreigners travelling from countries in Southern Africa and required all Russian nationals returning from South Africa or neighbouring countries as of Thursday to quarantine for 14 days because of the the omicron variant, which was first reported by scientists in South Africa. Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart coronavirus vaccines. Russia on Friday reported 32,930 new cases and 1,217 deaths. The coronavirus task force has reported a total of over 9.7 million confirmed infections and 278,857 deaths in the pandemic — a fatality toll much lower than that of Rosstat, which is yet to release data for the month November that is likely to make the toll even higher. Russian officials have ascribed the differences in reporting death tallies to the fact that the task force only includes deaths for which Covid-19 was the main cause, and uses data from medical facilities. Rosstat uses broader criteria for counting virus-related deaths and takes its numbers from civil registry offices where registering a death is finalised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/russia-registers-record-for-virus-linked-deaths-in-october/articleshow/88081316.cms||---
---||Business||Government seeks House nod for extra Rs 3.7 lakh crore spending||NEW DELHI: The Centre on Friday sought parliamentary approval for additional spending of over Rs 3.7 lakh crore, involving a net cash outgo of close to Rs 3 lakh crore. Air India will be biggest cash guzzler with close to Rs 67,000 crore earmarked towards it. The second supplementary demand for grants tabled in Parliament has proposed over Rs 62,000 crore for equity infusion in Air India Assets Holding Company for repayment of past borrowings, guarantees and lease rental as part of the clean up exercise along with the disinvestment of the national carrier. Another Rs 2,600 crore has been proposed for loans and advances to Air India for recouping loans from the Contingency Fund of India. And, Rs 2,111 crore is planned to be earmarked for taking care of medical benefits of employees, operations, and to cover cash losses. Apart from Air India, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has also proposed additional spending of Rs 58,430 crore towards fertiliser subsidy, which the government had announced earlier. Another Rs 53,122 crore has been earmarked for clearing the dues of exporters, which was again announced earlier but budgetary provision had not been made. Similarly, close to Rs 50,000 crore is meant for expenditure towards various schemes of food storage and warehousing. While tax revenues have been buoyant in recent months, both on the direct and indirect taxes side, the government is staring at a shortfall on the disinvestment front as some of the planned strategic sale transactions may not go through. If the current trend continues, the Centre will actually close the year with higher-than-budgeted tax collections. Higher spending, as some officials had warned, may blunt some of the revenue advantage although the government is trying to ensure that it sticks to the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% of GDP for the current year, even as some economists expect the target to be breached. “At end-October 2021, 52% of the full year expenditure target had been completed, and a portion of the higher than expected net cash outgo of Rs 3 trillion (Rs 3 lakh crore) in the second supplementary demand for grants will need to be absorbed through savings in other demands, to curtail the impact on the fiscal deficit. Nonetheless, there is near certainty that the fiscal deficit will exceed the budgeted Rs 15.1 trillion (Rs 15.1 lakh crore), despite our assessment that net tax revenues and RBI surplus transfer will together surpass the budget estimate by Rs. 1.7 trillion (Rs 1.7 lakh crore),” Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/government-seeks-house-nod-for-extra-rs-3-7-lakh-crore-spending/articleshow/88081351.cms||---
---||Business||Finance minister calls for global action in payment systems||NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday called for a “collective global action” for effective regulation of ever-changing technology and tech-driven payment systems, including cryptocurrency. So far, regulators are only “catching-up” in regulating ever-evolving technology and hence there is no one point formula with which it can be regulated, she said. The minister’s comments at an event came amid the govenrment’s plan to introduce a bill to “prohibit private cryptocurreny, while providing for certain exceptions “to promote the underlying technology” and “its uses”. The legislation, which has been in the works for several months, comes amid concerns of large investments flowing into digital currencies, without adequate safeguards or a regulatory framework and concerns over its possible misuse. “Even as we are thinking about at a national level, there should simultaneously be a global mechanism through which we are constantly monitoring the movement of technology, so that whether it is your cryptocurrency, whether it is tech-driven payment system, data privacy, whether it is ensuring that data is used ethically... When you are looking at data as one of the revenue generating options, to regulate it will have to be a collective effort,” Sitharaman said. Speaking at the InFinity Forum 2021, she said technology respects no physical borders and has the power to sweep through borders. “... It means that global action is the only way with which you can regulate effectively.” Recently, PM Narendra Modi had also called upon all democratic nations to work together on cryptocurrency and bitcoin to ensure that it does not end up in wrong hands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finance-minister-calls-for-global-action-in-payment-systems/articleshow/88081365.cms||---
---||Business||Gita Gopinath to be IMF’s first deputy MD||NEW DELHI: Gita Gopinath, chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has been named as the fund’s new first deputy managing director (FDMD) and will take over her new responsibility from January. In October, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva had announced that Gopinath, the fund’s first female chief economist and director of the research department, intends to leave in January 2022 and return to Harvard University’s economics department when her public service leave ends. Harvard University had extended Gopinath’s leave of absence on an exceptional basis by one year, which allowed her to serve as chief economist at the IMF for three years. “Especially, given that pandemic has led to an increase in scale and scope of macroeconomic challenges facing our member countries, I believe that Gita — universally recognised as one of the world’s leading macroeconomists — has precisely the expertise that we need for the FDMD role at this point,” Georgieva said, while announcing her appointment. “Indeed, her particular skill set — combined with her years of experience at the fund as chief economist —make her uniquely well qualified. She is the right person at the right time,” said Georgieva, a Bulgarian economist. Georgieva said under Gopinath’s leadership, IMF’s research department had gone from “strength to strength,” particularly highlighting its contributions in multilateral surveillance through The World Economic Outlook, a new analytical approach to help countries respond to international capital flows, and her recent work on a Pandemic Plan to end the Covid-19 crisis by setting targets to vaccinate the world at feasible cost. Gopinath said she was honoured and humbled to become IMF’s next FDMD. “As the pandemic continues its grip on us, work of the fund has never been more critical and international cooperation never more important. I am very thankful to Kristalina and the board for this opportunity, and so look forward to collaborating closely with all the incredibly brilliant and committed colleagues at the fund, working with whom has been an absolute privilege,” said Gopinath. Gopinath did her BA (Hons) in economics from Delhi’s Lady Shriram College and then MA from Delhi School of Economics and the University of Washington. A US national and overseas citizen of India, Gopinath’s research has been published in many top economics journals. Prior to her appointment as IMF chief economist, she was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics, in the economics department of Harvard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/gita-gopinath-to-be-imfs-first-deputy-md/articleshow/88081386.cms||---
---||Business||PM Modi for fintech revolution with security shield||NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for ensuring security, while pushing for a fintech revolution, while pitching GIFT City as a hub for “ideas, innovation and investment”. “Fintech industry has achieved huge scale, and scale means people from all walks of life as customers. This fintech acceptability among the masses has a unique feature. That feature is trust. The common Indian has shown immense trust in our fintech ecosystem by embracing digital payments and such technologies! This trust is a responsibility. Trust means that you need to ensure that the interests of people are secured. Fintech innovation will be incomplete without fintech security innovation,” he said at the Infinity Forum organised by the International Financial Services Centre Authority, the unified regulator. The Modi government has been pushing for digital transactions and use of technology such as UPI, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation in 2016. “Technology is bringing a big shift in the world of finance. Last year, in India, mobile payments exceeded ATM cash withdrawals for the first time. Fully digital banks, without any physical branch offices, are already a reality and may become common-place in less than a decade,” Modi said, while pointing to the use of technology to achieve financial inclusion goals in India. He pitched India’s solutions, such as UPI, for use across the world and saidlow-cost options were possible. The PM said GIFT City, a project that houses the international financial centre, can offer the best financial services globally. “Financial inclusion is the driver of fintech revolution. Fintech is resting on 4 pillars: Income, investments, insurance, and institutional credit. When income grows, investment becomes possible. Insurance coverage enables greater risk taking ability and investments. Institutional credit gives wings for expansion. And we have worked on each of these pillars. When all these factors come together, you suddenly find so many more people participating in the financial sector. The large base becomes the perfect springboard for fintech innovations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pm-modi-for-fintech-revolution-with-security-shield/articleshow/88081391.cms||---
---||Business||November services activity’s rise second fastest in a decade||NEW DELHI: Activity in the country’s crucial services sector rose at its second-fastest pace in over a decade in November on the back of new orders but price pressures remained a worry in the months ahead, a survey showed on Friday. Posting a reading of 58.1 in November, marginally lower from 58.4 in October, the India Services Business Activity Index pointed to the second-fastest rise in output since July 2011. According to monitored companies, the upturn reflected sustained increases in new work and ongoing improvements in market conditions, the survey results showed. The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction. The survey is compiled from responses to questionnaires sent to 400 service sector companies in the country. The latest data comes close on the heels of numbers which showed the country’s economy grew 8.4% in the September quarter, the fastest growth recorded by a major economy. Industry, services and the farm sector provided strength to the economic recovery that began after the curbs were lifted across the country. “The recovery of the Indian services sector was extended to November, with a robust improvement in sales enabling the second-fastest rise in business activity in nearly ten-and-a-half years. Companies were somewhat convinced that output levels would continue to increase in the year ahead, but worries regarding inflationary pressures weighed on confidence again,” said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit. “Looking at the manufacturing and service sectors combined, the results are even more encouraging and bode well for economic performance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021-22 so far,” said De Lima. Some economists expect the economy to grow in double digits in the current financial year that ends in March. Although business confidence improved to a three-month high in November, the overall level of positive sentiment was well below its long-run average. Some companies expect demand to continue to trend higher, but several others were worried that elevated inflation could dampen the recovery, the survey showed. Amid reports of higher fuel, labour, material, retail and transportation costs, average input prices among Indian services companies rose further in November. The overall rate of inflation quickened from October and was the second-strongest in almost a decade, behind April, the survey results showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/november-services-activitys-rise-second-fastest-in-a-decade/articleshow/88081412.cms||---
---||World||Baldwin says does not feel guilt over 'Rust' death; prosecutor may raise criminal charge in shooting||LOS ANGELES/TAOS: Actor Alec Baldwin said he does not feel guilty for the death of choreographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of his Western movie "Rust" when he mistakenly fired a gun, even as a New Mexico prosecutor on Friday raised the possibility of criminal charges in the shooting incident. Baldwin explained that he started cocking the gun that killed the cinematographer but did not pull the trigger.  "I feel that someone is responsible for what happened and I can't say who that is. But I know it's not me," the US actor told ABC in his first major interview since the on-set tragedy in New Mexico in October.  "I mean, I honest to God, if I felt that I was responsible, I might have killed myself," he said in the interview broadcast Thursday.  Baldwin was rehearsing a scene on the low-budget Western when the Colt .45 he was brandishing discharged a live round that struck Hutchins and director Joel Souza, who survived.  The former "30 Rock" star said the criminal investigation should focus on discovering who had brought live rounds onto the set of "Rust".  "I don't have anything to hide," he said.  Describing the incident in detail, Baldwin said he had been told the gun was "cold" -- industry lingo for a firearm containing no live ammunition -- and had been instructed by Hutchins to point the gun in her direction as she prepared to film the scene.  "I let go of the hammer. Bang. The gun goes off," he said.  "Everyone is horrified. They're shocked. It's loud. They don't have their earplugs in... the gun was supposed to be empty. I was told I was handed an empty gun."  Baldwin said he initially thought Hutchins may have fainted or had a heart attack, and was only told she had been killed with a live round hours later following a lengthy police interview.  He dismissed suggestions that live rounds may have been introduced on set as an act of sabotage, saying it was "overwhelmingly likely that it was an accident".  Baldwin, along with other people working on "Rust", is facing two civil lawsuits, while prosecutors have refused to rule out criminal charges.  He said he would be "stunned" if Hutchins' husband did not also file a lawsuit against producers, including himself. Meanwhile, a New Mexico district attorney said on Friday that some of the people who handled guns on the set of Western movie "Rust" may face criminal charges. "Everyone involved in the handling and use of firearms on the set had a duty to behave in a manner such that the safety of others was protected," New Mexico First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said in a statement. "Certain individuals may be criminally culpable for his/her actions and/or inactions on the set of Rust," she said, adding that she had yet to make a decision on charges. The tragedy has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, and led to calls for guns to be permanently banned from sets. Baldwin said he had been called a "murderer" since the incident, but disputed claims from some critics that it was an actor's responsibility to check weapons. But, he said, the tragedy had changed things for him. "I can't imagine I'd ever do a movie that had a gun in it again," said Baldwin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/baldwin-says-does-not-feel-guilt-over-rust-death-prosecutor-may-raise-criminal-charge-in-shooting/articleshow/88081481.cms||---

Ambani, who is also India’s wealthiest man, is a big believer in blockchain technology. “I believe in blockchain technology and this is different from cryptocurrency,” he said. “Blockchain is very important for a trust-based equitable society.” Ambani further said: “We are witnessing the fourth revolution – that is the digital-first revolution, where digital will be life for billions of people – which will be used in all technology – five or six kinds of technology will merge together, they will transform the whole world."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mukesh-ambani-backs-privacy-cryptocurrency-bills/articleshow/88081485.cms||---
---||Business||Companies’ payments banks can’t turn into SFBs||MUMBAI: Payments banks promoted by corporates will not be eligible to seek a transition to a small finance bank with the Reserve Bank of India not accepting the internal working group proposal on bank licenses for corporates. Of the payments banks that are already licensed, Airtel Payments Bank and Jio Payments Banks are promoted by corporates. These are the only two payments banks of the 11 that were granted approval that continue to function. Aditya Birla Payments Bank had surrendered its licence in 2019 others including Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi had dropped their plans earlier. This would mean that small finance banks would have to come from the NBFC microfinance segment or cooperative banks that choose to convert themselves into small finance banks. Most of the small finance banks operating today were largely converted from microfinance companies or non-banking finance companies engaged in small loans. Among the non-corporate promoted payments banks, Paytm PB and Fino PB have indicated that they would pursue an SFB licence if the opportunity arises. RBI’s internal working group on bank ownership had said that small finance banks would be considered for transitioning into a universal bank provided they meet the minimum paid-up capital and net worth requirement applicable to universal banks. SFBs are considered to have a better business model compared to payments banks as they can lend and issue credit cards. They also do not face any geographic or size restrictions, unlike cooperative banks. However, they do face restrictions in extending large loans to corporate houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/companies-payments-banks-cant-turn-into-sfbs/articleshow/88081510.cms||---

The HC invoked suo motu powers to protect the interest of litigants who are unable to move the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) here against orders passed by DRTs as the former has been headless since September 15. Consequently, they either approach the high court for judicial review or are stuck without a remedy. A bank and a company had moved the HC to direct the Centre to appoint a chairperson to DRAT immediately. The HC was hearing petitions filed by Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait vs Union of India. Counsel Madhur Rai sought directions to the central government to appoint a chairperson for DRAT-Mumbai or to direct any other DRAT to decide its appeal. The HC also took up a petition filed by the government-owned enterprise MSTC vs Standard Chartered Bank. MSTC counsel Birendra Saraf also sought a stay of the recovery proceedings against it, seeking directions to the Centre to immediately appoint the chairperson of DRAT-Mumbai. The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik, said, “Allowing recovery processes to continue without providing an effective remedy of appeal, particularly when the SARFAESI Act empowers secured creditors to take possession of secured assets without orders of the court, would result in desecration of legal system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-stays-drt-orders-due-to-headless-appellate-body/articleshow/88081552.cms||Swati Deshpande

He said that while banks have been caught napping, policymakers also need to look at the issue from a financial stability point of view. Speaking at an event organized by India’s International Financial Services Centres Authority (Gift City) and Bloomberg, Kotak said that Indian banks have been behind the curve and have allowed the growth of UPI payments to monopolized by Google Pay and Walmart-owned Phone Pe who have got 85% of the market. “It is a wake-up call for Indian banking, wake up or you will see a large part of the financial market move out. From a policy and financial stability point of view which policymakers have to look at,” said Kotak. Kotak said that bankers were shortsighted in the last two years. “They said there is no money in payments and let the payment market be taken by these two-three companies.” Kotak said that bankers need to keep in mind that consumer tech companies have revenue models outside finance. “For example, the e-commerce model. Banks under section 6 of the Banking Regulation Act cannot get into non-financial business. There are serious issues of how we are going to draw the line and simultaneously there is an issue of financial stability,” said Kotak. The chief of the country’s third-largest private bank also made a reference to the raising of deposits by payment platform Google Pay and to the central bank’s move to ban first loss default guarantees provided by lending platforms. He said that there was a need to establish who was responsible for the deposits and who was bearing the risk on loan assets. According to Kotak, a competition between a regulated entity and a fintech or consumer tech usually ends up with the tech company being fast and loose on regulation and gaining market share at great speed. “I am not against competition, all I am saying in the name of competitive service we do not have a systemic and stability challenge at the same time,” he said He urged authorities to take Unified Payment Interface and the Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems global. He said that there is already a partnership with Singapore but there was a need to take this to other developing markets such as Bangladesh and African countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dominance-of-phonepe-and-gpay-wake-up-call-for-banks/articleshow/88081581.cms||---

---||World||IMF chief warns Omicron could slow global growth||WASHINGTON: The new Omicron variant of Covid-19 could slow the global economic recovery, just as the Delta strain did, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva said Friday.  "A new variant that may spread very rapidly can dent confidence and in that sense, we are likely to see some downgrades of our October projections for global growth," she said at a Reuters event.  In its most recent World Economic Outlook, the fund projected global growth of 5.9% this year and 4.9% in 2022, but the United States and other major economies suffered sharp downward revisions after the spread of the Delta variant "caused some friction", Georgieva said.  "Even before the arrival of this new variant, we were concerned that the recovery, while it continues, is losing somewhat momentum," the IMF chief said, noting that policymakers are now dealing with new issues like inflation.  The IMF's most-recent forecasts raised concerns that global supply chain issues and uneven distribution of vaccines were slowing the rebound, and causing some countries to be left behind.  A surge in demand in many advanced economies coupled with shortages of key components like semiconductors has fuelled a wave of prices increases.  Less than two months ago, Georgieva expressed confidence that inflation would not become a "runaway train" but on Friday she said the United States Federal Reserve will have to increase interest rates in 2022, rather than in 2023, as the IMF previously predicted.  The Fed, which cut the benchmark lending rate to zero in the early days of the pandemic, already has started to pull back on its stimulus measures and has signalled it will speed up that process, which would put it in position to lift rates off zero by midyear.  "We do believe that the path to policy rate increases may be walked faster," Georgieva said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/imf-chief-warns-omicron-could-slow-global-growth/articleshow/88081634.cms||---

A lot of businesses are trying to use space tech and space data for making their businesses better,” said Neha Satak, co-founder & CEO of Astrome, which has developed an innovative wireless product that gives fibre-like bandwidth at a fraction of the cost of fibre. “In the last few months, I have come across so many companies who are helping banks, insurance companies and other businesses to do better using space tech, and that’s kind of an inflection point which will make sure that the money keeps going into this industry,” she said at the Nasscom Product Conclave.Awes Ahmed, founder & CEO of Pixxel, which is trying to build a health monitor for the planet through a constellation of hyperspectral small satellites, said that in the initial stages, getting customers for space tech is not as easy as for a software startup, where there is a pool of people ready to use it. “So, the government has to become the initial consumer,” he said. Srinath Ravichandran, CEO of Agnikul, which is building launch vehicles, noted that a Japanese company called ALE is trying to do artificial meteor showers from space, “basically like going up and throwing a bunch of debris that on its way down burns up completely.” The company envisions staging sky shows for big events, such as Olympic Games opening ceremonies.

---||Bengaluru||Insurer denies bike accident claim; Bengalurean wins Rs 84,000||BENGALURU: After an insurer refused to grant his claim towards a motorcycle that was damaged in a crash, the owner approached a city consumer court complaining of deficiency in service. The forum recently ordered that the claim be cleared and a compensation of Rs 25,000 paid to the customer, besides other expenses. Sunkadakatte resident Jayaram Siddappa, 53, had purchased a Royal Enfield Classic motorcycle in 2016 and insured it with ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company from September 23, 2016 to September 22, 2019. On August 5, 2017, his motorcycle met with an accident and a case was registered by Malleswaram traffic police. With the motor vehicle insurance active at the time of the accident and his vehicle repair cost crossing Rs 54,000 as the chassis was damaged fully, Siddappa filed an insurance claim to cover the expenses. But much to his chagrin, ICICI Lombard refused to grant him any money despite a surveyor ascertaining the damage on behalf of the company; the vehicle’s insurance value at the time was Rs 93,513. After months of futile efforts, Siddappa approached the Bangalore Urban 2nd Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Shantinagar with a complaint against the insurance company for deficiency in service by denying a customer his rightful accident money claim. Firm: Complainant failed to pursue claim During the litigation that commenced on August 3, 2018, Siddappa’s lawyer presented the case, while the insurance company’s attorney claimed the complainant failed to pursue the accident claim and therefore it was treated as withdrawn and the case closed. Moreover, the insurance firm presented evidence in court through a person named Gundu, who the complainant’s lawyer alleged was unauthorised to appear on behalf of ICICI Lombard. The court proceedings lasted over three years. Judges of the forum noted that the surveyor had indeed ascertained damage to the motorcycle chassis following the accident and it was beyond repair. Despite this, the company refused to pay the owner his rightful claim, which amounted to deficiency in service. In their verdict pronounced on November 20, 2021, the judges ruled that the managing director and ICICI Lombard’s Bengaluru branch manager concerned must pay the customer Rs 54,355 towards his accident claim, Rs 25,000 as compensation for the trouble caused and Rs 5,000 towards court expenses. The payment must be made within 60 days of the court order, failing which it will attract interest, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/insurer-denies-bike-accident-claim-blurean-wins-84000/articleshow/88081749.cms||Petlee Peter

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Store blaze raises safety concerns as Commercial Street shrinks||BENGALURU: Commercial Street traders are worried that the modifications in redevelopment of the road by Bengaluru Smart City Ltd may have compromised safety. They say the widened pavements have eaten into the carriageway, making it difficult for emergency vehicles like fire tenders to enter the road. A fire that broke out in a store on the street on Thursday morning was a testimony to their fears. However, fire tenders could access the site as it was early in the day and there were no vehicles or people on the road. Aju Antony, a member of Bangalore Commercial Association, said: “The fire was a minor one and occurred before the street could get crowded. Considering the pavement is nearly five feet wide on each side, the number of shop owners who have extended their business to the footpath by putting up mannequins and other things has also gone up. Civil work is in progress so shoppers have to walk on the street and vehicles have to move on the very same carriageway. It would have been absolute chaos if the incident were to occur during peak business hours.” Members of the association believe that short circuits and minor fires are quite common in a market-like set up and fire tenders should have smooth access. “I believe shoppers didn’t face any inconvenience before Smart City work started. They have increased the width of the footpath, yet one can see shoppers walking on the road. When visitors park their vehicles on the street, it shrinks the carriageway further. Not allowing parking can’t be a solution. Where will shoppers park,” asked Anand Dadu, another member of the association. The pavements used to be half of what they are now. Anand further said, “We have explained this to the Smart City engineers several times. They say things are being done in keeping with Smart City rules. Earlier, they wanted to pedestrianise this street and possibly keeping that in mind, they went ahead with this design. Now that shoppers are parking on Commercial Street, pavement width needs to be reduced.” The association says even if one vehicle slows down for 20 seconds on the street now, traffic piles up behind because of the narrower carriageway. “Two fire tenders were pressed into service and they doused the blaze after nearly 30 minutes. We suspect short circuit behind the incident. No casualties were reported,” fire personnel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/store-blaze-raises-safety-concerns-as-comm-st-shrinks/articleshow/88081752.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

According to KS Layout police, Rajanna aka Raju, a resident of Talaghattapura, left behind a three-line suicide note where he said he is killing himself over financial problems that hit him during Covid-19. He said he was under pressure from three persons to return their money. Rajanna used to lend money for a monthly interest, run chit funds and was also into fabrication and welding. Police said that Rajanna came to his office around 7am. Later, one of his employees, who came work around 10am, found him hanging from the ceiling. According to sources, Rajanna’s customers stopped paying interest or returning the principle amount citing the pandemic situation. He also incurred losses in his chit fund business. Rajanna ended up borrowing money from a few acquaintances. His chit fund investors and lenders were after him asking him to return their money. Four days ago, three persons approached Central Crime Branch (CCB) officials, seeking their help to get back their money from Rajanna. CCB officials summoned Rajanna to their office and after preliminary inquiry, police told both the parties that there were no proper documents to confirm their transactions or prove the chit fund was legal. Hence, they were asked to settle the matter among themselves. On Thursday evening, the trio who had approached CCB met Rajanna near Talaghattapura. They allegedly abused and manhandled him in front of the public, following which he was said to be depressed. Rajanna lived with his wife and two daughters. A senior officer said that according to Rajanna’s wife, he was very disturbed on Thursday night. She counselled him and suggested he sell the house and clear the loans. Kumaraswamy Layout police have registered a case of abetment to suicide against the three persons named in the note.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/financier-in-covid-induced-crisis-hangs-himself-in-office/articleshow/88081753.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Pandemic a roadblock for social inclusion of disabled, say experts||BENGALURU: Joyal Biju, a 16-year-old foot and mouth artist of Guinness World Records fame, has been living with muscular dystrophy and is dependent on his special tutor for everyday learning. During the pandemic, things took a turn for the worse for the boy. With hardly any interaction with people, Joyal grew restless. Even though he found solace in his love for painting, the feeling of exclusion haunted him throughout the two years. It was but natural that Joyal, a resident of Wayanad, was excited to attend an event — Art ki Manzil: Inspire-Aspire — organised by ArtMantram, a non-profit organisation, in collaboration with Bangalore International Centre on Friday to mark International Day of Disabled Persons. His special tutor, Chandrika, told TOI that life is like a pandemic for him every day but the lockdowns took the exclusion to another level. “Events like these where he can show his talent are much needed now,” she said as Joyal held a paintbrush in his mouth and painted a beautiful picture of a sunset. Joyal has painted more than 2,000 pictures in the last three years and his work is even displayed at the Art Gallery of Kozhikode. Jija Madhavan Harisingh, former director general of police and managing trustee of ArtMantram, said the event helped introduce Joyal and kids like him to a regular social setting after months of isolation. “Inclusion should be in ways that will reduce their insecurities and up their confidence,” she said. Sarbani Mallick, founder director, Bubbles Centre for Autism, said the pandemic created an enormous roadblock in years of work towards the social inclusion of people with disabilities and now is the time to set things right. Mallick was one of the panellists at a discussion held at the event. Ride to raise awareness Fourth Wave Foundation organised On The Road to Inclusion — a ride by a group of bikers from Bengaluru to Hampi — to raise awareness for their Nanagu Shaale (school for me too) programme. It’s aim is the inclusion of children with disabilities into mainstream schools. The bikers started from Parle G toll gate at 5am to cover a distance of 343km in six to seven hours. The ride was inaugurated by Shubhajit Bhattacharya, who lost both his hands when he was 12 but went on to become a certified counsellor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pandemic-a-roadblock-for-social-inclusion-of-disabled-say-experts/articleshow/88081761.cms||Farheen Hussain

There was uncertainty over the Belagavi session with many appealing to the government to hold the winter session in Bengaluru, considering the risk of Covid. But the government didn’t change its stand because experts during the meeting opined that Omicron’s effect is not as severe as that of Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/belagavi-session-to-be-held-under-strict-covid-norms/articleshow/88081762.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: GST on garments, footwear set to go up from New Year||BENGALURU: All eyes are on chief minister Basavaraj Bommai as he heads a group of ministers on rate rationalisation in the hope that it will lower the Centre’s proposed 12% GST on readymade garments, textile materials and footwear. It’s a steep hike from the current 5%. The GST council in September decided to hike the GST on all types of apparel, textile goods and footwear costing up to Rs 1,000 from 5% to 12% effective January 1, 2022 and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on November 18 issued a notification about it. The objective is to eliminate discrepancy due to inverted duty structure, where the tax rate of raw materials is higher than the rate on finished goods. While currently manmade yarn and fibre have been taxed at 12%, readymade garments priced below Rs 1,000 are taxed at 5% creating a problem for a trader to avail input tax credit. The government wants to eliminate it by bringing in uniform tax rates. This results in higher price of merchandise and consumers from lower income groups bear the brunt. While the basic price of raw materials has already increased by about 25%, the hike in GST will further push up the price of readymade goods by 7%. For instance, the price of a branded or unbranded shirt being sold for Rs 700 has already jumped to Rs 875 plus 5% GST and the consumer will have to pay Rs 61.25 more from next month. “About 80% of consumers buy readymade garments and footwear pricing below Rs 1000 and they will be badly hit by the tax hike. The government can solve the problem by bringing all raw materials and finished goods under the uniform 5% slab. Hiking the rate to 12% is not the solution,” said BT Manohar, member, Karnataka state GST advisory committee. Bommai in September had written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sithraman requesting her to bring down GST rates on the entire gamut of textile materials and garments to 5%. Now, he heads the GoM on rate rationalisation and stakeholders expect him to follow up. “We hope Bommai will help the ailing textile industry by having the GoM recommend lower tax rates. We gave him a representation, explaining how taxing 5% will help boost the economy recovering from Covid-induced slowdown and increase the government’s revenue through improved tax compliance,” said trade activist Sajjan Raj Mehta, who recently led a delegation to meet the chief minister. The GoM mandated to submit its report to GST council slated to meet in December third week has met twice and will meet again shortly and finalise its recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gst-on-garments-footwearset-to-go-up-from-new-year/articleshow/88081818.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

She then reined in her groundstrokes after her opponent Akanksha Dileep Nitture drew level, finally coming through the last-eight clash 7-6 (4), 6-4. Yadlapalli, 22, who struggled as much with her right shoulder as with her opponent’s consistent craft and splendid use of court, spent nearly three-hours on in the middle to edge past Vaidehi Chaudhari 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4.Yadlapalli, who has been training at the Rohan Bopanna Tennis Academy in Bengaluru in recent weeks, has benefitted from her Hyderabad-based strength and conditioning trainer Srikanth Madapalli, who helped her regain fitness. Chaudhari, who relies on her consistency and court coverage, had just one winner in the tie-break, when she played a backhand behind Yadlapalli. The rest of the points came from her opponent’s errors. The fourth seed repaired determinedly after letting the opening set slip, she also needed the trainer on court midway through the second set. Yadlapalli, who is supported by the Go Sports Foundation, levelled the match with a volley winner on her fourth set point, having picked the ball off her shoe laces. Yadlapalli, who broke Chaudhari in the seventh game of the decider, held serves in the eighth and tenth games to close out the match.The other semifinal meeting will pit top-seeded Rutuja Bhosale against her friend and doubles partner Sowjanya Bavisetti, the third seed, who put out Korea’s So-Ra Lee 6-0, 6-4.Results: Singles (Indian unless mentioned; Quarterfinals): Rutuja Bhosale bt Prathyusha Rachapudi 6-0, 6-3; Sowjanya Bavisetti bt So-Ra Lee 6-0, 6-4; Pranjala Yadlapalli bt Vaidehi Chaudhari 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4; Shrivalli Rashmikaa Bhamidipaty bt Akanksha Dileep Nitture 7-6 (4), 6-4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pranjala-and-rashmikaa-storm-into-semifinals/articleshow/88081819.cms||---

The match, second of Saturday’s double header scheduled at 9.30pm, will be a stiff test for Bengaluru FC custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and the defenders, who have conceded six goals in three matches. Coach Marco Pezzaiuoli will also be hoping for an improved performance from India stars Sandhu and skipper Sunil Chhetri. Chhetri, substituted in the 62nd minute against Kerala Blasters, is yet to get on the scoresheet. “We are playing against the champions and that’s a big motivation for us as everybody wants to beat the champions. Mumbai are coming from two good games. They play a good pressing game and the wingers press very high. But as we saw against Hyderabad they also have weak points and we have to work on (exploiting) that,” the Bengaluru coach said. “We will have to be sharp in our duels and show more intensity in winning possession. Mumbai is a team that is fast in the transition as well,” the Italian added. Des Buckingham’s Mumbai will be looking for another win after decimating ATK Mohun Bagan 5-1 on Wednesday. The islanders, leading the standings with two wins in three matches and a better goal difference, will try to extend their stay on top by taming BFC who are languishing in the seventh place with four points from three matches. Hogging the spotlight would be Mumbai’s teenage striker Vikram Pratap Singh who netted twice against Bagan. The Chandigarh academy product has come through the ranks with impressive stints with India’s age-group teams and the 19-year-old looks primed to shine in the ISL.

She made another telling statement when she edged out in-form Varshaa Sanjeev, nearly half her age, to annex the National 6-red snooker title in Bhopal on Friday.In a battle of generations, the 44-year-old Vidya’s experience stood her in good stead in the title clash against her fellow Bengalurean as she prevailed in a tense affair 4-3 to claim her second 6-red National title. Vidya began in earnest, taking the first frame of the best-of-seven frame clash. But the 25-year-old Varshaa, who put out defending champion Amee Kamani in the quarters, fought back in style, taking the next two and threatening to run away with the match.Vidya then slowed down the pace of the game and didn’t give Varshaa any opening to level frame scores. But the younger rival forged again with percentage snooker. However, in her eagerness to close out the match, Varshaa committed a few errors to give her experience rival a look-in.Not looking a gift horse in the mouth, Vidya capitalised on Varshaa’s errors to win the next two frames with ease and with it the title.In the men’s final, S Shrikrishna of PSPB outclassed seasoned Manan Chandra 7-1 to emerge triumphant. In a lopsided contest, Chennai’s Shrikrishna jumped to a 5-0 lead, including two breaks of 69 and 71. Manan carved out a gritty 58 in the sixth frame to raise visions of a fightback. However, Shrikrishna snuffed out Manan’s hopes with runs of 33 and 33 in the next two frames to walk away with the title.Results: Men: Final: S Shrikrishna (PSPB) bt Manan Chandra (PSPB) 6-1 (49-10, 69 (69) -0, 50-4, 71 (71) -0, 48-8, 2-58, 33-24, 33-28); Semis: Manan bt Himanshu Jain (Tel) 6-5 (52-12, 25-13, 12-29, 0-50, 8-47, 16-29, 30-14, 51-22, 27-38, 39-22, 49-0); S Shrikrishna (PSPB) bt Vijay Nichani (TN) 6-4 (3-32, 55-0, 32-18, 21-34, 3-33, 53-0, 40-6, 42-9, 24-33, 58-0).Women: Final: Vidya Pillai (Kar) bt Varshaa Sanjeev (Kar) 4-3 (29-18, 19-31, 3-32, 33-29, 10-26, 26-7, 42-0).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vidya-wins-tense-battle/articleshow/88081822.cms||---

---||Dehradun||IFS assn approaches CM over selective transfers||Dehradun: To know the rationale behind selective transfers, members of the IFS association, Uttarakhand, approached the chief minister through the chief secretary SS Sandhu and the additional chief secretary Anand Bardhan for the very first time. After the lid was blown off the Corbett corruption scam recently, state government had transferred 30 state and central forest service officers. The mass transfers stirred up controversy due to alleged violation of rules and promotion of dented officers at sensitive locations. The five points that they flagged are – posting of non-cadre officials in cadre posts despite availability of sufficient IFS officers for those posts. The non-implementation of transfer list as approved by the Civil Services Board (CSB) has also been highlighted by the officials. A copy of their communication duly signed by their president, Kapil Lal, is with TOI. “As per the rule 7(3) of the Indian Forest Services Rules, 2014, the cadre post officer apart from promotion, retirement, deputation or two-month training has to serve at least 2 years at one location. But the rules while ordering mass transfers on November 25 were not complied with,” reads the communication. The fact that junior officers are being deployed at very senior posts has not been welcomed by the service rule book adhering officers. The communication reads, “Despite the presence of some senior officers in the department, a junior officer has been deployed. This step has demoralised the senior officers.” And, putting the IFS officers on state deputation without their consent has also been criticised in the communication while in the fifth which was the last point of the communication, the association has clearly shown disapproval to transfers of dented officers or those with questionably credentials to alluring posts. State government after sensing uproar among the forest officers about the latest transfers, sent 6 officers back to their previous locations. Incidentally, there are some officers who continue to remain in their locations for over four years too, raising questions on the transparency and credibility of the transfers of the IFS officers in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ifs-assn-approaches-cm-over-selective-transfers/articleshow/88096907.cms||Shivani Azad

The state occupies third place in terms of individual case numbers. As per data furnished by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, India had reported nearly 55,000 black fungus cases by November 29. Maharashtra leads the chart with 10,300 cases, while Andhra Pradesh recorded about 5,100 cases. About 2,800 surgeries under various categories have been performed on black fungus patients in the state. The Covid-associated mucormycosis emerged as a major challenge during the second wave in Andhra Pradesh. At the peak of the second wave, hundreds of cases surfaced every week. Considering the huge cost involved in the treatment, the state government added “post-Covid with mucormycosis management” under the Dr YSR Aarogyasri scheme. In the initial weeks, there was a short supply of Amphotericin B injection doses, which later eased. Corresponding with the improvement in daily case numbers of Covid-19, black fungus cases have reduced in Andhra Pradesh in the last few months. Director, Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr K Rambabu said the body’s immune system fights fungal infections, such as mucormycosis, in the normal course. “But factors like compromised immune system in some Covid-19 patients and medical conditions like uncontrolled diabetes would increase the risk of contracting mucormycosis infection. Those who recovered from Covid-19, particularly those with comorbidities, should monitor their health closely,” said Dr Rambabu. Under the Aarogyasri scheme, the Andhra Pradesh government has fixed a package of Rs 41,968 for the treatment of black fungus cases. This is apart from costs incurred on Amphotericin B and Posaconazole. Hospitals can raise additional pre-authorisation, if there is a need for additional surgical intervention for black fungus patients. For nasal involvement, which may need endoscopic sinus surgery, the package has been fixed at Rs 16,932. For orbital involvement, which may need procedures such as orbitotomy, surgical management of proptosis and exenteration of orbit, the maximum package has been fixed at Rs 50,000. Mucormycosis begins to manifest as a skin infection in the air pockets located behind the forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes and teeth. It then spreads to the eyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain. It leads to blackening or discoloration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-among-top-4-to-log-over-5k-mucor-cases/articleshow/88079700.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The government has pressed into service 774 rythu bharosa kendras (RBKs) to procure paddy from farmers in all 13 districts. While the AP State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd (Markfed) is procuring paddy in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts through the RBKs, the AP Civil Supplies Corporation is the procuring agency in the remaining districts. So far, according to officials, procurement has started in 123 of 664 mandals in the district. RBK staff across these mandals have procured one lakh metric tonnes of paddy by Friday noon, worth Rs 190 crore. Payments too are being made through the RBKs and the farmers will receive the money 21 days after procurement. Sources in the agriculture department say the RBKs have procured paddy from 8,285 farmers so far while payments have been made to around 2,000 farmers. “Every farmer would get the payment after 21 days of procurement. All they have to do is approach the procurement staff attached to the RBKs and register their names,” said a senior official with the agriculture department. Procurement and payments are linked to the Aadhaar numbers of farmers to avoid misappropriation at any level.  AP Civil Supplies Corporation is ahead of the Markfed in paddy procurement this time. Out of the 10 districts allotted to it, the corporation has procured the highest quantity of 52,735 metric tonnes in Nellore district, followed by 32,877 metric tonns in West Godavari district. Procurement in other districts is yet to pick up. However, recent cyclonic rains and the subsequent floods have halted the procurement process in the flood-affected districts of Nellore, Chittoor, Anantapur, Kadapa and Kurnool. In Krishna, Guntur and the two Godavari districts, the rains have caused discolouration of the paddy. The Civil Supplies Corporation officials are also worried about the moisture levels in the paddy and are working with the Centre to give relaxations in the light of the floods.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/state-to-speed-up-paddy-procurement/articleshow/88079717.cms||Gopi Dara

Contact tracing has reduced in the state with the number of Covid cases gradually decreasing over the past few months. Data till Thursday (December 2) shared by the public health department revealed that contact tracing had considerably gone down in 16 districts of the state. “Contact tracing will now be increased and we have directed officials to seek data of people who had undertaken international travel in the past month. We will then check for their contacts. The key aspect is not to panic. Reports from South Africa are stating that people testing positive for the Omicron variant of Covid have mild symptoms,” Tope told TOI. Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan also directed the states to be more vigilant in enforcing public health measures for containing the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tope-stresses-on-increased-surveillance-contact-tracing/articleshow/88080618.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Felicitating the toppers of Matriculation and Intermediate examinations of 2020 and 2021 at the Medha Diwas celebrations on the 137th birth anniversary of Prasad, Choudhary said he was not only a freedom fighter and great lawyer but also a brilliant student. The youths should learn a lesson from his life and try to be honest and simple in their day-to-day dealings. He said when the Constitution of India was being finalised, a question arose as to why there was no minimum educational qualification for the lawmakers (MPs, MLAs), when it was mandatory for bureaucracy, judiciary and all other professionals. Then Rajendra Babu, the chairman of the Constituent Assembly, remarked that the qualification of people’s representatives would be determined by the people themselves. Choudhary called upon the toppers to bear in mind that there is no alternative to merit and hard work for getting desired success in life. Altogether 198 students, who secured top positions in Matric and Intermediate examinations of 2020 and 2021 conducted by Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), were felicitated on the occasion. The district magistrates and district education officers of Araria, Banka, Khagaria, Nalanda, Patna, Purnia and Samastipur were also felicitated for remarkable performance of students from their respective districts. Education department additional chief secretary Sanjay Kumar called upon the students to get inspiration from the life and works of Rajendra Prasad and pursue their higher education with complete dedication. He said the book written by Prasad on Champaran Movement would soon be sent to all the district education officers so that they might be apprised of his style of writing and presenting the facts in a very simple language. Former vice-chancellor of JP University, Harikesh Singh, delivered a lecture on the life and works of Prasad. BSEB chairman Anand Kishor pointed out that for the last three years, the state board has been publishing the exam results much ahead of all other states in the country. BSEB has also introduced a number of co-curricular activities like crossword, quiz and Olympiad for the development of students’ personality, he said. Those who topped in Classes XII (science, arts and commerce streams) and X exams got a cash prize of Rs1 lakh each along with a laptop and kindle e-book reader. The second and third toppers of their streams were given Rs75,000 and Rs50,000 respetively. The winners of state-level quiz competition organised by the BSEB were also awarded on the occasion. Toppers who got Rs1 lakh each: Matric exam, 2021: Sandeep Kumar of Baldeva High School, Rohtas; Pooja Kumari and Shubhdarshini of Simultala High School, Jamui Matric exam, 2020 : Himanshu Raj of Janta High School, Rohtas Intermediate Exam, 2021 : Sonali Kumari of Parmeshwari Devi Girls Higher Secondary School, Biharsharif (Science), Sugandha Kumari of S N Sinha College, Aurangabad (Commerce); Madhu Bharti of R Lal College, Khagaria, and Kailash Kumar of Simultala School, Jamui (Arts) Intermediate Exam, 2020: Neha Kumari of Hazarilal +2 School, Gopalganj ( science); Kausar Fatma and Sudhanshu Narain Chaudhary of C M College, Darbhnaga ( commerce) and Sakshi Kumari of MRRG College, Bettiah (arts).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/matric-inter-exam-toppers-felicitated-on-medha-diwas/articleshow/88079081.cms||B K Mishra

When asked by Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha to give his version of the series of incidents, Jibesh said the two officers had turned up at his official residence on Thursday night and apologized for the incident. “I still think that what had happened (on Thursday) was wrong, reprehensible and an insult to the legislature. It was a matter that was not connected with either the government or the minister, but with the legislature,” Jibesh also said. He said after the CM convoy had passed, as many as 11-12 vehicles were allowed to pass, but his car was stopped twice, which he felt was “not right”. He thanked the Speaker for taking notice of the infringement of the legislature’s dignity. Earlier, when the House met, CPI(ML) member Mahboob Alam, along with others from the opposition benches, raised the issue. From the treasury benches, BJP member Gyanendra Singh Gyanoo said what had happened with the minister was wrong and action should be taken against the guilty persons, but the opposition members were wrong by gheraoing the Speaker during the budget session in March. “In the case of Jibesh, the opposition has been trying to take political advantage,” Gyanoo said, as a result of which the enraged opposition members shouted at him. Subsequently, the Speaker said the basic tenet of the functioning parliamentary democracy was mutual respect for the dignity of its three pillars – legislature, executive and judiciary – but the Constitution has given an edge to the legislature, because it is a lawmaking body. “The Constitution has also provided for protection to legislators, but all the stakeholders should also respect each other’s boundaries and limits,” he also said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minister-cools-down-after-dm-ssp-assure-action-against-cops/articleshow/88079150.cms||Abhay Singh

Nearly 70% of the works are complete. The road between the two parks having a total area of 6.28 acres, is being developed at a cost of Rs 12 crore. MSCL general manager Arun Prabha told TOI that the major works have been completed, and the focus is currently on landscaping, mechanical and electrical works. “The road will also flaunt murals, and though not part of the original project, the MSCL may take up development of the junction near Nanthoor, keeping in mind the overall decor. Once the works are completed, the area is expected to grow as one of the most popular destinations in the city, with all amenities. Opportunities will be created to generate revenue that will contribute towards the overall maintenance of the park by the Kadri Park Development Committee,” he said. The road has been divided into west, east and central pedestrian plaza, for the development of parking spaces, pedestrian footpath, cycling tracks, leisure seating, shops, toilets, drinking water, yoga and exercise area, thus providing varied experiences of eateries and shopping establishments, exercise and play, recreation, leisure and events for residents. According to an estimate, the number of visitors to both parks is about 2,500-3,000 per day on weekdays, and about 4,600-5,000 on weekends. With the project, the parks will be combined into one large development of 23.7 acres, and will become the second-largest park after Pilikula. There are about 21 existing trees of medium girth on the roadside. It is being developed on the lines of Bengaluru’s Cubbon Park.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/70-of-works-for-integrated-devpt-of-kadri-park-completed/articleshow/88079542.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Directives have already issued to police as well as administrative officials in this regard. “While mask checking drives will be conducted in market areas and other public places, officials have also been asked to see that people observe Covid appropriate behaviour at public places. Common people must cooperate in this regard as without their support the objective could not be fulfilled,” the DM said. He added: "Though, as of now no case of the new variant has been reported in the state, yet it is imperative that all preparations must be in place to counter any such threat.” Health officials have been asked to ensure that the three oxygen plants installed recently at Begusarai sadar hospital and the primary health centres at Teghra and Balia must be in operational mode latest by Sunday. “Keeping in view of the fact that the spread of the new variant is much faster than the previous ones, the PHCs in the district would soon have a minimum 15-bed separate Covid-dedicated ward with oxygen facility to avoid any untoward situation,” the DM added. “The Teghra PHC, which is already equipped with a 30-bed dedicated Covid facility with its own oxygen plant, has been asked to upgrade to 60-bed facility.” To keep a tab on the spread of the virus, a medical team under Teghra PHC is working in three shifts 24x7 near the main booking counter at Barauni junction to conduct RT- PCR and antigen tests on people coming from other states. Besides, those who have so far not got their vaccination dose are also being administered vaccines. Apart from this, all Asha workers under the district have been asked to keep a watch on people coming from other countries and inform their respective sub-divisional offices. Begusarai civil surgeon Pramod Kumar singh said more than 3.14 lakh people are due for their second dose of vaccination under the district. “A special drive will be carried out on Saturday. For this, as many as 600 teams of health workers across various blocks will work to meet the target ,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/begusarai-district-admn-on-alert/articleshow/88079068.cms||---

The details of the search went viral on social media creating a flutter in the city’s business circles. The search at the leading realty group at a time when the sector in the state is reeling under slowdown for the past several months sent shockwaves among realtors. Taxmen from other centres of the state too have joined in the search being underway at least on 25 locations of multiple firms and transactions and records of various partners of these firms are being examined. Senior I-T officials, however, refused to comment about the search claiming that they are not authorised or permitted to share details with the media. Meanwhile, various realty and jewellery firms of the city who have business terms with the groups under search were worried over possible inquiry at their premises too. The groups that are facing search have widespread realty and jewellery businesses spread across the south Gujarat and other parts of state. Owners of the realty firm were top office bearers of CREDAI as well in the past. It is suspected that the realty and jewellery group have entered in some major transactions in the past few months that were under investigation and the search may be to gather more details of those dealings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/i-t-searches-on-realty-jewellery-groups/articleshow/88079583.cms||---

The Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited (KDCMPUL) has launched a mobile semen sorting laboratory through which farmers will get sex-sorted semen for artificial insemination of cows and buffaloes at highly subsidised rates. The technology separates male sperms from spermatozoa leading to 90% chance of the animal delivering a female calf. The idea is to control the birth rate of male calves that are no longer in use as much as earlier. Amul Dairy has roped in ST Genetics India, a subsidiary of US-based Sexing Technologies (ST) for this technical segregation process. “Globally, there are two players engaged in the business of sorting and freezing bovine semen into X (female) chromosome bearing and Y (male) chromosome bearing sperm populations. It is for the first time in the world that a mobile sorting laboratory is being used for this purpose,” said Amit Vyas, managing director of Amul Dairy. The mobile sorting lab, set up at a cost of Rs 25 crore by the US firm, currently stationed at Amul’s Ode farm was inaugurated on Thursday in presence of Amul Dairy’s chairman Ramsinh Parmar, chairman of the National Dairy Development Board Meenesh Shah and managing director of Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation, R S Sodhi. “This will prove to be a game-changer. With the help of this mobile lab, we will take the best semen of the high-genetic bulls from our Ode farm, they will be sorted out there itself and distributed to farmers so that they get semen of high-genetic bulls that can be used for artificial insemination to produce only female calves,” he said. Further, the dairy will be using ova of high-genetic females developed using embryo transplant at Mogar farm. “In future, we want to replace artificial insemination with embryo transplant. The goal is to double milk production through high-genetic, high milk yielding cows and buffaloes,” he said. “If a farmer currently keeps 10 animals and procures 100 litres of milk from them, with this process they will procure 150 litres of milk by keeping just five animals,” he said. At Ode semen station, Amul has eight breeds of cows and two breeds of buffaloes. In 2017, the dairy became the country’s first milk union to launch its own brand of frozen semen branded as ‘Amul Novo Genes’. Last year, it sold 5.5 million doses of frozen semen to government, private and co-operatives outside its milk shed areas including exports. Normally, male calves constitute 60% of the total deliveries in bovines done through artificial insemination. In October last year, the dairy launched sex-sorted semen project through which 30,000 plus doses were distributed to its village-level mandalis. “So far, more than 1,000 calvings have been recorded, of which 92% are female calves,” said Dr Gopal Shukla, adding that the target is to double milk production in the next 5-6 years with high-yielding high-genetic cattle||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mobile-semen-laboratory-to-help-breed-female-calves/articleshow/88079369.cms||Prashant Rupera

The academic year was reportedly delayed due to the late announcement of sixth semester results. The results, which were supposed to be out by the second week of November, were delayed due to a glitch in the exam software and other reasons. Following the delay, MU extended the last date for the submission of completed applications of all PG programmes/ PG diplomas/ certificate programmes offered at its campus and other campuses in its jurisdiction multiple times (currently, it is extended till December 9). “With sixth semesters results announced a few days ago, we are now planning to go ahead as planned. There will be no further extensions, and the academic year is likely to commence in mid-December. A meeting on Saturday will decide on this,” said MU registrar Kishore Kumar C K. Sources in MU added that the university cannot start PG classes until and unless local students take admission to courses. Candidates from other universities have already applied for the courses as their results were announced some months ago. It was delayed only in MU, putting students’ academic/ career plans in a fix. “We have about 30-40% of PG admissions from candidates studied under MU, and the rest from other universities. The results of the final UG semester were out a few days ago. MU will not further delay to start the academic year,” said MU vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya. As per academic calendar of events, all PG courses under MU used to commence in August. However, the pandemic affected the calendar. “It is high time that MU maintains its academic calendar without troubling students.

He said that while banks have been caught napping, policymakers also need to look at the issue from a financial stability point of view. Speaking at an event organised by India’s International Financial Services Centres Authority and Bloomberg at GIFT City, Kotak said that Indian banks have been behind the curve and have allowed the growth of UPI payments to be monopolised by Google Pay and Walmart-owned PhonePe, who have got 85% of the market. “It is a wake-up call for Indian banking: Wake up, or you will see a large part of the financial market move out. From a policy and financial stability point of view, which policymakers have to look at,” said Kotak. He said that bankers were shortsighted in the last two years. “They said there is no money in payments and let the payment market be taken by these two-three companies.” Kotak said that bankers need to keep in mind that consumer tech companies have revenue models outside finance. “For example, the e-commerce model. Banks under section 6 of the Banking Regulation Act cannot get into non-financial business. There are serious issues of how we are going to draw the line and simultaneously there is an issue of financial stability,” said Kotak. The chief of the country’s third-largest private bank also made a reference to the raising of deposits by payment platform Google Pay and to the central bank’s move to ban first loss default guarantees provided by lending platforms. He said that there was a need to establish who was responsible for the deposits and who was bearing the risk on loan assets. According to Kotak, a competition between a regulated entity and a fintech or consumer tech usually ends up with the tech company being fast and loose on regulation and gaining market share at great speed. “I am not against competition. All I am saying, in the name of competitive service, we do not have a systemic and stability challenge at the same time,” he said.He urged authorities to take UPI and the Aadhaar-Enabled Payment Systems global. He said that there is already a partnership with Singapore, but there was a need to take this to other developing markets such as Bangladesh and African countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dominance-of-phonepe-and-gpay-wake-up-call-for-banks-kotak/articleshow/88080184.cms||---

The HC invoked suo motu powers to protect the interest of litigants who are unable to move the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) here against orders passed by DRTs as the former has been headless since September 15. Consequently, they either approach the high court for judicial review or are stuck without a remedy. A bank and a company had moved the HC to direct the Centre to appoint a chairperson to DRAT immediately. The HC was hearing petitions filed by Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait vs Union of India. Counsel Madhur Rai sought directions to the central government to appoint a chairperson for DRAT-Mumbai or to direct any other DRAT to decide its appeal. The HC also took up a petition filed by the government-owned enterprise MSTC vs Standard Chartered Bank. MSTC counsel Birendra Saraf also sought a stay of the recovery proceedings against it, seeking directions to the Centre to immediately appoint the chairperson of DRAT-Mumbai. The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice M S Karnik, said, “Allowing recovery processes to continue without providing an effective remedy of appeal, particularly when the SARFAESI Act empowers secured creditors to take possession of secured assets without orders of the court, would result in the desecration of the legal system.” It noted that in the absence of a DRAT chairperson, “going to HC would indeed entail limited scrutiny on settled parameters”. The bench said, “We are conscious that stalling of recovery processes would affect the economy of the nation. But, at the same time, we cannot overlook that the dates of demitting offices by the respective chairpersons of the DRATs have been known to the relevant department from the respective dates they took charge. The process to appoint chairpersons ought to have commenced much prior to July 4, 2021.” The HC added, “We, accordingly, direct that if any party is desirous of challenging an order passed by any DRT situated in the state of Maharashtra before the DRAT (Mumbai), he/she/it shall be at liberty to present an appeal before the DRAT (Mumbai) together with the requisite fees irrespective of whether the period of limitation has expired or not. However, after the appeal is preferred (together with the application for condonation of delay, if any, or any other application including an application for stay), the order under challenge would remain stayed from the time the appellant makes a pre-deposit of at least 25% of the debt due from him/her/it, as claimed by the secured creditors or determined by the DRT, whichever is less.” The HC said that, once such a pre-deposit is made, any secured creditor or party in whose favour an order has been passed by the DRT for effecting recovery shall remain injuncted from taking any action adverse to the interest of the appellant. “Such a pre-deposit shall be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties in the appeal before the DRAT (Mumbai). This arrangement shall continue till January 4, 2022, for the present,” the HC said. The bench said its endeavour has been to ensure that appointment of the chairperson of the DRAT (Mumbai) is expedited by the Centre without wasting any time. After hearing counsel Tushad Cooper for Standard Chartered Bank and ASG Anil Singh for the Centre, the HC also directed that without going into merits of the MSTC petition, it was “only as an ad-interim measure” directing protection of the rights of both parties till December 7 with an unconditional stay and by then, if MSTC deposits 25% of its debt, the stay would continue till January 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-stays-drt-orders-due-to-headless-appellate-body/articleshow/88080126.cms||---

I think we are on the right track,” Ambani said in an interview at the Infinity Forum, hosted by International Financial Services Centres Authority, GIFT City and Bloomberg. Ambani’s comments come as the government plans to mandate a minimum investment in digital currencies while not allowing them as legal tender. Ambani, who is also India’s wealthiest man, is a big believer in blockchain technology. “I believe in blockchain technology and this is different from cryptocurrency,” he said. “Blockchain is very important for a trust-based equitable society.” Ambani further said, “We are witnessing the fourth revolution, that is the digital-first revolution, where digital will be life for billions of people — which will be used in all technology — five or six kinds of technology will merge together, they will transform the whole world.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ambani-backs-privacy-crypto-bills/articleshow/88080150.cms||---

Of the payments banks that are already licensed, Airtel Payments Bank and Jio Payments Bank are promoted by corporates. These are the only two payments banks of the 11 that were granted approval that continue to function. Aditya Birla Payments Bank had surrendered its licence in 2019. Others, including Sun Pharma’s Dilip Shanghvi, had dropped their plans earlier.This would mean that SFBs would have to come from the non-banking finance company (NBFC) microfinance segment or cooperative banks that choose to convert themselves into SFBs. Most SFBs operating today were largely converted from microfinance companies or NBFCs engaged in small loans. Among the non-corporate-promoted payments banks, Paytm PB and Fino PB have indicated that they would pursue an SFB licence if the opportunity arises. The RBI’s internal working group on bank ownership had said that SFBs would be considered for transitioning into a universal bank provided they meet the minimum paid-up capital and net worth requirement applicable to universal banks. SFBs are considered to have a better business model compared to payments banks as they can lend and issue credit cards. They also do not face any geographic or size restrictions, unlike cooperative banks. However, they do face restrictions in extending large loans to corporate houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-payments-banks-cant-turn-into-sfbs/articleshow/88080100.cms||---

Rimjhim, the wife of a Ghazipur-based dentist Vishwajeet Chaturvedi, was shot dead at a secluded spot near Punpun dam under Naubatpur police station area in western Patna on November 23. Her body was recovered the next morning. On November 27, police arrested Rohit, his friend Kamal Sharma, Suraj Kumar, Pawan Kumar and shooters Ranjit Kumar and Rahul Kumar for their alleged involvement in the murder. Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma had said Rohit got Rimjhim killed as she had threatened to damage him by her black magic if she severed his connection. The SSP had also said Rohit believed that he was in her grip due to which he became depressed and suffered panic attacks. Rimjhim’s younger sister Shweta Pathak on Friday contacted this newspaper and alleged that her sister had a diary in which details of the money given to others are mentioned. Pathak claimed that their family don’t believe in black magic angle of the police. “Rimjhim was killed for financial gains,” she alleged. “She had paid Rs10 lakh to Rohit earlier. She might have given him more money in the last few months,” she alleged. Pathak, who is settled in Buxar and looks after the family property, said the diary is kept in a bank locker which they will take out in a couple of days and share its details with everyone. “Rimjhim’s son also told us that Rohit used to visit their home and talked about ‘balu (sand) tender’ with her. The diary would also makeit clear how much she had paid him and others and for what purposes,” Pathak said. She said Rimjhim had started an online business of selling masks, sanitisers and other items with Rohit’s colleague Poonam after Covid-19 last year. “Earlier, she was into online sale of Indian female dresses and ran old beauty parlour established by their mother on Boring road,” she said. When asked, SSP Sharma said Rohit’s motive of killing Rimjhim was based on investigation. “Investigation and evidences clearly support Rohit’s confession that he used to believe in Rimjhim’s black magic and finally got her killed,” he said, denying any further comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rimjhim-killed-for-financial-gains-sister/articleshow/88079225.cms||Debashish Karmakar

While seven were seriously infected and have been put on high doses of antibiotics, three others were operated upon Friday evening. “The eyes of six of them are badly infected and they are on high doses of antibiotics. Two of them will have to undergo vitreoretinal surgery and cornea transplant, while one will undergo cornea transplant,” health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said. IGIMS superintendent Dr Manish Mandal said the patients were being provided free treatment and arrangements have been made for the stay of attendants as well. He said more such patients were expected to come. So far, out of the 65 persons who had undergone cataract surgery at the private hospital in a free camp, eyes of 15 had already been removed. Of them, the eyes of 11 victims were removed at SKMCH and four at the Eye Hospital. Sources said more people may lose their vision and eyes as they had been badly infected. If the infected eyes are not removed, it could be dangerous for them. The exact reason of infection is yet not known as the report of culture done at the microbiology lab of SKMCH is awaited. Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Vinay Kumar Sharma said an FIR has been lodged against the hospital administration and a copy of the investigation report submitted by a team constituted by him, had also been attached. “We have given the details of doctors and assistants involved in the cataract surgeries,” said Dr Sharma.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh HC upholds management quota in private colleges||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Friday quashed certain rules pertaining to admission into B category seats for various undergraduate courses in private aided and unaided degree colleges in the state. While disposing the petitions and allowing private degree colleges to issue admission notification for filling up of 30 per cent seats under management quota, the court also directed the state government to extend welfare measures under Jagananna Vidya Deevena and Jagananna Vasati Deevena to SC and ST students admitted under management quota. Amending the rules of admission into undergraduate courses, the government had issued GO 55 on October 7, as per which seats in private colleges were to be divided in the ratio of 70:30 as category A and category B. While the ratio of seats used to be the same earlier, the government amended the rules saying seats in both categories will be filled through online admission by the convenor instead of filling 30% of seats by managements. Challenging the GO, Rayalaseema degree colleges association moved the high court alleging that the state government is taking away their right and liberty to give admissions to students of their choice under management quota. On the other hand, the state government argued that filling up of management quota seats by the convenor is meant to bring transparency into the system and curb illegal practices by the colleges, thereby providing equal opportunities to students across the state. The high court bench headed by Chief Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed there is no valid reason or rationale behind the GO and it is manifestly arbitrary. The court further said that as seats under convenor quota are not being filled in more than 70% of the colleges, if the right to fill 30% of seats is taken away from the managements there is no question of filling up seats under management quota by the convenor. Setting aside the rules, the court allowed private colleges to issue notifications for admissions under management quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-upholds-mgmt-quota-in-pvt-colleges/articleshow/88079684.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||Patna||Government prejudiced against Anand Mohan: Tejashwi Yadav||PATNA: The leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, told mediapersons on the state assembly premises on Friday that the government was under “political prejudice and vendetta” by not issuing the order to release former MP Anand Mohan from jail. Anand Mohan was convicted in the murder of the then Gopalganj DM, G Krishnaiyya, and has completed the life term of 14 years served on him. He is lodged in the Saharsa jail. The matter regarding Mohan’s release was raised in the state assembly by his son Chetan Anand as a supplementary question to the general call attention information put by 19 MLAs, including from the opposition and treasury benches, demanding the release of convicted inmates lodged in various jails who had already completed the life term served on them. Besides the RJD and CPI(ML), JD(U) member Dr Sanjeev Kumar also raised the issue. The Supreme Court, in its May order this year, had asked the state governments to release the prisoners who had served the life term or were above 65 years of age in order to decongest the jails in view of the Coronavirus pandemic, as the inmates lodged in the jails were vulnerable to the infection. In Bihar, the release order of an inmate is issued by the government’s Parihar Board after reviewing the reports submitted by the DM, SP and the jailer concerned. The MLAs concerned, including Chetan, in their supplementary questions on the matter, said the Bihar Parihar Board is not issuing the release orders regarding the convicted prisoners who fulfilled all the conditions, as the state government was not inclined towards it. “It is under a political conspiracy that the government has still been keeping Anand Mohan in jail. The way the minister concerned gave the reply (citing the CrPC sections under which he had been convicted) showed that the government was not in mood to give him justice,” Tejashwi alleged. “The government is acting prejudicially. It is strange that the government protects its own men, but becomes politically vindictive in the cases of others,” he also said. In another development, Tejashwi held a press conference at the RJD state headquarters and took up the case of the recent killing of Vishwajeet Singh alias Rintu Singh in Purnia district. He alleged that the killer, Athia alias Ashish Singh, was the cousin of food and consumer protection minister Leshi Singh. He also raised the issue of the incarceration of RJD member Bittu Singh in a “false case”. Incidentally, Anulika Singh, elected recently as a zila parishad member and wife of the deceased Rintu, and Sarvapriya Singh, wife of Bittu Singh, were also present at the press conference. Anulika demanded the court-monitored CBI inquiry into the killing of her husband. The RJD has been organizing protests in Purnia against the killing of Rintu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govt-prejudiced-against-anand-mohan-tejashwi/articleshow/88079208.cms||Abhay Singh

The House passed Bihar Technical Services Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2021, Bihar Private Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2021 and Bihar Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2021 during the session. The House also passed the second supplementary budget worth over Rs 20,000 crore for 2021-22 fiscal. Given the plethora of issues on the cards, it was feared that the session might witness noisy scenes, but the opposition members had decided to put the pressure on the government during the question hour or through other channels, like call attention questions, observers felt. Even a few MLAs from the treasury benches, like Sanjay Saraogi or Nitish Mishra from the BJP, put the ministers concerned in a tight corner through their questions. In the case of Misha, CM Nitish Kumar had intervened to explain the government’s position on the issue that the BJP MLA had raised. The departments concerned had also submitted answers to all the questions through the online mechanism. Even during the zero hour, most of the listed questions were either raised on the floor or submitted for record and reference. Question of late MLA listed for govt reply: On Friday, a queer situation developed when it transpired that a question related to animal husbandry resources department put up by Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) MLA from Bochaha, late Musafir Paswan, was listed for the reply. Paswan had died recently and an obituary reference had also been made to him on Monday. He had sent the question for listing from the hospital bed at Muzaffarpur where he was under treatment.

He also said 6,421 posts of Vidyalaya Sahayak (school assistants) have been created for works related to computers and other fields. Choudhary was replying to a starred question raised by RJD MLC Ram Chandra Purbey, who said the students were suffering because of delay in completion of courses. Purbey cited the example of the B R Ambedkar Bihar University in Muzaffarpur and said 60,000 students could not apply for the 4335 posts of POs and management trainees because of delay in holding examination of the 2018-21 batch. The minister said all the vice-chancellors and registrars, in a meeting at Raj Bhavan recently, were instructed to complete the courses on time. To another short-notice question raised by MLC Sanjeev Kumar Singh, the education minister said his department has created 6,421 posts of school assistants and computer literacy has been made mandatory for their appointment. Choudhary said the induction of these assistants will help in carrying out several duties. Singh pointed out that teachers have to be engaged in various works like enrolment and registration of new students, issuing admit cards and other works in the absence of school assistants and clerks. He further said the teachers had to go to cybercafé for completing the works as many schools do not have computer facilities. Choudhary also said a software was being developed to have a record of land availability of schools and instructions have been given to get the encroachments on educational premises removed. Exchange of couplets: The last day of winter session witnessed exchange of couplets between education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary and Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra after a question regarding the status of Maithili teaching. When Mishra read out an Urdu poem, Choudhary replied in a poetic way. Choudhary said the state government was serious about Maithli education and 55 teachers were working while 114 posts of teachers had been created in senior secondary schools. He further said 49 teachers were appointed at the college level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/government-to-recruit-4600-teachers-in-colleges-minister/articleshow/88079122.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Chief minister Nitish Kumar will inaugurate it along with several projects of the urban development and housing department on Saturday. The first-of-its kind system will increase the efficiency of solid waste management in the city. Under the ISWM project, 1.48 lakh households and commercial buildings are equipped with QR (quick response) code and the remaining 50,000 buildings will be commissioned with QR technology (type of matrix barcode) soon, said PSCL’s public relations officer Harshita. She told this newspaper that a mobile application, ‘Samadhan Patna’, a control room at PMC headquarters, dashboard to monitor the status of garbage collection, biometric attendance of sanitation workers and weight bridge at landfill site in Ramchak Bairiya will also be launched at the event. “All the sanitation workers have been provided with smartphones under this project. After collecting the garbage from the households, the workers will scan the QR codes displayed at the houses. The residents will automatically get the message on their registered phone numbers about garbage collection from their homes,” she said. The garbage vehicles are equipped with GPS (global positioning system) and also with geofencing. It will help the civic body track the movement of the vehicles and monitor the status of garbage collection. Harshita said the local mobile app will be integrated with Swachhta app of the Centre. “This app will enable people to lodge complaints regarding the door-to-door garbage collection and get the contact number of the control room for the redressal of the civic problem. The developer will also add real-time tracking system of the garbage collecting vehicles in their wards. It will help people track and know when the garbage vehicle will reach their localities,” she said. Once the app is launched, the residents would be able to lodge complaints regarding waste management. If a complaint is not addressed, it will be automatically transferred to higher authorities and action will be taken against the officials for that. The ISWM system has been installed under smart city mission by utilizing funds to the tune of Rs14 crore. Besides, a control room has been set up for daily monitoring of the garbage vehicles and coverage of households from 6am to 12 noon. In case any complaint is lodged, the control room will verify it by using the QR code data. A weighing bridge has been installed at Ramchak Bairiya to weigh the garbage and dispatch that to the landfill site per day. According to sources, the objective of the project is to streamline the door-to-door garbage collection in the city and cover all the households and commercial buildings to get good scoring in next Swachh Survekshan survey.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-to-launch-qr-code-enabled-garbage-collection-system-today/articleshow/88079099.cms||Faryal Rumi

This has taken Delhi far ahead of many global cities, including London, Paris and Washington, in CCTV camera coverage of public places. An additional 1.4 lakh cameras are being installed, which would take the total number to 4.15 lakh. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said Delhi ranked number one globally in terms of CCTV coverage. He claimed that the cameras made women feel more secure and had also helped police apprehend criminals. While London has 1,138 cameras per mile, Delhi has 1,826. Delhi’s CCTV coverage is three times more than Chennai and 11 times higher than Mumbai. “Over the last seven years, 2.75 lakh CCTV cameras were installed on roads, in public places, colonies, schools, streets, etc. In a survey of 150 cities globally, Delhi was at the top with 1,826 CCTV cameras per square mile. We are far ahead of London, New York, Singapore and Paris,” said Kejriwal. Mentioning that the AAP government overcame many obstacles in getting the cameras installed and he had to sit on dharna inside Raj Niwas with his ministers over the issue, Kejriwal said, “We faced many obstacles during the first phase of installing the cameras, including from the central government.” The CCTV cameras being installed now are being sourced from Bharat Electronics Ltd, a central government company. “They are doing great work and we would like to thank them. The cameras are modern and state-of-the-art devices. Often, many CCTVs get damaged after installation and no one gets to know about it. In times of need, like when a crime occurs, we find out that the camera wasn’t working. However, these modern cameras sound an alarm to alert the command centre in case they get damaged,” said the CM. “The operators get alerts on their phones in case of a power cut or vandalism. If a CCTV camera stops working, these alerts help them repair it at the earliest,” added Kejriwal. Recordings were being kept for up to 30 days and only 3-4 authorised personnel had access to the live feed, which they would be able to view from anywhere in the world with a password and firewall protection on the internet. “A command centre receives the live feed of all CCTV cameras for real-time monitoring. These devices have 4 megapixel cameras with night vision, providing optimum video quality,” said the CM. Before installing the cameras, meetings were held with PWD, police, RWAs and market associations to decide their location. The camera feed is only provided to authorised users, like PWD command centre, RWA monitoring rooms and police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-tops-london-paris-in-cctvs-per-mile/articleshow/88080074.cms||AlokKNMishra

Meanwhile, a passenger who arrived at the Calicut International Airport from Germany on Friday evening tested positive for Covid-19, after which the passenger was shifted to the special ward set up at the Manjeri medical college for further observation. The passenger tested positive for Covid-19 in the Rapid PCR test conducted at the airport on arrival. District medical officer Dr Ummer Farook said that the man, who is based in the UK, had arrived on November 21 and tested positive for Covid-19 on November 26. His samples were sent for genome sequencing tests to the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday. The person’s samples are being sent for genome sequencing as part of the guidelines issued by the central government to conduct the test for travellers who arrived from ‘at risk’ countries which includes the UK. The DMO said that the result of genome sequencing is expected within a week. The mother of the person has also tested positive for Covid-19. Both have been admitted to the Beach Hospital. “Both of them had only mild symptoms like fever and headache. I have spoken to both of them and currently they don’t have any symptoms. He had taken three doses of Pfizer vaccination while his mother and the domestic help, who is also under observation, have been fully vaccinated,” Farook said. The person had travelled by train to four districts before he tested Covid-19 positive, and efforts are on to prepare his contact list which will be forwarded to the respective districts. After he tested positive for Covid, he has been under home quarantine. The DMO said that as a precautionary measure, arrangements have been made at the CFLTC at Chathamangalam and at the Kozhikode medical college and at the Beach Hospital to provide treatment if anyone tests positive for the variant. Following the development, the DMO convened an online meeting of health supervisors, and a meeting of private hospitals will also be convened soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/2-people-from-at-risk-nations-test-covid-ve/articleshow/88080015.cms||---

A total of 94,434 residents took the Covid shots in the Pune district on Friday. With this, the district with an 83.42 lakh eligible (above 18 years) population has vaccinated 82.27 lakh people with the first dose. Of them, 52.53 lakh people have received both the doses, an official said. It means the district still has 1.14 lakh eligible citizens who have not yet received a single shot so far. “A total 2,92,268 residents took the Covid shot in the Pune district in November. They had remained unvaccinated till October end. They were convinced to get the Covid shot through public education and door-to-door counselling under the Har Ghar Dastak campaign,” said public health expert Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region. During the same period (November), a total of 7.92 lakh people who had previously got their first dose turned up to take the second dose in the district. “Till September 15, we would vaccinate more first dose beneficiaries than the second dose beneficiaries. Thereafter, we are vaccinating more people with second dose, and motivating unvaccinated people to get their first has become a challenge. We are using creative methods to win citizens over in favour of vaccination, besides deploying routine educational tools like posters, hoardings and mass media tools,” Deshmukh said. Health activists stressed on scaling up efforts to educate people about taking both the doses. “People are currently more focused on reclaiming income sources and putting in more efforts to compensate the loss that occurred during the lockdown. They need to be not only counselled but also provided doorstep vaccination,” said health activist Sanjay Dabhade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-92l-unvaxxed-residents-convinced-to-get-covid-shots-in-nov-in-dist-report/articleshow/88080632.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Let HC hear issue of ‘clean chit’ to Ajit Pawar, says BJP||Mumbai: The BJP has questioned the Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s decision to allow an appeal against the clean chit given to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and 79 others to be heard by the principal secretary co-operatives department. The matter pertains to the Rs 1000-crore scam in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank. The party has demanded that the appeal be put before the Bombay High Court for a hearing and the case be handed over to the central agencies for an impartial inquiry. A committee appointed by the state government in 2013 had pointed out that the scope of misappropriation in the apex co-operative bank was to the tune of Rs 1,086 crore. Subsequently, the government set up another committee headed by additional registrar Shivaji Pahinkar. However, when objections were raised on how a junior officer could hold an inquiry against ministers, the government had appointed retired judge Panditrao Jadhav to investigate the matter. The committee gave a clean chit to all the 80 accused. Now the decision has been challenged by one Tatyasaheb Natkar from Beed who has filed an appeal before the state co-operatives department. “All this is nothing but a drama to give the accused a clean chit. Besides, Pawar, rural development minister Hasan Mushrif, Relief and Rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, and Food and Drugs Administration minister Rajendra Shingne have been named as accused. How can an officer serving under a government whose senior cabinet ministers are accused carry out a fair investigation?” Keshav Upadhye, BJP chief spokesperson, said. The head of the business unit of the BJP Shailesh Ghedia has already written to the CM and revenue minister to forward the matter to the high court for a hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-let-hc-hear-issue-of-clean-chit-to-ajit-pawar-says-bjp/articleshow/88081559.cms||---
---||Mumbai||33 accused chargesheeted in Dombivli gangrape case||KALYAN: The Thane police have filed a chargesheet against all 33 accused, including four minors, in the Dombivli gangrape case, in which a 15-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted multiple times over a period of nine months earlier this year. The 885-page chargesheet includes statements from 122 witnesses along with medical, forensic and circumstantial evidence to make the case watertight, so that the accused can be given the maximum punishment for the crime, said police. The chargesheet was filed in the Kalyan sessions court on Thursday. A case of gang-rape of a minor girl was registered at the Manpada police station on September 22. As many as 33 accused were arrested. The accused had sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl for nine months, police said. The tragic story began in January when the girl’s boyfriend allegedly raped her and filmed the crime on his phone. He allegedly used the video to blackmail her and rape her again. He had also allegedly shared the video with his friends and acquaintances who in turn used it to blackmail the teen and raped her. The case came to light after the teen narrated her trauma to her aunt, following which a complaint was filed against the accused. The incident had led to an outrage as opposition and different women's organisations across state demanded speedy investigation in case. Considering the seriousness of the case, the investigation handed over to a special investigation (SIT) team led by Assistant Commissioner of Police Sonali Dhole. A senior police official associated with the investigation, who did not wish to be named, said the police usually file a chargesheet in the court within 90 days of any incident. However looking at the seriousness of this case and by conducting a speedy investigation despite the involvement of a large number of accused in the case by collecting maximum evidences and witnesses, a chargesheet has been filed within a month-and-a-half. In its chargesheet, the police have mentioned the WhatsApp chats, phone calls and other technical evidences against the accused. Police said the four minor accused have been granted bail. The remaining 29 accused are still in judicial custody. According to the chargesheet, the victim was allegedly raped in Dombivli, Navi Mumbai, Rabale and Murbad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-33-accused-chargesheeted-in-dombivli-gangrape-case/articleshow/88081870.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Mumbai||Mumbai student gets multiple vax certificates, link shows jabs in UP; kin seek probe||MUMBAI: Jogeshwari resident Amol Kamble was out when a string of one-time passwords (OTP) for registering on the CoWin platform started popping up on his phone. While the college-goer was still figuring out what was going on, there was a barrage of messages for “successfully completing vaccinations”. A link to the certificates showed the jabs were given in Uttar Pradesh. Kamble’s family has demanded a thorough probe into what they suspect could be a scam. Kamble’s case is not the only one. In October, a blogger from Delhi, Fayaz Peer, received a CoWin link to a vaccination certificate for his grandfather who is no longer alive. When he tweeted about it, Peer came across another incident where a Delhi woman had received texts for completing inoculation for her mother who had in fact passed away six months ago. “There is something amiss,” said Kamble’s father, Arjun, who intends to lodge a complaint. Kamble initially received three OTPs, one after another, on November 23 to register on CoWin. Puzzled, he asked his parents if they were trying to log in using his phone number. When they denied it, Kamble ignored the OTPs assuming it was an error. Ten minutes later, he got separate texts which said that Geeta, Suress Kumar and Durga Prasad had been successfully vaccinated with the first dose of Covishield. Kamble rushed home to download the vaccination certificates and get more details. “All the certificates had been issued at Baheri Fazalpur in Bareilly. If my son did not share the OTP, how did the registration happen against his phone number? Is this how vaccination numbers are being inflated?” said Arjun. Peer said he received a text about his late grandfather’s inoculation just a day after India crossed 1 billion doses. “My grandfather stayed in Kashmir and I had registered him against my phone number for vaccination. He was given the first dose in May 2021 and he subsequently passed away in July. Getting a text in October which said that my grandfather had just been given his second dose was very traumatic. I soon came across other such cases online and do not understand how this could have happened,” Peer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-student-gets-multiple-vax-certs-link-shows-jabs-in-up-kin-seek-probe/articleshow/88080683.cms||Nitasha Natu

The Maharashtra government on Thursday rolled back most restrictions, including the RT-PCR negative report, mandated for inter-state domestic flyers, irrespective of their vaccination status. Now, inter-state domestic flyers who are fully vaccinated will not require an RT-PCR report. Lata Srinivas said she had booked a vacation for the family to Meghalaya and was supposed to fly from Mumbai boarding on December 17. “We had booked the vacation for eight days around August with a travel agency. Till last week, it was all good. But we are now a bit doubtful. The rules may get stringent. We are in touch with tour operator,” she said. Solo traveller Abhishek George said, “I am going to Leh and Ladakh around the end of December for 15 days. I have made my bookings from Delhi onwards. So far things look fine. I just hope that things remain the same and my plans do not get disturbed.” SOTC Travel has continued to see demand for Christmas and New Year from customers in Pune across segments. Daniel D’Souza, president and country head of SOTC Travel, said, “With the positive news of Singapore and Mauritius opening its borders and the onset of the honeymoon season, we are witnessing an uptick in queries from various segments, especially honeymooners. With no information available on the new variant of Covid, our customers are awaiting clarity.” He said, “Domestic destinations such as Kerala, Goa, Andamans, Rajasthan and international destinations like the Maldives, Dubai, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Turkey continue to see an uptick during Christmas and New Year.” City resident Manoj Vaswani, who has booked a vacation with friends to the Maldives, said, “We are nearly four couples who have booked this vacation and all of us have completed our second doses. We have to do our RT-PCR tests before we leave Pune. Apart from that, there are no major rules to be followed as far as testing and vaccine is concerned.: Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, said, “We are getting calls from travellers regarding their bookings and if there are any changes in travel rules. So far there have not been any cancellations and the bookings for the weekend are full.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/travellers-on-tenterhooks-over-future-of-vacation-plans/articleshow/88080643.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

A division bench comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly held that the union government had set the dosage gap at 84 days on the basis of scientific and expert advice and a constitutional court cannot analyse the intrinsic aspects of the same to arrive at a different conclusion, especially when no material has been produced before the court to show that the expert and scientific advises given to the government are hasty, bad, or ill-advised. An appeal filed by the Union government against the judgment of September 3 was considered by the court. The court also noted that the Union government had invoked the provisions of the Disaster Management Act to deal with Covid-19 and in such circumstances, individual freedom and interest may have to give way to the interest of the citizens of the country at large. Otherwise, the government would not be in a position to manage, coordinate, and implement the measures taken for protecting the rights and liberties of the citizens at large, the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-sets-aside-single-benchs-judgment/articleshow/88080021.cms||---

The city has the highest coverage of second vaccination amongst all the large cities in the state. Vadodara had recently reached the 100% vaccination landmark. Against a target of 15,09,801 persons, it has already vaccinated 15,24,306 persons. The vaccination still continues and is expected to increase in the coming days. Administering the second dose has been a challenging task in several municipal corporations. Special drives have been conducted to ensure that this happens. However, in Vadodara, that has not been the case and the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) did not offer any sops or rewards for vaccination too. VMC commissioner Shalini Agarwal said that the good coverage of the second dose was possible largely because of strong follow-ups. “Teams have worked hard to follow up hard with those who have taken the first dose. They are continuing the drive to ensure that all who have taken the first dose take the second too,” she said. VMC has also been making calls from the health department to all whose second shot becomes due. This is besides the SMS sent by the system to such persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/85-in-vadodara-have-taken-second-dose-of-covid-vaccine/articleshow/88079396.cms||---

The 66-bed facility has been set up at the 10 storey Stem Cell Hospital building that was converted into Covid-19 hospital during the past two waves of coronavirus. NCH is the largest government hospital in the region that provides treatment to Covid-19 patients from across south Gujarat, Saurashtra and Maharashtra as well in the recent past. Of the 66 beds, 41 have been set up on the 10th floor which has basic isolation facilities. Patients with minimum oxygen requirement will be kept in this general ward having common facilities. Special rooms with life support systems have been set up on the third floor of the hospital with 25-bed capacity at present. “We have a facility to accommodate more patients as well but the additional facility will be set up if required. This facility is developed as part of our preparedness,” a senior NCH official told TOI. The official further said that NCH has 300 ventilators and required setup for oxygen support. “We have made the arrangement considering confirmation of the presence of patients infected with the Omicron variant,” he said. In the second wave, the newly constructed Kidney Hospital building at NCH was also converted into Covid-19 hospital. “The Kidney Hospital building is now being used to handle medicine department patients since the condition of the old NCH building is poor.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: GIFT City represents promise of India, says PM Modi||AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar that houses the country’s first International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), represents India’s openness to ideas and investment. “GIFT City is not merely a premise. It represents the promise of India... GIFT City is a gateway to the global fintech world. IFSC at GIFT City was born out of the vision that finance combined with technology will be an important part of India’s future development,” said PM Modi. He said that the aim was to provide the best international financial services not just for India but for the world. The PM was speaking at the inauguration of the Infinity Forum, a thought leadership forum on FinTech via video-conferencing. The two-day event, beginning Friday, is hosted by International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), under the aegis of the Centre in collaboration with GIFT City. Calling for a fintech revolution driven by trust in inclusiveness, PM said there is an opportunity to provide a low-cost and reliable ‘real-time payment system’ as well as a ‘domestic card scheme’ and ‘fund remittance system’. “Financial inclusion is the driver of fintech revolution,” he said adding that fintech rests on four pillars of income, investments, insurance and institutional credit. “When income grows, investment becomes possible. Insurance coverage enables greater risk-taking ability and investments. Institutional credit gives wings for expansion. And we have worked on each of these pillars. When all these factors come together, you suddenly find so many more people participating in the financial sector. The large base becomes the perfect springboard for fintech innovations,” according to PM Modi. Fintech industry in India is innovating to enhance access to finance and the formal credit system to every person in the country, he said. “Now, it is time to convert these fintech initiatives into a fintech revolution. A revolution that helps to achieve financial empowerment of every single citizen of the country,” the PM further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gift-city-not-merely-a-premise-it-represents-promise-of-india/articleshow/88080025.cms||---
---||Dehradun||No holiday on Igas in 2022; Cong says BJP’s dual face exposed||Dehradun: Amid much fanfare, the ruling BJP had declared a holiday on Igas (Budhi Diwali) -- celebrated as Diwali 11 days after the Festival of Lights – claiming that the move aimed at promoting traditional and cultural values. However, a few days later, government released the 2022 calendar, declaring holidays on Chhath and Harela but Igas. Taking a dig at government over the move, opposition Congress claimed, "It is a well-known fact that BJP leaders are opportunists. With elections around the corner, Igas was announced a holiday and as there are no polls in 2022, the day remains a working one." General administration department of the secretariat released its calendar for government holidays in 2022. According to the calendar, the holidays are Republic Day, Mahashivratrai, Holika Dahan, Holi, Ram Navmi, Mahavir Jayanti/Dr BR Ambedkar Jayanti, Good Friday, Eid-ul-Fitr, Buddh Poornima, Eid-ul-Adha, Harela, Muharram, Raksha Bandhan, Independence Day, Janmashtami, Gandhi Jayanti, Vijay Dashmi, Eid-I-Milad, Deepawali, Govardhan Pooja, Chatt Pooja, Guru Nanak Jayanti and Christmas. Besides, there are four public holidays on Guru Govind Jayanti, Cheti Chand, Vishwakarma Pooja and Guru Teg Bahadur Shaheedi Diwas. Legend has it that the news of Lord Ram returning to Ayodhya came 11 days late to this part. Therefore, Diwali is celebrated in the form of Igas or Budhi Diwali in the Himalayan state. While the ruling BJP claimed that it had announced a holiday on Igas to promote culture and tradition, and bring the near and dear ones together on the auspicious occasion, top BJP leaders had accused former CM Harish Rawat of announcing a “holiday on Friday for people to offer namaz”. In a counter-attack, Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal said, “This once again exposes the dual face of the BJP. For them, it is no election, no holiday. In 2022 there are no polls, so the BJP government has not named Igas as a holiday. Let me assure the people of Uttarakhand and also the BJP that when the Congress will come to power, a holiday will be declared on Igas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/no-holiday-on-igas-in-2022-cong-says-bjps-dual-face-exposed/articleshow/88080038.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: November gold imports swell 92% year-on-year||AHMEDABAD: It indeed was a bumper Diwali season for jewellers and bullion traders as the imports of gold in November swelled by a whopping 92% compared to the same month last year. The data released by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex (AACC) suggests that about 5.44 metric tonnes (MT) of gold was imported in November, up 92% against 2.8MT in November 2020. The festive season demand and the sales of jewellery for weddings kept the gold imports buoyant. The gold price stood at Rs 49,150 per 10 gram in Ahmedabad on Friday. Jewellers and bullion traders attribute the surge in imports to the festival and wedding season sales. “Around the festival season, muhurat purchases were very good. In fact, on Pushya Nakshatra and Dhanteras muhurats alone, the city retailed an estimated 750kg of gold,” said an Ahmedabadbased bullion trader. “This was indeed a great start for the jewellers. The gold price was very much favourable around the festive season which gave an added impetus to purchases.” The demand for bullion was also firm during the festive season. “Due to the wedding season, the demand was phenomenal. That apart, a lot of customers who have weddings in their family are also purchasing lightweight gold jewellery,” said Ashish Zaveri, member, Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA). “Many are also investing in bullion and buying physical gold, all of which has propelled the demand.” The demand for silver was strong too. The silver price settled at Rs 66,500 per kg in the Ahmedabad market on Friday. In November, AACC data suggests that about 11MT of silver was imported which was much lower than October imports. Young people are buying both gold and silver jewellery as well as bullion, as they have realized the importance of saving up, suggest industry players.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nov-gold-imports-swell-92-year-on-year/articleshow/88080041.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Delhi||Learning interrupted for special children in Delhi||NEW DELHI: When schools reopened for junior students almost a month ago, Anushree Shivpuri, who has a five-year-old son with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), started hoping for a change. After being confined to her house for almost two years, Shivpuri was hopeful of getting some intervention to help her child develop social and life skills, which she believed couldn’t happen at home. Though he was going to school just twice a week, a start had been made. Now, with schools yet again closed due to pollution, the battle seems even longer for Shivpuri and several parents who have children with special needs. They want the government to realise that school is one of the best places to help these children grow and develop. “ASD affects a child’s social, verbal and life skills and early intervention is the key. This entails being in school with other children and learning to be independent. The bad air quality will continue. I’m not worried about the academics, but the psychological impact. For our children, the impact is double. It’s so frustrating. We are putting in money, time and careers on hold. If the schools don’t open, I won’t be able to do much about my child’s needs,” Shivpuri told TOI. Her son is in nursery class at a private school in south Delhi. Even for Varun Gairola and Nadisha Goswami, this period has not been easy. Their son suffers from ASD. To assist her child, Goswami has stopped working as even work from home was becoming difficult to manage. “This lockdown has been bad for all children. While an atypical child can attend online classes, nothing can compensate for school and face-to-face therapy, which has been missing for a year now. Our children cannot sit in one place and attend classes. Forcing them to remain inside has resulted in behavioural issues. My child has gone back to washroom training and throws tantrums now. Our children cannot express themselves in words like others, “said Gairola, whose child is in nursery class at a private school in Dwarka. Upashna Mahtani Luthra, the mother of a 16-year-old boy with special needs, said they were facing even more challenges now. “He requires many physical therapies now. His growth is much less. During online schooling, the facilitators keep trying, but my son's attention and interaction is minimal,” said Luthra, the director of events at Gurugram Moms, the largest women’s community in the NCR. Luthra has created a mini occupational therapy centre in her house. “I have an older daughter who does occupational therapy. My son responds best to her. Just when schools were opening and such children were slowly getting back to their routine, pollution reared its ugly head,” she said. Sonali Saxena, who has a child with ASD and runs Satat Navotkarsh Foundation and works with special children, said many parents had to hire shadow teachers for online classes. “The online classes were actually for parents. We had to learn and then teach our children. With the closure of schools, children have forgotten how to talk. If these closures continue, it will be very difficult to make our children independent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/learning-interrupted-for-special-children/articleshow/88080044.cms||Shradha Chettri

The government has decided to issue notices to these teachers to know the reasons for not taking the vaccination yet. In the wake of reports of Omicron, the new Covid variant, the state government cannot take any risk and hence all teachers should take vaccination if they have to come to school, said Sivankutty. “The people of the state should also know about the teachers who have not yet taken the vaccines. Hence the list of teachers from each district will be made available in the public domain,” said the minister. “Teachers, who are unvaccinated yet, will be given a week’s time to take the vaccines and produce the necessary certificates before the authorities. Those who don’t take even after that will have to produce their explanation before the medical boards in each district,” the minister added. The government decided to act tough against teachers who are unwilling to take the vaccination but are coming to schools. The government has given strict directions to the managements not to force yet unvaccinated teachers to come to school. If the teachers are not taking the vaccination then they will have to do RT-PCR tests every week and submit the results to the school authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-release-list-of-unvaxxed-teachers-min/articleshow/88080051.cms||---

Fadnavis, while addressing a function after inaugurating the party’s new office, said, “MVA claims the state government is ahead in vaccinations as 10 crore doses have been administered so far. But it is because of PM Narendra Modi, who took steps for vaccine production in the country, that jabs are available on such a large scale.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fadnavis-inaugurates-party-office/articleshow/88080655.cms||---

After the December 4 public rally of PM Narendra Modi in Dehradun, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to address a gathering in the state capital. Congress sources have not ruled out the possibility of general secretary of All India Congress Committee Priyanka Gandhi also holding a series of meetings in Uttarakhand. Confirming the development, party state chief Ganesh Godiyal said, “Rahul Gandhi is scheduled to be in Dehradun on December 16, on the occasion of 50th year of India-Pak 1971 war, to felicitate ex-servicemen for their contribution towards the nation. Thereafter, he will address a public rally.” Godiyal said it will not be a roadshow but a public rally. “However, the venue for the rally is yet to be decided. We will take a call on the issue in the next few days,” said the Congress state chief. According to sources, the state leadership will take a call on the venue after Modi’s December 4 rally – which the BJP members are calling to be the biggest ever political rally in Uttarakhand. They did not fail to point out that Priyanka Gandhi was actively involved in Uttar Pradesh and the possibility of her holding meetings and rallies were bright in the later half of December and first half of January. Besides, holding a rally in Garhwal and Kumaon, Rahul attended a roadshow in Haridwar, the only district of Uttarakhand where the Congress managed to win three seats. With the party aiming to make a comeback in the Himalayan state, the programmes of its national leadership are being regarded crucial. “Till now, we have received a positive response in our campaigns. The party has strongly raised issues like farm laws, Devasthanam Board, appointment of Lokayukta and changes made in Land Laws in Uttarakhand. The presence of our national leadership will boost the morale of party members and draw a positive response from people of the state,” Congress spokesperson Garima Dasauni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/poll-campaign-hits-top-gear-after-modi-rally-on-dec-4-rahul-to-address-public-on-dec-16/articleshow/88080072.cms||Kautilya Singh

However, with a change in the wind direction, citizens felt the chill in the air. As the trough that was causing the unseasonal rain has dissipated, no part of the state reeceived rainfall on Friday, according to state government data. Ahmedabad recorded a maximum temperature of 27.3 degrees celsius, 3.4 degrees lower than normal. The minimum temperature of 15 degrees was 0.6 degrees higher than normal. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast that the minimum temperature on Saturday will be 16 degrees, with a partially cloudy sky. ‘No large change in minimum temperatures during the next 24 hours, thereafter a rise by 2-3 degrees in the subsequent 3-4 days over the region very likely,’ the forecast on Friday said. Naliya, with a minimum temperature of 12.2 degrees celsius was the coldest weather station in the state, followed by Keshod at 13.4 degrees and Rajkot with 13.7 degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sun-emerges-after-two-days/articleshow/88080050.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Antilia scare: Alleged bookie challenges stay on bail in Mumbai||Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Friday said it would consider the legal point of whether a trial court has the jurisdiction to grant stay on its own bail order. Alleged cricket bookie Naresh Gaur, arrested in the Antilia bomb scare case and businessman Mansukh Hiren death case, has moved the HC challenging the stay for 25 days on the bail granted by the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court. On November 20, the special NIA granted bail to Gaur who was accused of procuring SIM cards for dismissed assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, the prime accused in the case, and encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. However, the special NIA court, on a request from the prosecution as it “wished” to challenge the grant of bail before an appellate court, stayed its own order for 25 days, which is not within its power, argued Gaur, through senior counsel Shirish Gupte and advocate Aniket Nikam. The NIA court erred in applying Section 309 (power to postpone or adjourn proceedings), Gupte and Nikam said before Justice S K Shinde of the Bombay high court. The special court had arrived at a prima facie conclusion that Gaur had no active knowledge of the conspiracy, said his counsel, questioning the exercise of the discretionary power to stay the bail. NIA counsel Sandesh Patil said the agency would file its reply to Gaur’s petition. The high court then posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/antilia-scare-alleged-bookie-challenges-stay-on-bail-in-mumbai/articleshow/88081592.cms||---

The suspects also attempted to cut a safe using a gas-cutter. “There were gold ornaments in the safe, which are intact,” Arvind Gokule, senior inspector, Hadapsar police, told TOI. The Hadapsar police nabbed one of the suspects from near Nashik. “We took him into custody from a train with the help of Nashik police.,” Gokule said. Sunil Sonawane (35), owner of the jewellery shop, has filed a complaint with the Hadapsar police. The jewellery shop is one of the seven shops on the ground floor of the building. The watchman’s room shares a common wall with the jewellery shop. Sonawane said, “About 15 days ago, the building watchman left for his home in Nepal. He arranged for another watchman, who is also from Nepal.” He said that a building resident found the door of the watchman’s room open. “He also noticed a mattress fixed on the common wall,” Sonawane said. When Sonawane entered the shop, he found gold and silver ornaments missing. Cash Rs70,500 on the counter was missing, too. He said that watchman and his accomplices took advantage of overnight rain. “Some residents heard loud thuds. But they ignored the sound thinking it had been caused by rain falling on tin sheds,” Sonawane said, adding, “The suspects used a mattress while drilling the hole to muffle the sound.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/guard-aides-drill-hole-into-shop-wall-steal-valuables-worth-rs-12l/articleshow/88080680.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority was richer by Rs 474 crore revenue in two days of auction. Officials were enthused by the good response to the auction as it fetched Rs 474 crore for a single layout at Uppal Bhagat. In the earlier auction from the same layout, the HMDA earned Rs 1,000 crore revenue. Sources said buoyed by the response to the land auctions, the HMDA is planning to conduct auctions in identified layouts in the western part of the city soon. HMDA officials said the highest bid was Rs 1.01 lakh per square yard as againgst the upset price of Rs 35,000 per square yard while the lowest bid stopped at Rs 36,000. On Thursday, the HMDA got the same highest amount of Rs 1.01 lakh per square yard while the lowest bid was Rs 53,000 per square yard. In the two days of auction, the average bid amount was Rs 55,000 per square yard.

---||Hyderabad||ISB ‘slow road’ turns into fine trap for commuters||HYDERABAD: The 30kmph speed limit fixed for the arterial 2.63-km Indian School of Business (ISB) road, which leads to the financial district, Narsingi, Kollur and other areas, has become a bane for many commuters. Signboards of 30 kmph have been put up on the entire stretch which is frequently used by those having their offices and residences in the neighbouring areas. While motorists sayfixing of speed limit as low as 30 kmph is arbitrary, cops on the other hand said unless there are limits placed, there could be accidents due to over-speeding and fine of Rs 1,000 will be levied for over-speeding. “On a road that is so wide and has a slope to it, how can people drive at a speed limit of 30 kmph? I have been fined four times till now for driving above 30 kmph. There is no rationale behind having such a low speed limit for a six lane road,” argued Sameer Dubey, a resident of Narsingi, who has not only compiled data of those fined on the stretch but has also filed an RTI application seeking information on the speed limit. As per the data compiled by Dubey, between August 2020 and November 2021 as many as 86 challans have been slapped on 36 commuters to the tune of Rs 89,010. “It seems like a complete case of revenue generation by the traffic cops. Between August 2020 and October 2021, I have been issued 12 challans to the tune of Rs 12,420. Maintaining a speed of 30 kmph is absolutely unjustified on that stretch,” said a commuter on condition of anonymity. Many other residents have demanded that the concerned authorities revise the speed limit on the stretch and not penalise commuters. “It’s difficult to maintain that speed, especially on the slope leading from ISB towards Wipro circle. Even if one doesn’t accelerate, the vehicle would automatically speed to 40-50 kmph due to the slope. One has to keep using the brake to avoid getting a challan,” said Rajendra Gupta, an IT sector employee. However, traffic cops argue that the speed limit was fixed following a survey by engineers from the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC). “Despite the speed limit being fixed at 30 kmph, we are giving a relaxation of another 30 kmph on that stretch and issuing challans to only those who are driving above 60 kmph. If there is anyone who has been issued challan for driving below 60 kmph can approach us and we will waive it off,” said Narasimha Reddy, circle inspector (traffic), Gachibowli. On the other hand, TSIIC officials said that there is no need for the speed gun that has been installed by the traffic cops on that stretch. “As per the rules, the speed limit mentioned on the signboard is half of the actual permissible limit on that stretch. Hence, the permissible limit is 60 kmph and not 30 kmph. But if we erect signboards of 60 kmph, commuters would end up speeding more than that, resulting in accidents,” said B Madhu, deputy zonal manager, TSIIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/isb-slow-road-turns-intofine-trap-for-commuters/articleshow/88080037.cms||Preeti Biswas

GFP vice president Durgadas Kamat said that chief minister Pramod Sawant’s promise to provide 16,000 litres of free water to households every month has proved to be just another way to over charge customers. “We demand that the chief minister stop joking around, roll back the tariffs and stop looting people by releasing cumulative bills,” Kamat said. On Independence Day, chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced a scheme to provide 16,000 litres of free water from September 1. At that time, PWD had released a notification increasing the water tariffs and revising the water consumption slabs. Since then, PWD has started releasing water bills for three-month periods and households have received water bills running into several thousands. “When we studied the notification, we realised that the new tariffs have increased by 60% and the gimmick of giving free water was just a farce. Our party president said this on September 3 that the government is making a fool of people through this scheme,” Kamat said. Kamat said the PWD is releasing cumulative bills for three-month periods in order to show consumption of more than 16,000 litres based on which a higher slab of tariffs can be applied. “In the name of 16,000 litres of free water, this government is hoodwinking people,” said Kamat. “Across the state water supply is scarce, pipelines are broken, dirty water is released. People are protesting outside the PWD offices with buckets. This clearly indicates that the BJP government’s free water supply and tariff has been exposed. The BJP government has failed to provide free water and ensure 24x7 water supply to people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/free-water-supply-a-farce-says-gfp-demands-rollback-of-hiked-tariff/articleshow/88080719.cms||---

Bhupendra Patel said Dholera SIR has huge potential for sectors such as aerospace, defence, engineering, pharmaceuticals, IT, agro and food processing and renewables. He urged entrepreneurs to invest in the SIR, which is spread over 920 square kilometres. “Dholera SIR is not just about industries, as we have also planned to develop a Special Education Region over 1,000 acres here. An international airport is also coming up over 1,425 hectares and the Airports Authority of India has already started work on it,” the chief minister said. Patel further said that the Dholera SIR makes for an attractive deal for investors because it has large industrial plots, plug-and-play infrastructure, low power tariffs and connectivity. The state government has set up the Dholera SIR Development Authority for smooth management, he added. Speaking about ongoing projects, Hareet Shukla, MD, Dholera Industrial City Development Ltd, said the SIR has already attracted investments worth Rs 3,000 crore and the foundation work for two factories has been completed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cm-reviews-progress-at-dholera-sir/articleshow/88080070.cms||---

There is no record of how many senior officials are still to be vaccinated, but those who have not taken it yet or have delayed it have mostly done so due to health reasons. A doctor who did not want to be identified said when the vaccination drive began in the state, politicians, bureaucrats and doctors took the first shot to build public confidence in the jab. Till Chakrabarty took the Covaxin shot on Thursday, he was one of the 1.6 crore adults in Maharashtra who had not taken even one jab since the vaccination drive began on January 16. At present, 45% of the state’s 91.4 million adult population is fully vaccinated. Parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab has said that due to the Omicron threat, the administration has decided to only allow fully vaccinated individuals along with an RT-PCR negative report to enter the Vidhan Bhavan premises. Most government offices, including Mantralaya, have a ‘fully vaccinated’ requirement for entry into the premises. A few days back, the state administration said that only fully vaccinated individuals could travel by public transport or enter public places. When asked about the forthcoming session, Chakrabarty said he had decided that if he had to go to Nagpur for the winter session, he would take an RT-PCR report. As Chakrabarty has taken the Covaxin vaccine, he can take the second shot one month later. A senior bureaucrat said that the final call on the vaccination requirement for the forthcoming assembly session would be taken soon by Vidhan Bhavan officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/had-decided-to-take-rt-pcr-report-to-attend-house-cs/articleshow/88080765.cms||Malathy Iyer

On Friday, city recorded a maximum temperature of 30 degree Celsius (one degree Celsius above normal) and a minimum temperature of 19.5 degree Celsius (four degree above normal). Last year, by this time, maximum and minimum had already dipped to 29.8 degree Celsius and 14.6 degree Celsius respectively. As per Telangana State Development Planning Society figures, lowest minimum temperature of 18.8 degree Celsius was recorded at West Marredpally. IMD officials said that continuous formation of cyclonic circulation has slightly delayed the onset of winter over Telangana. “Northeast monsoon is still active due to which the onset of winter is delayed over Telangana. Districts such as Adilabad, Nirmal, parts of Nizamabad will have below normal minimum temperature. However, in other parts such as Hyderabad, mercury levels will be around normal,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, IMD. Minimum temperature in Hyderabad is likely to touch normal only by second or third week of December. “Once cyclone Jawad and its impact subsides, we can expect a gradual drop in minimum temperature across Telangana,” said Shravani.

---||Kochi||‘Masks lower oxygen in those with cardiorespiratory diseases’||KOCHI: Even as face masks remain the first-line defence against Covid-19, a new study from Kerala shows that use of surgical face masks reduced functional capacity and oxygen saturation in persons with pre-existing cardiorespiratory diseases like connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases (CTD-ILD) during activity. Yet masks can’t be avoided and universal masking must be followed without exceptions, researchers added. “People with severe respiratory problems may avoid using masks when engaged in physical exertion. But at all other times, they should be wearing masks as the presence of ILD increases risk of severe Covid disease. Continuous use of masks as well as other Covid-19 protocols is secondary to none and key to reduce risk of Covid-19 infection,” said Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, clinical immunologist and rheumatologist and co-author of “Effects of face masks on oxygen saturation and functional measures in patients with connective tissue disorder-associated interstitial lung disease” was recently published in British Medical Journal (BMJ). For the study, patients between 18 and 75 years of age with high-resolution CT-proven CTD-ILD were included in this crossover trial. Patients requiring oxygen supplementation and with myositis or lower limb pain were excluded. Initial oxygen saturation was recorded and a standard six minute walk test was carried out with and then without a standard three-layer surgical face mask. Adequate precautions were taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the tests. It was found that the participants covered a mean of 12.9m lesser distance and had a larger drop in saturation while they were wearing masks than when not wearing masks. Though the study doesn’t focus on the effect of wearing masks on healthy people, Dr Shenoy made it clear that healthy people may not face any problems while wearing masks and they should essentially wear it in enclosed spaces and in public areas to prevent spread of Covid infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/masks-lower-o2-in-those-with-cardiorespiratory-diseases/articleshow/88080085.cms||Preetu Nair

Vanrajsinh Rathod, 34, in his FIR said that one Arun Perisudi contacted him in August and sought gram seeds. After negotiations, Rathod agreed to send him 40 tonnes of gram seed, for Rs 21.50 lakh. Perisudi’s aide, Vivek Bafna, then sent their office and warehouse details. To check the office and warehouse, Rathod sent a staffer to Bengaluru, who verified that the company was real. Later, he sent the consignment to the given address on August 23. Perusudi sent a payment cheque but when Rathod deposited it in the bank, it bounced. After a couple of days, Perusudi and Bafna went incommunicado. When Chavda’s staffer went back to check the place, he found that both the office and warehouse had been closed. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bengaluru-man-cons-seed-trader/articleshow/88080081.cms||---

---||Delhi||Class XII: ‘Tricky’ English paper leaves many stumped||New Delhi: Friday was a trying day for Class XII students who wrote the CBSE English exams. Many of them, and their teachers, pointed out problems with the question paper, such as questions with more than one right option in the answer and ambiguously worded questions. These made the paper “challenging” to some of the students. The question paper, with multiple answer choices for each question, comprised a booklet of 24 pages, making it quite a task for schools to print out. Only government schools are being provided printed question papers. A parent complained, “It was a shoddy paper with spelling mistakes and typing errors which seemed particularly jarring in an English paper. There were numerous questions with more than one perfectly valid answers among the choices. To top it all, the answer key provided by the school has several mistakes too, with wrong options marked as the correct ones.” There was one portion that was particularly ambiguous. It was the unseen paragraph on pollution, and it said: “WHO has pointed out that the urban air pollution is responsible for 800,000 deaths and 4.6 million lose their lives every year around the globe." One question asked students which was the correct figure for deaths. Divya Bhatia, principal, Amity International School, Saket, said, “From our school, 194 students sat for the English exam. The paper was challenging and a test of logical reasoning, perceptions, analytical thinking. With 24 pages of questions, students had to manoeuvre between pages and go back and forth when answering text-based questions.” Preparing for the test was itself taxing for schools. Principal Tania Joshi of The Indian School said around 15 teachers were required to print, collage and staple the question sheets. She, however, added, “The students said the paper was fine if they read the fine text.” In the morning, CBSE asked schools to check the answer keys properly. “Although every possible care is taken by the board, there may still be a possibility of some ambiguity in questions or discrepancy in answer keys. However, the Board has a well settled system to address such issues. Therefore, it is informed that the evaluators may check/evaluate the OMRs according to the answer keys provided to them,” the notification said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/class-xii-tricky-english-paper-leaves-many-stumped/articleshow/88080090.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The strawberry farmers in Mahabaleshwar and Panchagani areas of Satara district have been adversely affected due to the unseasonal showers on Wednesday and Thursday. The farmers are now striving hard to drain out the water from their farms to resume the functioning of the root system that has been stopped due to waterlogging. The current weather conditions provide perfect ground for pests and insects to savage the crops. Hence, in order to stop their crops from further damage farmers will have to spray costly pesticides and chemicals. Satara district collector Shekhar Singh visited some of the strawberry fields and witnessed the damage caused by the unprecedented rains. “We are going to make the pesticides and other chemicals available to the marginal farmers to survive the onslaught due to heavy rains. The chemicals will be used to save strawberry grown on over 350 acre,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/satara-admin-makes-pesticides-available/articleshow/88078619.cms||---

Mehboobkhan Pathan, 57, in his complaint stated that a man from the Science City road, who is now based in the US, along with his two aides cheated him by promising to provide visas for Canada and Norway. Pathan, a resident of Juhapura, runs an education visa consultancy firm in partnership with three others. As per the complaint, in December 2019, Amrita Kushwaha — one of the partners — told Pathan that she knew a man named Manoj Sharma who could help them in securing a visa with ease. “Sharma assured me that he can provide a visa for Canada for Rs 15 lakh and that of Norway for Rs 6.50 lakh. He told me that an advance amount of Rs 1.50 lakh for the Canada visa and Rs 2 lakh for the other visa will have to be paid,” Pathan stated in his complaint. Sharma assured Pathan that he would arrange jobs for those going abroad and also promised to return the money if the visa is not granted. Pathan paid Rs 58 lakh to Sharma and his two aides for securing visas for his 28 clients. The money was paid through online transactions and angadias between December 2019 to January 2020. As Sharma didn’t provide the promised visas even after two years, Pathan approached the cops. He filed a complaint of cheating and breach of trust along with criminal conspiracy against Sharma and his two aides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/anandnagar-visa-consultant-duped-of-rs-58l/articleshow/88080088.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Piyush Goyal counters Telangana claims, says FCI yet to receive rice||HYDERABAD: Charging the Telangana government with politicising the paddy procurement issue, Union minister for food and public distribution Piyush Goyal on Friday said the state did not send rice and boiled rice in the current kharif season — as promised by it — to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) despite Centre’s reminders and five extensions. “There are a number of discrepancies in the rice stocks and registers when our teams have gone for a physical verification,” Goyal said in Rajya Sabha. Replying to question raised by TRS floor leader K Keshava Rao, the Union minister said the state government had not sent 17 lakh metric tonnes of boiled rice and 29 lakh MTs of rice to the Centre as part of the ongoing kharif procurement. He said the target of boiled rice procurement for Telangana was 24.75 lakh MTs. Following a request from the state, the Centre had increased the procurement target to 44.75 lakh MTs. “But, so far, the state has supplied only 27.78 lakh MTs of boiled rice and 17 lakh MTs is still pending,” he said. However, the TRS MPs staged a walkout from the Rajya Sabha as they were not satisfied with the reply given by the minister. Goyal said the TRS government had given an undertaking on October 4 that it would not send boiled rice in future to the FCI and promised to procure all the paddy produced in Telangana in the kharif season. Responding to the TRS MPs’ ongoing protests in both houses of Parliament demanding a statement from the Centre on the paddy procurement issue and on providing MSP, Goyal said the Centre had been increasing the procurement target year on year. “The Centre had procured 51.9 lakh MTs in 2018-19 from Telangana and it was increased to 74.54 lakh MTs in 2019-20 and 94.54 lakh MTs in 2020-21. This is the track record of the (Narendra) Modi government,” the minister said. He blamed the Telangana government for not delivering the assured rice to the Centre. “The state government claimed that it had procured 94.53 lakh MTs. But, it has not sent the same. Still, 29 lakh MTs of rice is pending with Telangana ,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/piyush-counters-t-claims-says-fci-yet-to-receive-rice/articleshow/88080723.cms||Koride Mahesh

ACB sleuths said that Ramsing Jayram Patil was caught red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 on behalf of ASI Satish Sayajibhai Somvanshi. Sources said that Somvanshi had demanded Rs 1 lakh from a man for not charging him under the PASA Act. The man was caught in a prohibition case by Valsad rural police some days ago. ASI Somvanshi initially demanded Rs 1 lakh from the man and later the deal was settled for Rs 50,000. As the man didn't want to pay the bribe, he approached ACB, Surat. After a complaint was filed, R K Solanki, PI Surat rural ACB and his team, under the supervision of deputy director N P Gohil, laid a trap near Simada naka in Surat on Thursday. But Somvanshi didn't come to take the bribe money and instead sent his aide Patil. As soon as Patil collected the bribe money from the complainant, the ACB team caught him red-handed.

---||Ahmedabad||PepsiCo’s exclusive rights to potato variety revoked||AHMEDABAD: In what has come as the final victory for Indian farmers and agriculture activists, the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Authority on Friday cancelled US food and beverages giant PepsiCo’s registration of potato variety FL 2027 and with this the company’s exclusive rights to grow this variety of potato, which is used to manufacture chips of PepsiCo’s Lay’s brand. In 2019, PepsiCo India Holding sued farmers from North Gujarat for growing this potato variety and demanded compensation from them for alleged unauthorized planting of the seeds without entering a contract with the company. The company cited its registration of the variety in 2016. The litigation snowballed into a controversy and agriculture activists raised questions against the corporate’s registration of the potato variety and its assertion of exclusive rights. This also forced the government to pressure the company to settle the dispute with the farmers and the company withdrew its litigation. One of the activists, Kavitha Kuruganti, dragged the company before the authority and demanded revocation of PepsiCo’s registration of the potato variety under the provisions of India’s Protection of Farm Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001. She submitted that the grant of certificate of registration was based on incorrect information furnished by the company; that the certificate was granted to a person not eligible for protection; that this granting registration and exclusive right over the variety was not in public interest. Acting on the revocation application filed in June 2019, the authority revoked the company’s registration and accepted the activist’s argument that the law acknowledges farmers’ rights and any attempt to harass and intimidate farmers should be considered a matter of public interest. After the judgment was pronounced, Kuruganti said the judgment set a precedent for all seed and food and beverages corporations and other registrants to not only uphold, but more importantly, not to transgress the legally granted farmers’ seed rights and freedoms in India. “Companies should not think that they are at liberty to harass farmers. We are watching and will disallow any such mischief. For us, any intimidation and harassment of farmers is clearly a matter of public interest. We sincerely hope that the authority will proactively put into place all measures and mechanisms possible to ensure that farmers’ rights are not violated at any cost. The interpretation of ‘public interest’ by the authority today is very progressive. This is a victory for farmers in the country, especially potato farmers in Gujarat, who strongly resisted Pepsi’s onslaught on their rights in 2019,” she added. Reacting to the development, Kapil Shah of Kisan Beej Adhikar Manch said, “We believe that the Authority and the government have a responsibility to let every applicant and registrant under the PPV&FR Act know that their rights do not supersede farmers’ rights. The registrants’ rights are limited to only production of a variety, and not production from a variety.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/pepsicos-exclusive-rights-to-potato-variety-revoked/articleshow/88080094.cms||---

---||Aurangabad||Subsequent registration of offence not a criteria to apply MCOCA: HC||Aurangabad: The Bombay high court bench at Aurangabad held that subsequent registration of an offence can not be a criteria for application of the stringent provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA). A single-judge HC bench of justice M G Sewlikar on November 26 granted bail to a 34-year-old Sonu alias Sandip Mohan Duggal of Gawde mala in Yashoda Nagar, Savedi in Ahmednagar district, who is a co-accused in a February 2017 liquor tragedy that claimed three lives in his village. The police had attributed Sonu a role of collecting empty liquor bottles and handing them over to his father, a canteen owner who was allegedly into supplying illicit liquor, for filling these bottles with country liquor.  The bench, while ordering the bail relief, relied on a couple of HC judgments of 2002 and 2019, which held that for invoking the MCOCA provisions, there must be continuing unlawful activity by an individual, singly or jointly, besides there must be more than one chargesheets and the same ought to have been taken cognisance of by a competent court. The state had submitted, among other things, that a subsequent offence was registered against Sonu. The bench then said such subsequent offence was not enough to invoke MCOCA provisions. The bench said, "Mere registration of the offence is not enough. Requirement is that the charge sheet ought to have been filed and cognizance of the offence ought to have been taken by a competent court. These basic requirements are not fulfilled." The HC ruled that for MCOCA application, a continuing unlawful activity by an individual must be committed singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/subsequent-registration-of-offence-not-a-criteria-to-apply-mcoca-hc/articleshow/88078650.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Omicron can evade immunity derived from past infection: Study||NEW DELHI: A study conducted by scientists from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was detected first, has suggested that the new variant is not just highly transmissible, but it can also evade immunity generated by previous infection. Apart from not offering any insight into whether reinfection leads to severe symptoms, the study also doesn’t look at immune-escape in vaccinated people. However, doctors said the new findings clearly hinted at the possibility of a rise in infections due to the new variant. “The mutation is such that it is almost like a new virus. So, it will be difficult for the antibodies produced either due to a previous infection or vaccination to recognise and neutralise it. Therefore, the risk of spread of the new variant is high indeed,” said Dr Arun Gupta, president of Delhi Medical Council. Earlier, it was thought that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 reduced the chances of reinfection by 80%. The study by South African scientists, which was based on reinfection trends in the country since the beginning of the pandemic, stated that they did not find any evidence of increased reinfection risk associated with circulation of Beta or Delta variants compared with the ancestral strain in routine epidemiological data there. “In contrast, we find clear, population-level evidence to suggest substantial immune evasion by the Omicron variant,” the study added. On the brighter side, doctors said evidence available so far suggested that the new variant did not cause severe symptoms in a majority of cases. “If this trend holds and there isn’t any significant increase in hospitalisations among the infected individuals, then I would say it may actually turn out to be a boon. The infection will provide additional immunity due to natural infection with minimal or no risk of serious illness or death,” said Dr NK Mehra, senior immunologist and honorary emeritus scientist of Indian Council of Medical Research. Mehra added that more data was needed to fully understand the impact of the new variant and the picture would become clearer in the next few days. “The reports of the new variant causing mild illness should in no way mean that people lower their guards. Instead, they should continue to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour. Those who haven’t got vaccinated must get it as early as possible,” said the immunologist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omicron-can-evade-immunity-derived-from-past-infection/articleshow/88080119.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Raising apprehensions about the role of the ICC, the students’ body in a statement said, “Incidents like this reawaken the apprehensions of the JNU community regarding the ICC and the possible gender justice it can deliver when compared to an independent, autonomous body like GSCASH (Gender Sensitization Committee against Sexual Harassment). The role of the ICC has once again been deplorable as no restraining orders have been issued by the nominated body.” In the recommendations provided by the ICC, the accused has been asked to write an apology letter and also submit an undertaking to the committee that he would not engage in such misconduct. Both the accused and the complainant have also been directed to attend three workshops on gender awareness and sensitivity apart from three counselling sessions. The JNUSU, in its statement, said, “In a shocking manner, when the ICC handed over the recommendations after three months of the enquiry, the ICC has resorted to shifting the onus onto the complainant by suggesting that she undertake sessions on gender sensitisation instead of punishing the accused.” Senior officials of the varsity administration could not be reached for a comment.

During the hearing, the petitioner had said that he was not involved in this incident and was being implicated in this case by some people due to political reasons. Police also told the court that there was "no role of Chilwal in the case, so far". Chilwal's name was not in the first list. But, his name purportedly came up when the four accused who were arrested from the Ramgarh Road took his name during investigation. During the hearing, Khurshid's advocates told the court that Chilwal is the main accused and under his leadership the house was attacked. Several people have been arrested in this case, but the main accused is yet to be detained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/khurshids-house-arson-case-stay-on-arrest-for-bjp-member/articleshow/88080152.cms||---

Briefing the media on the party’s plans for the protest rally, Maken blatantly ignored reporters’ queries on holding the public gathering at a time when the Covid-19 cases were rising and threat of its deadlier variant Omicron was high. The state’s ruling party is planning to gather around a lakh people from across the nation for the protest rally, which would be attended by Congress leaders including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi here on December 12. The rally for protesting inflation under the Modi-government was initially announced to be held in Delhi, but the local police denied permission for it. Subsequently, the Congress shifted the rally named "Mehangai Hatao (remove inflation)"to Jaipur. Maken said, "All Congress ministers and leaders will go to every district, block and village to create awareness on how the Modi-government and the BJP were responsible for the inflation and how they failed to control it," He added, "Inflation is being deliberately stepped up to benefit the Modi-government’s crony capitalists. At the international level, the inflation is going down but in India it is going up. The Centre is increasing the excise duty to fill its own pockets and is robbing the common man." Maken said Congress leaders from across the nation will gather in Jaipur for the party event. AICC general secretary, organisation, KC Venugopal and Maken reached Jaipur on Friday to take stock of the preparations for the protest rally. Both the leaders, along with chief minister Ashok Gehlot, PCC Govind Singh Dotasra and Sachin Pilot inspected the city's Vidyadhar Nagar stadium in the presence of senior administration officials. At the stadium, Gehlot told the media that people would teach a lesson to the Modigovernment for its anti-people in the 2024 general elections. "Inflation is affecting people across India. Not granting permission for holding this national rally (in Delhi) is unfortunate because it represents the countrymen’s sentiments. We thank Sonia ji and Rahul ji for choosing Rajasthan for the rally," the CM said. MLAs who stayed back saved govt: GehlotAt an informal meeting of the council of ministers at held his residence to discuss the Congress protest rally, chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday again remarked that the state government was saved in July-August last year by the legislators ‘who stayed back’, which included the BSP-turned-Congress MLAs and the independents. Gehlot’s comment discomforted ministers loyal to Sachin Pilot, as they were among the 19 Congress MLAs who rebelled and left the state to remain in ‘hiding’ last year. Sources said junior minister Murari Lal Meena ‘murmured’ at the meeting that the CM should not be repeating the remark as all Congress MLAs were now with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/maken-avoids-queries-on-covid-says-holding-rally-a-pride-for-raj/articleshow/88080770.cms||---

The division bench of Justice M M Srivastava and Justice Vinod Kumar Bharwani however dismissed the petition filed by senior lawyer P C Bhandari saying that there is no law to prevent the parties from organising the event. The petitioner had challenged the visit of union home minister Amit Shah at a party function in Jaipur on December 5 and the Congress mega rally against price rise to be held at Jaipur on December 12. The court in the morning during the hearing had asked the petitioner whether the functions are organised without the required permission or not as he had not mentioned on this in the petition. The petitioner said he is opposing the function as such because gathering of the huge crowd to the magnitude of people are providing a conducive atmosphere for the spread of the virus. The court also asked where was the petitioner when recently a cricket match was organised at the SMS Stadium in Jaipur. Since the argument could not be completed in the morning, the matter was posted for hearing in the evening. In the evening, petitioner Bhandari argued that organising such an event is a violation of the guidelines issued by the centre. However, the court did not accept the argument. The court said there is no law barring organising political functions. The court also said the estimate on the number of the crowd is also not authenticated by documents in the petition. The PIL is simply based on newspaper reports and no official data has been given. Advocate general MS Singhvi appearing for the state government said the PIL is simply based on newspaper reports. Another (PIL) seeking a ban on the proposed Congress mega rally against price rise to be held in Jaipur on December 12 will come up for hearing on December 6. The petitioner said when the entire country is in deep fear and apprehension about the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, such rallies are uncalled for and will increase the infection chances. The petitioner said the attendees were from all over the country and lakhs of people are expected to participate in the rally, which is being organised by the ruling party in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-court-nixes-plea-seeking-ban-on-rallies/articleshow/88080804.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Shilpa Chowdary’s rich friends lost crores lured by her luxurious lifestyle||HYDERABAD: Socialite Shilpa Chowdary’s ‘investment scam’ may be much bigger than what is now in public domain. While only three women have so far approached cops accusing the socialite of duping them, police sources said that there were many more victims who have individually lost anywhere between Rs 1 crore to Rs 11 crore. Her luxurious lifestyle, a villa worth crores and rich attendees at her kitty parties created a glow that most fell for, buying into her claim of having a successful real estate and film business, police said. Over the past several years, Shilpa slowly roped in people by introducing them to those who had already invested in her plans. Fun was mixed with good food, costly liquor and promise of rich returns for investments in her grand plans in the kitty parties Shilpa hosted at least once or twice a month. Mostly attended by rich housewives, Shilpa baited them with the idea of becoming financially independent by making a killing with a one-time investment. “The victims are from various backgrounds, including wives and relatives of IAS and IFS bureaucrats, who gave her anywhere between Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore. A person even lost Rs 11 crore, but he has not lodged an official complaint,” a source in Cyberabad police told TOI. According to sources, most of them gave Shilpa unaccounted money and, hence, they do not want to approach cops. Officially, the maximum amount she has been accused of cheating is Rs 3.1 crore by complainant number three, Rohini, a businesswoman from Narsingi. The first complaint cited Rs 1.05 crore and was filed by businesswoman V Divya Reddy, which led to Shilpa (46) and husband Krishna Venkat Pradad (56) being arrested on November 27. The second complaint was by superstar G Krishna’s daughter Priyadarshini and mentioned Rs 2.9 crore. The three complaints in all total Rs 7.05 crore. Trouble began for Shilpa once the promised returns didn’t materialise. Cops said that they were now investigating what she did with all the money she got as ‘investments’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shilpas-rich-friends-lost-crores-lured-by-her-luxurious-lifestyle/articleshow/88080142.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by K Rangasamy. According to the petitioner, the alleged construction by a person named Kannan is being made within 15m from the oorani, which would pollute the water. However, the government advocate submitted that the construction is made at a distance of 31m from the oorani and well beyond the prohibited zone. The counsel for Kannan also produced the building plan approval granted for the proposed construction. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan observed that it appears the petitioner had filed this petition only due to personal dispute with Kannan, who is the fifth respondent. There is no public interest involved in this petition. Dismissing the petition, the judges observed that it was their only concern that the sewage water from the newly constructed building should not be discharged inside the ooorani and hence directed Kannan to take appropriate steps to ensure the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-forbear-construction-near-oorani-dismissed/articleshow/88080145.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Omicron fails to put fear among students as rural primary school attendance soars to 56%||Nagpur: Speculations over the severity of the Omicron virus being debated hotly across various traditional and social media platforms has not affected attendance in rural primary schools. On Friday, the third reopening since March 2020, just over 56% of enrolled students were back on campus.In rural Nagpur, Std I-XII are open for physical classes while in the city, only Std VIII-XII are allowed. Chintaman Vanjari, district education officer (primary), said, “On day one itself I said that attendance will start to soar. We started with 51% attendance on Dec 1 and today you can see the results.” The sharp increase in rural school attendance is also due to lack of or poor quality internet connection due to which online classes are not an option. With primary schools in Maharashtra being closed since March 2020, it had been a long wait for many of these kids. A zilla parishad school headmaster said, “Government officials basically kept these kids away from academics for almost two years. Of this, only six or seven months can be justified. The rest of the months these kids without access to the classroom was criminal.” Unicef India too had appealed to the government and championed the cause of reopening schools at the earliest. Unicef’s Maharashtra unit went on to say that keeping schools closed will lead to “generational loss”. After an extremely prolonged period, the Maharashtra government gave the green signal for reopening. There were some concerns, whether or not parents will send their children to school. The biggest reason for such a concern was the news about the Omicron variant surfacing in various countries across the world. The average attendance in the previous reopening phase (for higher classes) has been around 20% more or less.So, for these tiny tots, government officials were expecting even lower figures. But the record breaking 51% attendance in Nagpur’s rural schools set the tone. In Nagpur city, a decision on reopening Std V-VII will be taken after December 10. The state government has still not given permission to reopen Std I-IV in urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/omicron-fails-to-put-fear-among-students-as-rural-primary-school-attendance-soars-to-56/articleshow/88079436.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Hyderabad||HC notice to officials over Hyderabad rain havoc||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday ordered the appearance of GHMC commissioner and Hyderabad district collector before court in connection with a PIL that raised concerns over Hyderabad getting flooded during rains. A bench of Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice N Tukaramji turned critical towards the municipal and revenue officials for not filing counters in a case that sought steps like cleaning of canals to protect Hyderabad from facing floods during the rains. However, following requests from the counsels representing the state government and GHMC, the bench said the commissioner and collector will need to appear before the court on the next date of the hearing if they fail to file the counters in the meantime. The bench was hearing the PIL filed by P Indra Prakash, who wanted the authorities to ensure that the canals from Himayatsagar to Hussainsagar were free from dust and debris. In his plea, the petitioner said some builders were dumping construction waste in the nearby canals. “In some areas, even the canals are encroached. This is impeding the flow of rainwater and causing flooding of the city during a short rain spell,” Prakash said. When state counsel Harender Pershad sought time, the bench reminded him that the state government had sought time in the last hearing (on October 29) also. Prakash appeared as a party in person and complained that none of the government authorities named as respondents had filed the counters so far. The bench served an ultimatum that both the GHMC commissioner and district collector have to be present before the court on January 21, 2022, the next date of hearing, if they fail to file their counters by then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-notice-to-officialsover-city-rain-havoc/articleshow/88080146.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Union minister Amit Shah will visit Jaipur on December 5 to attend party functions. Congress party's mega anti-inflation rally will be held on December 12 at the Vidhadhar Nagar stadium in Jaipur. Both party leaders are worried, but they have left with no other option but to keep silent and make them grand events even at the cost of their health due to rising cases of Covid. The Opposition BJP which has been taking on the government on every issue even during the time of Covid had gone silent on Congress rally as it would boomerang on them. It is leaving no stone unturned to make the visit of Amit Shah a memorable one with a grand welcome at the airport and reception by party workers on the way to the venue at Sitapura on December 5. BJP leaders review the preparations for Shah’s visitChief minister till the other day had been expressing deep concern over the new variant and advising people to follow the guidelines on Friday said he was happy with the party leadership for giving the opportunity of organizing the meet in Jaipur. The meeting is expected to be attended by over a lakh people. It would be a Herculean task for the government if at least the participant wears a mask, leave alone other Covid protocols. Leaders when contacted on condition of anonymity said they were helpless as it was forced upon them. A Congress leader said "the rally was supposed to be held at Delhi but it was denied permission. In Rajasthan the party has a government which is close to Delhi. If the party central leadership decides to organise it in Jaipur, what can we do?" Another leader said, “Ever since the Congress government came to power in Rajasthan, it was acting as the saviour of the Congress during the crisis. During the government formation in various states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan has been hosting MLAs from other states, this time also we have come to the help of the Congress which we have to do.” The BJP leaders also feel that hosting number two in the party now and may be future number 1, is a priority for any party functionary in the state. The party in any case is a divided house and needs unity and strong man Amit Shah could give a much-needed direction to the party. They are not thinking of anything else except to impress Shah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/despite-virus-scare-bjp-congress-netas-out-to-make-rallies-successful/articleshow/88080820.cms||---

After the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) decided to restart primary schools from December 13, the district administration reviewed the preparedness of the schools and permitted them to conduct in-person classes from Monday. Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said, “Around 450 schools are likely to start physical classes from Monday. The preparedness of the schools has been reviewed by the respective authorities and accordingly, the decision has been taken.” There are over 4,000 primary schools in the rural areas with a student strength of around 4 lakh. The chief executive officer of Nashik Zilla Parishad Leena Bansod has directed all the block education officers to ensure that they strictly adhere to the Covid norms before starting the schools for the safety of the students and the teachers. Bansod has also asked the school authorities to conduct a parent meeting on Saturday to inform them about the Covid-appropriate behaviour, Covid norms and other safety measures that would be followed across all the schools. The CEO has directed the school authorities to inform the parents about the remedial measures to be taken if any incident related to the infection surfaces. The education officers have been further asked to conduct training for all the teachers to help them take better care of the students. The teachers would be trained on how to screen the students for the virus and seek help from the medical teams or the nearest health care centre in case of an emergency. The officer has also directed the medical officers, the multi-purpose workers, auxiliary nurse midwives, community health officers and others to visit schools at least twice a week and conduct the health survey of the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/primary-schools-to-start-classes-from-monday/articleshow/88213170.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Earlier this week, TOI had reported about the haphazard manner in which private vehicles are driven and parked at the school campus, which also houses a few government offices. Now, officials have started the process of finding a new location for these offices so that school kids become the ‘sole users’ of the vast land.Due to the hundreds of people visiting these offices, SUVs and two-wheelers are parked randomly and sometimes even driven in a harsh way.The school campus also houses a Aadhar centre, a patwari office and two other government-related offices.Meanwhile, ZP CEO Yogesh Kumbhejkar took action as soon as information reached him.A school teacher, who informed TOI and shared photos and videos, said, “We have been informed that the CEO has directed his team to sort out the issue so that nobody is inconvenienced.”ZP’s extension officer Sharad Bhandarkar told TOI that some of the CEO’s directives have already been implemented. “CEO Kumbhejkar directed me and block development officer Kishore Gazalwar to visit the spot and take stock of the situation. As of today, the vaccination centre which was operating there has been shifted to another location,” said Bhandarkar.He added, “The other government units there include an Aadhar enrolment centre and some offices of the revenue and health department. We met the local heads of all these departments and had a fruitful discussion over relocating.”TOI had highlighted the issue of safety of school kids in the light of the government’s reopening decision. Till a few months ago, the movement of such vehicles would not have had any impact as schools were closed for primary section kids.On December 1, the day schools reopened, attendance in rural area clocked a record 51%. This was much higher than the previous average attendance of 20%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/times-impact-zp-starts-process-of-relocating-offices-from-school-campus/articleshow/88079450.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Police said that on December 1 they received a complaint from S Rangamma who claimed that a burglary took place in her residence and that she lost her ancestral property — 105 tola of gold and Rs 4 lakh cash. In her complaint to Osmania University police, Rangamma raised suspicion against son-in-law Laxman. The accused was nabbed at Arts College railway station on Friday. During interogation, police seized all the stolen property from his possession. The victim had recently visited Kasi on a pilgrimage.

---||Delhi||Uphaar fire tragedy case: Plea by Ansals to suspend 7-year jail nixed||NEW DELHI: The applications filed by real estate barons Gopal and Sushil Ansal seeking suspension of their seven-year jail term awarded in the evidence tampering case related to the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy were dismissed by a court on Friday. The bench said “polluters of the judicial firmament were required to be shown no leniency to maintain the sublimity of the institution, and recourse faith in general public in the administration of justice”. Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil said any interference in the course of justice and any obstruction caused in the path of those seeking justice were an affront to the majesty of law and needed to be viewed seriously. The court also dismissed applications of the Ansals seeking a stay on the fine imposed on them and their release on bail till the disposal of the final outcome of their appeals. The pleas of convicts PP Batra and Anoop Singh and former court staffer Dinesh Chand Sharma seeking suspension of their sentence and fine imposed on them were also dismissed. “The case at hand is one of the gravest of its kind. The offence appears to be the outcome of a calculated design on the part of the appellants/convicts to interfere with the course of justice,” the order stated. On November 8, a magistrate court had sentenced the Ansals to seven-year imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 2.25 crore on them. A fine of Rs 3 lakh was imposed on Batra, Singh and Sharma. The sessions court said that age by itself could not be the sole criteria to grant relief to the convicts, more so when they themselves were involved into the procrastinated trial of the case. “They (convicts) cannot be permitted to take benefit of their own wrongs. On the other hand, inordinate delay in the trial of the case also does cause acute suffering and anguish to the victims and their rights cannot by any yardstick be subservient to the rights of the accused/convicts,” the court further said. It was noted that a criminal justice system drives its legitimacy not only from legislation, but more so from the faith that the public at large reposes in it. The nature of the crime was such that it struck at the very edifice of functioning of the court. “The crime involved in the present case is of a very grave nature. Suspending the sentence at this stage will not only be against the established principles of criminal law, but also shake the confidence of the general public in the judicial system. It is trite to say that if the judiciary as an institution begins to lose the confidence of the public, our cherished value of democracy shall come under serious threat,” the court said. It added that a finding of guilt had already been given by the trial court, so the presumption of innocence that attaches to the accused during the trial did not apply at the stage of consideration of suspension of sentence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-by-ansalsto-suspend-7-yr-jail-nixed/articleshow/88080169.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||Madras high court dismisses Dhayanidhi Alagiri’s plea against summons||MADURAI: The Madras high court on Thursday dismissed a plea moved by former Union minister M K Alagiri’s son Dhayanidhi Alagiri challenging the summons issued by the Madurai II additional district court for CBI cases in a proceedings initiated against him by the enforcement directorate (ED) under Sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The court also directed the trial court to proceed with the complaint and dispose of it as expeditiously as possible, preferably on a day-to-day basis, without adjourning the matter beyond five working days at any point of time. In 2012, the Keelavalavu police in Madurai district registered a case against the petitioner and other people who were associated with Olympus Granites Pvt Limited for alleged illegal mining of granite. The ED in 2013 had initiated proceedings against the petitioner and others. Subsequently, ED had issued a provisional attachment order in 2019 and submitted a complaint before the adjudicating authority, who after inquiry arrived at a finding that there is no material to substantiate that the provisionally attached property of the petitioner as proceeds of crime. Under such circumstances, ED filed a complaint before the special court to proceed against the petitioner and two others. Summons were issued to the petitioner to answer the charge. Challenging the summons, the petitioner filed the present petition. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that this court is of the opinion that a prima facie satisfaction of the adjudicating authority in a preventive proceedings regarding certain properties, noway stands in the way of prosecuting the person accused of the offence of money laundering. The judges said that though the petitioner has raised a plea that he is no way connected with the company, the same has to be proved in the course of trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-alagiris-plea-against-summons/articleshow/88080164.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Death sentence of man who raped boy commuted||MADURAI: The Madras high court Friday commuted the death sentence awarded to a man to 30 years of imprisonment in a case where the man had sexually assaulted and caused the death of a 17-year-old mentally challenged boyin Pudukottai district in 2019. The convict, hailing from Gujarat was working as a daily wage labourer in a stone crushing unit. In December 2019, he kidnapped the victim and sexually assaulted him. The boy who sustained severe injuries was admitted to the Pudukottai Government Medical College Hospital where he died 19 days later due to septicemia. Police booked the man under sections of IPC and Pocso Act and arrested him. In 2021, the Pudukottai district mahila court convicted and awarded death penalty to the man. The case was referred to the HC Madurai bench for confirmation of sentence while the accused also preferred an appeal challenging the conviction and sentence. A division bench of justices S Vaidyanathan and G Jayachandran said that the accused’s intention to cause the said bodily injuries was not to cause death, but to satisfy his lust. The prosecution was able to establish that the death was caused due to the injury, but failed to prove that it was intended by the accused. Hence, the judges held that the death of the victim falls under the definition of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, since the death is caused without any intention to cause death. The judges said that the prosecution has proved beyond doubt that the victim was subjected to aggravated penetrative sexual assault by causing hurt, which in turn, has caused his death. Hence, the judges commuted the death sentence to 20 years rigorous imprisonment for offences under Pocso Act. The court also modified the life sentence under Section 302 of IPC to 10 years imprisonment under Section 304 (ii) of IPC while confirming the seven years sentence for offence under Section 363 (kidnapping) of IPC. The judges said that the sentences for offences under IPC sections shall run concurrently. However, the sentences for offences under Pocso Act and IPC shall run consecutively which is 30 years (20+10).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-escapes-gallows-in-sodomy-of-boy-who-later-died/articleshow/88080158.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Madurai||Post rain, garbage blocks cleaned channels||Madurai: Clearing channels to maintain their original passages to help rainwater run off was one of the main monsoon preparedness activities taken up by Madurai corporation, but post rains, many channels in the city have again turned into garbage dumps or sewage pools with their water flow blocked. Kiruthumal Nathi, Avaniapuram channel and Chinthamani channel carry water from the Vaigai river to the central part of the city through connecting channel near the river bed. Water flows copiously in the river, but not a drop enters this connecting channel thanks to encroachments, stagnant garbage and sewage. “If water flows through these channels, there will be groundwater recharge in the central part of Madurai city which will help it overcome the water crisis in summer,” says A Pandi, president of Melaponagaram residents welfare association and a district committee member of CPM. According to him, water from the river should have entered Anupanadi channel near Puttuthoppu in ward 11, which had been happening for hundreds of years. Now the connectivity with the river has been cut off due to a shutter erected as part of road expansion works. The channel that flows through wards 13, 14 and 15 in Melaponnagaram is just an open sewage channel, he said. S Kumaresan of Arasaradi says most of the channels in the city like the ones in Mapalayam in ward number 16 near Traveller’s bungalow, and the one near Ram theatre in Arasaradi are blocked by encroachments or garbage and continue to be stagnant sewage dumps. N Venkatesan, program leader, Dhan Vayalagam Tank Programme, says sensitization of the immediate stakeholders, the people who live near the channels and water bodies, should go hand in hand with the work on cleaning channels and tanks. Working on an early warning system, where the channels are cleaned on a regular basis more during summer instead of just the monsoon could go a long way in maintaining them in good condition, he said. The CPM says the city needs to be clean before becoming smart which requires making its water channels free of garbage. In wards 15 and 20, the channel that carries water into river Vaigai, is carrying excessive sewage and the water that enters the river is black and dirty, said Pandi. Many of the channels were cleaned and paved with concrete under the JNURM scheme in 2008 but all the money has gone waste, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/post-rain-garbage-blocks-cleaned-channels/articleshow/88080175.cms||---

About 40 families that had been living near the highway in Kannivadi had been allotted land in Alta Nagar in the Reddiarchathiram union, in the foothills of the Western Ghats in 2011 by the DMK government. Soon after that, there was a change in government and the people claimed that they were forsaken by the AIADMK government. They have been seeking pattas for their houses since then, which they have not got.As they do not have pattas, their houses are makeshift huts, which are now damaged due to the rains and do not have drains or toilets. The only thing that they got from the authorities in the last one decade under the AIADMK rule was a borewell, which was laid by the town panchayat authorities, said the residents. They said that this is their only water source and they also use it for drinking. Nithya, 22, a resident said that there are no toilets in this locality and the women and men are forced to defecate in the open lands. Meanwhile, they are scared of going out late at night because the area is swarming with snakes and other poisonous insects after rains. Veeran and Pandi, residents of the locality said that the men return late after work and they have to cross the Kannimar Odai stream which has water. “We don’t even know if many in the outside world know we live here, in such bad conditions,” they said. Dindigul district collector, S Visakan said that they are in the processing of updating status reports of all tribal and Adi Dravida colonies and other small habitations and that all efforts would be taken to fulfill their basic requirements at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sans-basic-amenities-adi-dravida-colony-suffers-in-silence/articleshow/88080171.cms||---

The surprise visit came in response to a complaint by a high court advocate. Trivedi has ordered an inquiry into the allegations. The minister said the state government will adopt a zero-tolerance policy against any form of corruption. A high court advocate had recorded an audio clip where a couple of persons who were not employees of the stamp duty office, were sitting inside and demanding a bribe. The advocate provided this clip to Trivedi. The minister was told that two persons – Pankaj Shah and Raju Parikh — were not employees at the office, but were sitting inside. The minister questioned officers and employees about the unlawful practice and ordered an inquiry into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/revenue-minister-makes-surprise-visit-to-stamp-duty-office/articleshow/88080176.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Samples with <25 CT value under lens for Omicron||Pune: Research laboratories in Maharashtra have started prioritising positive samples of Covid-infected patients without travel history with less than a 25 cycle threshold (CT) value for genome sequencing to rule out the presence of Omicron in the community, the latest variant of concern of SARS-CoV-2. A low CT value indicates a high viral load. For those with a travel history to at-risk countries or close contacts of such travellers, positive samples would be sequenced irrespective of the CT value criterion, said Rajesh Karyakarte, the state coordinator for genome sequencing, on Friday. A Bengaluru doctor found infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 despite not having any travel history has raised concerns about its presence in the community. The doctor had volunteered for testing after developing symptoms such as a cold and bodyache. On testing positive, the hospital where he worked sent his swab sample for genomic sequencing as his CT value was less than 25. The Omicron variant was detected in his sample on Thursday. Karyakarte said, “We have started prioritising samples with less than 25 CT values for genome sequencing in Maharashtra. For some districts, we have stretched this limit up to 30 CT value because the Covid case count has gone down significantly in some places in Maharashtra. The objective is to ensure an adequate number of samples from every district is sequenced.” He said, “The samples need a high viral load because they will be analysed again during genome sequencing. Some portions (viral particles) get used up during the first test with the RT-PCR machines. Hence, samples with a high viral load are preferred over samples with a lower viral load.” The CT value was a useful screening criterion for sequencing, experts said. “A study from AIIMS in Odisha concluded the proportion of patients with CT value less than 25 was higher during the second Delta wave in India and hence it (the CT value) may act as an early indicator of an upcoming surge,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force. Even in the vaccinated, the viral load of Delta variant in the patients’ nose with breakthrough infection was similar to unvaccinated individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-samples-with-lt25-ct-value-under-lens-for-omicron/articleshow/88080854.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||International flyers allege lack of Covid testing facilities at Delhi airport||NEW DELHI: Even on Day 5 of Indira Gandhi International Airport having made Covid-19 testing mandatory for flyers from 11 countries exposed to the Omicron coronavirus variant, the arrangements there left the passengers arriving from these countries in dismay. TOI spoke to people arriving from at-risk countries on Friday. Shaswati Das was one of them. She said, “I pre-booked the Rapid RT-PCR test on Air Suvidha portal and paid Rs 3,500 in advance. My flight was already delayed by two hours due to operational issues and landed in Delhi at 2.45am. I was shocked to be asked to stand in the same queue as the one where other passengers were being tested with no benefit of my pre-booking. And there were only three staffers to process the passengers of a flight that had already arrived and ours. They were obviously overworked and ended up making errors on the test documents. It took me an hour to get the receipt and another two hours to get my test report. During the total of four troublesome hours, I found no refreshments or water available nearby.” The airport offers passengers two tests: Rapid RT-PCR and RT-PCR at, respectively, Rs 3,500 and Rs 500. The report for the former is supposed to be much quicker than the six hours for the latter. Aman Narang, also flying in from London, too opted for the Rapid RT-PCR test and had a better experience than Das, completing the mandatory procedures within two hours. Avtar Singh wasn't so lucky. He arrived from Georgia at 6am and was to have caught a flight to Amritsar. “Due to the long wait to get tested, I missed the connecting flight,” said Singh. “I wasn’t aware of the Air Suvidha app and was expecting assistance from the airport staff. But everything was chaotic. Nobody was cooperating with us in getting our test report or immigration clearance done quickly. We had to constantly pester them for everything. I underwent a lot of hassles at the airport today and hope they put in place more passenger-friendly facilities soon.” Shakti and Saroj, both senior citizens coming to Delhi from Muscat via London, too struggled. The couple said that there was nobody to guide them at the airport and they were left completely on their own to figure out the Covid test procedures. “To add to the tiring journey of 28 hours, two elderly people like us did not even find water or chairs for those waiting for the tests,” complained Saroj. “What is the point of paying Rs 3,500 each when you are made to wait for as long as four hours?” The various passengers that TOI talked to on Friday believed most of these problems could easily be resolved if the staff deployment for the at-risk arrivals was boosted. An airport official said, “More than a thousand passengers are being tested every day. We have made adequate arrangements for this. There are a few challenges, but things are smooth.

---||Jaipur||Vicky Kaushal-Katrina Kaif wedding: Jaipur administration to enforce strict security, Covid norms||JAIPUR: The guests coming to attend the wedding of actors Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif should either be fully vaccinated or should produce an RT-PCR negative report. This was decided in a review meeting chaired by district collector Sawai Madhopur on Friday wherein the collector also asked the authorities to ensure that Covid guidelines issued by the state’s home department be followed at the wedding. Rajendra Kishan, district collector, held a meeting along with the senior police officers and officers from the district administration to review security measures to check any commotion ahead of the wedding. It was also decided in the meeting that the district police in Sawai Madhopur would provide adequate security outside the wedding venue. Also, the village panchayat at the Chauth ka Barwada area has been asked to ensure proper sanitation and complete repairs of lights, if needed. Kaushal and Kaif and the guests are expected to start arriving from December 6 onwards. He asked the officials that inside the marriage venue, there would be the private security brought by the organisers of the wedding. However, police will ensure smooth traffic passage on roads in Sawai Madhopur. “Though the marriage ceremony is a private function, but in view of the possibilities of commotion, the police should make proper arrangements on the roads connecting the marriage venue,” Kishan told the police in the meeting. Similarly, instructions were issued to the gram panchayat for vehicle parking, lighting and cleanliness in the fair ground. Also, barricading has been done at the Chauth Mata bypass connecting the hotel. “We should ensure that no commotion takes place while the guests start arriving at the venue,” he added. The district collector also directed that for any visit to the Ranthambore National Park by the guests, no extra vehicles should be allowed. Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) would be deployed around the marriage venue, while the police will also make some traffic diversions to ensure no commotion takes place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vicky-katrina-wedding-admn-to-enforce-strict-security-covid-norms/articleshow/88080852.cms||---

The TSRTC is likely to enhance the bus fare across the state by almost 25-30%. Defending the corporation's move, Sajjanar said, "TSRTC would never lie to burden its commuters. But given the current situation, a fare hike is unavoidable. It is inevitable due to the steady increase in diesel price, spare parts and overall cost of operations.” The TSRTC caters to 37 lakh passengers each day. The last fare revision was made in December 2019 but it didn't aid the corporation due to the subsequent lockdown imposed in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition to this, diesel prices have gone up to Rs 94 from Rs 70 since the last fare hike. “Each day our buses require at least 6.80 lakh litres of diesel. Steady increase in diesel prices made huge losses to the corporation. Prices of spare parts have shot up heavily after Covid-19,” he said. Steady increase in diesel price, spare parts and overall cost of operations are inevitabe for the bus fare hike.

The cylinder now costs Rs 2,235 after the price was increased by Rs 268 in the first week of November and by Rs 100 a couple of days ago. “It is the same LPG for a 14.2 kg domestic cylinder that is available for around Rs 900 and for lesser price for automobiles too. There is no such disparity in the price of diesel for private vehicles, public transport vehicles and commercial goods carriers,” says K L Kumar, president of Madurai hotels association. “We bought a 19 kg cylinder for Rs 1,333 in November 2019 which remained the same in November 2020 (Rs 1,337), but climbed to 1,438 this January and to 2,235 now,” the Tamil Nadu Hotels Association joint secretary added. Kumar will be shelling out Rs 1.84 lakh more for cylinders in his 15 hotels while smaller eateries and teas stalls like the one owned by K Senthil in Anna Nagar need two cylinders every one or two days. “We prepare tea and snacks and sell at a very less price. We cannot afford to lose consumers by increasing its price by one rupee a cup,” he said. He said he would be spending Rs 16,500 more on LPG from this month. Hoteliers said some small eateries could be pushed to using domestic LPG cylinders illegally. Tamil Nadu chamber of commerce and industry president N Jegatheesan says the hike is another blow to the hotel industry that is impacted by the pandemic and price hike of raw materials due to diesel price hike. “In the last two months, crude oil price fell by about 14 USD per barrel and the price of other petroleum products has come down slightly. We request oil companies and Union government to withdraw the price hike on commercial gas cylinders and reduce GST on it from 18% to 5% in the interest of all walks of life,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lpg-price-hike-hits-hotels-tea-stalls-hard/articleshow/88080192.cms||M K Ananth

The half-inch pipelines were laid two to three decades ago, but as per the current population, it is necessary to have at least four-inch pipelines to supply water with good pressure.Devashish Gurjar, a resident of Purani Basti in ward 24, said the government boring is not able to supply water to the interior areas and houses that are located in elevated areas. "It’s been years that water is not reaching most of the houses. The pressure is very low and many of us have to go down to the boring tap, to fill up buckets and take back home," said Gurjar.Manak Sharma, councilor of ward 24, said he had been receiving regular complaints from the people for a long time. "A big project has to be taken up soon," he said.Councilor of ward 8, Rajesh Mahawar, said he had written it to the PHED officials to change the half-inch pipelines. "Population has increased, but the pipelines were not changed. Every other day these half-inch pipelines burst due to excessive pressure and the colony people have to shell out money for repair works," said Mahawar. Ghanshyam Kumar, a resident of the Top-Khana Chaukari, said despite this being an election issue, residents have never received any form of help from the government.However, officials at the PHED said a project for laying down new pipelines has been sent to the department. Sanjay Sharma, executive engineer project looking after Walled City, said, "A proposal to change the pipelines of Purani Basti and Top-Khana Chaukari has been sent to the government. Around Rs 77 crores estimate has been made, but it is yet to be approved by the government." Under the project, all pipelines will be changed and a population of 4 lakh will benefit. However, it will take some time to get it approved and implemented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/walled-city-residents-seek-water-pipeline-change/articleshow/88080860.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The interiors are yet to be done although the initial contract mentioned that the library was to be completed in nine months. It’s been five years, three higher education ministers and vice-chancellors have changed, but the new library is yet to be fully functional. Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) state secretary Hushyaar Meena said, "This library aims to provide books online with the latest technology. There will be a better collection of books and more sitting areas for students. We have been waiting for a long time, but no one has taken this up seriously. University administration is not willing to complete the work." The new library will be digitalised to reduce the dependency on manpower. There will be a special chip in the books to keep track. According to the information provided by the university administration, students will have to punch their smart library cards to get a book issued. Library cards will have information on all books issued in the past as well. At the entry gates, sensors will be installed that will start beeping if any book is taken out without being issued. This will help in preventing book theft as well. Library in-charge professor SL Sharma said, "We had invited tenders for the furniture and interior of the library earlier, but due to some technical fault it was not possible. Now, we will again invite tenders. We are expecting that within three months we will be able to complete the process." According to university sources, the administration wants to invite the governor and chief minister Ashok Gehlot for the inauguration of the library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/students-of-ru-await-digital-library-launch/articleshow/88080862.cms||---

With this, the total number of such persons, mostly persons with a history of travel to countries such as the UK, France, Belgium and South Africa, isolated at Lok Nayak has reached 12. “Eight of them are Covid positive while the test reports of four others are still awaited,” said a senior official. He added that the genome sequencing of samples taken from them is also in process and results should be available in the next two to three days. All travellers, except one with a history of travel to Tanzania, are asymptomatic, the official added. “The person with a history of travel to Tanzania has high fever and body ache and he is being administered medications to manage the symptoms,” he informed. Covid-19 was marked by high fever, dry cough and a dip in oxygen saturation in the first and the second wave. But, reports from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was detected first, suggest the new variant leads mostly to extreme fatigue and body ache among other symptoms. A dedicated team of doctors, nurses and other staff members have been deputed in the ward. They are trained to look after the high risk patients with utmost precaution so as to not get themselves infected, he added. The Lok Nayak hospital director said all staff members posted in the ward meant for isolating international travellers from countries affected by Omicron variant have been asked to wear PPE kit and maintain distance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-more-with-travel-history-admitted/articleshow/88080236.cms||---

It may be recalled that the up-ghat road leading to the sacred abode of Lord Venkateswara was severely damaged at multiple places following landslides triggered by incessant rains on Wednesday. TTD, which sealed off the second ghat road which was no longer safe for travel, made alternative arrangements for the devotees along the first ghat road. Following a series of meetings and inspections by TTD engineers and IIT experts, the temple body began repairing the second ghat road. Subba Reddy asked the officials to allow traffic till the twin-ghat road link point and divert the traffic from the second ghat road to the first one from Saturday onwards. Speaking to reporters later, TTD chairman observed that heavy boulders fell on the ghat road damaging it at multiple places. “As safety of devotees is our utmost priority, we will take up appropriate measures to prevent landslides on the ghat road at all costs and will not think of the expenditure part”, asserted Subba Reddy. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams board member P Ashok, additional EO AV Dharma Reddy, CVSO Gopinath Jatti, IPS, and IIT professor KS Rao and TTD’s engineering department officials were present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-to-complete-ghat-road-repairs-by-dec-end/articleshow/88079500.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The villagers also claimed that they heard sounds which seemed like two animals were fighting. Most probably the cub’s mother was involved in a fight with another leopard because if it would have been a tiger then we would have found signs of injury to the mother as well”, said a forest official. Officials refuted any signs of foul play and according to the state of the cub’s body, it appeared to have died in early hours of Friday morning.The Ranthambore reserve has a core area of 392sqkm, with a buffer zone of 1,342sqkm, officials claimed that territorial fights between them are becoming frequent. “The tiger and leopard population are steadily increasing in the park and we have over 75 tigers and double that leopards so it is only natural that there would be territorial fights. In this case, the cub was the collateral damage in a fight between two animals”, added the official. In the past also experts have lamented that the shrinking space due to increasing population, the big cats have to frequently safeguard their territories and safety of the cubs is always precarious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/six-month-old-leopard-cub-found-dead-in-ranthambore/articleshow/88080864.cms||---

---||Madurai||Madurai: Cops find new way to check locked houses||MADURAI: Madurai district police have launched a new QR code feature for better surveillance of locked houses. Residents going out of town can generate a QR code from the existing ‘Madurai Kavalan’ app and affix it at their houses. The system has been made such that the QR code will be scanned by the police patrolling units. The time when the police checked the house will be updated to the residents as well as the police control room. Police sources said that the new feature has been introduced to bring down the number of house breaking cases on the outskirts of the city. The app already has the facility for people to intimate locked houses by mentioning basic details such as the from date and to date that the occupants will be out of town, their address and the police station under which they are located. “Those houses are checked by the police during their night patrol. Now we are bringing in the option wherein people can generate a QR code from their mobile phone, take a printout of the same and affix it on their house or a prominent place on their street. It will be scanned by the police twice or thrice every night,” superintendent of police for Madurai district V Baskaran told TOI. The SP said that 44 night patrolling units will be on the move across the district on two-wheelers and that they will scan the QR codes late at night, early hours of the next day and by the end of the night patrolling duty. Each time it is scanned the resident will receive an SMS, giving them the confidence that their house is safe in their absence due to regular monitoring by the police. It also helps police officers monitor the movement of their night patrol teams. “Such QR-based monitoring is already done at random locations where regular offenders reside so that they will be aware that the police are monitoring their movements at night. The respective inspectors will advise Tasmac outlets, pawn shops and jewellery outlets to affix QR codes in front of their outlets so that they will be monitored by the police,” the SP added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cops-find-new-way-to-check-locked-houses/articleshow/88080194.cms||---

---||World||Concern over Covid-19 infections in children under 5 as South Africa's daily cases shoot up||JOHANNESBURG: South African experts have expressed concern about the rising number of Covid-19 infections among young children, even as the country recorded a further 16,055 infections and 25 deaths overnight on Friday. "We have always seen children not being heavily affected by the Covid epidemic in the past (and) not having many admissions (to hospitals). In the third wave, we saw more admissions in children under five and in teenagers who were 15 to 19. "Now, at the start of this fourth wave, we see quite a sharp increase across all age groups, but particularly in the under-fives," said Dr Waasila Jassat of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) at a media briefing by the Health Ministry on Friday. "As expected, the incidence is still lowest in children. However, the incidence in those under five is now second highest and second only to the incidence in those over 60. "The trend that we are seeing now that is different from what we saw before is the particular increase in hospital admissions in children under five years,” Jassat added. Dr Michelle Groome, also from the NICD, said more research would be done to investigate the reasons behind this phenomenon. “It is still very early on in the wave. At this stage, it has just started in the younger age groups and we will know more (by) monitoring this age group in the coming weeks. “We do just need to highlight the importance of surge preparedness to also include paediatric beds and staff,” Groome said. Dr Ntsakisi Maluleke, an official of the health department in Gauteng province, which is the worst hit with up to 80 per cent of the daily infections, also expressed concern. “The phenomenon of younger age groups as well as pregnant women having increased infection is currently being investigated,” Maluleke said. “We are hoping that in the coming weeks we will also be able to give reasons for why this particular cohort of patients is having increased infections,” she added. Health Minister Joe Phaahla said at the briefing that infections and positivity rates were rising in seven of South Africa's nine provinces. “Only the Free State and Northern Cape are currently showing low numbers and low positivity rates. Even though with them, we are not talking about the one to two per cent, but between three and five per cent positivity rates," he said. “While we are still dealing with few days and limited data, indications are that this variant is indeed highly transmissible, including infections of people who have been vaccinated, but the infections are causing mostly mild illness, especially for those who are vaccinated," the minister said. Phaahla said hospital admissions were dominated by those who are not vaccinated and young people below 40, most of whom are not vaccinated. “At this stage, even in Gauteng province, which accounts for 80 per cent of the new daily infections, we have not yet reached threatening stages in terms of our hospital capacity and new hospital admissions. “The trend is indeed that of a rapid rise in cases, but we hope that the mild nature of the illnesses among those who are infected will continue to be the dominant feature,” the minister said. Phaahla provided an assurance that both the national and Gauteng provincial health services will be able to handle those who become seriously ill. However, one risk identified was that even if they have mild illnesses, health care workers would have to go into isolation leading to shortages of skilled staff at hospitals. The health minister said national and provincial authorities were looking into addressing this urgently. Dr Ramphelane Morewane of the National Department of Health said a contingency plan has been put in place across South Africa to ensure that hospitals never run short of oxygen during the fourth wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/concern-over-covid-19-infections-in-children-under-5-as-south-africas-daily-cases-shoot-up/articleshow/88081935.cms||---

The second dose coverage is very important in order to complete the vaccination and provide full protection from serious disease and death to the eligible people. Compared to the state average, Bhandara, Gondia, Nagpur, Washim and Wardha districts in the region have better second dose coverage than Maharashtra’s 42.3% overall average. In all other districts, less than 40% of the eligible people have taken the second dose. With this, it’s nearly impossible for the region to achieve 100% vaccination by December 31. However, the second dose coverage of Nagpur division is better than other parts of the state. Deputy director of health, Nagpur division, Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said joint efforts have made it possible. “Apart from above 50% coverage of the second dose in Gondia and Bhandara, Nagpur district has also covered nearly 50% adults with the second dose. Gadchiroli is the only district where second dose coverage is less than 35%. We are working on it,” said Dr Jaiswal. Bhandara collector Sandip Kadam said the district has always been in the top five in the state. “Awareness and cooperation by locals made Bhandara the first district in Vidarbha to achieve 50%-plus vaccination coverage of the second dose. We are also hopeful to cross 65% soon,” he said. The situation in Amravati division is, however, alarming. Barring Washim, no other district out of the five in the division has more than 40% of the second dose coverage. Amravati, the divisional headquarters, has only 31.1% population covered with the second dose, which is even less than tribal-dominated Gadchiroli. Yavatmal (30.57%) is at the bottom while the divisional headquarters of health department Akola has covered only 31.1% adults with the second dose. Akola collector Neema Arora said the administration has been taking all necessary initiatives to boost the vaccination. “We have organized a cycle rally on December 4. Many events and rush outs to rural population are under way,” she said. Akola’s resident deputy collector Sanjay Khadse said the number of second dose coverage will see surge in the second half of December, because many have taken the first dose late.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-bhandara-and-gondia-have-50-2nd-dose-coverage-in-vidarbha/articleshow/88080230.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

Though it is good news for the public, the government contractors are a bit worried as they had to start work with a serious concern unaddressed. The contractors are concerned about the sudden rise in prices of quarry materials. The quarry and crusher owners have increased the prices of granites and gravels citing huge losses they suffered having to shut down their operations multiple times this year owing to bad weather. In fact, the quarry owners here had also gone on a strike after the contractors refused to purchase materials at the revised rates. This strike was called off after the district collector convened an emergency meeting on Sunday in which the representatives of quarry and crusher owners and government contractors attended. “Earlier, a cubic feet of three quarters inch metal (gravel) was priced at Rs 32. Recently, they wanted to hike the price to Rs 36 per cubic feet. After the meeting with the collector they have agreed to reduce Rs 2. But the reduced price is still a burden on us,” said A Manaf, the district working president of All Kerala Government Contractors Association. Similarly, the price of many other raw materials used for construction has been increased. If the government would not sanction additional funds the contractors will have to incur huge losses, Manaf said. He added that despite their concerns remaining unaddressed, they have resumed work to save the face of the government. There has been huge pressure on the contractors from the government to complete on-going projects as the PWD minister was criticised by the state High Court recently over the deplorable condition of most roads in the state. “Compared to the prices here, the rates of raw materials in Tamil Nadu are almost half. But there are logistical hassles involved in choosing that option,” Manaf said. According to PWD officials, the government had recently sanctioned maintenance works of as many as 55 roads that were damaged in the recent rains. If the concerns of contractors over the rising prices of raw materials are not addressed soon, those works are likely to be affected. The works of Pappanamcode - Malayinkeezhu road and Attingal - Puthenpalam - Venjaramoodu road are two of the main projects that have been resumed from Thursday. The PWD officials concerned said that the works of these major roads will not be affected by the price issue as more than 50% of the works were completed before the rains. The works that are pending to be completed involve surfacing of the road by laying of bitumen. A total of around 20 projects, including major and minor roads, were affected in the district owing to the incessant rains that lashed the district last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/public-construction-activities-resume-in-district-as-rains-stop/articleshow/88080211.cms||---

The instructions from the civic administration came after the Nashik district court gave a verdict in its favour. As per government norms, the NMC had decided to recover lease rate as per 8% of the RR, but shop holders had opposed the new lease rate and moved court on the issue three years ago. After the verdict, the civic administration has started sending letters to the shop holders asking them to pay rent with dues as per the new formula. NMC officials said the civic body’s annual income through lease of shops is estimated at around Rs 3 crore. “But NMC’s income will increase by another Rs 5 crore annually. Moreover, it is also expected to receive dues for the past three months, amounting to Rs 14 crore,” an NMC official said. “We started implementing the lease rate at 8% of the RR rate from financial year 2017-18. But shop holders did not pay the rent as per the revised rent and moved district court. Almost three years later, the court has given its verdict in favour of the NMC. Hence, we have started sending letters to the shop holders asking them to pay their rent as per 8% of the RR rate along with their dues of the last three financial years,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-asks-shop-owners-to-pay-lease-at-8-of-rr-rate/articleshow/88078802.cms||Tushar Pawar
---||Mumbai||Writers losing freedom due to whims of those in power: Javed Akhtar||MUMBAI: Poet- lyricist Javed Akhtar has expressed concern over the steady encroachment of a writer’s space by forces inimical to freedom of expression. “If you try to say or write something which is in the larger interest of the nation, you are promptly dubbed a ‘rashtra-drohi’ (traitor),” Akhtar said. He was speaking as chief guest at the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, which began its proceedings in Nashik on Friday. “In the past, the nawabs, jahagirdars and zamindars used to patronise poets and writers—but only if the latter talked of love, stars and flowers. Poets who wrote about tears and sweat were not wanted. The present-day political nawabs and zamindars are no better. They don’t want a writer to portray the truth—the social reality which envelops us,” said Akhtar who has often been the target of right-wing radicals for upholding Nehruvian values. Akhtar exhorted writers and artists to keep away from political parties as, he said, power muffles dissent. “Every political party has its thought process and discipline. They will ask you not to swerve an inch from the party’s stated policies,” he argued. Stating that both writers and citizens were fast losing their freedom because of the whims of those in power, Akhtar urged the political establishment to not stifle voices of dissent. Recalling the role of the Progressive Writers’ Association (PWA) in pre-Independent India, Akhtar said the left-centred body had, at its inaugural conclave held in Lucknow in 1933, resolved to write about the angst and aspirations of farmers and labourers, and thus give a push to the freedom struggle. He said it was time to draw strength from the PWA movement which, he pointed out, had inspired Annabhau Sathe, the iconic Marathi litterateur and one of the earliest voices of the Dalit identity. Stating that a writer should record his creative experiences in a simple language which touches the chord of the masses, Akhtar said Marathi saint-poets such as Jnaneshwar and Tukaram wrote in an unadorned style. “So did Hindi saint-poet Tulsidas who wrote the Ram Charit Manas in Awadhi, which was the language of the millions in the Hindi belt,” he added. Akhtar said the Marathi plays of P L Deshpande, Vijay Tendulkar and Achyut Vaze offered him a set of new interpretations of life and times. Praising Muktabai and Bahinaiee, the saint poets of medieval Maharashtra, Akhtar said that the duo wrote 800 years ago without fear or favour. In contrast, the Bronte sisters of England had to adopt a male pseudonym 150 years ago, lest the male-dominated literary establishment of Britain was upset. “And upset it was,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-writers-losing-freedom-due-to-whims-of-those-in-power/articleshow/88081691.cms||Ambarish Mishra

The sheer volume of drugs seized recently indicate the gravity of the situation. Ernakulam rural police have seized over 225kg of ganja and 200g of MDMA, also known as ecstasy, worth lakhs in the last one month alone. In the past two-and-a half years, Ernakulam rural police had seized over 526kg of ganja. During this period, they had also seized 255g of hashish oil, 2.45kg of MDMA, 250g of brown sugar and 75 LSD stamps. District police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick said that a strong network for gathering intelligence and prompt action on every information collected were the reasons behind the successful seizures in the district. “We have been following a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to drug cases. Preventive action under CrPC and Kerala Anti-social Activities prevention (Kaapa) Act is taken against offenders,” he said. “We are not only foiling attempts to smuggle in drugs, but are taking proper follow-up action to arrest everyone involved in the network. Once arrested, we are also collecting the history of these accused to see if they have any previous cases and have violated any bail conditions from their past cases. If that is the case, we file a report against these persons at court. Also, we facilitate awareness classes to youths who are being targeted by such rackets,” said Karthick. The recent mega seizures by the rural police started when the police foiled an attempt to smuggle large volumes of ganja on November 8, by intercepting two cars on the highway. They seized 225kg of the contraband from them at Karukutty. Days after this seizure, the smugglers again attempted to smuggle drugs through the same route. On November 20, rural police had seized 168g of MDMA from Kariyad after intercepting a car. In October, the rural police had busted an attempt to courier 31 kg ganja to Kerala from Andhra Pradesh. In November last year, the rural police had seized 140kg of ganja in two separate operations. Based on information received from the accused in this case, sleuths seized another 35kg of ganja which was stashed at a rented house at Avoli. Officials said that the accused were using various methods to smuggle drugs. “Women are tagged along to make it look as if the smugglers are on a family trip,” said an official. He added that while the major source of ganja coming to the district is from the eastern coast of the country, synthetic drugs are smuggled in from cities like Bengaluru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spike-in-quantity-of-drugs-seized/articleshow/88080209.cms||Disney Tom

A junior health nurse has been suspended pending inquiry in the incident. The incident had occurred on Thursday at the health centre when two children had come to take the preventive vaccination for the 15-year-olds. However, they were given the Covishield vaccine from the health centre by mistake. This was noticed when another child of this same age group and a friend of the other two children, had come to take the same preventive vaccination. The nursing staff informed her that the vaccination is not available and told the child to come the next day. However, the child informed the nursing staff that her two friends had taken this vaccination a few minutes back.This brought out the mistake that occurred earlier when the parents of these two children reached the hospital and questioned the hospital authorities. Only then the hospital authorities also realised that the vaccination given to those children were Covid vaccine. The parents and various political parties staged a protest against the hospital authorities. Soon the two children who took the Covid vaccine were admitted to the hospital for observation. At present they are not having any serious health issues after the vaccination. They are continuing under observation. Following the incident the health department ordered a probe to find out how such a grave error occurred in the health centre. The district medical officer Dr Jose D’cruz reached the health centre on Friday and had discussions with the hospital authorities. He also met the parents of these two children. The hospital authorities told the district medical officers that these two children had come to the vaccination area meant for the Covid vaccines and hence it was given. However, the hospital authorities have to collect the details of the person, including their age and Aadhar card also has to be verified. In this incident the hospital authorities did not collect these details from the children. Hence a serious lapse in the procedure for giving the vaccination has been found against the hospital authorities. The district medical officer has submitted a detailed report to the health minister in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/health-dept-probe-on-into-vax-mix-up-issue/articleshow/88080222.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Covaxin may have edge over Covishield in tackling Omicron: Experts||Nagpur: The latest coronavirus variant, Omicron, has triggered concern worldwide, ranging from efficacy of vaccines to monoclonal antibody therapy, even as scientists are still working to record concrete data and draw inferences. Dr Prashant Joshi, professor and head of the department of general medicines, AIIMS, Nagpur, said Covaxin may be a better shield against the new variant as it is a ‘whole virion inactivated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine’. “Going by the initial findings trickling out, it seems Covaxin is likely to be more effective against the Omicron variant than Covishield, which is a ‘virus vector vaccine directed against the spike protein’,” said Dr Joshi. “As the new Omicron variant has many mutations in the spike protein, the thinking is that Covaxin may have an edge over Covishield, but it is not yet proven and needs to be put to test,” he said. Joshi, who believes monoclonal antibody therapy will work on Omicron, said there is no data currently to suggest either it would fail or help make a turnaround. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said it’s a theoretical assumption that Covaxin would be more effective against the latest variant, as it has all the antigens, but essentially such a theory needs to be proved beyond all doubts. “Covishield is a specific vaccine, which is generally prepared by copying the sequence of the spike protein. Covaxin is made from the antigen of the virus and so may have better chance to protect,” he said, adding that tweaking the vaccines has huge economic implications for pharmaceutical companies. Shinde also said he has used monoclonal antibodies on two of his doctor patients, who recovered at rocket speed. “Pharmaceutical companies may need to come up with the second generation of monoclonal antibody, which may have substantial financial burden,” he said. Dr Nilesh Agrawal, deputy director, administration, Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said his pharmacy has monoclonal antibody stock, but he wants to wait and watch before discarding them. “Out of the two patients of Omicron in Bengaluru, one was successfully treated with monoclonal antibody. Hence, we are brainstorming whether to return the stock or hold them back,” said Dr Agrawal. Another prominent infectious disease specialist Dr Ashwini Tayade said the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody is uncertain as it works on the spike proteins where multiple mutations have taken place. “The latest anti-viral drug Molnupiravir has more chance against Omnicorn as it helps reduce viral loads and stops progression to severity,” she said. Critical care consultant Dr Nirmal Jaiswal said as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) the mRNA vaccine may not work but Covishield and Covaxin may help. “As far as the monoclonal antibody therapy goes, the one used during the earlier waves may not work. The latest monoclonal antibody therapy of ‘Sotrovimab’ from UK is more effective against Omicron as per the latest findings,” he said. Dr Rajan Barokar, director of critical care unit at Kingsway Hospital, said amid all the speculation, a high level of precaution is being followed at his hospital, including special measures like opening of a fever Out Patient Department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covaxin-may-have-edge-over-covishield-in-tackling-omicron-experts/articleshow/88080242.cms||Soumitra Bose

The minister said Sree Narayana Guru’s message of ‘mutual respect and tolerance’ is of eternal relevance. “When we look at the world, we can see that intolerance and lack of mutual trust has been the root cause of strife at all times. Keeping the Guru’s message in mind will help us overcome our petty ego and rid the society of all kinds of strife and disharmony,” Riyas said. The office complex at the digital museum will serve as a facilitation centre which will serve pilgrims visiting the museum, being built at a budget of Rs 9 crore. The museum, which is to be completed in a 8,000-sq.ft area, will throw light on the life of the Guru and his teachings that profoundly influenced the transformation of Kerala into a modern society. The construction is being undertaken by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society based in Vadakara of upstate Kozhikode. Already a convention centre worth Rs 9.90 crore has been constructed as part of projects totalling Rs 18.90 crore.

---||Pune||Tired resident doctors want recruits on-boarded faster||Pune: Just two batches of resident doctors to manage thousands of patients visiting government hospitals in the state every day is an overburden, a letter from the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research said. The association had decided to go on strike from Saturday but has deferred it to the next week. “A meeting of 20 local MARD units of the state was held on Friday to discuss whether to join the ongoing national strike. It was decided that local units will take a decision at their individual level, ensuring that the OPD services in their hospitals are not severely affected. We are in discussion with the Directorate of Medical Education and Research. We will take a final decision on the same next week,” Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, president of MARD said. The doctors have said that they have been working without a break since the pandemic started and now with the Omicron threat, there is a further need for resident doctors in the hospitals which can only be fulfilled if the counselling sessions of the NEET for PG admissions are held. The final year batch already passed out six months ago, but due to the delay in PG NEET and now with the delay in announcing the schedule for counselling, the hospitals are yet to get the first batch of students who otherwise would have been inducted six months ago. On the condition of anonymity, a senior doctor at a government hospital, said, “The resident doctors are the actual workhorses in any hospital. They are the first respondents. They examine the patient, write the case papers, do the reports and report to the consulting senior doctors. If a hospital gets 70 PG students a year, then this year this number is missing because of the delay in counselling. This puts pressure on the second-year residents the most because third-year residents are busy with their exam and dissertation.” A doctor belonging to the medical teachers association said that there were talks about allowing deans to recruit doctors on a temporary basis on the resident doctor’s post who will then be released once PG admissions are completed. Director of DMER Dilip Mhaiskar said, “I have told them that I will seek permission from the government and then decide because it depends upon the admission. As of now, no decision to recruit has been taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tired-resident-doctors-want-recruits-on-boarded-faster/articleshow/88080249.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||Ultrasonic cams could be a solution to detect O2 leakage, avoid fire||Nagpur: The administration is already on its toes and various steps are being taken to ensure enough oxygen supply in case the new variant of novel coronavirus – the omicron – triggers third wave anywhere in near future. Recently divisional commissioner of Nagpur Prajakta Lawangare Varma reviewed the oxygen generation plants in the district and directed that they should soon be ready to generate oxygen at their optimum capacity. Three government hospitals — GMCH, IGGMCH and the AIIMS, Nagpur — together house more than six O2 generation plants and the issue of their safety is also important. To protect plants from oxygen leakage and to avoid fire incidents due to leakage of gas, a viable solution is likely to come soon, at least in the government hospital set ups. Head of the anesthesiology department of the IGGMCH, Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar has suggested that the installation of Ultrasonic detector cameras in the O2 generation area may solve a problem of detection of O2 leakage in hospitals and eventually avoid the fire incidents. “We discussed these issues in the meeting with the divisional commissioner. She was very positive about the suggestions given by us. At IGGMCH, we have prepared a proposal in this regard and will submit it to the divisional commissioner soon,” said Dr Shelgaonkar. Ultrasonic detector is a device that detects the presence of gases in an area, often as part of a safety system. The detector can sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring. The devise is widely used in the industry. If the proposal gets a go ahead from the divisional commissioner, it could be a game changer for the hospital oxygen generation plants. In last one year, at least four major fire incidents have killed many patients, including infants admitted in the ICU at a Bhandara hospital. Recently, patients were killed in Ahmednagar due to fire in hospital. Oxygen leakage is the major reason behind fires. They can be detected early with the ultrasound technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ultrasonic-cams-could-be-a-solution-to-detect-o2-leakage-avoid-fire/articleshow/88080250.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The remark was made by Justice Rekha Palli who was told by senior counsel Rahul Mehra, appearing for Delhi government, that the policy was framed after due deliberation to stop sexual activities at such centres. The court, which was hearing a batch of petitions challenging the prohibition on cross-gender massages, was urged by the senior advocate to allow the policy, which has now taken the form of a guideline. He asked the court to allow the policy to remain in force for some time and highlighted that cross-gender massages are not permitted at several places, including five-star hotels. However, the judge observed, “Just because it is a cross-gender massage, doesn’t mean that it is sexual activity.” “You ask your people to hold their hands. I’m not saying that illegal activities you shouldn’t stop,” she added. Delhi government counsel said that the authorities will only act against illegal activities. The court adjourned hearing on the petitions till later this month. In September, one of the petitioners, Association of Wellness Ayurveda & Spa, had told the court that the ban on cross-gender massages was unconstitutional for being in violation of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and assuming prostitution to be only in the “heterosexual domain” is illogical.

The cops were heading to Haryana’s Bahadurpura for a raid to rescue a minor girl who had allegedly been kidnapped. Budera police station in-charge in MP’s Tikamgarh district, Chandan Singh, said that the MP police team was on its way to Haryana after getting information that the abducted girl, a 16-year-old, had been kept somewhere in Bahadurpura. The FIR that has been registered in MP mentions section 363 (abduction) of the IPC. The dead cops have been identified as head constable Bhawani Singh, woman constable Heera Devi, and constable Kamlendra Yadav. The other two were Ravi Kumar from the Nagar Raksha Samiti, who worked with the police, and car driver Jagdish. In the accident, head constable Ratiram was injured as were one Dharmendra and his wife Preeti, relatives of the man who has been accused of kidnapping the girl. They are in hospital undergoing treatment. Ratiram said from his hospital bed that eight persons were in the car and that while four died on the spot, one succumbed to injuries later. SP (rural) Shrish Chand said the accident took place around 5 am when the car was heading towards Noida. The SUV the police personnel were in was badly damaged and had split into two. “We have informed MP police about the accident,” he said, adding that it looked like the driver had fallen asleep and rammed the vehicle into a divider. Last month on November 5, four residents of Ghaziabad, including the wife and son of a retired UP policeman, and the driver of an Agra-Noida bus, were killed in a collision between the two vehicles on the Yamuna Expressway near milestone 71 in Mathura. Then in February this year, seven people, including four members of one family from Haryana, were killed when an oil tanker hit the road divider and turned turtle near Mathura’s Naujheel area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-cops-2-others-out-to-rescue-girl-in-hry-dead-in-up-e-way-accident/articleshow/88079579.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||World||Merkel’s parting message to Germany: Trust one another||BERLIN: In a ceremonial military send-off to mark the end of her 16 years as chancellor, Angela Merkel left Germans with a final message Thursday: Trust one another. Less than a week before Merkel will officially hand over power to her successor, Olaf Scholz, she received her country’s highest military honours, featuring a traditional parade of torch-bearing soldiers and a marching band. In a short address, Merkel warned that trust was one of the most important ingredients in democracy. “The last two years of this pandemic have shown how important the trust in politics, science and societal discourse is — but also how fragile it can be,” she told a small audience of masked and socially distanced guests. Democracy, she said, “depends on solidarity and trust, including the trust in facts.” Merkel counselled vigilance. “Wherever scientific insight is denied and conspiracy theories and hatred are spread, we need to resist.” Merkel remarked on the symbolic location of the ceremony: The courtyard of the Bendlerblock, a building that is now part of the defence ministry but was once the headquarters of a resistance group of officers who had carried out the plot against Adolf Hitler in 1944 and were executed. The ceremony lasted about an hour. Known as the Grosser Zapfenstreich, or Grand Tattoo, it dates to the 16th century and is the highest honour the military can bestow on civilians. The highlight was the military marching band playing three songs picked by the chancellor. Her predecessors, Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroder, asked for Beethoven and Frank Sinatra. Merkel picked “Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen,” or “You Forgot the Colour Film,” a 1970s hit from the Communist East by Nina Hagen, who later emigrated to the West and became Germany’s punk rock idol of the 1980s. Until recently, Merkel had rarely spoken about her East German background. When asked about the song, which tells the tale of a couple going on holiday on an island in the Baltic Sea, she said: “The song was a highlight of my youth, which as everyone knows took place in the GDR (German Democratic Republic, the official name of Communist East Germany).” At times, there was a hint of emotion in the usually stoic chancellor’s face. “If I stand before you today, I feel above all gratefulness and humility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/merkels-parting-message-to-germany-trust-one-another/articleshow/88081953.cms||Katrin Bennhold

The Congress government has waived previous years’ outstanding dues of water and sewerage and for current consumption a flat rate of Rs 50 has been fixed for households above 125 square yards. Now commercial and industrial users are on the radar, but the staff said due to paucity of manpower, they were facing a tough time in recovering dues. The officials claimed that at least Rs 160 crore to Rs 180 crore was pending from industrial and commercial users for the past many years. MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal has directed the officials of the operation and maintenance cell to recover the pending dues. Sources said, “In the coming days MC will face difficulty in paying salaries to staff or getting development works done if recoveries are not made.” One of the officials said there was a problem in records, as they were given lists of consumers, but when they visited the site they could not trace the property. He said there was a need to check the data and they have to do the field job too and get the water supply and sewerage faults fixed. “It is an additional burden. The work should be outsourced,” he added. Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said, “The staff has been told to recover the pending dues from commercial and industrial units and they have already started the task.”Notice to bus stand authorities The civic body had issued a Rs 8-crore property tax notice to the bus stand authorities and next week their one-week period will end. The bus stand authorities have been seeking time and they also met mayor Balkar Sandhu. One of the senior officials claimed that they would start the process of sealing in case dues were not paid. He claimed that they were scanning records and in the coming days more government departments would be brought under the scanner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/now-mc-to-recover-dues-from-commercial-industrial-defaulters/articleshow/88079602.cms||---

However, the percentage of underweight children under five years has fallen significantly. As per the NFHS-5 report, the percentage of overweight under-five-year-old children in the district in 2020-21 was 6.4%. The value puts Ludhiana at fourth spot in the state. At 7.8%, Pathankot has the highest percentage, followed by SBS Nagar (6.6%) and Gurdaspur (6.5%).In 2015-16 (NFHS-4), the percentage of overweight under-five-year-old children was 1.1% in Ludhiana. Therefore, there has been an increase of 5.3%. This is the highest rise in the percentage in Punjab. Kapurthala recorded an increase of 4.3%.Besides, the percentage of underweight children under five years in Ludhiana is 12.4%. On the parameter, Ludhiana is at 18th spot in the state. Muktsar is at the top with 30.7%, followed by Bathinda at 23.8%. Pathankot recorded a percentage of 10.8.As compared with the previous report (NFHS-4), Ludhiana has registered a fall of 16.1% in the number of underweight kids. The decline is the highest in the state.The health experts said rise in overweight children was on the expected lines.“Sedentary lifestyle is responsible for it, as children nowadays are hardly playing outdoor games. This trend needs to be reversed and parents should encourage them to do physical activity,” said Dr Bimal Kanish, president-elect of Ludhiana IMA.The NFHS-5 shows the percentage of children under five years who are severely wasted (weight-for-height) is 1, which is less as compared with NFHS-4, when the value was 3.1%. “The fall in number of underweight and severely wasted children is because of two main reasons: decrease in malnutrition and improved financial status of families. In the Covid-induced lockdown, poor families got food so that may be another reason for the fall,” said Dr Naveen Bajaj, a neonatologist and child specialist. “Rise in obesity among children is due to less physical activity and more intake of junk food. Since they were mostly confined indoors due to the pandemic for the last two years, many children have become overweight,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/over-five-fold-jump-in-percentage-of-overweight-kids/articleshow/88079591.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Ludhiana||Travel restrictions, lockdowns abroad making exporters jittery||Ludhiana: Lockdowns and restrictions in several countries due to spike in Covid cases and surfacing of Omicron variant are giving sleepless nights to city exporters. Businessmen’s problems have increased after imposition of travel restrictions, as they are being forced to cancel their overseas trips. Their biggest fear is that if the coronavirus situation remains unchanged or becomes worse, it will severely hit the export orders and deliveries like last year when for months trade remained disrupted and Ludhiana exporters, especially garment companies, suffered huge losses. Harish Kairpal, garment exporter and president of Ludhiana MSME association, said, “Several European countries, like Austria, Netherlands and Germany, are witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases due to which partial or conditional lockdowns have been imposed. Besides, travel restrictions too have been imposed to and from countries where Omicron cases were found. The situation has dealt a setback to the business travellers, who had scheduled foreign visits for meetings, exhibitions and order finalisation. They have to cancel their plans and suffer losses on account of cancellation charges.”Vinod Thapar, chairman of Knitwear Club, said, “Garment exporters are jittery. Our biggest fear is lockdown in other countries due to which the sales and supply network of garments get jeopardised, resulting in cancellation of our orders. We are keeping a very close watch on the situation and can only pray that it improves.”For Rohit Gupta, president of Importer and Exporter Club, Punjab, the current situation has reminded them of the turmoil that they faced last year. “Earlier, exports and imports remained suspended for months and city businessmen suffered heavy losses. The discovery of the new variant in some countries has increased our worries. We are waiting and watching, and hoping that deliveries, which are in transit, reach safely and we get our payments. As far as under-processing orders are concerned, we can delay the deliveries depending on the situation in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/travel-restrictions-lockdowns-abroad-making-exporters-jittery/articleshow/88079608.cms||Mohit Behl

The judge S Sajikumar has also issued an order to conduct a retrial in the case while considering a petition in this regard by the revenue department. The case pertains to the ownership of 23 cents of land under Kudappanakunnu village, which according to government records is poramboke land. The respondents in the case are Daniel Lazar and wife Shoshamma Lazar of Pathirappally. According to the petition filed by the additional secretary of revenue department, the respondents were in possession of 1.55 acres of land. During a resurvey it was revealed that 23 cents of this land was actually poramboke land. Lazar allegedly colluded with some resurvey officers and managed to win pattayam of the land in 2008. The alleged fraud was found out in 2009 by the then vigilance director of land survey Biju Prabhakar. Following this, the officials involved in this fraud were placed under suspension. In 2011, Daniel Lazar approached the additional munsif court here seeking ownership of the land. The court issued an order in his favour in 2015. During the hearing of the petition , public prosecutor M Salahuddeen argued that the respondents managed to win a favourable order from the lower court by misinforming the court using forged documents procured through the tainted government officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/order-giving-poramboke-to-individual-annulled/articleshow/88080259.cms||---

A strong network ted development plan with no-vehicle zones, a bus transport system and parking charges to discourage vehicles were among the recommendations identified for the state’s urban development department. Speakers present included INTACH Pune Chapter convenor Sharvey Dhongde, museums and heritage learning consultant Alisha Sadikot, architects Narendra Dengle and Vikas Dilawari along with Parisar founder Sujit Patwardhan. “Development plans, which need to go hand-in-hand with a city’s comprehensive mobility plan, should recognise heritage as a non-renewable but reusable resource so that it can be managed and not just protected,” said Dhongde. The panel emphasized the need to improve pedestrian and public transport access along with measures to discourage personal vehicles. They also identified threats to heritage that the current development paradigm poses such as the lack of an integrated approach to planning, and highlighted the need for developing community consultation processes to identify priorities with urban development, transport and heritage. The meeting was organized as part of a statewide ‘Lakh ko 50’ campaign, which highlights the necessity for at least 50 buses per lakh urban population (a benchmark set by the ministry of housing and urban affairs) for all cities of Maharashtra. It has been launched by the Sustainable Urban Mobility Network (SUM Net), a coalition of individuals, voluntary organizations, and civil society networks and movements promoting sustainable urban transport solutions across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-suggest-walking-infra-buses-parking-norms-to-protect-urban-heritage/articleshow/88080257.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The only survivor in the family is their 11-year-old daughter, who was sleeping with her grandmother in the family house. While the bodies of Yogesh Mishra (40) and his wife Pratikshi (33) were found in the former’s office at Vanshi Vihar, their younger daughter, Kavya, was found dead at their house in Maruti Enclave, three km from the office. The couple left a handwritten four-page suicide note but did not blame anyone for their action. The man ran a battery business and Pratikshi was a homemaker. They were married for 13 years. Taken by surprise by the deaths, Mishra’s relatives claimed there was no tension in the family or any financial issue bothering the couple. Sudhir Kumar Singh, SSP, said Mishra was found hanging from a fan in his office while Pratikshi’s body was on the floor. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death. The daughter who survived said she and her sister had accompanied their parents to the office on Thursday afternoon. At about 8 pm, their father dropped them home and returned to the office. Her mother had stayed back in the office as she was not feeling well. Mishra returned home alone around 10 pm and everyone went to sleep. They skipped dinner. Her father left for office early on Friday while she and her grandmother were still sleeping. CCTV footage showed Mishra entering his office at 6.21 am. “When we tried to wake up my sister, we noticed that her lips had turned black. We took her to hospital with the help of my relatives,” the elder daughter said. Mishra’s body was discovered by his employee, Manoj, at about 9:50 am. The office door was bolted from inside but gave way when he pushed it, Manoj claimed. Praveen Kumar Singh, Jagdishpura police station in-charge, said preliminary investigations suggest that Mishra’s wife and daughter’s death was due to consumption of poison. Further investigations are on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/3-of-agra-family-including-5-yr-old-die-in-suicide-pact/articleshow/88079606.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Now, municipal corporation commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal will take the final call, after which an agency will be hired to carry out the work.The MC had scrapped the project of UID number plates earlier after a firm failed to complete it in time. The officials claimed that now they would not repeat the past mistakes and the project would benefit the residents. The officials said, “Every property will have its unique QR code. People will be able to check their outstanding dues after scanning this code. Even the MC employees will not have to ring the bell as they can also check whether the house owner has cleared all the dues by scanning the code.” The earlier project could not take off as the residents were required to pay Rs 110 for the plate. This time, the plates will be installed outside the houses by the selected firm and their cost would be added to the property tax dues. The decision on the cost, however, is yet to be taken. “The mayor had formed the committee to take a decision on the project. With its members giving their consent, the project will now go to the MC commissioner for the final approval. If approved, an agency will be hired for installing the UID plates,” said an official. According to GIS survey conducted by the MC officials, there are more than 4 lakh properties in 37 blocks. The GIS survey was conducted with the help of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre (PRSC). The installation of UID number plates was proposed in 2014. But the work kicked off from Block 26 in Model Town on June 23, 2017. The work progressed at snail’s pace and only 25,000 houses were covered by the private firm. The areas like Model Town, Model Gram, Shastri Nagar, Pakhowal Road, Ghumar Mandi, Gurdev Nagar, Rishi Nagar, Kitchlu Nagar, Maya Nagar, Maharaj Nagar, Sarabha Nagar, BRS Nagar, among others, were covered.When plates could not be installed outside all houses and properties, the MC employees wrote the UID numbers outside the properties. As a result, many people are not sure about their UID numbers, as the written ones have either faded or gone unnoticed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/panel-approves-uid-number-plate-with-qr-code-project/articleshow/88079626.cms||---

The dead man was identified as Maharaj Singh alias Bhola. His father, Pokhpal Singh, told police he had hired a history sheeter for Rs 1 lakh to kill his alcoholic son, who often fought with family members. Giving details, Botre Rohan Pramod, Kasganj SP, said, “Bhola had differences with his father over ancestral property. He was an alcoholic and wanted to sell a part of the property. Angry over his son’s repeated demands to sell the property and ill-behaviour, Pokhpal confided in his brother, Ganesh, and neighbour, Indrapal, who then got in touch with one history sheeter, identified as Virendra. The latter was given Rs 5,000 as advance for killing Bhola.” All four were arrested on Wednesday. “Bhola’s Aadhaar card was recovered from Virendra. He confessed to murdering Bhola for money,” the SP said. Police said Virendra, a resident of Nagla Cheet village, has several criminal cases, including loot, kidnapping and rape, against him.

The government has implemented a new excise policy under which fresh registration of brands is being made. The policy was implemented from November 17 and initially, people faced a shortage of different brands due to not many brands being registered. “Under the new excise policy 2021-22, the excise department has registered 505 brands so far, which includes 332 Indian liquor brands and 173 foreign liquor brands. Of these, 166 brands of whisky, 55 brands of vodka, 65 brands of beer and 154 brands of wine and 65 brands of other categories of liquor i.e Rum, Gin, Brandy, liqueur, mixed alcoholic beverages, etc, have been registered so far for the year 2021-22. We have processed all applications and there is no brand registration pending,” Delhi government said in a statement. The government said that the new excise policy aims to promote liberalisation of brand registration process so that customer has a wide choice of liquor brands available in the capital. In majority of the categories of the liquor brands, registration fee has been reduced, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-excise-policy-delhi-govt-registers-500-liquor-brands/articleshow/88080278.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Incubator hatches peahen eggs abandoned in field||PUNE: The state forest department and Pune-based Ela Foundation have hatched four eggs of a peahen in an incubator after they were abandoned when they were exposed from the concealed nest in Pingori village in Saswad, some 66km from Pune. There are no published Indian reports about this technique for hatching peahen eggs making it a probable first. Ornithologist Satish Pande said peahens are very wary during the breeding season. They lay eggs on the ground on farm bunds or conceal them in thorny vegetation. “If they are found by humans or if the hens are disturbed, they abandon the eggs. Since it is a Schedule 1 bird under Wildlife Protection Act 1972, handling the eggs is prohibited,” he added. However, out of sympathy, people rescue the eggs and keep them with domestic poultry birds for warming and assisted hatching. In such cases, due to mismatch in the size of the small brood patch of the poultry birds and larger size of peahen eggs, hatching fails. Such a process is illegal too, Pande said. Pingori farmer Suresh Shinde found the abandoned eggs while removing grass from the bund on his farm. “He brought the eggs to the 'Ela Transit Treatment Centre' at Ela Habitat, Pingori within an hour. Experts succeeded in hatching the four peafowl eggs in an artificial home-made incubator. The centre is run by Maharashtra Forest Department and Ela Foundation,” Pande said. It gives hope for the survival of abandoned peafowl eggs or any other avian eggs, he added. The peahen eggs hatch in 25 days. “The farmer brought the eggs three weeks ago and they hatched in 16 days in the incubator so they may have been abandoned after the initial days. Each chick weighed 75gm at birth but now the weight has increased to 600gm,” he added. The chicks start eating on their own. They needed fortified diet supplements for bone and feather growth. A special formula was imported for them, Pande said. They will soon be released into the wild.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/incubator-hatches-peahen-eggs-abandoned-in-field/articleshow/88080270.cms||Manjiri Damle

His body was found hanging in his brother's room on Wednesday. The family alleged that the boy, a student of class 8 in a government school, was “very upset after returning from school.” He was found dead soon after. An FIR was registered under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) against the teacher after a complaint was filed by the boy’s mother at Bagwala police station on Friday. Deputy superintendent of police, Kalu Singh, said that the autopsy report has confirmed death due to hanging. “The matter is being probed,” he added. Naresh Kumar, the boy's father, who is a farmer in Kasaun village, said that his son was a bright student and also a class monitor. “On Wednesday, my son left for school at 7am.

But few know that a number of migratory birds flock the river during the winters and hang around for a few months. The ravines of Vishwamitri are chirping with migratory birds that fly in hundreds of kilometres from northern parts. About 40 to 50 varieties of birds, both foreign and local, nest near the river during winters. From red-headed bunting and little ringed plover, black-headed bunting and common sandpiper to Eurasian curlew, gull-billed tern and Siberian stonechat, a variety of migratory birds from other countries are spotted on the river bank. Major parts of the river that passes through the city are shallow with dense green surroundings in some stretches along with marshy patches. The birds find it safe to nest in this region. Also, apart from fishes, many birds feed on maggots and insects that are in abundance in this river due to the sewage released in it. Chandrashekhar Patil, who has in the past held an exhibition on birds found near Vishwamitri River, said that the water body offers an ideal spot for the migratory birds. “I have spotted a variety of local and migratory birds in the ravines of the river. The birds find the Vishwamitri ravines an ideal spot as not many venture near the river that is home to hundreds of crocodiles too,” Patil said. The river is also home to local migratory birds.  Bird watchers have seen the winged guests near the river stretch behind Vadodara central jail, near Akota-Dandia Bazaar Bridge and in Sayajibaug.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/migratory-birds-find-winter-warmth-in-vishwamitri-river/articleshow/88079480.cms||Tushar Tere

Given HDMC's financial situation, only patchwork solutions can be expected as immediate measures. According to a survey conducted by Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation, 406kms of roads in the twin cities were damaged during the monsoon due to flood-like situations, costing Rs 145 crore. Heavy rain that lashed the twin cities for a few days beginning November 17 damaged 56.93km of road stretches, with a loss estimated at Rs 33.9 crore, and rain is still falling, so further damage to the roads is possible. So far this year, rain has damaged 463.2 km of road stretches, with a total loss estimated at Rs 178.9 crores. Due to financial constraints, HDMC officials are finding it difficult to make provisions for funds to restore road conditions. According to sources, the HDMC can only get Rs 60,000 per km under the NDRF to repair roads damaged by heavy rain. E Timmappa, superintending engineer, said that the tender process for the patchworks that have already begun has been completed, and a work order has been issued to the contractor. Under the HDMC's general grant, Rs 3.5 crore will be spent to repair 37,778 square metres of damaged roads in both Hubballi and Dharwad. Patchwork on damaged roads was supposed to begin in November, but it didn't because of unexpected November rainfall. Once the rain stops, pothole filling and road patching will begin, he said. Dharwad district minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa stated that roads have been severely damaged as a result of unexpected rain. He said he has met the officials concerned, including Smart City officials, and directed them to begin road restoration and repair work.

---||Delhi||‘Doorstep scheme meant for the poor, not to sustain ration shops’||NEW DELHI: The doorstep ration delivery scheme is meant for the benefit of poor people and not to sustain the fair price shops, the AAP government told Delhi High Court on Friday. Appearing before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi submitted that the fair price shops are only a medium and if the government has a better scheme, there is no prohibition in law to ensure that ration at no extra cost reaches the beneficiaries without them having to leave their home. “We have put on record the glaring nepotistic practices and leakages. We now have end-to-end computerisation. There has not been even a single challenge to the scheme from the beneficiaries. It is common sense, why would anyone object to getting ration at their door for no extra cost,” Singhvi contended. The government’s reply came after the bench sought to know why it didn’t include the FPS in its doorstep delivery scheme, so that the ration dealers’ association would have no grievance against it in the first place. “We all carry rather a poor impression of these shops and probably for good reason since there were no checks, they were not giving foodgrains or selling it in the blackmarket. But all these measures of ePos, geotagging have been put in place. If it can be done through the process you have adopted by bypassing the FPS, why can’t it be done through them? That serves every one’s purpose,” the bench pointed out. Singhvi explained that there is a “parallel system without total abolition” of the FPS and they have the option to continue. He claimed as per the government’s feedback, 69 lakh out of 72 lakh beneficiaries have opted for home delivery of ration. “We had tenders for it. They were free to participate. They want the vested interest and architecture to continue, that's why they did not participate,” he added. The court is hearing a plea by Delhi Sarkari Ration Dealers’ Sangh challenging the Delhi government’s scheme for doorstep delivery of ration, Mukhymantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. Earlier, the Centre had said that the court should not allow any state to interfere with the structure of NFSA and destroy its architecture. Fair price shops are an integral part of NFSA, it stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doorstep-scheme-meant-for-the-poor-not-to-sustain-ration-shops/articleshow/88080285.cms||Abhinav Garg

Deepali Dhumal leader of the opposition in PMC said that such water cuts are not acceptable. “An amicable solution must be found in this matter. Such kind of arm-twisting tactic adopted by the irrigation department is wrong,” she said. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol opposed the curbs, saying that the PMC was making all efforts to check water consumption. “The imposition of water cuts in a such scenario is wrong,” he said. Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizen’s group, said it is not proper to impose water cuts when most dams have around 90% water. The officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said on Friday that it would continue to lift water as per their current practice. The irrigation department had planned to ,reduce water supplied to the civic areas from Friday. A letter regarding the same was sent to the PMC on Thursday. But no cuts were imposed on Friday. Aniruddha Pawaskar, head of the PMC’s water supply department, said that the civic administration has lifted the water as per it’s daily use. “We have got the letter from the irrigation department. A meeting has been called with the irrigation officials to resolve the issue. The future course of action will be decided accordingly,” he said. V P Patil, executive engineer, irrigation department, said, “The PMC is getting water from Bhama Askhed now. So, we have asked the civic body to lift less water from Khadkwasla,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activists-politicians-decry-move-to-curb-water-supply/articleshow/88080283.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Hubballi||On North Western Karnataka bus, carry exact fare||HUBBALLI: If you are on a North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) bus, carry the exact fare. Asking for change may be treated as an interruption to the duty of a public servant and you may be imprisoned for 3 years. The NWKRTC has displayed such a warning at its bus stands. The boards say that bringing the exact fare is the responsibility of passengers and they ‘should cooperate’ with bus conductors. “The Supreme Court has identified NWKRTC drivers and conductors as public servants under Section 21 of IPC. If passengers assault or disturb a conductor or driver on duty, they may be punished with 3 years’ imprisonment under Section 332 and 353 of the IPC and 3 months imprisonment under Section 186 of IPC,” the board says in Kannada. However, Rajesh Huddar, the chief traffic manager of NWKRTC in Hubballi, admitted that one can request customers or passengers to cooperate by paying the exact fare. “We will remove such boards from the bus stands immediately,” he said. There have been clashes between conductors and passengers over small change in buses earlier. Passengers and activists now want to know when transport corporations will incorporate cashless transactions. V R Govindgoudar, the founder president of Young India in Gadag and an advocate, said that this requirement is illegal. “The NWKRTC should tell under which rule they have made it mandatory? Normally, it is the responsibility of both the conductor and passenger, but more responsibility lies with the seller or the service provider. The NWKRTC is a business run by the government and it has to be courteous while it is in the market or the service industry. The officials have cited the IPC sections in the wrong context. It says (IPC) sections can be used if a passenger interrupts the crew’s duty. Not bringing exact change does not lead to interruption,” he said. Pradeep K Jangamani, an advocate in Hubballi, commented that almost 90 per cent of passengers carry smartphones with them all the time. “Even drivers and conductors carry smartphones despite restrictions imposed by officials. If they are provided with some scanners of UPI platforms and ATM card point of sales (POS), the problem of change can be avoided. The NWKRTC should upgrade its services with digital platforms. Cash transactions can be kept as a secondary option for non-tech savvy passengers and in case of unavailability of telecom network,” he said. Prakash Hebballi, a Dharwad-based techie, said that change would not be an issue if conductors are provided with a smartphone, a UPI scanner and a POS. “Even POS can be incorporated with existing ETVMs. Karnataka is the hub of world-class IT companies and the state-run KSRTC, BMTC, NWKRT and KKRTC can take help from them. Officers often cite one or another reason due to lack of technological knowledge. If corporations incorporate digital transactions for unreserved buses, it will be easier for conductors to issue tickets at a shorter time,” he asserted. Regarding digital transactions, chief traffic manager Huddar said that 70 per cent of passengers of reserved buses book tickets online. “The NWKRTC MD Gurudatta Hegde has already taken up the plan of introducing cashless transactions at our booking counters. As per his instructions, we are working on how to eradicate complications like how conductors should be facilitated to verify whether the ticket amount is deposited to the official account. Discussions are going on with some technology companies involved in digital payment services,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/on-north-western-karnataka-bus-carry-exact-fare/articleshow/88079676.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

They expressed the possibility of the doctor having been infected with the new variant from a patient.Dr T Jacob John, counted among the country’s foremost virologists, told TOI, “Although the new variant was first detected in South Africa, there is every possibility that the new strain was in circulation in India. It is also possible that a small section of the population may have been infected with the Omicron strain during the first and second waves of Covid-19.”Dr John, however, pointed out that the symptoms that patients infected with the Omicron variant displayed appeared to be mild. “There is no cause for panic but people cannot afford to get complacent. We must continue to adhere to safety guidelines. The government may deny claims of the transmission of the Omicron variant in society, but similar statements were made even during the first wave of infections. Before WHO alerted us, thousands of people from other countries had visited India,” he added.Former director of Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Traditional Medicine Dr Debprasad Chattopadhyay echoed the observations made by Dr John. “It cannot be denied that the new variant is in circulation already. The case of the doctor infected with the new variant reflects the prevailing situation. However, Omicron variant or any other strain of the novel coronavirus will not have much impact since majority of the population is already infected,” said Dr Chattopadhayay, who is also a virologist.Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, an expert on Covid-19, said, “Just because Omicron variant was first detected abroad, it does not mean it was not circulating in India. But this must not be used to create fear among the people. The technical advisory committee in Karnataka must tell the state that this is not a cause for concern.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/experts-point-to-possibility-of-omicrons-circulation-in-india/articleshow/88079683.cms||Shreyas HS
---||Dehradun||Amid internal rift, Gurukul Kangri univ’s ranking slips to B||Haridwar: The Gurukul Kangri University in Haridwar has been awarded “Grade-B” by the NAAC, two ranks below its previous “A” ranking. RC Dubey, the university’s internal quality assurance cell (IQAC) director, blamed a below-the-par self-study report (SSR) and the fact the university changed four vice chancellors and four IQAC directors in four years. Notably, due to an ongoing internal rift in the institution, the staff had apprehended a slip in the ranking before the NAAC team’s assessment visit from November 24-26. “Firstly, it seems the SSR had been submitted in a haste. While presenting data in SSR regarding the university's performance, on basis of the seven parameters set by the UGC, no effort was made to get it improved with the help of teaching and non-teaching staff. Instead of the 20 meetings of various stakeholders that needed to be held in the last five years, only three were held. For grading, 70% weightage lies in the SSR and 30% on its verification by the NAAC team during their visit. While the second went excellently, the first was poor,” said Dubey, who presented the university’s case before the NAAC team. Shrawan Kumar Sharma, who has been the longest-serving IQAC director in the university, said, “SSR contains data provided by various departments and officials of the university.

The AIADMK government had allotted Rs 122 crore for the works,” Damodaran said. “The minister should go through the documents and take steps to complete the projects.”When former minister S P Velumani stated that the city corporation cancelled 300 projects proposed to fulfil the basic needs of city residents, Balaji said the corporation announced the projects without getting administrative sanction before the election to get votes. Balaji had asked Velumani to release details of the works proposed, tenders called for, work orders issued and funds allotted.“We were told that the civic body proposes to carry out road works for 51km at a cost of Rs 33 crore.

In all, about 1,945 applications have been received by the authorities as the search for families and collection of documents, including their bank details, is on. According to the collector’s office, the official death toll of Ahmedabad district including city areas is 3,412. District collector Sandip Sagale said that 1,870 families have been provided the amount according to government guidelines. On Friday, citizens queued up at Civil Hospital to get the Covid death certificate that needs to be attached with the form to get ex-gratia amount. The hospital authorities said they have, so far, received 1,431 applications and around 1,000 have already been processed. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent, said that the process is primarily to issue the certificates in case where the relatives already have death slip or file for Covid treatment. “Not all patients in 1200-bed hospital were infected with Covid,” he said. Mortality at the government-run hospitals has remained a touchy subject for the authorities who have not revealed the hospital-wise deaths during the pandemic. Experts believe that the exercise to provide compensation may reveal the death toll to be higher than the official number declared. In crematoriums across Gujarat, the constantly smouldering pyres were testimony to fatalities much higher than the state government's official Covid-19 death toll. However, bulletins released by municipal corporations of Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, and Rajkot claimed there were only around 25 Covid deaths daily during the second wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/1870-get-ex-gratia-in-ahmedabad/articleshow/88079697.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||BJP shifts gears, targets leaders with mass support base to join ranks||HYDERABAD: Are ‘long rangers’ not welcome in the BJP? As former TSPSC member C Vittal and anchor Teenmar Mallanna are getting ready to join the saffron party, the BJP leadership is dropping clear hints that it will not entertain leaders, particularly those from the TRS and Congress, who join as lone rangers and are not in a position to bring additional cadre and rank and file with them. Sources said the party had taken this stand after its recent victory in Huzurabad bypolls. Citing the case of Eatala Rajender, sources said: “Along with several leaders who sailed with him when he was in the TRS and those who have good connect with ground-level workers joined the party along with Eatala. They not only helped the party win the bypoll but also ensured that the party ideology reached every nook and corner of the constituency.” A key leader said: “A lot will depend on the leaders who are willing to champion our fight and win the next assembly elections for us in Telangana. We need such leaders.” The party leadership is reportedly unhappy with some of the leaders who have joined from other parties but still pass off as ‘single towers’.“We want those jumping into the BJP to bring in a large group of supporters and activists along with him or her. This should be set as a pre-condition for leaders joining the party,” sources said. Sources said the party’s top brass was also convinced that some of the leaders who have joined the BJP from other fields have been unsuccessful in forging a relationship within the party and ill at ease in establishing a connect with party operations. Vittal and Mallanna are expected to join the BJP early next week once Bandi Sanjay returns from Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-shifts-gears-targets-leaders-with-mass-support-base-to-join-ranks/articleshow/88080957.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Operation Masoom: Coordinated action, geotagging helped Delhi cops nab offenders||NEW DELHI: It was a mammoth challenge. Operation Masoom (Mitigation of Adolescent Sexually Offensive Online Material) had over 100 suspects spread across Delhi. A crackdown on uploading of child pornography of this scale would have required huge manpower and coordination. However, with a little thinking, the Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police overcame this roadblock. They geotagged the identified internet protocol addresses and related mobile numbers to the newly formed cyber police stations in every district, thereby using local infrastructure to lay hands on the suspects. After police commissioner Rakesh Asthana assigned the case to IFSO, DCP KPS Malhotra prepared a detailed plan to ensure the success of their mass operation. “We had planned to start our operation from November 30. We had received thousands of IP addresses from NCRB and had to scan them,” said an officer. The 60-member team comprising ACP Raman Lamba, inspector Surjeet, SI Manoj and others kicked off the massive exercise to analyse thousands of suspected IP addresses. On many occasions, when the team resolved the IPs, they turned out to be of other states. After segregating IPs of Delhi, they wrote to the telecom service providers for the details of the people who uploaded the child porn videos. After receiving replies from the service providers, geotagging of the accused was started. Senior officers held meetings with DCPs and informed them about the task. “There were more than 170 police stations where cases were reported,” said an investigator. IFSO provided details of the accused with their social media IDs, location and time of uploading the content to the police stations. “The district police teams played an important role in the entire operation. They raided different areas and nabbed the accused,” said the officer. Malhotra said, “This exercise was a classic example of intra-departmental and inter-agency coordination. The operation was monitored for 48 hours. Many officers did not sleep and continuously resolved IPs and then informed the district cops.” Another officer said the exercise would help policemen in the future. “Now, the district cops can conduct more such smooth operations with proper coordination in the future,” the officer added. In the past, IFSO had initiated a drive against child pornography in which 43 people were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/coordinated-action-geotagging-helped-cops-nab-offenders/articleshow/88080312.cms||Abhay Singh

The crooks duped the elderly man between August 2 and August 5 this year. On Thursday, the senior citizen filed a complaint with the Sahakarnagar police after realising that he had been conned. Police inspector (PI) Yunus Mulani of the Sahakarnagar police said the complainant got a text message four months ago about handsome returns on his investment in an online commission platform. The person then sent a link to the complainant and told him to fill out the details and pay Rs200 as initial investment. “The complainant followed up and got Rs380 in return. He invested Rs200 again and got Rs180 as commission next,” Mulani said. The person then told him to invest higher amounts to earn better. The complainant invested Rs3.16 lakh in three days and got nothing back. A prima facie probe revealed that the suspects used a mobile number from Karnataka. “The amounts were transferred to bank accounts in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh,” Mulani added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/elderly-man-conned-of-rs-3-16-lakh-in-online-fraud/articleshow/88080289.cms||---

Every year, two nalas, including the Patny nala, cause flooding in 10 residential colonies. While MA&UD minister K T Rama Rao has been vocal about widening Patny nala, connecting Cantonment and GHMC areas on the left side, it is always full. “We are giving up hope. Despite sanction of Rs 10 crore for widening and inserting pipes, both SCB and GHMC have not been able to take up the work,” said Ram Kishore, a resident. Residents of Viman Nagar (Indian Airlines) Colony says they cannot forget the scary scenes after their colony and other three colonies were inundated in last year’s floods. “We spent two days in flood waters in the colony. SCB officials’ negligence to desilt nala caused inundation,” Nagaraju, another resident. Former SCB ward member, B Anitha, said: “Over Rs 10 crore has been spent” on the nala. But locals refute the results. Meanwhile, residents of 2BHK dignity housing scheme say they don’t have water lines and roads. Anitha said estimates have been prepared. Consumers in neighbouring GHMC are getting pure and safe drinking water, supplied by the HMWS&SB, but several colonies in SCB are getting polluted water due to decades-old pipelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-shortage-flooding-major-worries-in-karkhana/articleshow/88080303.cms||Sunil Mungara

The inauguration ceremony of an under-construction road in UP's Bijnor district went horribly wrong, turning into a major embarrassment for the BJP MLA who had been invited to do the honours, when the coconut-cracking ritual left the drupe intact but broke the road instead. A furious Suchi Chaudhary, the legislator from Bijnor who was there for the road-opening, stopped the event, sat on dharna for three hours and demanded action against those responsible for what she called a "grave misdemeanor". She declared she wouldn't budge from her protest until officers came to the site to take samples of the road, investigated and booked the culprits. She was mollified only after district magistrate Umesh Mishra vowed to punish the guilty. "The irrigation department is building a seven-km road in Bijnor's Haldaur for Rs 1.16 crore. Around 700 meters of the stretch is already complete. I was asked to inaugurate the road on Thursday but when I got there and tried to break a coconut, it did not break. But bits of the road came off," the MLA told TOI.Still seething, she added: "Materials used for the road seem to be sub-standard. I had to inform the higher authorities. A three-member team of the irrigation department then collected samples from the stretch for testing. I sat on dharna to register my protest." Executive engineer of the irrigation department, Vikas Agarwal, dismissed the "sub-standard" charge. He said, "We had invited the local MLA to inaugurate the road which is yet to be fully laid. Materials used are as per standard. We have set up a committee to look into the complaint. We need to wait for the findings." A local resident who seemed to have enjoyed the little drama laughed and said, "With state elections closing in, the authorities may have rushed with the inauguration event. Lucky the coconut didn't land on someone's head."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/at-inauguration-up-road-breaks-but-coconut-doesnt/articleshow/88079711.cms||Harveer Dabas

Arunprasath is also accused of spreading false information that former minister Udumalai K Radhakrishnan was sacked from the party for anti-party activities. A resident of Gomangalampudur near Pollachi, 28-year-old Arunprasath was the deputy secretary of the AIADMK IT wing for Pollachi south unit. AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and co-coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami had expelled him from the party for anti-party activities on November 14. A police officer said Arunprasath had verbally abused 34-year-old Thenmozhi, wife of AIADMK Gomangalam branch secretary Sivakumar, at her house on Wednesday (Dec 1) night, as he thought he was expelled from the party after Sivakumar furnished false information to the party headquarters against him. “He also threatened her of dire consequences.” Based on Thenmozhi’s complaint, the Gomangalam police registered a case against Arunprasath under sections 294(b), 354, 509 and 506(II) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him on Thursday night. He was later produced before a judicial magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. Former AIADMK minister Udumalai K Radhakrishnan had, meanwhile, petitioned the Tirupur rural police on Thursday, stating Arunprasath had forged the party’s letterhead and circulated a fake message that he (Radhakrishnan) was expelled from the party. “Arunprasath has circulated messages against the former minister on social media also.

As per the National Family Health Survey 2021 data, while the government hospitals in the district have managed to keep the C-section numbers comparatively low, the same has gone up to 35.9% from 29.6% during the period in the private hospitals. It is to be noted that the state average of C-sections in private hospitals is 63.8%. Like Coimbatore, Madurai also tops the state average with the private hospitals there handling 66.1% of the total deliveries through C-sections. In Chennai, private hospitals resort to C-section in 62.5% of the total child birth cases. However, the government hospitals in Chennai top the state by handling 42.5% of the delivery cases through C-section. The state average of C-sections in government hospitals is 36%. The district hasn’t reported any child birth at homes during the period. While all the deliveries were handled at medical institutions, about 50.9% of them was handled through C-sections. Dr C V Kannaki Uthraraj, gynaecologist and obstetrician, Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, said there was a need to study the reasons for the spike in C-sections and take appropriate steps for a course correction. “We always want to promote natural birth. But there are many factors that cannot be predicted and a normal pregnant woman can become critical during the labour, necessitating medical intervention.” According to her, C-section is opted only when the mother or the child is at immediate or long-term risk by natural labour. “We have set guidelines in decision making and we follow the same.” Home to some of the big corporate hospitals, the district is also known for experienced gynaecologists. “Most cases in these hospitals are referred from neighbouring districts. And most of them are high-risk cases, requiring C-sections to save both the mother and the child,” said Dr R Lalitha, gynaecologist, Sri Ramakrishna Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-tops-in-c-section-in-pvt-hosps/articleshow/88080298.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Varanasi||Destroyed, rebuilt over centuries, KVTcoming up in new avatar as KV Dham||Varanasi: The ancient Kashi Vishwanath Temple, which was demolished by invaders and rebuilt several times in between 1194 and 1777, is now coming up in a new form of ‘Kashi Vishwanath Dham’, a religious conglomeration of over 40 other ancient temples of artistic marvel with the temple of Lord Vishwanath at the nucleus. After Ahilyabai Holkar, the queen of Indore who rebuilt the temple in 1777, and Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who offered 1,000 kg gold in 1835 for the plating of its dome, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took up the task of its expansion and beautification with world-class facilities for the devotees and pilgrims. For this purpose, he laid the foundation of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham project on March 8, 2019. He will inaugurate the revamped temple premises in the middle of this month. Lord Vishweshwara, popularly known as Vishwanath, is the presiding deity of the millennia-old city of Kashi. The Kashi Vishwanath Temple enshrines one of the ‘Dwadashjyotirlingas’ (12 Jyotirlingas), and Kashi is believed to be the permanent abode of Lord Shiva. When the temple of Vishweshwara was built for the first time and what was its first original site is an issue of historical investigation. But the history says that after the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate, the entire Gangetic plain came under Muslim domination. The religious life of the city remained under constant threat, and the temples of Kashi were destroyed many times. Rana PB Singh, former professor of cultural geography and heritage studies of Banaras Hindu University, in his book ‘Banaras Region: A Spiritual & Cultural Guide’, writes that it is accepted that the first destruction took place in 1194 by the order of Qutb-ud-din Aibak, including the demolition of the temple of Vishweshwara which was at the site of the present Razia Mosque. During her reign, Razia Sultana (1236-1240) had built a mosque on the deserted site of the Vishweshwara temple. By the end of the 13th century, the temple was built in the compound of Avimukteshwara, and continued till the next destruction under the control of the Shirqi kings of Jaunpur (1436-1458). The Puranic description mentions the Vishweshwara temple under the name of Moksha Lakshmi Vilasa temple, and its architectural plan was described in detail. There were five ‘mandapas’ (pavilions) in the four directions, and additionally one in the centre which was the Vishweshwara sanctuary. The directional orientation was strictly followed in the construction. From east to north the four ‘mandapas’ were ‘Jnana’ (wisdom), ‘Mukti’ (liberation), ‘Shringara’ (beauty), and ‘Aishvarya’ (prosperity). At the four cardinal directions there were shrines of four deities -Tarkeshvara, Dandapani, Ganesha, and Bhairava. The main entrance was in the west. In 1490 Sikandar Lodhi once again demolished most of the important temples of Banaras, and the prominence of Avimukteshvara was lost. By the patronage of Raghunath Pandit (known as Todarmal), a wealthy merchant of Banaras, the new temple of Vishwashwara was built in 1585. He strictly adopted the basic architectural and structural plan of the Vishweshwara temple built in the late 13th century. This was demolished by the order of Aurangzeb in 1669, and converted into a mosque. Today, atop of the ruins of two old Vishwanath temples sit two different mosques, one built in the 13th century by Razia and one in the 17th century built by Aurangzeb. It was Ahilyabai Holkar who built the present temple in 1776-77. Despite all odds witnessed in the past, this temple continues to give blessings and well-being to all the devotees coming from across the country. After laying the foundation stone by the PM, the Uttar Pradesh government formed the Shri Kashi Vishwanath Special Area Development Board (SKSADB) to ensure the completion of the project. During the expansion work, several ancient temples, which were hidden among the residential and commercial buildings, have come to the light. These temples have been found to have immense religious and historic importance. Most of the temples are centuries old exhibiting the architectural grandeur. These temples are being conserved by the temple trust for the devotees visiting the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Some of the prominent temples include Shri Kumbha Mahadev Temple, Shri Baal Mukundeshwar Mahadev Temple, Shri Adivisheshwar Mahadev Temple, Shri Chandragupt Mahedev Temple, Shri Gangeshwar Mahadev Temple, Shri Chintamani Mahadev Temple, Shri Mahakal Temple, and Shri Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/destroyed-rebuilt-over-centuries-kvtcoming-up-in-new-avatar-as-kv-dham/articleshow/88080321.cms||---

The agency is now gearing up for the final audit for issuance of rating certificates of the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) to the eateries. The FDA conducted hygiene audits on around 12 more eateries on Friday. It has undertaken various drives, including at the fruits and vegetable markets, under the campaign pushing for a higher standard of healthy and hygienic eatables. FDA assistant commissioner Abhay Deshpande said the eateries were earlier provided with the measures to improve the food safety, hygiene, nutrition and their standards. “The FDA will now check whether the guidelines provided earlier were complied with,” Deshpande, who is monitoring the drive under the supervision of Jt commissioner Suresh Annapure, said. The FDA food safety officers have also collected 110 samples from Gokulpeth and Kalamna market in three separate drives as per the requirement of the ‘clean fruit and vegetable market’ which is one of the six components of the ‘eat right campaign’. “The samples will be sent to the government food laboratory for quality testing. Actions will be taken after the test reports come in,” Deshpande said. The FDA has also undertaken online training of around 100 Asha and Anganwadi workers on the maintenance of cleanliness, hygiene, nutrition and food safety standards of the mid-day meals. “The Asha and Anganwadi workers essentially need to maintain hygiene and cleanliness right from the preparation of the meal to distribution. They are required to focus on the personal hygiene too,” Deshpande said. The FDA is also embarking upon the drive at multiplexes and malls for creating awareness about proper food habits and standards. Posters have also been designed for appealing the masses to follow right food habits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-conducts-hygiene-audit-at-45-eateries-under-eat-right-campaign/articleshow/88080322.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Friday, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) issued a gazette notification on new CLAR Rules-2021. In fact, in June 2021, the MoD invited objections and suggestions from people of the 62 Cantonments on the draft CLAR, before finalising it. However, many Cantonment residents were not in favour of the new rules. “Without considering objections and suggestions given by us, the MoD issued a gazette notification on the ‘Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 2021, which is unacceptable,” general secretary, All Cantonments Citizens’ Welfare Association, Jitender Surana, told TOI. “The new CLAR-2021 is similar to Cantonment Land Administration Rules, 1937. The MoD has done a copy and paste job,” Surana said. The gazette notification issued was made available to the public on the Ministry of Defence portal.

The man, Pradeep Sonawane, lived in Kalyan and had assumed a new identity, the police said. What got him into the police net is that he made the mistake of making a voice-call to a relative after which he was tracked down by a crime branch team led by by inspector Maheshkumar Thakur. The body of Sashikala Waghmare had been found at on June 13, 2014 where she lived alone. A case of murder had then been registered against unidentified persons at Powai police station. However, for five years the police failed to get any clues and sthe case was closed after classifying it as ‘A summary’ — which means that the matter has sgone undetected. An officer said it was initially suspected to be fallout of a robbery. Recently, the crime branch took a fresh review of the case and learnt that Sonawane, a relative of the deceased, had been missing for the past seven years. said an officer. It was learnt that Sonawane, an alcoholic, had married twice and had disputes with his wives and he was missing. No one knew where he was or even if he was alive. Over the past six months, the police started looking for Sonawane. “Recently, we learnt that he called a distant relative through Facebook messenger. With technical help, our officers traced him to Kalyan where he did odd jobs for a living. He had changed his identity and was living with the third wife,” said a police officer. When he was picked up, he denied he was the same person (Sonawane), but later gave out his real identity and also confessed to the crime. said Neelotpal deputy commissioner of police. The police claimed that Sonawane killed his grandmother as she poisoned his second wife’s mind, telling her about his first marriage and how he had abandoned his first wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-grandson-arrested-after-2014-murder-case-is-reopened/articleshow/88080989.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ahmedabad||Attendance in Ahmedabad school rises after Diwali break||AHMEDABAD: Self-financed schools are seeing a significant increase in the number of students attending in-person classes after the Diwali holidays. From about 10% in the first week, attendance has risen to 35%-40% at many private schools of Ahmedabad. “We are seeing a significant increase in students at in-person classes after the Diwali vacation. For Classes 1 to 5, attendance was about 10% in Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara. This has gone up to 30%-35%. For Classes 6 to 12, attendance is about 40%,” said Manan Chowksi, president of Ahmedabad Progressive School Management Association. He said that there has also been a significant increase in attendance for Classes 10 and 12, who are preparing for their board exams next year. Schools are trying to reduce the learning loss to students due to the long duration of online education. After being shut due to Covid, schools started reopening for the new academic year in July in staggered fashion. Most schools had switched to online education which still continues, as the government has allowed reopening but has capped inperson attendance at 50% of capacity. In Gujarat, the state education department has begun on a survey to evaluate the learning loss and find measures to overcome the challenge. Many schools report that the writing skills of students have deteriorated and academic performance had fallen greatly over the last 18 months. “Due to distractions, despite attending online classes, some students lose focus. There are learning gaps caused due to this. Writing, which is essential, takes a back seat. They don’t get firsthand experience such as sessions in the science lab. If their concepts are not clear, as they cannot be directly monitored by the teachers, they try to resort to unfair means to pass the exam,” said Sharmistha Sinha, principal of Zebar School For Children. Fr Xavier Amalraj, principal of St Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall, said there is excitement among parents over sending their children for inperson classes but transportation remains a major problem. “The greatest learning losses during the pandemic are the social interaction and group activities that are the most essential part of holistic development of a child,” said Shaji Mathew, principal of Divine Child International School, Adalaj. He said students are very happy and excited to meet their friends and teachers, many of whom they have not met inperson for 18 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/back-to-school-attendance-rises-after-diwali-break/articleshow/88079732.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Net widens in drive against child porn, 172 FIRs so far||NEW DELHI: The Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Ops (IFSO) unit of Delhi Police on Friday said that 172 FIRs had been registered and 103 people apprehended till date for circulation of child pornography material online. The operation was ongoing and more arrests were likely. DCP (IFSO) KPS Malhotra confirmed the developments. The accused uploaded and shared obscene videos of children on social media and various chat platforms. Investigators said the accused were from different backgrounds, including an assistant manager at a bank, a law graduate, an MNC employee and a sweeper. Police had launched “Operation Masoom” to tackle the menace of child pornography. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana closely supervised the operation executed by the newly formed cyber police stations in all districts. IFSO scanned thousands of IP addresses across the country and segregated Delhi’s data. Later, more than 300 complaints were assigned to 15 districts in which over 170 cases were registered. The data accessed by TOI revealed that the highest number of cases were assigned to the Central district (31) followed by Northeast (30) and West (27). After investigation, 21 cases were registered in Central district, 19 in East, 18 each in Dwarka and Southeast and 96 in other districts. The details of the violations about child pornographic material were received through National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), which had signed an MoU with National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC has tied up with social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and others to keep a hawk-eyed vigil on the content on them. Whenever they come across any content found violating privacy and obscene material related to children, the same is red-flagged and NCRB is alerted. During the raids, 103 people were apprehended, including 14 in Southeast district, 13 in Dwarka and 11 in Central. In the remaining districts, 65 people were nabbed. Investigators said the apprehended people also included juveniles. “They were mostly using messengers on their mobile phones for sharing pornography material,” said an officer. The mobile phones used for the illegal activities were seized and sent for forensic examination. Explaining the profiles, an officer said, “One of the arrested persons was a sweeper at Nirman Bhavan, another was a gym trainer, the others were a law graduate, a manager working with private aviation company and a waiter.” A 29-year-old electrical engineer working with an MNC in Ghaziabad was also arrested. So was an assistant manager of a private bank for uploading child pornographic content.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/net-widens-in-drive-against-child-porn-172-firs-so-far/articleshow/88080330.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Redevelopment policy for airport funnel zone to be out soon||MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will soon come up with a policy for the redevelopment of buildings that are in the airport runway funnel zone, said urban development department minister Eknath Shinde. Shinde held an online meeting with transport minister Anil Parab, elected representatives from Santa Cruz, Vile Parle including BJP’s Parag Alavani, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Potnis, MLC Bhai Jagtap, Sena youth leader Varun Sardesai and senior bureaucrats.  It is estimated that around 20 lakh residents of Ghatkopar, Kurla, Santa Cruz, Andheri, Vile Parle have been affected by the height restriction on account of their proximity to the airport and for safety reasons are not allowed the use of additional floor space index (FSI) and Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) making redevelopment of these buildings economically unviable. Elected representatives said some of the buildings are 60-70 years old. MLAs demanded the buildings be allowed TDR on the built up area (which can be sold in the market and used elsewhere) and grant permission for the construction of the same number of tenements on the site that reflect in the BMC records. Principal secretary, UDD, Bhushan Gagarani said the BMC has submitted a detailed report on the issue and recommended two to three options. “For MHADA buildings the BMC has recommended how to allow the residents benefit under section 33(7) which is for the redevelopment of old and dilapidated buildings,” said Gagarani. In 2019 residents of the affected buildings had got together to prepare a redevelopment plan and submitted it to the state government. The residents had suggested redevelopment be allowed under section 33(7) B which allows an fsi of 3 and the fsi which cannot be consumed on the plot be converted into TDR. They had also suggested that development fees be on par with that for slum redevelopment schemes to bring down the construction cost. “Once the policy is finalised we shall hold a joint meeting of the urban development department and BMC so that there is clarity,” said Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/redevpt-policy-for-airport-funnel-zone-to-be-out-soon/articleshow/88081388.cms||---

This has become a cause of great inconvenience to the motorists using this busy road. Even shoppers visiting VR Mall parked vehicles on the other side of the road which resulted in very little space on the road for moving traffic. All this chaos leads to huge traffic jams.During investigation, Sakkardara traffic police learnt that private company SR Engineering Private Limited Company had dug up the road to lay some cables without obtaining a certificate from traffic police, who also found no traffic wardens to ensure smooth movement of traffic.Consequently, traffic police have approached Imamwada police station and filed an FIR against the private firm.Imamwada police have booked the firm under Sections 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) and 336 (negligent acts that endanger human life or the personal safety of others) of the IPC. Section 336 of the IPC also invites punishment with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend to Rs250 or with both, explained a senior cop from the traffic police department.A representative of the firm admitted to Awad that it started the road digging work without any permission. “After we filed an FIR, the firm obtained NOC from the traffic police to carry out the cable laying work,” said the senior cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fir-against-pvt-contractor-for-digging-road-sans-permission/articleshow/88079114.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The incident has once again highlighted the persistent threat of predators, who have made the CSTPS premises their home.One Rupesh Lande along with his friend was on an evening walk between VIP guest house and HVDC guest house in the CSTPS, when a tiger crossed the road in front of them. The duo is learnt to have lingered on the spot anticipating the tiger’s return. The beast suddenly resurfaced from the shrubs and clawed the head of Lande before dashing away. Lande was rushed to a local hospital by his friend and was later shifted to a private hospital for emergency treatment.There is presence of resident predators like tigers and leopards on the CSTPS premises, spanning 1,100 hectares, for several years. While their sightings are frequent, there have been scattered incidents of attacks or chasing down of commuters in the last few years. A leopard had killed a five-year-old girl in the residential colony in 2018. Despite efforts, the forest department had failed to control the problem as the thorny jungle, spread in hundreds of hectares, is proving to be safe shelter for the predators.In the recent past, a tigress with two or three sub-adult cubs and a couple of tigers are regular visitors to the CSTPS area. The plant premises houses over 10,000 population. In the light of threat the predators pose to the residents, an 11-member technical study group, instituted by state board for wildlife headed by CM Uddhav Thackeray, had in September recommended capture of the tigers from CSTPS and WCL areas and release them in zoos or tiger safaris. However, the plan saw no headway.In-charge RFO, Chandrapur, Santosh Thipe ratified the tiger attack and claimed the tigress is likely to be responsible for it. He claimed the department has taken up rigorous tiger monitoring measures and have installed over 100 camera traps in the area. Patrolling too has been intensified on CSTPS premises, while the residents have been warned to be aware of predators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tiger-mauls-evening-walker-on-cstps-premises/articleshow/88078940.cms||Mazhar Ali

The sequencing data is good enough for surveillance purposes but cannot correlate the effect of all the mutations in the Omicron genome with the human body in terms of cellular and antibody responses. In an exclusive talk with Binay Singh, he elaborates the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant. Excerpts: Q: How do SARS-CoV2 Variants arise? A: Variants of SARS-CoV2 are being reported now and then from various parts of the world. Mutations in RNA viruses is a common process. This is most commonly seen in RNA viruses compared to DNA viruses. As we know that SARS-CoV2 is an RNA Virus that modifies their genome after infecting humans or animals. In fact, there is a war between the virus and the host immunological system after infection. The virus always tries to evade the human’s immunological response in the process of increasing its progeny through replication. The process of replication is very faulty. There is no error correction mechanism in most of the RNA viruses. Although SARS-CoV2 has a partial mechanism to control those errors. We see more mutations in other RNA viruses compared to SARS-CoV2. The mutation is explained in simple words, then it is like a mistake in photocopying, which if once wrongly photocopied, it continues to be photocopied uncontrollably. The mutation occurring in the genome of the virus gives rise to the variation in the original form of the virus, from which new variants are formed. The same is happening with SARS-CoV2. Q: A new variant Omicron has become a matter of concern worldwide. How do you see it? A: Since the first report of Covid-19 outbreak, there have been a lot of “variants of concern” in different parts of the world. Most of these variants have acquired different mutations in Receptor Binding Domains and other parts of the viral genome. When we talk about Omicron, we compare it with the earlier variants. We see many mutations, which were reported in the Delta variant, are also present in the Omicron variant along with additional mutations. The spike protein of the Omicron variant has almost 32 mutations. Due to these many mutations, the diagnosis based on/including S gene of Omicron is not being picked up, and this was the basis of its reporting as a new SARS-CoV2 variant in South Africa. When we examine its genome, we find the cluster of mutations such as H655Y+N679K+P681H, very closely located to the Spike protein (S1/S2) cleavage site. This kind of mutation might lead to efficient cell entry and increased transmissibility. Such increase in transmissibility is being observed at least in South Africa for now. Still, it is premature to say that this variant will be more pathogenic or immune evasive till we have the laboratory based in vivo or in vitro experimental data. The sequencing data is good enough for surveillance purposes but cannot correlate the effect of all the mutations in the Omicron genome with the human body in terms of cellular and antibody responses. Q: What is really there to concern? A: Since we do not have much laboratory based experimental and clinical correlation-based data out till date, it would be too early to give any final verdict. Of course, what we are seeing in South Africa currently suggests that it has higher transmissibility. One must know that persons of every age group are susceptible to infection. Therefore, it is advised that older people and immunocompromised patients and patients on immunosuppressive drugs should be very careful. The present trend indicates that the Omicron variant can overtake the Delta variant. The countries where Delta has made much adversities and one more addition of Omicron may worsen the situation. The prominent mutations in the Spike protein’s region, where neutralizing antibodies bind, is a matter of concern. This may lead to the reduced efficacy to the vaccines but it does not mean that the vaccine’s effect will be completely nullified. Vaccines also train the T cells along with the antibody secreting plasma B cells. So, vaccines will be adding value to the immunological response against Omicron. Therefore, we all must get vaccinated. Q: Is this new SARS-CoV2 variant Omicron more dangerous? A: Not much is known about the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant. It will take almost 2 to 3 weeks to get more information from the virologists regarding the immune evasiveness and pathogenicity of this variant based on the experimental data. In addition, we cannot say anything currently about the severity, it may or may not be severe and we expect to get the reports from the clinical side in the next 2 to 3 weeks’ time. People should know and understand that it is very important to be alert and follow health ministry advisories strictly to break the chain of transmission. Q: What can be done to handle this situation? A: Any pandemic cannot be dealt with by the government alone. A strong public participation is needed to have a control on such a pandemic. There is only one mantra in the current situation to deal with this new variant of concern is adherence to protective measures such as: use of masks, use of sanitizers and maintain physical distance and avoid going to crowded places. Along with this, follow the advisory issued by the ministry of health, GoI and get the Covid-19 vaccine. Q: How do you see this whole situation as a virologist? A: Public awareness for this SARS-CoV2 variant is very important. SARS-CoV2 variants are emerging as a threat and continuously giving a challenge to scientists and clinicians. Some non-experts talk about the population-based safety against SARS-CoV2. All must be aware that there is not such immunity which is making any population immune to SARS-CoV2 infection. Globally, we all have seen the disastrous effect of the Delta variant during the second wave of infection. Please do not believe in rumours and do not panic. Some of the mRNA-based vaccine manufacturers started tweaking their vaccines to deal with the challenges associated with the SARS-CoV2 Omicron variant. Many governments including the Indian government are seriously thinking about boosters. Last but not least, the equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines globally is very much important to prevent replication and transmission of SARS-CoV2. We cannot control the nature of viruses but we can restrain our behaviour. India has done a great job on sharing the vaccine with many countries. This is important which will be helpful in reducing the risk of new variants in the coming days. We cannot be safe until everybody is safe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/premature-to-say-omicron-will-be-more-pathogenic-or-immune-evasive/articleshow/88080340.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Earth station Gorakhpur Doodarshan Kendra inaugurated by Info& Broadcasting min, CM||Gorakhpur: Union Minister for information and broadcasting Anurag Thakur and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Friday inaugurated earth station Gorakhpur Doordarshan Kendra in Gorakhpur and also virtually inaugurated 10 KW three FM relay centers at Etawah, Gadania in Lakhimpur Kheri and at Nanpara in Bahraich. Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan, MLA Radha Mohan Das Agarwal and mayor Sitaram Jaiswal were also present on the occasion. Speaking on the occasion, Union minister Anurag Thakur announced that from 11 December onwards Gorakhpur Doordarshan Kendra will have one hour Bhojpuri program. He also said that within two years every nook and corner of the country will have FM transmitters and within three months there will be FM relay centres at Rampur, Sultanpur and Maharajganj districts. “Unlike the Congress government you don’t have to wait for 70 years for an announcement to take shape on ground, today I’m announcing 1-hour Bhojpuri program on Gorakhpur doordarshan starting from December 11. With the earth station, Gorakhpur Doordarshan Kendra will be able to telecast directly its programs as earlier it was done through Lucknow Doordarshan Kendra,” said Anurag Thakur. Thakur said that with Etawah FM relay center 50 lakh people, with Lakhimpur Kheri relay center 35 lakh and with Nanpara center 25 lakh people will be benefited. “Our brothers and sisters living on the other side of the border (Nepal), who want to see/hear programs in our language will also be benefited,” he added. The minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi re-established the power of All India Radio with Man ki Baat and the department of information and broadcasting is committed to promote local art and culture. Praising CM Yogi’s work, he said that the echo of his work is in the entire country, “Under his regime the state economy climbed up from 10th to second place and investment started pouring in. In brick business the state gained second position. Defense corridor came to the state and other states are following his ODOP scheme.” After the wonderful performance of sportsmen at the Japan Olympics, CM Yogi not only honoured the sportsmen of UP but also all the Indian performers and soon he will establish a sports University, said the minister. Praising the leadership of PM Modi, Thakur said that under his guidance two Covid vaccines were developed in India and 120 crore people were inoculated, “Unlike the Congress government when a vaccine used to reach India after 40 years.” He also said India is the only country which provided free ration to people for 15 months. He appealed to all to vote for CM Yogi in the forthcoming elections. CM Yogi, on the occasion, thanked the Union minister for giving earth station and said, “People of this area waited for 37 years for earth station and I and people of East UP are thankful for the 1-hour Bhojpuri program on Gorakhpur Doordarshan as they have waited for it for four decades.” “Not only people of east UP but also of west Bihar and Nepal will be benefited by the earth station and the programs of Doordarshan Kendra in Gorakhpur will also be able to check the propaganda starting at border areas,” said the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/earth-station-gorakhpur-doodarshan-kendra-inaugurated-by-info-broadcasting-min-cm/articleshow/88080327.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 2 doctors, nurse from Nair hospital suspended for ‘medical negligence’||MUMBAI: The BMC suspended two doctors and a nurse from BYL Nair Hospital following allegations of medical negligence causing the death of a four-month-old boy who suffered severe burn injuries in the Worli BDD chawl gas cylinder explosion on Tuesday. The action came after a video clip showing four burn victims, including the infant, not being attended to at the Mumbai Central hospital went viral. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Friday said that a committee, comprising civic doctors who treat burn injuries, will be formed to probe the allegations. “I saw the video and ordered an immediate inquiry into the allegations. The report is expected in seven to eight days,” he said. Friday’s civic standing committee meeting saw a heated discussion on the issue. BJP corporators demanded setting up a committee of elected representatives for surveillance of civic hospitals. “The family of the deceased should be given Rs 25 lakh compensation,” said Prabhakar Shinde, BJP party leader in the BMC. NCP corporator Rakhi Ja-dhav sought a review of medical services in civic hospitals. Civic health committee chairman Rajul Patel of Shiv Sena said that she had forwarded the video to Nair hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal and told him to take strict action against the offenders. “A case of homicide should be filed with police,” Patel said. Standing committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav of Sena said: “In the video, we could see patients begging for help and doctors and nurses sitting idle. The BMC is known for providing good health services, but such incidents are condemnable.” Additional municipal commissioner Sanjeev Kumar, who was also present at the meeting, said the video showed that prima facie the medical staff’s behaviour was wrong. BJP’s Vinod Mishra said that when his party’s corporators reached Nair hospital in the morning for a surprise inspection, of the 34 department heads, only two were present on the premises. Meanwhile, Shiv Sena and BJP corporators came to blows in the civic House in the evening after Sainiks accused the BJP of politicising the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-doctors-nurse-from-nair-hosp-suspended-for-med-negligence/articleshow/88081015.cms||Richa Pinto

In October, Italy had made Covid-19 health passes must for all workers. Only those carrying the double immunisation certificates were permitted to enter restaurants, cafes, pubs and beaches in Lebanon. “Asking people to present the double immunisation certificate in public places is a proactive action by the government so that those who are demonstrating vaccine hesitation are encouraged to take the inoculation,” said Subodh Kandamuthan, director and Professor of Centre for Health Care Management at Administrative Staff College of India. Morocco in northern Africa was already implementing a must vaccination pass for all those entering its government buildings and public venues. The same yardstick was applied for people in the Netherlands and Romania as well. Authorities said similar norms were in place and being implemented in the Czech Republic and Italy. France has gone a step ahead and made it mandatory for those aged 65 and above to present a proof of a booster shot. This will bne enforced from mid-December to give access to them to public places and other facilities. To gain entry into governmental and private establishments in Tunisia, officials, employees and visitors must display a card certifying immunisation against Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vax-cert-made-must-2-months-ago-in-several-nations/articleshow/88080332.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The UK is among the 11 countries designated as ‘At Risk’ in relation to the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. The other countries are South Africa, Brazil, Botswana, China, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Israel. The passengers arrived by Air India Flight AI-172 and landed at Terminal-II of SVPI airport. “As soon as the passengers stepped out of the aircraft, their RT-PCR negative reports of Covid-19 tests taken within 72 hours of departure and their self-declaration forms were checked,” a source said. “These passengers were made to queue up separately from other fliers. Once their immigration and customs clearances were done, they were sent for testing.” The results were not available till late on Friday. Authorities at SVPI airport have earmarked a separate area for the passengers to be seated as they await their Covid-19 test reports. “Five counters have been established for Covid-19 tests at the arrivals area. Passengers are given the option of taking either an RT-PCR test or an RT-LAMP test which is equivalent to the RT-PCR test approved by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” said a well-placed source at the airport. “About 200 chairs have been set up at the arrivals area for the passengers to rest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/200-fly-into-city-from-at-risk-london/articleshow/88079753.cms||---

The morning witnessed foggy conditions with cool weather staying put through the day. Weathermen said the pleasant weather was owing to the cyclonic circulation over the north-east Arabian Sea off the south Gujarat-north Konkan coasts. In the 24-hour period ending 8.30am Friday, both IMD Colaba and Santacruz observatories recorded light rain of around 5mm. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), in a five-day forecast, said dry weather conditions will continue till December 7. While minimum temperatures rose 1.6 degrees Celsius above normal, maximum temperatures were 3 degrees C below normal. Minimum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba observatory was 22 degrees C and the Santacruz observatory 21.4 degrees C, a day after the unseasonal rain caused mercury to drop below 20 degrees. Both Colaba and Santacruz recorded maximum temperatures of 30.2 degrees C. In the 24 hours ended on Thursday, Santacruz registered 91.2mm of rain, smashing its previous record of 53.8mm on December 6, 2017, when Cyclone Ockhi passed close to the city’s coast.

The police arrested Priti Sharma after the sessions court and the Bombay high court rejected her anticipatory bail in connection with the extortion case. Sharma, a resident of Chira Bazaar was remanded to police custody till November 12. The initial investigation and trap was carried out by the ACB in August 2019 but as the arrested accused Rahul Sharma was not an ACB official, the case was transferred to the Azad Maidan police. The case pertains to a complaint filed by Nitin Kamble, a junior engineer attached to the H East ward of BMC. Kamble complained to the ACB that ‘two officers’ from the ACB – Tombre and Mrs Dani – were harassing him to lodge a corruption case against Kamble if he fails to bribe them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-held-for-extorting-rs-23-lakh-from-bmc-engineer/articleshow/88081756.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||Look out for back pain among students due to prolonged sitting posture in school||Nagpur: As schools in rural Nagpur welcome back students on campus, one of the issues facing kids is how they will sit upright for the two or three hours of study. Online class attendance has given the flexibility to students for getting up from their chair, dashing off to the washroom at will and sometimes even lying down by switching off the camera.But these same primary school kids won’t be able to do the same when back on campus. Sitting upright on a wooden/fibre bench for a prolonged duration is very likely to be a problem for them.Parents feel that schools need to innovate now and integrate some kind of physical activity in the limited time spent at school. As per the SOPs, children are not allowed to play on the ground to prevent them coming in close contact with each other. Pankaj Jain, a parent, said, “Small breaks can be provided between two classes so that kids get relief for some time and don’t affect their backs. To solve this problem, it’s important that physical activities are scheduled on the first day in the morning. Also, stretching and yoga should be encouraged so that the mind and body both come back to discipline.” Another parent, Simran Nagpal, said, “Students should have a heavy breakfast before class. Their breakfast should include fibres to keep them full for long hours before class so that they do not face any problem. Kids should be made to watch videos on yoga stretches by teachers which they can practice at home so that they do not face problems while attending classes.” Parent Shivani Mandhare said, “Having no breaks could be a huge problem when it comes to kids. They are not in the habit of sitting in one place and this may affect their posture and overall health. However, kids adapt to new things much easier than others. So, there is a possibility the transition may be seamless.” She added that teachers can adopt activities that involve a lot of moving and make children stand and stretch every 15 to 30 minutes. Parent Sudha Chauhan said, “I am more worried about kids who started their academic life in online mode. They do not know what a school looks like, they do not know about sitting in a classroom. At schools, they have to sit for hours, which is a matter of concern for all parents. Schools should initially open physical classes on alternate days and they should also take small breaks between classes.”Shailendra Sharma, a parent, said, “In order to prevent stiff necks and back pain caused by prolonged hours in the same position, teachers should ensure that children are made to do stretching exercises for a couple of minutes in class every half an hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/look-out-for-back-pain-among-students-due-to-prolonged-sitting-posture-in-school/articleshow/88078948.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||After delay of 3 days, NMC submits draft of wards’ delimitation with SEC||Nagpur: After a delay of three days, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) submitted delimitation of wards with the state election commission (SEC) on Friday. This time around, the first ward is likely to start from Kamptee Road in north Nagpur but the last one will probably end on Wardha Road at Chinchbhuvan instead of the usual Shivangaon-Jaitala in south-west Nagpur. Delayed to a great extent this year when compared with the last term, the SEC had directed all poll-bound municipal corporations to prepare a draft of delimitation of wards and submit it on or before November 30. In the 2017 municipal elections, the process started in August 2016 and was complete by November 25, 2016. The SEC will scrutinize the draft. Later, the SEC will announce the schedule for publication of the draft, period for receiving suggestions and objections, appoint an officer for each municipal corporation for holding a hearing and then finalize the delimitation of wards. Meanwhile, senior corporator Sunil Agrawal and a few others feel the SEC can hold the polls on time if it expedites the process of finalization of the delimitation of wards and reservations. There will be 52 wards and all of them will be new as the state government changed the four-member ward system to three. The draft submitted by the civic body includes areas and boundaries of all wards. Political parties, corporators and aspiring candidates will come to know about the exact boundary of the new wards only after publication of draft by the NMC. Speculations related to boundaries and areas in new wards are doing the rounds in political circles. Some are even circulating pictures marked on the map. The district administration is also in the last stage of finalizing the list of voters. The final list is likely to be published on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-delay-of-3-days-nmc-submits-draft-of-wards-delimitation-with-sec/articleshow/88080348.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The dacoits used hard and sharp tools kept at home to threaten the elderly woman. Anita Meshram, who lives alone, was startled after a strange noise caught her attention. Before she could take action, armed dacoits barged inside her house by breaking open the front door lock and latch. A second door was also forced open by the dacoits.Police said the dacoits tied up Meshram’s hands with her saree and dragged her to different rooms, asking her to show the place where the valuables were kept. Though the woman was not injured, she was left shaken up by the dacoits dragging her around her house.A stunned Meshram later sought help from her daughter and son-in-law who reside opposite her house. Later, a complaint was lodged at Gittikhadan police station. City police are now trying to collect the CCTV footage of the miscreants. “The dacoits are likely to be labourers from other states like Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, who were trying to lay their hands upon valuables for some fast cash,” said an official. In another unrelated incident, a trucker was injured after being stabbed by a gang of robbers on the Service Road near Wadhamna earlier this week. The victim, a native of another state, had earned the wrath of the robbers as he was trying to chase them. Apart from Gittikhadan police, crime branch too has started a probe into the incident. According to a source, several criminals were rounded up for questioning but cops are yet to get any clue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/senior-citizen-tied-up-robbed-of-valuables/articleshow/88078962.cms||Soumitra Bose

Some 600 health workers protesting against their sudden firing by AMC since November 30 tried to hold a protest at Satyagrah Chhavni in Sector 6 early on Friday. “We tried to assemble and protest there but police immediately detained us and took us to various police stations. We were made to sit there till 6.30pm,” said Jagdish Shah, a multipurpose health worker (MPHW) who is one of the hundreds of sacked workers. Shah said that on Thursday when they met Ahmedabad mayor Kirit Parmar, he had passed the buck on to AMC commissioner Mukesh Kumar saying only he could help them. He said that the commissioner refused to meet them and officials told him that only the health commissioner in Gandhinagar had the power to help. “So we went to Gandhinagar to make our voices heard. Ours was a peaceful protest. We are not committing a crime by demanding our rights. Still we were treated like criminals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sacked-health-workers-detained-in-gandhinagar/articleshow/88079766.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cong banking on ’09 deja vu; BJP worried about the same||Nagpur: On paper, BJP’s MLC candidate (local bodies constituency) Chandrashekhar Bawankule seems be in a stronger position with 60-odd surplus voters, but still the saffron party is planning to whisk its public representatives in local bodies to a ‘safe and secure’ resort till the polling date. BJP’s strategy does make sense if one looks at the 2009 results of the same polls. Back then, BJP’s Ashok Mankar looked set to romp home with over 50 voters more than that of the Congress. Yet, Congress’ Rajendra Mulak pulled off a miracle by winning the polls by four votes. The second generation politician worked the local political equations to the maximum and swung votes drastically in his favour, in the end winning by a wafer thin margin. This is why Congress president Nana Patole on Friday said that the ‘on paper’ calculations of voters don’t matter. “This is not that type of an election. Here it does not matter who has the maximum voters. We have worked out a strategy to get to the finish line,” said Patole. A Congress leader said that Mulak’s victory in 2009 is what’s worrying BJP. “If it could happen back then, it can happen now too. In these elections what matters is the relationship you develop with voters, who themselves are public representatives. So a candidate like Mulak, whose father himself was a veteran Congress leader, knew how to connect with voters in every village and taluka. This also means having good equations with the opposition. In the end, Mulak pulled it off,” said the leader. But while Mulak achieved the seemingly impossible, does this mean Congress candidate Ravindra Bhoyar can do the same? The answer depends on whom you speak to within the Congress. The camp which backed Bhoyar’s entry is convinced that history will be repeated. One such leader said, “Do you think tickets are given just like in a scenario where we already know which party has how many voters? It is absurd to even entertain the thought that senior politicians who are smart enough to run the state government will be stupid enough to back a loser. We know which political equations will come into play during the polls, as even the BJP has active factions.” But members of the camp who were not too keen on Bhoyar’s entry say it’s wrong to compare this poll with that of 2009. “That was Mulak, with a big political legacy backing him that has roots in rural politics. He was himself an MLA before so can’t be compared to Bhoyar. And Bawankule is a very strong candidate. It all comes down to how Congress leaders like Mulak and Sunil Kedar work their rural voters and swing things for Bhoyar,” said the leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-banking-on-09-deja-vu-bjp-worried-about-the-same/articleshow/88078971.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The train left from Safdarjung railway station where Kejriwal visited different coaches of the train to greet the pilgrims. He also interacted with them and took stock of the arrangements made for the free pilgrimage. The pilgrims thanked the chief minister for the scheme. Meanwhile, the CM claimed that the Centre refused permission to the Delhi government to organise a programme at the railway station to mark the departure of the train with pilgrims. The pilgrims were brought to the railway station by buses. “Due to corona, the process of sending people on pilgrimage under our scheme had stopped. Now that corona has reduced a bit, we have restarted the pilgrimage. Under this, the first train has left for Ayodhya today,” Kejriwal stated after seeing off the pilgrims. He directed the officials accompanying the pilgrims to take full care of the facilities and ensure that they do not face any trouble. In January, elders of Delhi will go on pilgrimage to Kartarpur Sahib and Velankanni. Now, 15 pilgrimage sites can be visited under Mukhyamantri Tirth Yatra Yojana. “A plan is ready to send Delhi pilgrims to Kartarpur Sahib by deluxe AC buses. The first batch of passengers via AC bus from Delhi to Kartarpur Sahib will leave on January 5, 2022 and the first train carrying passengers from Delhi to Velankanni will leave on January 7, 2022,” the government said in a statement. Those who could not take advantage of the scheme during the pandemic may modify their applications on the e-district portal to opt for the Delhi-Ayodhya-Delhi tour, said an official. Kejriwal risking lives of elders, claims BJP Leader of the Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri questioned the idea of the AAP government to take senior citizens on a pilgrimage to Ayodhya at a time when cases of Omicron, a new coronavirus variant, have been detected in the county fuelling fresh Covid scare. “Kejriwal is risking the lives of elders just for applause in view of the upcoming assembly elections in some states, which is not fair,” Bidhuri claimed in a statement. He requested Kejriwal to postpone the pilgrimage plan till the coronavirus situation comes under control.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-flags-off-train-to-ayodhya-with-1k-seniors/articleshow/88080360.cms||---

The revised price is Rs 3,900. Beginning November 30, all passengers arriving in the city from at-risk countries have been directed to compulsorily undergo a RT-PCR test and leave the airport only if the test negative for Covid-19. The test is also mandatory for Dubai-bound flyers. While the conventional RT-PCR test is much cheaper – Rs 999 – it takes about four to six hours for the results to come through. In case of the Rapid RT-PCR, it’s only a matter of an hour. In Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, the latter is priced at Rs 3,900 to Rs 4,000. “Since most of the people arriving at RGIA are opting for the Rapid test, owing the convenience of time, the cost was revised,” said a source from the airport. According to rough estimates, about 1,500 to 1,800 incoming passengers are expected to be tested every week at the facility – in light of the Omicron threat. Earlier scores of passengers had taken to Twitter to air their grievance against the exorbitant rate. “@MinisterKTR sir. In Hyderabad airport agencies are over charging the travellers for RT PCR tests.  At RGIA, a regular RT-PCR test costs Rs 999, and a rapid RT-PCR test costs Rs 4,500 for passengers. Telangana government allowed to charge Rs 500-800. Please stop this looting,” wrote one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rapid-rt-pcr-test-rates-cut-at-rgia-to-now-cost-rs-3900/articleshow/88080350.cms||---

According to the reply, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had given permission to cut 6,384 trees in the city during this period. Though, the civic body put the number of trees felled illegally (without seeking mandatory permission) at 267 in the same period, the actual number could be much more as several trees were felled clandestinely and were not reported.The department also stated that the NMC earned over Rs3 crore in lieu of giving permission to chop the trees. More than 50% of these trees were cut on the premises of various government agencies and for infrastructure works such as widening of roads, construction of flyovers and Metro tracks etc.Civic officials, however, claimed they always make efforts to protect trees whenever possible, but also ensure that developmental activities are not hampered.Environmentalists expressed concern over this data. “Against 6,384 trees cut with permission in the last 6.8 years, how many public objections and hearings were held?” asked activist Jaydeep Das.“How many and where were the compensatory plantations done for the trees that were cut? As per the old norm of 1:5 ratio, there should be minimum compensatory plantations of around 31,000 plants against the trees cut,” he said.He ridiculed the number of trees cut illegally and claimed it has been grossly under-reported. “Let’s say these are the numbers which the public brought to the notice of the NMC. The numbers of illegally cut trees would be much higher than that and there is no harm in accepting that,” said Das.“Since the last tree census was done in 2012, NMC won’t have exact number which they can verify against today. “There may be trees planted post 2012, which may have been cut in 2020 or 2021,” he said. “Going by the number of illegally cut trees, as admitted by the NMC, how many FIRs against the miscreants have been registered by the garden department, which is the primary guardian of the urban trees?” asked the environment activist.The department also informed that the civic body had spent Rs1.25 crore for procuring 7,298 tree guards in the last four years — from 2017 to 2020. It means the NMC paid Rs1,713 for procuring one tree guard.Environment activists, however, questioned the installation of tree guards which failed to protect trees planted across the city.They also pointed out that at many places, these tree guards were stolen. Despite this, the department has not tried to find an alternative to the iron tree guards, which are being stolen and sold to scrap dealers for easy money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-trees-cut-every-day-in-city-in-80-months/articleshow/88078984.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Land under coal-bearing areas act can’t be partitioned: HC||Nagpur: In a ruling which may have a far-eaching impact on land acquisition by coal mining PSUs like Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), the high court has observed that once a holding is covered under section 9 the of coal-bearing areas act 1957, it cannot be partitioned by existing owners into separate units. Section 9 deals with declaration of a given land area to be under acquisition for coal mining. The further process, including granting of compensation and final takeover, happens subsequently. The ruling came after a petition was filed by an oustee whose land in Kamptee was taken over by WCL for an opencast mining project in 2006. WCL grants a cash compensation as well as an option to take up one job in the company in lieu of individual land holdings. Those not taking employment get extra compensation. Explaining the case, the central government’s standing counsel Advocate Sushma, who represented WCL, said, “The land was jointly held by three persons. Since none held the land individually, a joint compensation was granted to the trio. Later, the land was partitioned among the three and one of the owners, Shantabai Shende and her son Lakhpati, filed a case seeking employment against their share. It has been ruled that since the separation of ownership happened after section 9, it can’t be held valid.” Following section 9, the land vests under WCL and would be considered as a single unit as it was at that time, she said. This also means that once a land is declared to be acquired under section 9 of the Coal-Bearing Areas Act, no alternation, including partition among the existing holders, can happen. In this case, the other two owners had forgone the employment option and taken extra compensation. Now, the logic by the WCL side was that since the entire land has to be taken as a single unit, it could not happen that extra compensation could be paid to the two holders and job given to one. In that case the entire additional compensation had to be returned and any one of the three claimants as decided mutually could have got the job. Advocate Sushma is an advocate empaneled by WCL. A source in WCL said that he company often comes across cases of people creating separate titles of a single holding after an advanced stage of acquisition like section 9. Subsequent claims from their side lead to disputes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/land-under-coal-bearing-areas-act-cant-be-partitioned-hc/articleshow/88080369.cms||Shishir Arya

The decision was taken at an emergency meeting held in the backdrop of IUML being forced to shelve its plan to conduct an awareness campaign against the alleged ‘anti-Muslim’ stand of the government inside mosques on December 3. IUML leader Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal chaired the meeting. The meeting was held after Samastha, on Thursday, backed off from the decision taken at the meeting of Muslim Coordination Committee convened by IUML. The meeting was attended by representatives from over a dozen Muslim organizations earlier this week. IUML national general secretary PK Kunhalikutty said the decision to entrust Waqf board appointments to PSC was biased and went against the Central Waqf Act. “It amounts to taking away the rights granted to state Waqf boards by the Central Act. It will have repercussions even outside state and BJP-ruled states could make it a model,” he said, adding that IUML will not back down and will continue to oppose the government’s decision. “There is no point in saying that an issue is being communalized when facts are being told. Some people are trying to deny the rights by communalizing and politicizing the matter which is incorrect,” he said. IUML leader Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal chaired the meeting. But, CPM had strongly opposed the idea of holding campaigns against the government inside mosques and the CM too had reached out to Samastha leadership to resolve differences through talks. However, Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen (KNM) brought up the issue in speeches made inside their mosques after Friday prayers (on December 3). KNM leader Hussain Madavoor said in his address at Palayam mosque that if the real purpose of Waqf is to be achieved, then the people handling Waqf affairs should have faith in Waqf and believe that Waqf properties belong to Allah. “That is why there is a Central Act for Waqf in the country governing the constitution of state Waqf boards. The staff appointment in Waqf board is carried out by the board and it has been so for all the 30 Waqf boards in the country. Muslim religious leaders have urged the government that it should continue that way. The chief minister has expressed readiness to hold talks, which is a welcome development,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-plans-a-mega-waqf-meet-on-dec-9/articleshow/88080374.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC puts financial clamp on errant builder in refund row||MUMBAI: Calling it the “worst form of economic offence”, the Bombay high court on Friday put a financial clamp on partners of a realty firm who did not refund Rs 1.25 crore to a Navi Mumbai couple despite a MahaRera order. “You will not withdraw anything from your personal and partnership accounts. Your family members will also not withdraw,” said Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav who heard a petition by Seawoods residents Sabhajit and Gita Yadav. The direction was passed after the judges took note of the statement by Yadav’s advocates Ajit and Vikram Jakhadi that there are over 200 flat purchasers in the same Hill View project at Chembur (E) who have been “cheated” by Hemendra and Chetan Mapara of M/s Reliance Enterprise, Builders and Developers, and have not received possession of flats. An intervention plea was filed on behalf of 140 flat purchasers who have formed a society. While Chetan was brought to court in a wheelchair, Hemendra submitted documents on assets disclosure, as sought by the court. The judges noted they also are partners in several other firms. They have given huge loans to their family members but told the court they have nothing to offer the Yadavs. Questioned how many flats the brothers have and on crores given as loans and advances, Hemendra was evasive. “I have to recollect,” he said. Justice Kathawalla said, “You’ll be in very serious trouble if you give us such answers. When you go inside (jail) you will have enough time to recollect.” Justice Kathawalla then recalled Hemendra had appeared in court earlier in another case filed by flat purchasers. “I know this man now. That time also his behaviour was the same. I know your modus operandi. He is not new in this court. The moment he wore his specs I knew this man had appeared before court,” he said. Jakhadi said Hemendra has served a jail term. Advocate Mahesh Menon, for the interveners, said there are 32 complaints against Maparas on the Rera website. “There are only 27 slabs completed without doors and windows and with incomplete brickwork,” he added. Jakhadi said the Maparas stayed in a bungalow worth crores, while many flat purchasers sold their possessions and paid their instalments. “My client took a Rs 80 lakh loan,” he said. “You (Maparas) people stay in bungalows. None of them have received their flats,” said Justice Kathawalla. Justice Jadhav added, “This is the worst form of economic offence. It is affecting generations of families.” But Hemendra asserted, “I have not done anything wrong.” The judges, in their order, recorded this was not the first matter Hemendra had remained present in court. “Therefore the court cannot trust any of his responses,” they added. The Maparas are directed not to not operate accounts of partnership with other firms. Their family members shall also not operate their accounts. Any amount received from flat buyers or debtors shall be deposited in court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-puts-financial-clamp-on-errant-builder-in-refund-row/articleshow/88081049.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The accused also sent a message to his brother on WhatsApp, stating that he had killed his wife and two children under depression. On coming to know about the incident, a police team headed by commissioner of police Asim Kumar Arun, along with a forensics team and dog squad rushed to the spot and initiated investigations. The police said that the accused, Prof Sushil Singh, 55, is the HoD in the forensic science department at a private medical college in Mandhana.

The offender will also have to pay an additional amount of Rs 2,000 per tonne of excess load and the liability of expenditure for off-loading the vehicle in presence of RTO official.. The new list of compounding fines was notified by the state government on Thursday under the Motorvehicle (amendment) Act. While transport associations welcomed huge fines as overloading was a serious crime, they also pointed out that higher the fines, higher was the corruption by enforcement officials. “The revised fines are very much on the higher side. However, we are against overloading and we will also spread a message to our association members to desist from overloading. The higher the fines , higher the corruption,” alleged Bal Malkit Singh of All India Motor Transport Congress. He urged the government to ensure that the new fines were implemented sincerely and real culprits were brought to book. “In some cases, there is a minor variation in load and officials harass transporters. There should be some leniency in such cases. But in case of gross violations, the hefty penalty should be levied,” he pointed out. Another transporter from Mumbai said that overloading was done allegedly in connivance with law enforcement officials in a few cases and this should be checked as well. Also consignor and consignee should be held accountable, transporters demanded. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said the government was serious about cases of overloading of heavy goods vehicles which has led to road mishaps and fatalities in the past. “With higher penalties, we just hope the number of cases come down in the next few months,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-now-pay-40k-for-overloading-truck-on-highway/articleshow/88081767.cms||---

The room, which had been closed since the incident was opened and re-examined. The suicide scene was repeated by hanging the effigy of Aanchal in the bathroom. The police team entered the room where Aanchal was hanging on the noose. The SFL team of the police had taken an effigy with them. The effigy of Aanchal’s height was hanged in the same way as Aanchal’s body was hanged. The measurement and the position of the dead body will be matched. If both match in measurement, then suicide will be proved scientifically. Aanchal, wife of Ashok Nagar’s Spice trader Suryansh Kharbanda, had committed suicide on November 19. Spice businessman and his mother Nisha are in jail these days after being booked under the dowry act. Suryansh was at his sister’s house in Lucknow with his mother at the time of the incident. The police had arrested him from there. He had left the house on November 12 due to family dispute and on the morning of November 19, Aanchal’s body was found hanging in the house itself. Forensic expert Dr PK Srivastava said that the investigation report will be handed over to the police by Monday. It will include all the facts, so that there is no room for any doubt. A two-page note of Aanchal was also recovered. The names of six people were written in it and whom Aanchal had held responsible. The police have collected several samples for handwriting matching. The samples have been sent by the police to the Forensic Lab for handwriting matching. “Further action will be based on the investigation report,” said a senior official further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/aanchals-suicide-case-cops-re-enact-crime-scene/articleshow/88080384.cms||---

All the accused have gone behind bars in the last one year for various crimes, including house-breaking. According to police, the personal rivalry which Jishnu had towards Sandeep lead to the murder. Jishnu was former president of Yuva Morcha Peringara panchayat committee. Nandu is a CPM sympathizer. Police are yet to confirm whether the motive behind the murder is political rivalry. During the interrogation, Jishnu has told police that he nursed a grudge against Sandeep for trying to make his mother lose her temporary job in the beverages warehouse in Pulikkeezhu. Sandeep was attacked around 8pm on Thursday at a bylane in Nedumbram near Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta. The autopsy report said that there were around 18 wounds on the body. Four deep wounds on the chest are said to be the cause of death. The funeral of Sandeep, who was also a former panchayat member, was held in his residential premises in Chathankary on Friday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/five-held-for-murder-of-cpm-leader-in-thiruvalla/articleshow/88080387.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Allahabad HC seeks CBI reply on Anand Giri’s bail plea||PRAYAGRAJ: The Allahabad high court on Friday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file its reply within four weeks in response to the bail application moved by Anand Giri, one of the accused in the alleged suicide case of Narendra Giri, the then president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP). Hearing the bail application of Anand Giri, Justice Rahul Chaturvedi directed to list this case after four weeks for hearing. The applicant, Anand Giri, is in jail since September 22, 2021 in connection with this suicide case. In the bail application, it has been stated that the applicant has been falsely implicated in this case. According to the application, the alleged suicide note is not in the handwriting of Narendra Giri. Further, there are so many cuttings in it. Further, even the accused applicant was not present in Prayagraj on the date this incident had taken place. Subsequently, he was informed by the police authorities about the suicide of Narendra Giri, while he was far away in Haridwar in Uttarakhand. The body of the then president of ABAP, Narendra Giri, was found hanging from the ceiling of a room in Shri Math Baghambari Gaddi under the limits of Georgetown police station in Prayagraj on September 20, 2021. Narendra Giri was the president of the largest organization of seers in India. In his suicide note, the Mahant had charged Anand Giri and two others of mental harassment. An FIR was lodged against the three accused under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at police station Georgetown in Prayagraj. Subsequently, Anand Giri and two others were arrested. They were produced before the CJM court on September 22 and remanded to judicial custody for 14 days and sent to jail. Later, on the recommendation of the state government, the investigation of the case was transferred from UP police to the CBI. After 60 days of investigation, the CBI had submitted its chargesheet on November 20, 2021 stating that Mahant Narendra Giri was under such “grave mental trauma” from his estranged disciple Anand Giri and two others that he ended his life to “avoid defamation and insult” in the eyes of society. The agency had filed its chargesheet accusing Anand Giri and two others of abetment to suicide and criminal conspiracy. Earlier, on November 11, the special judge at Prayagraj had rejected the bail application of Anand Giri saying that as per the case diary of the case, the witnesses have by and large supported the prosecution case. “Therefore, keeping in view the gravity and seriousness of the offence, the bail application is rejected,” the special judge had added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-cbi-reply-onanand-giris-bail-plea/articleshow/88080386.cms||---
---||Delhi||Plea opposes same-sex marriages under Hindu Marriage Act, Delhi HC to hear case in February||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Friday said it would examine in February next year a plea opposing same-sex marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act on the ground that marriage in Hinduism is allowed only between a man and woman since times immemorial. “Marriages in societies like Hindu are very much part of their religion and derived and associated with their divine entities as well as religious texts and thereby hold significant sentimental values,” the plea said. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh listed the application by Sewa Nyaya Utthan Foundation seeking to be heard in the main petition for recognition of same-sex marriages for February 3, when all the batch matters will be heard. The application said the petition seeking same-sex marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act was not only against the religious system of Hindu Marriage but also an act to bring changes abruptly without any reason and this change would impact other aspects like inheritance, adoptance and religious ecosystem of the Hindu society that are critically hinged on the religious ‘sanskar of vivah’. “As per vedas (the sourcebook of Hinduism), marriage happens only between a male and a female to fulfil certain worldly and religious duties. In fact, most veda mantras recited during Hindu vivah or describing the ritual of marriage refer to a biological male and a biological female. This has been the practice since times immemorial across almost all Hindu sampradayas without any variation in essence,” said the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-opposes-same-sex-marriages-under-hindu-marriage-act-hc-to-hear-case-in-feb/articleshow/88079790.cms||---

He had taken a leave from the post for a period of one year (from Nov 13, 2020) on health grounds. “Who doesn’t have a health problem or two? Things have improved now. I no longer have health issues that prevent me from taking up higher responsibilities,” said Balakrishnan. His return to the chair, in the run up to the party state conference in the first week of March in Ernakulam, foretells the possibility of him being re-elected as the party state secretary for another term. LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan was only holding the fort as the acting secretary of the party in his absence. To a question, Balakrishnan told reporters at AKG Centre that he was not afraid of political witch hunts. Balakrishnan, who had serious health issues, went on leave after the arrest of his younger son Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with a money laundering case. Even while on leave, he started taking up political responsibilities just before the state assembly election. In the current inner-party equation, there is no political reason to stop Balakrishnan’s return as the party secretary for another term.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kodiyeri-back-as-cpm-state-secy/articleshow/88080404.cms||---
---||Pune||Shallow fog brings down visibility level across Pune||PUNE: The city’s visibility dropped to 1,000-2,000 metres on Friday morning, as shallow fog was reported from several areas in Pune. Shallow fog conditions are likely to continue till Saturday, IMD officials said on Friday. The unusual weather conditions cool day and night temperatures and rainfall being experienced in the city may continue for another day or two, after which minimum temperatures are expected to drop significantly, bringing in the usual weather conditions seen in December, officials said. Pune received 8.3mm rainfall till 5:30pm on Friday, but there is no rain forecast from Sunday, the IMD officials said. Senior IMD scientist and head of Surface Instruments Division (SID) at the Climate Research and Services, IMD, Pune, KS Hosalikar, told TOI, “Such weather conditions rain, foggy mornings are expected to continue for a day or two according to the forecast. Thereafter, only partly cloudy skies and normal December weather conditions are likely to prevail in Pune.” Hosalikar’s tweet on Friday read, “Pune today 3 Dec, morning, fog observed reducing the visibility, cloudy sky, humidity 96%, light drizzle and minimum temperature at Shivajinagar 16.3°C...A significant chill in air.” On the shallow fog being reported early mornings in Pune, he said the city is experiencing weather conditions that prevail in hill stations, with foggy mornings, intermittent cool rain spells (like those that recently lashed the city) and low day temperatures. “As there was still a lot of moisture in Pune because of heavy rain a few days ago, it caused early morning fog on Friday. Day temperatures have dropped 8-9 degrees Celsius below normal in the last three days. With day temperatures dropping significantly coupled with cloudy skies, no sunshine and on-and-off rain, the weather feels chilly,” he said. Day temperatures in Pune in all stations were below 30 degrees Celsius. Hosalikar said rain in December was unusual. “Pashan and Shivajinagar saw record-breaking rain recently with a similar trend in Mumbai, though the coastal city does not usually recieve rain in December. Last time it rained a lot in Mumbai in December was when cyclone Ockhi had affected Maharashtra in 2017. At present, the trough from EC Arabian Sea to NE Arabian Sea through Kutch gave intense spells of rain across Pune on Dec 1 night. Impact of the same continued in the following days in Pune. On Friday, the city received rain in isolated places, but it was a moist day in Pune, with fog throughout the morning. There was sunshine on Friday evening,” said Hosalikar. On Friday afternoon, Pune and Mahabaleshwar, including the adjoining locations, had isolated cloud patches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shallow-fog-brings-down-visibility-level-across-city/articleshow/88080391.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Ex-Sena MP Adsul’s plea for pre-arrest bail rejected||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday observed presence of former Shiv Sena MP Anandrao Adsul would be needed for custodial interrogation and rejected his plea for anticipatory bail in a money laundering case. Justice Nitin Sambre heard his counsel Ashok Mundergi with advocate Subodh Desai and ED counsel ASG Anil Singh before rejecting his plea. He was seeking anticipatory bail in the proceedings initiated by ED in connection with an alleged Rs 980 crore fraud at the City Co-operative Bank. Adsul had approached HC after a Mumbai sessions court denied him interim relief in the anticipatory bail application filed there by him. The ED case was based on Adsul’s own complaint registered by Economic Offences Wing of Mumbai police for offences of criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy under IPC for alleged irregularities in the loan disbursement by City Co-operative Bank. The ED had issued Adsul three summons. He was asked to appear in person or through a representative. He had challenged these summons and the ED case before HC, which had, while rejecting his quashing petition in October, said that “it cannot be said that there is no material” against him. The HC bench had in October, however, said it was not commenting anything more on the merits of the case and had given Adsul liberty to seek anticipatory bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ex-sena-mp-adsuls-plea-for-pre-arrest-bail-rejected/articleshow/88081064.cms||---
---||Delhi||Nehru sangathan files complaint against 20 candidates for cheating||New Delhi: Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), an autonomous organisation under the ministry of youth affairs and sports, has filed a complaint with Delhi Police against 20 people who were allegedly involved in cheating during an exam for recruitment of district youth coordinators. According to police, on Thursday, they registered a case and further investigation was going on. “We have not arrested anyone,” an officer said. An officer said that, in 2019, the examination was conducted by institute of banking personnel selection (IBPS) in collaboration with TCS. “In the online examination, held on April 30, 2019, as many as 19,793 candidates appeared at various centres, including Shimla and Karnal,” the complainant told police. Later, the authority received an email from one Mohit Viz, who alleged irregularities at the Shimla centre where 73 candidates appeared. “Out of 73 candidates, 16 have made their place in the selection list. NYKS on its scrutiny found that the marks obtained by these 16 candidates were more or less equal, which pointed towards irregularities and fraud at the centre,” the complainant added. Further, all the candidates were from Haryana, but instead of choosing a centre in Kurukshetra, which was close, they chose Shimla.

---||Nashik||Freedom of expression shrinking: Javed Akhtar||Nashik: Well-known poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar said that the freedom of expression among the novelist and authors is ‘shrinking’ in the country. Akhtar was the chief guest of the 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan, which started in Nashik on Friday. “Just like the Parliament and the state assemblies are important in a democratic setup, so is the freedom of expression of writers and authors. Unfortunately, that freedom of expression for them is shrinking,” he said, speaking in Hindi. He also said that a writer should not be aligned with the state, but at the same time, cannot remain aloof from the happenings around him. He has to articulate the feelings of the common man through his writings. “Unfortunately, that it not happening. The writer’s pen trembles while writing about the plight of the common people and their woes. There is some kind of fearfulness that has crept among them. At present, there is darkness which was never felt before,” he said, stressing the need for all writers across the country to come together and work fearlessly. Retired bureaucrat and Marathi novelist, Vishwas Patil, who inaugurated the event, called on the state government to preserve the monuments of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj era on priority, instead of constructing a memorial higher than the Statue of Liberty. “It will be the real tribute to the Maratha King,” he said. Patil also used the opportunity to clear air about the alleged corruption charges against him. “There was an allegation of corruption against me. But so far, I have not been served any notice from the government about the corruption charges,” he claimed. Nashik guardian minister Chaggan Bhujbal demanded that the Centre accord classical status to Marathi language that has 52 dialects. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his recorded speech, said the festival was a testimony to how things are returning to normal after the pandemic. He applauded the president of the event, Dr Jayant Narlikar, for his meaningful writings. Dr Narlikar, who could not attend due to his health concerns, said that if we look at Marathi literature, we will see how little science literature is in it. “Science fiction writers can only be counted on our fingers tips. There is a kind of fear of science. Often readers or listeners also assume that we do not understand scientific facts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/freedom-of-expression-shrinking-javed-akhtar/articleshow/88079028.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||4 flights diverted, many delayed||Pune: More than 20 flights’ arrival and departure to and from the city airport were delayed and four were diverted on Friday because of low visibility owing to early morning fog, triggering chaos at the facility’s terminal building till late in the afternoon. “The first flight landed only at 9.15am. No flights were able to take off or land at the airport because of low visibility between 6am and 9am. Many flights are still getting delayed and attempts are being made to restore order among flyers. There is little anyone can do in this situation,” an airport official said. In the morning, the airport management tweeted about the problem. “There is low visibility at Pune due to fog. As a result flights are getting delayed or diverted for the next few hours. All passengers travelling from Pune airport are requested to check flight timings with their airlines,” the tweet read. A similar situation was witnessed on Wednesday, too, when several flights got delayed because of the weather conditions. “I got no prior information from the airline on this. As I was proceeding for security check, I got a text message stating that the flight has been delayed. My flight to Bengaluru was scheduled to take off at 7.30am but it took off at 2pm. By then many flights had been delayed and the rush at the security hold area was overwhelming with people not getting place to sit. Many were seen getting into heated arguments with the airline staff,” a flyer said. Flights that were diverted include an IndiGo flight from Ahmedabad, which was diverted to Mumbai, a flight from Delhi, too, was diverted to Mumbai, one from Chennai was diverted to Hyderabad, and an Air India flight from the national capital was diverted to Mumbai.

The father of the victim deposed in a hearing which was partially held in-camera. Last month the court framed charges against the two accused for several offences, including murder, kidnapping and destruction of evidence. Vyas’s body was never found. Both the accused, Khushi Sahjwani (46) and Siddesh Tamhankar (42), pleaded not guilty, paving the way for the trial to commence against them. The maximum punishment attracted in the case is the death sentence. Vyas, a resident of Grant Road who worked in Andheri, went missing on March 16, 2018. The alleged couple was arrested for sthe murder on May 5, 2018. A police inquiry revealed that the two allegedly dumped her body at Mahul. While Sahjwani, mother to a teenage boy, was granted bail by the Supreme Court this year, Tamhankar is still in jail. While granting Sahjwani bail, the apex court had said, “Considering that the petitioner is a female undertrial prisoner, in custody for more than three years...and considering the family situation... the petitioner is directed to be released on bail...” The court also noted the chargesheet was submitted in July 2018.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-salon-exec-murder-trial-begins-her-dad-deposes/articleshow/88081786.cms||---

However, devotees were upset that the HR&CE department that manages the temple did not release information on any pandemic-time restrictions.Considered as the foremost among all Divya Desam temples in Vaishnavite belief, the temple has been conducting Vaikunta Ekadasi during the Margazhi month (December-January) every year with thousands in attendence. However, the temple management has not disclosed anything, putting devotees in other states and districts in a fix. We have not received the event schedule, it is still unclear whether devotees would be allowed to view the holy events,” V B Jaganath, a devotee from Karumandapam, said. While the district administration has convened several meetings to host the festival peacefully, neither it nor the temple management has conveyed the SOPs.

---||Kolkata||Cyclone Jawad may change course, hit Bengal coast as deep depression||KOLKATA: Cyclone Jawad is likely to change its course near Puri coast and curve towards Bengal on Sunday. With changing course, it may also start losing strength. It could cross the Bengal coast in the Sunderbans as a deep depression. The exact landfall point is not clear yet. While it had earlier been predicted to hit land on Saturday morning, weathermen said it could now change direction after getting close to Puri at noon on Sunday. Jawad will continue to move northward along the coast. While the coastal districts of Bengal are set to be lashed by heavy to very heavy rain on Saturday, Kolkata and the rest of south Bengal could receive intense showers on Sunday. “We expect Jawad to be close to the north Andhra-south Odisha coast on Saturday noon. It will then recurve in a north-northeasterly direction close to Puri, continuing to move along the Odisha coastline and move towards Bengal. While it is still not clear where Jawad will hit land, it will lead to heavy rain across the four coastal districts of Bengal and Kolkata on December 4, 5 and 6,” said deputy director-general of meteorology Sanjib Bandyopadhyay. Weathermen, who kept studying the approach of Jawad on Friday, pointed at two major possibilities. It could either hit land in Bengal or curve further east and strike the Bangladesh coast, they said. “Since it will move along the coast, it could gain further strength or may even lose intensity and hit land as a depression. In case of the latter, the impact will be moderate though the rain could still be intense across the coastal districts,” said a weather official. Jawad, named by Saudi Arabia, transformed into a cyclone from a deep depression at around 11.30am on Friday. It then lay over west-central Bay of Bengal and moved in a northwest direction, intensifying further. On Friday afternoon, it lay 530km south-southwest of Puri, 470km south-southeast of Gopalpur and 600km south-southwest of Paradeep. It moved at a speed of 22km/hr on Friday. On Saturday, the coastal districts of West Midnapore and East Midnapore have been predicted to receive very heavy rain. “On Sunday, all the four coastal districts – two Midnapores and the two Parganas, along with Howrah, Hoogly and Kolkata may receive heavy to very heavy rain,” said Bandyopadhyay. While disaster management teams have been deputed at all the coastal districts, a warning has been issued for tourists at Digha, asking them not to venture near the sea. Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has announced a series of measures at the civic headquarters. Drainage pumping stations have been alerted keeping in mind a heavy rainfall alert. If need be, heavy-duty portable pumps will be operated to flush out storm water from city's low-lying areas. A buildings department team will take care of the dilapidated buildings, borough-wise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jawad-may-change-course-hit-bengal-coast-as-deep-depression/articleshow/88079807.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Epigraphists said that the multiple memorial pillars with Tamil inscriptions stating name of the emperors signify the prominence of merchant guilds, members and the warriors, who were protecting the group during the Chola dynasty. Out of the 10 pillars discovered on the banks of the Konnaipatti tank near Ponnamaravathi, inscriptions only on nine pillars were readable. The pillars have a varying height of five to seven feet and the base is square in shape. According to the inscriptions, the 10 members of a Tamil merchant guild seem to have died due to unspecified reasons in different years, so the memorial stones were said to be different to the hero stones. The inscription mentions the name of Rajendra Chola I, epigraphists said. One of the merchants for whom a pillar was raised, identified him as Gangaikonda Chola Setti, presumably named in the honour of Rajendra Chola addressed as Gangaikondan. Other names in the stone pillars include Kundran, Saththan, Marudhan Setti, Poolankulathan, Mummudi Chola Sithilatti and Sirappan. “The merchant guild has remained influential people during the period of Rajendra Chola I. Finding 10 such pillars at one place is very rare,” said A Manikandan, a research scholar with Thanjavur Tamil University, who was part of the research team. The pillars were erected during the 10th, 17th, 28th and 29th regnal years of Rajendra Chola I.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/10-chola-era-memorial-pillars-for-tamil-merchant-guild-discovered/articleshow/88081072.cms||Deepak Karthik

Saying that their normal life has been hit, they sought immediate action from Trichy corporation officials. As the Kottapattu tank near Aavin dairy unit on Pudukottai NH reached full storage in the recent rains, the weak bunds and ill-maintained drain canals as well as supply canals inundated JK Nagar and parts of Khajamalai. The civic body diverted the surplus water using pumps and cleared blockages in the sluice gate to discharge the water to the other side of NH so that water stagnation in residential areas would recede. However, this didn’t go down well with a section of people residing in Venkateshwara Nagar who protested the temporary action as the surplus water inundated their roads. Stating that they could not access the roads on two-wheelers and cars, the locals said the civic body was ignoring their problem. Protesting the waterlogging, the residents on Friday blocked the highway. After police and Ponmalai zone officials held peace talks with the locals and the latter promised to drain the water in a day, the protest was withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/kottapattu-residents-block-road-over-water-stagnation/articleshow/88081084.cms||---

---||Nashik||Nashik health teams have tough time tracing international travellers||Nashik: The Nashik city health teams are having a tough time tracing all the international fliers, especially since they have received incomplete addresses or the phone numbers are “unreachable”. In the last five days, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has received a list of 95 international fliers from the state government. These travellers have a history of travel to the countries where the new variant of novel coronavirus, omicron, has been detected. Such countries have been identified as “at risk” countries. The Nashik civic authorities have succeeded in tracing 51 of these travellers. The swab samples of the 51 travellers have been collected and the reports of 37 have come in. All 37 have tested negative for Covid-19 so far. The NMC is expecting the reports of the remaining 14 samples by Saturday evening. Authorities said that their tracing has revealed that two international travellers having their names in the list had stayed with their relatives in Mumbai and did not come to Nashik. A major hurdle for the NMC sources is that some travellers have given their international phone numbers, which are not unreachable here. Also, in some cases, only name of the locality has been mentioned and no further details of the road or the building has been given. “The addresses of over 20 international travellers are incomplete. Hence, it becomes difficult if even their mobile number is not reachable,” said NMC officials. The teams also received the old addresses of some travellers, who were living at another location than the address given to them. “We had to get their new address from those residing near their old residence,” officials said. However, NMC officials maintained that all the fliers would be traced. When contacted, NMC’s medical superintendent Bapusaheb Nagargoje admitted that they were facing some hurdles finding international travellers as cellphone numbers of some of these travellers were not reachable. The civic authorities are collecting the swab samples of international fliers since the World Health Organisation categorised omicron as a “Variant of Concern” and asked countries to increase surveillance. Omicron has over 50 mutations and studies to check its transmissibility, impact on therapeutics and vaccines are under way globally. Health authorities said that if the samples collected from the travellers, if they are positive, will be further sent for genome sequencing to check for omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-health-teams-have-tough-time-tracing-international-travellers/articleshow/88079041.cms||Tushar Pawar

Recently, a new passenger car and mini-load van suffered major damage while crossing an unscientific speed breaker on Thanjavur main road near Varaganeri bazaar.The Indian Road Congress (IRC), a society monitoring road standards, has mandated that speed breakers should have a rounded bump of 0.10 metres height and 3.7 metres width to limit the crossing speed of vehicles below 25 km per hour. However, the speed breakers in the city including those established in recent months are deviating from these standards. The one established by state highways on Thanjavur main road near Gandhi market and Varaganeri Bazaar has a steep bump and irregular curves that damage vehicles with minimal ground clearance. Two-wheeler riders face a dangerous situation if they are late to realise the presence of the speed breaker. “Ideally the public should recover the expenses from the authorities concerned for repairing the vehicles damaged by the speed breaker. During the night, it becomes too risky as the visibility is poor,” A Manoharan, a retired railway station master, said.

The allotment of fertilizers by the concerned department should be increased to avoid this situation, Veerasekaran stated.Tamil Manila Congress’s Puliyur Rajendran said the acute shortage of urea, potash, and other chemical fertilizers has been prevailing for the last three months. “Despite repeated representations to the district collector and state government, farmers are made to run from pillar to post for necessary fertilizers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-seek-more-supply-of-fertilizers-to-paccs/articleshow/88081105.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy can’t attend court daily: Counsel||HYDERABAD: Dealing with a query on the presence of a sitting CM facing a corruption case before a trial court for each hearing, Justice Ujjal Bhuyan of Telangana high court on Friday enquired about the way the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) MPs’ bribery case that had then Prime Minister as accused was heard and decided by the trial court. The judge was hearing a petition filed by AP CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy challenging the CBI court’s order that dismissed his plea for a blanket exemption from court appearances. Referring to the ongoing daily hearing that is taking place before a Hyderabad trial court in all the 20 chargesheets filed by the CBI and the ED in the quid pro quo and money laundering cases, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy said that if the CM who was shown as accused number one in all the cases had to sit in the court, then he has to remain in the court five days in a week and that would cripple the administration in AP. The judge posted the case to December 6 for hearing CBI’s version. Jagan has been filing applications for exemption from court appearances for each hearing and has been getting exemptions on a daily basis. “The criminal procedure code says that the presence of an accused before the trial court is to ensure that he knows the case against him and hence it seeks his presence in his interest. If an educated accused prefers to forego this facility and wants his case to be represented by his counsel, then that should be considered positively as long as the trial is not impeded,” Niranjan said. The court should take into consideration the nature of the public duties a CM had to carry out, he said. It was in this context, the judge referred to JMM bribery case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jagan-cant-attend-court-daily-counsel/articleshow/88081109.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

In his complaint, initially lodged with the Warje police on Thursday, the victim stated he was returning home in his motorcycle when three men followed him on a scooter and forced him to stop near Chandni Chowk. “The trio accused the victim of driving away after dashing their scooter and damaging their smartphone. They showed him a damaged smartphone and asked for compensation while abusing and threatening him of dire consequences,” assistant inspector Sagar Kate of the Hinjewadi police told TOI, citing the complaint. “Later, the trio took the key of the complainant’s motorcycle and forced him to sit pillion on it. They took him to an ATM kiosk and forced him to withdraw Rs 9,000. They let him go only after he gave them the money,” Kate said. The Warje police later referred the case to their Hinjewadi counterparts for investigation. “We have collected CCTV footages from different locations. The suspects could be from Warje Malwadi area. We are working on some clues,” Kate said. The police have invoked charges under Sections 392 (robbery), 364A (kidnapping for ransom), 323 (causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 504 (intentional insult), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-men-kidnap-rob-artist-after-quarrel/articleshow/88080422.cms||---
---||World||Omicron could displace Delta, says WHO||The WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Friday the Omicron variant could become dominant because it is highly transmissible, but that a different vaccine may not be needed. She told the Reuters Next conference that it was too early to say whether Omicron is milder than other variants and cast doubt over its origin, saying it was far from certain it emerged in southern Africa. “It is possible that it could become (the) dominant variant,” Swaminathan said, adding that it was however impossible to predict. The Delta variant now accounts for 99% of infections globally, she said. Scientists in the EU and Australia are forecasting that Omicron may account for more infections than Delta within a few months. She said Omicron “was highly transmissible” and cited data from South Africa showing the number of cases doubling daily. “How worried should we be? We need to be prepared and cautious, not panic, because we’re in a different situation to a year ago.” She said there is not yet conclusive evidence about Omicron’s impact on the effectiveness of antibodies. “The fact that they’re not getting sick ... that means the vaccines are still providing protection and we would hope that they would continue to provide protection,” Swaminathan said. She was cautious about the need to upgrade existing vaccines, noting that a booster of existing shots might be enough against Omicron. A WHO technical advisory group is trying to work out if a new type of vaccine be needed against Omicron, she added. Speaking to Reuters Next earlier in the day, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said his firm would be able to adapt its vaccine relatively quickly. “I believe in principle at a certain timepoint we will need a new vaccine against this new variant.” Swaminathan, a qualified paediatrician from India, raised doubts about the origin of the new variant, which was first detected in southern Africa, where the highest number of cases is also being recorded. “Where did it originate? We don't know,” she said noting it could have originated in countries which do not have enough genomic sequencing. “We may never know.” Flight bans by some countries targeting southern Africa were unfair, Swaminathan said. The WHO has said travel curbs can buy time but are not the way to fight the Omicron, urging countries to boost healthcare capacity and vaccinate their populations. Swaminathan also urged more equity in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and tests. Australia became the latest country to report community transmission of the new variant, a day after it was found in five US states. Three students had tested positive for the variant. The cases, detected in the country’s largest city of Sydney, come despite a ban on non-citizens entering and curbs on flights from southern Africa. On Friday, Malaysia reported its own first Omicron infection in a foreign student arriving from South Africa on November 19. Sri Lanka also announced its first case, a citizen returning from South Africa. In the US, the Biden administration announced steps to guard against the virus spreading. From Monday, international air travellers arriving in the US will have to have obtained a negative Covid test within a day of travel. “We’re going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion,” President Joe Biden said. Germany said it would bar the unvaccinated from all but essential businesses, and legislation to make vaccination mandatory would be drafted for early next year. Nepal said it will ban the entry of travellers who have been in eight African countries or Hong Kong, to curb the spread of the Omicron variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/omicron-could-displace-delta-says-who/articleshow/88081979.cms||---
---||Mumbai||10 months on, BMC to check if Mithi silt pushers work||MUMBAI: A day after TOI reported that 10 months after they were bought and after releasing close to Rs 50 crore to contractors, the BMC was now checking if the imported silt pushers and pontoon excavators deployed to de-silt Mithi river actually work, Mayor Kishori Pednekar conducted a site inspection of the desilting works. Pednekar, along with the Storm Water Drain (SWD) department officials,on Friday visited the Mithi river, where the machines are deployed, and reviewed the desilting works. BJP MLA Ameet Satam had said that the BMC has discontinued the use of the machines for now and is carrying out a performance analysis after spending Rs 50 crore. Following a complaint by Satam, Pednekar reviewed the delsilting work at the Mithi river. “Officials told me that the machines are working well. I have asked them to submit a detailed report on the performance. If they are working well, then they should not be discontinued and should be used in other nullahs too. If we find that any officials are playing a mischief or doing policy flip flops, stern action will be taken,” Pednekar said. The BMC in February announced, with much fanfare, that they would be using imported machines to clean up the Mithi and major nullahs in the city. According to officials, three silt pushers and three pontoon excavators were to be deployed for the next two years to de-silt the Mithi river. The machines madein the Netherlands and Sweden were to remove 2 lakh tonnes of silt from the Mithi per year. While the silt pusher costs around Rs 3.5 crore, the pontoon excavators cost Rs 2.25 core per unit. “Machines are working well. We will continue to use them judiciously. The performance over width of 200-300 m of these machines was also seen,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-10-months-on-bmc-to-check-if-mithi-silt-pushers-work/articleshow/88081116.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Kodiyeri Balakrishnan alleges political conspiracy||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Contradicting the state police’s claims, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Friday claimed that the CPM Peringara local committee secretary P B Sandeep was murdered by a gang of RSS-BJP workers to avenge political rivalry. “It’s a clear case of murder, committed by RSS-BJP men. The murder is the outcome of a political conspiracy. It is part of the RSS plans to take on CPM workers by eliminating them physically,” Balakrishnan told a news conference held after the CPM state secretariat meeting that ratified his return to the post of party state secretary after a hiatus. He said it was improper on the part of the state police to rule out political conspiracy behind the murder even before completing the investigation. “There should be a high-level inquiry into the conspiracy behind the murder. Those who were involved in the conspiracy should be brought before the law,” he said, adding that the CPM was against countering violence by violence. Balakrishnan said that as many as 20 CPM workers were killed after 2016 by political opponents. Of these, 15 murders were committed by BJP-RSS. A total of 215 CPM workers were murdered by BJP-RSS gangs in Kerala. In total, political opponents have killed 588 CPM workers, he said. To a question, the CPM state secretary said the Periya twin murder was the fallout of some local issues. “CPM had disowned the incident. CPM view is that local issues should not be allowed to end up in murder. There should be no violence at the behest of the party,” he said. Balakrishnan said a person need not be involved in a murder just because he was arraigned as an accused by the investigating agency.  Balakrishnan said the CBI was after CPM leaders to carry out the orders they receive from some quarters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kodiyeri-alleges-political-conspiracy/articleshow/88080428.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Abducted from Kolkata, rescued 230km away||KOLKATA/BERHAMPORE: A 38-year-old man was allegedly abducted by some unidentified persons from Kalicharan Ghosh Road in Sinthee close to the Dum Dum station on Thursday evening. The kidnappers dragged the victim, Sidhartha Banerjee, to a car and sped away from the spot. After a 230km run from the northern fringes of Kolkata, the victim was traced and rescued by the police in the wee hours of Friday. Eight people were arrested so far in connection with the abduction. The incident happened barely 100 metres away from the house of the victim at Roypara around 5.30pm when he was sitting at a local tea stall. “He was pushed inside the car. Many pedestrians and locals saw the incident but we had no idea that he was being abducted by the men,” recalled a neighbour. Banerjee runs a placement agency in the area. By the time the victim’s wife visited the Sinthee police station and informed the cops about the matter, the accused had already made a ransom call, demanding Rs 10 lakh. The accused, while on the move, made two calls from Banerjee’s phone — the first call was made to his wife and the victim was allowed to speak to her while the second call was made to one of his acquaintances, Bijoy. The second call was of longer duration and helped police trace the accused. In next two hours, cops checked the tower locations of the calls as well as CCTV footage of the area and finally, got to know that they headed towards Nadia-Murshidabad. With the help of the detective department, the Sinthee police worked in tandem with Murshidabad police to trace the car. “We used our technical leads and traced the accused in the Beldanga area of Murshidabad,” said DC (North) Joyeeta Basu. By night, cops had intercepted the car at Beldanga and arrested six of the accused. The victim was not there in the car. On being questioned by the police, the accused confessed that the victim was being taken in another car, which was intercepted at Hariharpara. The accused were planning to transfer the victim in another car. Two more persons were nabbed there. “We have arrested eight people. Banerjee and the accused were brought to the city on Friday. Prima facie, the accused claimed that they had worked as guards and cleaning staff but they were not paid. So, they abducted Banerjee and demanded ransom from his family to take a revenge. We are probing if there’s any business or personal rivalry,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-abducted-from-sinthee-rescued/articleshow/88079820.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Three of the phones were found in the houses of the accused while two others were recovered from other places recently, said the source on Friday. All the phones have been sent for forensic testing. The SIT is also trying to establish whether Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish – who is the prime accused in the case -- was with these five men at the time of the incident. The phones of Ashish and co-accused Ankit Das have already been recovered. The Supreme Court had earlier expressed concern over the SIT’s failure in getting the mobile phones of all the accused. A source told TOI, “The SIT had recovered a few unclaimed phones and some of these belonged to the accused. They have been sent to the forensic lab, and its report will be crucial. We can’t share further information.” The SIT on Friday also released pictures of 10 people suspected to be involved in the lynching of BJP workers in the October 3 violence. The probe agency has announced a reward (not disclosed) to anyone helping in the identification and arrest of these suspects. On October 3, four farmers and a journalist were allegedly run over by Ashish Mishra’s convoy during a farmers’ protest in Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri district. Three BJP workers were killed after the protesting farmers retaliated. Two cross FIRs were registered and a SIT, led by DIG Upendra Agarwal, was formed to investigate the case. Later the Supreme Court, while hearing the matter, expressed reservations over the manner in which probe was conducted by the original SIT. Following that three IPS officers were included in the probe team. The apex court also appointed Rakesh Kumar Jain, former judge of the Punjab and Haryana high court, to monitor the investigation to ensure transparency and fairness. The reconstituted SIT is now being led by 1993 batch IPS officer SB Shiradkar, currently posted as ADG, intelligence, in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/kheri-violence-sit-recovers-mobile-phones-of-5-accused-lodged-in-jail/articleshow/88079822.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activist opposes Bhujbal’s discharge plea in graft case||Mumbai: Activist Anjali Damania on Friday moved an intervention plea in a special court seeking to oppose the discharge plea of state cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal in the 2015 Kalina land scam case. The matter will come up for hearing on January 14. Damania in her plea said that in 2013, along with others, she had moved the Bombay high court for investigation into the allegations of corruption against Bhujbal. The plea said that she has been following up the case since its inception and has helped the investigating agency in the matter. “Intervenor (Damania) has no personal enmity or vendetta against the accused but is following up the case out of public interest as the public money has been looted and this is not the only case that she is following up,” Damania’s plea said. In 2015, the ACB registered a case against Bhujbal and others for irregularities in allotment of a prime piece of land in Kalina to a leading developer for construction of a library. Bhujbal, then PWD minister, and others were accused of misusing their official position for personal gains under the Prevention of Corruption Act and cheating and forgery under sections of the Indian Penal Code. The chargesheet said that as part of the pre-arranged plan, the accused deceived the state government and caused a total loss of around Rs 79 crore by preparing a false proposal-cum-feasibility report beneficial to India Bulls Real Estate Ltd. Two accused, Anilkumar Gaikwad, then PWD superintending engineer and Sanjay Solanki, then PWD undersecretary, were discharged from the case in February this year. The court had then held that the duo did not have any intention to commit an offence with their superiors. It said that at most, it can be said that there may be some negligence or gross negligence on their part while discharging thier duties particularly in respect to the proposal-cum-feasiblity report. “Basically, there is no material, prima facie showing that there was a meeting of mind of all the public servants and as a members of conspiracy, they hatched a plan to prepare a proposal-cum-feasibility report favourable to the developer,” special judge HS Satbhai had said. The court further said there was nothing on record which would suggest that the duo did certain things in a corrupt or illegal manner to cause benefit to themselves, the developer or others. On September 9, the same judge discharged Bhujbal in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case investigated by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau. His son Pankaj, nephew Sameer Bhujbal and five others were also discharged. In 2015, the state ACB had registered the FIR against the Bhujbals,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-activist-opposes-bhujbals-discharge-plea-in-graft-case/articleshow/88081122.cms||Rebecca Samervel

In its order, a bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai took strong note of the rejection of properties searched by the court-appointed architect for her and their daughter and termed the approach as “unreasonable”. “In our view, to stretch the word ‘similar’ as used in the order dated March 6, 2020, to be totally identical to the said house would be unrealistic. It will be difficult to find a house identical to the said house having the same area, the same facilities, and the same luxuries.” It rejected the plea of Poonam that she and her minor daughter be allowed to forthwith move into the 82, Pali Hill residence of her estranged husband.  “The word ‘similar' has to be construed as providing the same degree of luxury and comfort as is available in the said house. We have no hesitation in observing the conduct of the respondent-wife...to say the least, is unreasonable,” Justice Gavai said .pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sc-rejects-womans-plea-to-live-in-estranged-hubbys-home/articleshow/88081866.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: How ‘jewel thief’ Jayesh Ravji Sejpal pulled off over 30 heists in 2 decades||JAIPUR: His suave demeanour masked his long criminal history. The notorious interstate “hotel burglar” Jayesh Ravji Sejpal’s (50) interrogation has revealed a minefield of information for the Jaipur police about his alleged involvement in over 30 hotels heists in over two dozen cities across the country, including two at the city’s prominent hotels in 2012 and 2016. “We have discovered that prior to Jawahar Circle case last month, Sejpal had burgled into a hotel in Ashok Nagar in 2012, and another hotel in 2016 under the Sodala police station. FIRs were filed at both police stations, but probes were inconclusive. We have now decided to reopen both cases and investigate them afresh,” said additional commissioner of police, crime, Ajay Pal Lamba. Arrested from Gujarat on Thursday, Sejpal was on the run after robbing jewellery worth Rs 2 crore and Rs 95,000 cash from hotel Clarks Amer at Jawahar Circle in November 25. As per SHO Jawahar Circle, Radha Raman Gupta, Sejpal claimed that he wanted to buy a flat which he wished to put on the rent to earn passive income. “He had purchased a flat in Vapi in Gujarat in October. He was also planning to purchase a second flat soon,” he said. Sejpal began his criminal journey in 2003 when he, according to Lamba, stole a laptop while working at a hotel’s canteen in Mumbai. Always impeccably dressed, mostly in crisped white shirts, he prowled luxury hotels from Chandigarh to Chennai and from Jaipur to Udaipur to prey on well-heeled guests. He used his notorious charm to quickly banish any glare of suspicion and managed to strike in over 30 hotels in two decades. His victims included NRI couples, businessmen etc. Meanwhile, Jaipur police said that calls to interrogate Sejpal have been pouring in from several states and cities. “So far, we have received calls from police in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Agra, Kerala, Gujarat and Delhi. Police teams from different cities want to corroborate Jayesh’s involvement in hotel thefts that took place in their cities,” Lamba told TOI. The Udaipur police are also expected to arrive in the city anytime soon to investigate the accused’s involvement in a burglary in a five-star hotel in the city’s Amba Mati police station area on November 20. The police in their preliminary investigation have discovered that the accused was involved in as many as 30 heists at luxury hotels across the country. He is a confident trickster who easily conned the hotel staff into opening rooms by impersonating the occupant of the room.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/how-jewel-thief-sejpal-conned-luxury-hotels-for-two-decades/articleshow/88080441.cms||---

But things were just not moving,” Sunando Dhar, AIFF’s CEO Leagues and Development, told TOI on Saturday. The AIFF then reached out to Kenkre, who finished second in the Qualifiers, and the Mumbai-based side were more than keen to take part, even though they have less than a month to prepare. The I-League kicks off on December 26. “If the club had decided to play, we would have overcome all the criteria, contrary to reports stating that we failed to comply,” Chennai City said in a statement later in the day. Chennai do not have any registered player at the moment and were hoping the AIFF would provide them with a one-year exemption from playing in I-League. According to club sources, they were unable to start with the club licensing criteria due to “inordinate delay” in obtaining the affiliation letter from the Tamil Nadu Football Association. The club is also serving a FIFA transfer ban due to a dispute with their former player Nauzet Garcia. Even that, sources said, was close to getting resolved after reaching an in-principle agreement with the Spaniard. “The floods in Chennai did not help our cause,” said one club official. “Most of the grounds are flooded and not in a condition where trials can be conducted. There was no way we could put up a competitive squad.” Chennai have a partnership with Swiss giants FC Basel and the general feeling from the shareholders was that, in times of Covid-19, it was impossible to raise adequate funds. “The management was forced to take a very difficult decision that it would be detrimental for the future of the club, if we had to participate in the I-League under our current circumstances,” the club said. Chennai wrote to AIFF general secretary Kushal Das last week and asked him to use the discretionary powers and grant a one-time exemption, assuring the federation they would take efforts to return to the competition next year. However, the AIFF said in statement they were “not in a position to give any more opportunities to the club.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-kenkre-replace-former-champs-chennai-city-as-aiff-refuses-exemption/articleshow/88097350.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The men in the car stuffed a piece of cloth in her mouth and headed towards Majhola. There, the girl somehow managed to free herself and jumped out of the moving vehicle. The traumatized girl managed to make her way to Pilibhit city and was taken to Kotwali police station. Her father was called there and a complaint was lodged. Later, an FIR was registered against unidentified abductors under IPC section 364 (abduction) at Barkhera police station. In the complaint, the girl’s father said his daughter had left her bag at school and gone out to the market to buy a book after taking permission from her teacher. “While she was walking towards a bookstore, a car suddenly stopped by and a man dragged her inside. She was threatened to keep quiet. My daughter somehow managed to escape and reached Pilibhit city on an e-rickshaw. She informed my wife through someone’s phone about her ordeal,” said her father in the complaint. Dinesh Kumar, Pilibhit SP, told TOI, “We immediately registered an FIR after receiving a complaint. The girl was abducted from a busy marketplace but no one saw her. We are yet to find any CCTV footage confirming that she was abducted. She doesn’t even remember the make of the car she was kidnapped in. We are investigating the case and collecting all possible evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/schoolgirl-abducted-jumps-out-of-moving-car-in-pilibhit/articleshow/88079848.cms||---

But now these audacious village gangs have begun challenging the police also. In one such attack in the series, some villagers attacked a police team in village Dedasari of Baap police station in Phalodi and injured two policemen including an SHO on Friday afternoon. While the SHO was discharged after primary treatment, the other one, who sustained serious injuries, had to be rushed to Jodhpur for treatment.

SHO (Baap) Derawar Singh, who sustained injury in one of his fingers in left hand, said that Hero groups has set up a solar power plant in the village Dedasari in Baap and Meera Constructions has been engaged in civil work at the plant site. One Sadik Khan had been threatening the officials of the construction company and demanding the contract to be given to him and that too on his own conditions. “He had warned them not to give the work to others and had been pressurizing them to the work to be given to him and his allies and that too on his rates,” said Singh. Khan had also been demanding “hafta” from the company if they failed to grant his wish or face the consequence. “Since the company officials had given a complaint to us, we reached the site on Friday afternoon and called Sadik Khan with a view to have a talk with both the sides for an amicable resolution of the issue. But when we reached there, he and his allies, who came to the spot on five vehicles, attacked the employees of the company in our presence and when we intervened, they started pelting stones to us and fled from the spot,” Singh said. In this stone pelting, Singh sustained injury in a finger of his left hand while a constable Shravan was hit in his head by the stones. He was first taken to the local hospital but was referred to Jodhpur due to injuries in his head. Situation on the site is peaceful for now and a police team has been deployed on the spot. A case has also been filed against 10-15 persons including Sadik Khan and a hunt has begun for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/gang-attacks-solar-plant-officials-cops-2-hurt/articleshow/88080464.cms||---

---||Jaipur||12 members of 3 gangs involved in 200 cases in police net||Jaipur: City police on Friday arrested 12 members of three gangs that acted in unison to rob petrol pumps, loot drivers on highways using molls, and conduct thefts at liquor shops. Additional commissioner of police (crime), Ajay Pal Lamba, said the accused were involved in over 200 criminal offences in the city, across different police station areas. "We were examining different cases of similar kinds, including cars being robbed, and salesman at petrol stations targeted in Sadar, Bagru, Karni Vihar, Murlipura, and Kardhani areas. Our teams visited all crime scenes and began following leads on suspects," Lamba said. DCP (west) Richa Tomar said police began looking for one particular suspect, Nainpal Singh(25), when his description matched in multiple crime scenes. Tomar said that police arrested Singh along with his four gang members. "Singh’s gang booked car cabs before looting the vehicle on highways," she said, adding that Singh’s gang was involved in five cases of cab loots in the city. The gang targeted one particular model of the car which is most commonly used as cabs in Jaipur. She said that the same gang also robbed three tractors in Bhankrota, Chomu and Karni Vihar. Tomar said that Singh’s gang colluded with two other gangs, the Deepu Singh gang and the Dinesh Samota gang. Additional DCP (west) Ram Singh said that all three gangs worked in close collaboration and looted truck drivers on highways. Singh said that the accused used molls and then attacked the driver in his cabin before fleeing with vehicles. "We have arrested a total of 12 suspects in the case. All three gangs worked together. Teams have been sent to track down other accused involved in the case," Singh said. He added that the gang members had also robbed salesmen of petrol stations in the Murlipura and Kardhani areas. "The suspects would visit the petrol station in their cars. One of the suspects would overpower the salesman and rob his bag," Singh said, adding that besides loot salesmen, the accused were also found to be stealing liquor cartons from shops. "All these accused have been involved in multiple criminal activities. For instance, we found that they had also robbed cash agents in Jodhpur and Pali," Singh said. Police said that the men lured truck drivers through molls on highways to loot vehicles. "We are working to corroborate the gang’s involvement in other cases," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/12-members-of-3-gangs-involved-in-200-cases-in-police-net/articleshow/88080495.cms||---

The festive procession kicked off the three-day Marathi literature festival — 94th Akhil Bharatiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan. The Dindi — a procession carrying ‘Dnyaneshwari’ written by Sant Dnyaneshwar and works of famous litterateurs — started from Smarak at about 9.30 am and passed through the main roads of the city before reaching the landmark Sarvajanik Vachanalay. The air reverberated with the beats of dhol-tasha and lezim and students dressed in colourful attire danced to folk music and also performed martial arts. Many students held posters of noted astrophysicist and science writer Dr Jayant Narlikar, who is the president of the Sammelan. There were tableaus highlighting his books and also literary works of Veer Savarkar. The Dindi began with president of the event’s welcome committee Chhagan Bhujbal and state agriculture minister Dada Bhuse, Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Mahamandal president Kautikrao Thale-Patil performing rituals.

---||Kolkata||Cops teach bikers on blind spots||Kolkata: Traffic cops sensitized bikers on the danger of blind spots as part of their road safety awareness drive on Friday. Instead of being penalised, the errant bikers were asked to sit on a bus driver’s seat and learn about the blind spots that can result in serious accidents. Cops explained to them the problems faced by the drivers of buses or other large vehicles to spot two-wheelers immediately after they overtake and come in front of them. Though the southwest guard had held earlier such drives in the areas, where the movements of trucks is higher, this was the first time Tiljala traffic guard organised a similar drive to make people aware of abiding by traffic rules. The officers stopped over 50 errant bikers, cyclists and pedestrians on Bypass and showed them how the violation of traffic rules could pave the way for accidents. “If a driver cannot see a vehicle next to him, he is likely to crash into the other vehicle when they are switching lanes. For the drivers of large vehicles like buses and trucks, it gets impossible when a biker tries to overtake from either side of the vehicle, staying very close The same problem is there when a pedestrian tries to cross a road in front of a bus,” said an officer. “I never knew the difficulties that drivers of buses and trucks due to the blind spots. Cops made me sit on the driver’s seat and told me about the precautions a biker needs to take while overtaking large vehicles,” said Anubrata Das, an insurance agent, who was stopped for the training.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-teach-bikers-on-blind-spots/articleshow/88079898.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Mild Covid on the rise, say docs||Kolkata: Even though the number of Covid admissions remain stable and low across hospitals, a spurt in transmission may have been triggered in Kolkata, going by the number of people afflicted with mild Covid-like symptoms who are not always getting tested, say doctors. Many of them could actually be Covid positive, they fear, but point out that surges like these will keep recurring till the pandemic persists and may eventually lead to a herd immunity. It would now be difficult to identify Covid since with temperature fluctuations, multiple viruses have been let loose, according to CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “Cases of mild fever with cough and other Covid-like symptoms have suddenly shot up. Most of these could be other viruses but chances of a rise in Covid transmission can’t be ruled out either. With vaccination, a large section of the population has developed resistance so we can expect most cases to be mild. Going forward, it may not be feasible or necessary to get tested every time we have fever. More mildly-afflicted patients will help to turn Covid into an endemic from a pandemic,” said Dhar. Over the last fortnight, more patients have sought treatment for mild fever and cough and this includes doctors as well, said Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “There has been a sudden proliferation in cases. We are advising most to stay at home for a few days which is proving to be enough. Unless the fever persists for 4-5 days, a Covid test is not essential. Most cases are mild which is a good sign,” said Sarkar. He cited the instance of an SSKM Hospital doctor who had fever for two days and was a Covid-suspect but recovered even before he could get tested. A disabled-rights activist and her family have tested positive but their symptoms are mild. Unless a new strain like the Omicron turns out to be virulent, most cases will continue to be mild, felt Dhar. “We can never be sure about a variant. But so far, reports suggest that Omicron patients have had a very mild disease which is even milder than what had struck patients after the second wave. So, a mere rise in cases needn’t cause panic. Rather, it’s a step towards complete immunity,” added Dhar. Mild Covid cases could indeed be getting lost among multiple viral infections which are now on the prowl, said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. “Covid cases remain mild and sporadic. With season change around the corner, there could be a mild spurt I transmission. While there is yet no reason to panic, it should be kept in mind that a section of patients will continue to get a severe Covid despote double vaccination. So, we need to continue sticking to all the Covid norms,” said Panja.

Police have registered a case of murder and have detained two people for interrogation. According to police, the deceased man, Jodh Raj, went missing on November 29 from his village. "When he left the village he did not tell anyone. Thereafter, the family members lodged a missing complaint followed by a kidnap case," said a senior police official at Ghad police station area of Tonk on Friday. When Tonk police were attempting to find the youth, the Khetri police station in Jhunjhunu district intimated them about a mutilated body of a man, which they believed could have been of the missing man, Jodha Raj. "We found a mutilated body in a well situated near the hills passing through Bilwa village. A team of Tonk police arrived and the deceased was identified as Jodh Raj, a native of Gairoli village in Tonk. After the post- mortem, we handed over the body to them," said Vinod Sankhala, station house officer at Khetri police station told TOI. Meanwhile, Tonk police have registered a case of murder against unknown persons.

---||Goa||Ex-CM and Cong MLA Ravi Naik set to join BJP next wk||Panaji: In a major setback to Congress ahead of the state assembly polls early next year, former chief minister and its Ponda MLA Ravi Naik is likely to join BJP next week. Naik is likely to resign as an MLA and will join BJP at the party headquarters in Panaji in the presence of BJP Goa election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis. With this development, Congress which had won 17 seats in the 2017 state polls will find its numbers reduced to three in the 40-member House. This is the second time Naik is joining BJP. He had joined BJP in October 2000 when Manohar Parrikar cobbled up a government with MLAs from various parties. Naik was the deputy CM in the Parrikar government. He quit BJP on the eve of 2002 assembly election and joined Congress. Following differences with the Congress leadership during the current term, Naik has not been active in the party organisation for nearly two years and a year ago, both his sons joined BJP. After Naik’s sons—Ritesh and Roy—joined BJP, Congress had distanced itself from him and state party president Girish Chodankar had even said they don’t count Naik as a Congress MLA. Recently, Naik didn’t attend the Congress workers meeting presided over by former finance minister P Chidambaram held in his Ponda constituency, giving clear indications that he was on his way out. Naik’s move to join BJP comes after the saffron party refused his demand to give a ticket to elder son Ritesh. Earlier in the 2017 bypolls to Valpoi constituency, Naik’s younger son Roy had contested against health minister Vishwajit Rane on a Congress ticket and lost the seat by over 10,000 votes. Political observers said Naik’s joining will give a leg up to BJP not only in Ponda taluka but also in other constituencies where there is a sizeable Bhandari population. “Naik is considered a Bhandari leader and he still has influence in some of the constituencies which have sizeable number of Bhandari population,” they said. In 2007, Naik as the Congress president helped the party form the government and served as the home minister in the Digambar Kamat-led coalition government for five years. During this period, Naik faced severe charges from BJP with Parrikar raking up his son Roy’s alleged involvement in the drug mafia-politician nexus, after an Israeli drug dealer’s Swedish girlfriend reportedly named Naik’s son having a drug connection. After Parrikar formed the government, he even set up a House committee to go into the drug mafia-politician nexus. Naik was also a bitter critic of Parrikar during the 2012-14 period. Naik started his political career as councillor of Ponda Municipal Council and in 1984, he became an MLA for the first time from Ponda constituency on MGP ticket. He became chief minister in 1991 and held the post for around 28 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ex-cm-and-cong-mla-ravi-naik-set-to-join-bjp-next-wk/articleshow/88080505.cms||Murari Shetye
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: First chargesheet to be filed in case linked to Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The crime branch is likely to submit a chargesheet on Saturday against three persons including dismissed cop Sachin Waze in an extortion case where suspended former police chief Param Bir Singh is a co-accused. The chargesheet to be filed in the 37th metropolitan magistrate’s court is the first in a case linked to Singh. Waze and two others named in the chargesheet, Sumit Singh alias Chintu and Alpesh Patel, are in custody on the basis of a probe into a complaint filed by a hotelier. Another two, Riyaz Bhati and Vinay Singh alias Babloo, are shown as absconders. Police had also obtained an order declaring Param Bir as an absconder in the case, but last week the order was cancelled. In the case of Singh, under section 197 of CrPC, sanction to chargesheet him has to come from the home department. Supreme Court in July had observed that sanction from competent authorities is required under Section 197 of Code of Criminal Procedure to prosecute public servants if the alleged act committed is directly concerned with official duties. Among the five cases where Singh is an accused, this will be the first where a chargesheet is being filed. The filing of the chargesheet assumes significance as interim protection granted to Singh by the Supreme Court ends on Monday. Last week the court had granted him protection until December 6 and he was asked to cooperate in the investigation. On August 21, businessman Bimal Agarwal had lodged an FIR for alleged extortion against Singh and five others--Sumit Singh, Waze, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singhand Riyaz Bhati. Agarwal had alleged that Waze at Singh’s behest extorted Rs 9 lakh from him as a payoff for not conducting raids on two of his bars in Goregaon which he ran in partnership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-first-chargesheet-to-be-filed-in-case-linked-to-param/articleshow/88081163.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolhapur||Every step to control crowd will be adopted, says Kolhapur collector||KOLHAPUR: Kolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar said that they would take every measure needed to avoid crowding at public places, especially in markets and tourist destinations. In the wake of the Omicron cases in neighbouring Karnataka, the Kolhapur administration has stepped up vigil. Thousands of people come to Kolhapur from Karnataka to visit tourist places and the public movement has increased within the district due to marriage functions, fairs and trade. The marriage halls and weekly markets are witnessing huge attendance and the covid appropriate behaviour is not being strictly followed. “The crowd at the public places and events needs to be controlled. The directions have been issued to the local authorities to take necessary steps to control the crowd to avoid the spread of new variant,” said Rekhawar. Earlier, the markets from Kolhapur city were decongested by decentralising. The vendors were allocated space in open areas at sufficient distance from each other. Separate squads were formed to act against the marriage hall operators violating any rules. A major step taken at Mahalakshmi temple was to restrict the number of visit timing and attendance. “Instead of curbing the time, we can extend the time and allow the visitors in batches. I think this solution is more effective than curtailing the time for the visitors of the temple,” said Rekhawar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/every-step-to-control-crowd-will-be-adopted-says-kolhapur-collector/articleshow/88079107.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Don’t procure machines without sanction, says PGI director||CHANDIGARH: PGI director Prof Surjit Singh has asked department heads not to procure machines without recruitment/sanction of manpower first. This is being done in a few departments where new machines have been installed and it is imposing stress on the existing infrastructure. Officials in PGI administration have asked all heads of departments to inform the competent authority and justify creation of posts required for operation and maintenance of the equipment prior to its installation. “It has come to the notice of the authorities that various departments from time and again are requesting for providing technical staff for proper functioning of their department,” mentioned the circular issued by the director’s office. It added, “These requests are generally received for proper operation and maintenance of newly-installed diagnostics and interventional radiological equipments. However, due to no prior information, regarding installation of these instruments and non creation of manpower for handling these equipments, it becomes very difficult to provide technicians to these departments as the existing strength of radiographic technicians is deployed for currently running radiology services.” Sources said that some of the departments which had installed new machines did not recruit manpower, which took time and purchased machines instead. “To operate them, they have requested the director to allocate the staff from the existing areas where the technicians are already working. This will put pressure on the staff as they are already working in the assigned areas,” said a faculty in the department of radiology in the PGI. As per purchase rules of the institute, prior to buying any new machine, manpower sanction and installation must be done simultaneously. The manpower sanction approval has to be taken from the director before machines are purchased. “But some departments have bought costly machines and have started installation later. Also, they have asked us to spare our technicians, which is not possible,” said a faculty. System for detection of gall bladder disease proposed by PGI doctorsA team of researchers from PGI, including faculty from the departments of radiodiagnosis, medical and surgical gastroenterology, general surgery, medical oncology, histopathology and cytology have proposed a novel risk stratification system for gallbladder diseases. They along with the global team of MD Anderson Cancer centre, US, Harvard Medical School, experts from Australia and Netherlands have developed well defined ultrasound criteria for gallbladder cancer. “The present criteria was not clear and we have to rely on Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) which is an interventional procedure. But with time, we hope to do away with FNAC which is painful and just base the detection on the basis of ultrasound,” said Prof M S Sandhu, head of the department of radiodiagnosis, PGI. It is an international consensus on the gallbladder reporting and data system (GB-RADS) for evaluation of gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound. This pioneering work was led by Dr Pankaj Gupta, associate professor in the department of Radiodiagnosis, PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-procure-machines-without-manpower-sanction-pgi-dir-to-dept-heads/articleshow/88080501.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Expressing the Archdiocese's solidarity with those protesting “some obnoxious activities at the heritage site”, Ferrao, in the presence of CM Pramod Sawant and other ministers, said any offensive interventions in and around the monuments of Old Goa “could attract derecognition of their world heritage status”. Citizens of various faiths have been on a hunger strike to protest the construction of a bungalow, allegedly by a BJP functionary, inside a protected area where several centuries-old churches are situated. “We are all gathered not only in a holy precinct, but also in a world-renowned heritage area recognised as such by our central government, by that I mean the Archaeological Survey of India, and also by Unesco,” he said, while speaking at the high Mass at the feast of St Francis Xavier at the Basilica of Bom Jesus. Ferrao warned that undue interventions, “even by legitimate stakeholders” around these monuments can have grave consequences... and de-recognition of their world heritage status “would be a tremendous and severe loss to Goa”. Meanwhile, bishop emeritus of Port Blair, Aleixo Dias, appealed to those in government to serve the people. “God has chosen you to serve the people, not to fill your pockets. Keep your conscience clean and serve the people.” He also chastised the leaders for their lack of concern for the poor. Dias was the main celebrant at the feast Mass, and said that the government and officials are responsible for protecting Goa, but many times, this isn’t happening. “Many evils like robbery, cheating, fighting and lies are also seen in Goa,” he said. Hailing the Constitution as one of the best in the world, he said it “has value only as long as people observe it and follow it”. “So many times we talk about our Constitution, but we don’t honour it and don’t observe what it teaches us. For that reason, there is such a lot of evil in this world,” he said. He also appealed to the people to live together as brothers and sisters. “Why can’t we consider ourselves brothers and sisters and children of one God? In fact that is what we are, created in the image of God regardless of faith,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/refrain-from-illegal-acts-around-old-goa-site-archbishop-warns-state/articleshow/88080512.cms||Lisa Monteiro

No data was available for Panchkula and Chandigarh. While anaemia among children has decreased in the Tricity, the national average has increased. In the NFHS 4 survey in 2015-16, 40.4% pregnant women between 15 and 49 years of age were found to be anaemic. This increased to 56.4% in Mohali in 2020-21. The national average was 50.4% in 2015/16 and 52.25% in the 2020/21 survey. “It is not uncommon to find pregnant women low in iron. This is linked with diet and proper nutrition and care. There are national programmes where pregnant women are given these supplements, but not many are compliant,” said a gynecologist in PGI. She added, “If the data is taken from Panchkula and Chandigarh as well, there is likelihood of almost same results.” The Tricity has also shown a marked improvement in anaemia among children between 6 months and 59 months of age while the national average has shown a rise from 58.6% to 67.15%. Chandigarh has 73.1% children who had anaemia in 2015/ 16, and this time, the survey found 54.6% children to be anaemic. In Mohali, there were 66.7% children with anaemia, which improved to 63.7%. In Panchkula, there were 66.4% children with anaemia, which reduced to 53.1%. The national average has increased from 58.6% to 67.1%. “The decline in anaemia among children indicates good intake of fortified food in the Tricity. Anaemia can affect cognitive skills in children and their overall mental growth,” said a public health expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/56-4-pregnant-women-in-mohali-anaemic-nfhs/articleshow/88080514.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Also, the vaccination certificate has been made mandatory to enter theatres, malls and for travelling. The people are not getting vaccinations, even after booking their slots, as the number of persons arriving directly for the vaccination without an appointment has increased. Many vaccination centres in the city were even out of stock on Friday. Rasika Sawant, a vaccine beneficiary said, "Even after confirming my vaccination slot and taking a token from the Kolhapur municipal corporation's Firangai hospital, I could not get a vaccine on Thursday as there was a huge rush at the hospital. Hence, I had to come again on Friday to get my second dose. The timings for the vaccination should be increased at least till 8pm as people are crowding at the centres and the working professionals can get jabbed only after their work is over." The demand for vaccination has increased ten folds in comparison to the demand during the Diwali period. Dr Umesh Kadam, a dean at Seva hospital in Kasba Bawda, said, “At present, the slot bookings and on the spot appointments have increased tremendously. During the Diwali festivities, there were hardly 30 to 40 beneficiaries daily. The number has now increased to 600-700 per day at our centre itself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/scramble-for-vax-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/88079117.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi municipal corporations deploy mechanised sweepers to deal with dust||NEW DELHI: To prevent road dust adding to the air pollution, all the three municipal corporations have deployed mechanised road sweepers. These machines cover over 2,000 kilometres of road length. The north, south and east civic bodies are not only relying on the road sweepers to pick up the billowing dust along 2,600km of city roads every day, but they also plan to increase the fleet strength from the current 52. At present, the machine-fitted trucks are being used in single shifts by the north and east corporations, while the south civic body is covering areas under its jurisdiction in two shifts. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has 18 mechanical sweepers, which cover 850km of road length in a 12-hour shift every day. They collect 50 metric tonnes of dust daily and get rid of it at dumping sites designated for construction and demolition waste. During the process, the civic body uses 18,000-20,000 litres of recycled water to settle dust, procuring the water from its own treatment plant at Haiderpur. North corporation officials also claimed that road sweeping was occasionally carried out in two shifts during the day to reduce the dust on the roads. According to the Department of Environment Management Services (DEMS), the cash strapped north corporation has requested Delhi government for funds to procure six more mechanised road sweepers. An official of the engineering department said, “It is well known that North Delhi Municipal Corporation is struggling with funds. So, we have asked Delhi government for funding under the National Clean Air Programme to purchase six more mechanised road sweepers that we require.” SDMC has deployed 24 mechanical sweepers in two eight hour shifts per day to sweep 1,455 km of road length daily. The corporation also uses 55,000 litres of recycled water in the mechanised sweeping trucks daily. Every day, the mechanised sweepers collect 80.5 metric tonnes of dust and silt that are taken to construction and demolition waste dumping sites. The south body plans to add eight more mechanised road sweepers to its fleet. “The purchase of eight additional sweepers are in the pipeline,” said a civic official. “They will be added soon to the corporation’s existing fleet. Four of them are going to be e-vehicles.” In the east of the capital, EDMC uses 10 machines to sweep approximately 330km of roads, every day collecting 20 metric tonnes of dust and silt in eight-hour shifts. The civic body disposes of the dust at the Shastri Park construction and demolition waste dump. All the road sweepers are fitted with water tankers that spray water on the roads as it moves along. This involves the use of 16,000 to 20,000 litres of recycled water that the corporation sources from the Delhi Jal Board. “Currently, we have deployed an adequate number of mechanised road sweepers to sufficiently cover the roads under our jurisdiction,” said an official in the engineering department of the east corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-deploy-mechanised-sweepers-to-deal-with-dust/articleshow/88080522.cms||---

Samit Dhar, a resident of Ballygunge who had applied for the birth certificate of his son, was delighted to receive it by Friday afternoon. “The service appears to be running well and response on part of the civic body has been prompt. I was wondering whether I would be able to get it on Friday as I didn’t want to use the drop-box service,” said Dhar. Civic staff also had to deal with a large number of people who had gathered to get their certificates manually. Sanchita Mondal, a resident of Beliaghata had come to receive death certificate of her father. However, she was turned away and asked to apply through the Chatbot service.

---||Chandigarh||System for detection of gall bladder disease proposed||Times News Network Chandigarh: A team of researchers from PGI, including faculty from the departments of radiodiagnosis, medical and surgical gastroenterology, general surgery, medical oncology, histopathology and cytology have proposed a novel risk stratification system for gallbladder diseases. They along with the global team of MD Anderson Cancer centre, US, Harvard Medical School, experts from Australia and Netherlands have developed well defined ultrasound criteria for gallbladder cancer. “The present criteria was not clear and we have to rely on Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) which is an interventional procedure. But with time, we hope to do away with FNAC which is painful and just base the detection on the basis of ultrasound,” said Prof M S Sandhu, head of the department of radiodiagnosis, PGI. It is an international consensus on the gallbladder reporting and data system (GB-RADS) for evaluation of gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound. This pioneering work was led by Dr Pankaj Gupta, associate professor in the department of Radiodiagnosis, PGI. GB-RADS is expected to fill an important knowledge gap in the evaluation of gallbladder diseases. It will aid radiologists in objective evaluation of gallbladder wall thickening and assign a probability of gallbladder cancer on ultrasound, based on which further tests including CT scan and MRI can be performed. This will improve ultrasound detection of gallbladder cancers in the setting of gallbladder wall thickening. Pertinent to note that earlier imaging-based risk stratification systems were in place for breast, liver, prostate, thyroid, and gynaecological cancers. “Development of this new model for gallbladder cancer was very much needed as this cancer has a high prevalence in developing countries especially in North India, said Prof Sandhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/system-for-detection-of-gall-bladder-disease-proposed/articleshow/88080527.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wazirabad barrage to be upgraded to be flood-ready||NEW DELHI: Delhi government announced that it would upgrade the Wazirabad barrage on the Yamuna river for better alertness in flood-like situations. Water minister Satyendar Jain held a meeting with the government’s irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board officials over the issue. The new gates at the barrage will also help wash away excess ammonia and other contaminants when required. “Upgrading these barrages is the need of the hour. Every year, lakhs of cusecs of water flows in the river. It is important to have the latest technology to regulate the barrage system,” said Jain. The Wazirabad barrage was built in 1959 across the Yamuna in north Delhi, one among six across the river. According to the government, new barrage gates will be built using the latest technology with a flood alarm system for quick response during the rainy season when the flow of water in the river is high. “During monsoon, up to 4 to 5 lakh million gallons of water flows all at once through these barrages. The reconstruction of these new barrage gates will increase its strength so that they can withstand the high water pressure,” said a statement from the government. A barrage is a type of diversion dam that consists of many large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing through. This allows the structure to regulate and stabilize river water elevation upstream for irrigation and other systems. This new barrage upgrade will also help to hold more water during the non-rainy season, leading to more water percolation, which will further help increase the city's groundwater levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wazirabad-barrage-to-be-upgraded-to-be-flood-ready/articleshow/88080531.cms||---

The Coast Guard has said one crew member died, and at least four others are missing from the barge. Coast Guard ships and fishing vessels managed to rescue four crew members, who were adrift at sea for close to 24 hours. “Presently, one casualty has been picked up by a Coast Guard ship, while two survivors were traced and rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter. Three other crew members, including one casualty, were found by three different fishing boats, and were transferred to our ship,” Coast Guard deputy inspector general Arunabh Bose said. An alarm was raised on Friday after MV Shri Krishna VIII failed to arrive at MPT, and the Coast Guard immediately scrambled a Chetak helicopter and asked patrolling ships to rush to the site where the barge was last seen. A short-range maritime surveillance Dornier was also part of the search operations, and till late night, search operations were still on, said officials. “There are Coast Guard vessels and one helicopter that are searching for the remaining crew,” said a port official. Coast Guard officials think the ill-fated barge may have capsized due to rough weather conditions, and said efforts are on to trace and rescue the missing crew members. Doctors said the rescued crew were stable when they were brought in, and were sent to Goa Medical College for further treatment. “They said they were in the water for 24 hours. We have sent them to GMC for further management,” said a doctor. Coast Guard assets from its Ratnagiri station are also assisting in search operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ore-laden-barge-vanishes-en-route-to-goa-one-dies/articleshow/88080537.cms||---
---||Goa||ISL: FC Goa lose third game in a row, worst start in five years||FC Goa have hit rock-bottom after being handed their third straight defeat in the Indian Super League (ISL). Just when it looked like they would earn a hard-fought point against NorthEast United FC, Khassa Camara fired in a spectacular winner in added time to give Khalid Jamil’s side a 2-1 win at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Saturday. Rochharzela gave NorthEast the lead in the 10th minute but Alexander Romario equalised three minutes later. Mathias Coureur was denied by the post twice in the second half, but there was no denying NorthEast their first win of the season, thanks to Camara. They now have four points in as many games. Goa, one of the most consistent sides in the league, find themselves languishing at the bottom of the table with no points after three games. This is their worst start to a league campaign since 2016 when they lost three games in a row and finished at the bottom. Goa had already conceded six goals and head coach Juan Ferrando opted to field foreign centre-back pairing of Ivan Gonzalez and Dylan Fox for the first time this season. But the most notable absentee was captain Edu Bedia as Alberto Noguera and Jorge Ortiz were the other two foreigners in the starting line-up. Goa were desperate to strike first and set things rolling. Ortiz’s quick movements upfront gave them options to send short as well as long balls. The Spaniard did have the first sight of goal, but aimed straight at rival goalkeeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury. At the other end, NorthEast pressed hard and found the Goa defence wanting in the 10th minute with their first attacking move. Coureur sliced the ball towards strike partner Rochharzela. The 23-year-old Mizoram forward was in a perfect spot with Gonzalez and Fox out of their positions. All that Rochharzela had to do was keep his cool and slot past goalkeeper Dheeraj Singh, which he did with a right footed grounder. Goa were not expecting to concede in such a manner, but they responded within three minutes through Romario. The winger was guilty of not doing justice to a cross from Ortiz. But the ball remained in play and when Noguera took a shot, he made amends and guided it home. Thereafter, Goa had the upper hand where Glan Martins attempted powerful shots which either sailed over or were blocked by the defence. Chowdhury also did well to block Gonzalez’s effort from close. After the change of ends, NorthEast were unlucky not once but on two occasions. Coureur’s volley first hit the upright and then the Martinique forward attempted a sublime chip from the center, which hit the horizontal, hit Singh and to Goa’s luck, fell back into play. Goa made several changes in the final quarter which included bringing on Bedia but nothing changed for them. It only turned worse in added time when substitute Deshorn Brown laid the ball for Camara, whose strike was simply too powerful and precise for the Goa goalkeeper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/isl-fc-goa-lose-third-game-in-a-row-worst-start-in-five-years/articleshow/88097464.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

In his letter, the minister, who is also deputy CM, told the panchayat that the technical clearance granted for the re-construction of a residential house has been revoked. “I have asked the panchayat to immediately take legal action (and) demolish the illegal structure that has been built,” said Kavlekar. In the note, the TCP department said that since the technical clearance was revoked on November 30, the panchayat can initiate action against the construction as per the provisions of the Panchayat Raj Act. “I studied the issue and even sought legal opinion, and based on this, the technical clearance has been revoked,” said Kavlekar. In October 2016, the TCP department granted technical clearance to Jose Maria de Gouveia Pinto and Maria Lizette de Abreu e Gouveia Pinto for repairs of an old structure that is within the heritage area at Old Goa. However, the Gouveia Pinto family sold the plot to Suvarna Suraj Lotlikar and Manish Munot, who used the technical clearance to build a massive bungalow on the site, said the TCP department while revoking all permissions. Kavlekar has alleged that the owners of the bungalow had indulged in fraud, which is why the technical clearance has been revoked. A group of citizens under the banner of Save Old Goa Action Committee have been on a hunger strike since November 24 near the Basilica of Bom Jesus, demanding the demolition of the illegal structure. Functionaries from various political organisations have now joined in. “We know that many people have incurred trouble because of the construction of the structure near the heritage site. The Old Goa heritage activists had to go to court because of the wrong steps taken by people before me,” said Kavlekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/demolish-structure-in-heritage-limits-kavlekar-tells-old-goa-panchayat/articleshow/88080562.cms||---

An official press note stated that the ex-gratia sanction will be subject to the ‘cause of death’ being certified as Covid-19, through collector (North)/chairman of DDMA, North Goa District, collectorate building, Panaji. (Phone 0832-2223612, 2225383) and Collector (South)/chairman of DDMA, Matanhy Saldanha Administrative Complex, Margao. (Phone 0832-2794414, 2794324). The application for the ex-gratia has to be applied to the respective district administration along with proof of death of the deceased due to Covid–19. Congress had demanded for Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia to the next of kin of the Covid victims. Several people died because of Covid mismanagement, including oxygen-related issues, the party had stated. As part of the national campaign of All India Congress Committee, opposition leader Digambar Kamat wrote a letter to chief minister Pramod Sawant urging him to commit upholding the state government’s share of the Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia payment so that it pushes the Central government to fulfill its commitment to the affected citizens. Kamat said in these difficult times, the meagre amount of Rs 50,000 as compensation is insufficient. “The central government has argued that giving Rs 4 lakh as compensation would leave the government with insufficient capital to deal with Covid-19 itself. We cannot understand how the Central government continues to collect taxes through rising petrol prices and provide tax relaxation to corporates, but can deny any such relief to the citizens,” said Kamat. Kamat said that the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) norms require 75% of the Rs 4 lakh, which is Rs 3 lakh, to be paid by the Central government and remaining 25%, which is Rs 1 lakh, to be the share of the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-to-disburse-covid-ex-gratia-relief/articleshow/88080558.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Ensure no more harm to trees: HC to Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: Tell your officers to start making amends right away, Delhi High Court said on Friday, asking Delhi government to ensure no further harm comes to trees from construction work. Justice Najmi Waziri also sought a report from the environment department of the city on the “ground reality” with respect to safety of trees in areas where construction activities are going on. The bench pointed out that at several key roads such as the one leading to the airport, trees are covered in dust due to widespread pollution and said these should be regularly watered. The court also made the deputy conservator of forests a party to the proceedings and sought a report of inspection to be conducted in east Delhi. It further directed Public Works Department (PWD) to file an affidavit stating the remedial steps taken and the permission sought for the construction work on Vikas Marg. The court’s directions came while hearing a plea by Neeraj Sharma seeking contempt action against various departments. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Aditya N Prasad informed the court that a tree was first damaged on Vikas Marg due to construction work by PWD and it was later chopped, even though it was in a deemed forest area. The department, however, maintained that the tree was cut as it had bent due to a storm, but the court directed the agency to show if it informed any other agency or department about the danger posed by the damaged tree before chopping it. Justice Waziri also underlined that there is already a modified circular issued by PWD, which states that protection of trees should be ensured while carrying out civil work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ensure-no-more-harm-to-trees-hc-to-govt/articleshow/88079944.cms||---

Over the past three days, Goa has reported 160 cases that pushed its active caseload over the 300-mark. With 2,646 tests conducted on Friday, the daily case positivity rate was about 1.5%. Of the total tests conducted, 1,914 were RT-PCR and 732 were rapid antigen tests. While South Goa centres conducted 1,500 tests, 1,146 tests were conducted in North Goa. Urban health centres at Margao and Panaji recorded eight and nine cases each. The mortality count rose to 3,386 with the death of a 62-year-old man from Siolim who had several comorbidities. The man died at Goa Medical College (GMC), Bambolim. The second Covid death recorded at GMC on Friday was not counted in the mortality count. The death was that of a 51-year-old man from Maharashtra. Since pandemic, the deaths of Covid patients from other states at medical facilities in Goa, were included in Goa numbers. However, no explanation was offered about the change in the practice. On Friday, as many as 3,583 doses were administered, including 798 people who were vaccinated with the first dose. To date, over 10.3 lakh people have been fully vaccinated in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-reports-42-new-covid-infections-one-death/articleshow/88080567.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Security and convenience on opposite sides of barricades||NEW DELHI: On Kanshi Ram Takkar Marg near Kalkaji in south Delhi, people use the police road barricades to dry their laundry. “These barricades have been here for several years and the locals make good use of them,” smiled a hawker, who had similarly hung several of his packets of potato chips from the barricade. In some places, the empty area on either side of the barricades are used by people to park their cars and motorcycles. That’s the irony of the metal barricades that the cops put up on roads. Most of these are regarded as inconveniences because they are frequently unmanned or set up in a manner that hampers movement of people and vehicles. On Bipin Chandra Pal Marg, there are barricades near the Rajesh Pilot Park. Two of these meshed frames were lying on the main road, some others on the other side of the road. Jaihind, a regular commuter, said, “You can see that two vehicles cannot easily pass each other on this road just because of poor barricading.” Not only were cars parked illegally on the stretch, despite the assumption that barricades are manned by police personnel, but cheekily enough, a mechanic shop runs unhindered behind one of the barricades. Across Chittaranjan Park, Kalkaji, Greater Kailash, Pamposh Enclave and South Extension, one runs into these police barricades. The placement of these yellow roadblocks reduces the width of the roads and commuters face a lot of trouble while travelling. When TOI drove along the roads on Tuesday, it discovered that the right to smooth progress is challenged by these purported security measures. Near the Shivalik complex, just beyond Kalkaji, the road barricades were placed in such a way as to allow only one car to pass at a time. Four of the metallic structures barred the passage leaving only a narrow inlet for commuters. Mahavir, a commuter, said that there are often big traffic snarls on the stretch because of this. A little further away, near a government school in the Kalkaji area, a few barricades were lying on the road and had a long queue of parked vehicles behind them. It was the same at a spot in South Extension Part I. Near the bus stand at Pamposh Enclave, the barriers impeded the traffic with the cops not caring a bit. Residents of Chittaranjan Park said that police closed the roads in the area from 11pm to 5am to deter car thieves. Motorists drive on a longer route to reach their homes. According to police, the barricades are erected at night to curb crime. Esha Pandey, DCP (South-East), said police did not close off the entire area. “We block entries to localities at night to curb crime. We also change the timings of the pickets to catch criminals by surprise,” she said. But asked why in many instances the barricades aren’t removed from the roads in the morning, an officer replied that this was to prevent snatchers from targeting morning walkers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/security-and-convenience-on-opposite-sides-of-barricades/articleshow/88079950.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Nashik||Nashikites shiver as temp dips after record Dec rain||Nashik: Rainfall in the 24 hours since Wednesday morning was the highest-ever recorded in December in Nashik district. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) recorded 68.3 mm rainfall in the 24 hours since Wednesday morning in Nashik district. The previous highest was registered on December 16, 1967, when the district had received 31 mm rainfall. Two senior IMD scientists, Anupam Kashyapi and K S Hosalikar, confirmed that it was the highest single day rainfall for December in Nashik’s history. Although the rainfall stopped after 9am on Thursday, the skies remained overcast. The cold conditions led to a drop in minimum temperature from 19.2 degrees celsius on Wednesday to 13.9 degrees celsius on Thursday. This is normal minimum temperature for December. Nashik along with Santa Cruz (91.2mm), Pune (75.4mm), Pune-Pashan (83.4mm) registered all time highest rainfall in 24 hours in December, the IMD officials said. About the unseasonal rainfall, Kashyapi, who heads the weather and pollution monitoring unit, IMD Shivaji Nagar, Pune, said the low-pressure area in the Arabian Sea had triggered the unseasonal rainfall. The cyclonic circulation that hovered over North Maharashtra and Gujarat region was now moving away and hence the intensity of rainfall is likely to drop. The cold conditions prevailed on Thursday, though the rainfall stopped. On Thursday, maximum temperature was 17.4 degrees C as against 20.5 degrees C on Wednesday. The temperatures are likely to remain the similar way. People took out their woollens and rain coats when moving out. On Wednesday evening, the power supply to parts of the city and the district was disrupted. “Though the wind was not very strong, the grown tree branches swayed and touched power cables, causing sparks and power disruption,” senior officers from the MSEDCL. The supply was restored in couple of hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashikites-shiver-as-temp-dips-after-record-dec-rain/articleshow/88057995.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Omicron ‘suspects’ in Mumbai up to 14, samples sent for tests||MUMBAI: A teenager who returned from Paris and a 41-year-old man who travelled to Barcelona, Spain, were on Friday found positive for Covid-19, taking the count of people who would be checked for the Omicron variant in the city to 14. The number also includes four contacts of the positive cases. One more traveller tested positive in Mumbai, but the BMC hasn’t included him in the tally of 14 as he lives outside the city limits. Civic officials said the 16-year-old had returned from Paris on November 25 while the man had returned on November 28. They were identified as part of the civic body’s surveillance program to trace and test passengers who have returned to the city from November 1 to November 30. At the state level, the number of suspects has gone up to 30, according to the state government’s update based on figures available at 7 am on Friday. The daily Omicron update said that so far, only three people had tested positive at the airport, while the remaining 27 had been picked up as part of the surveillance (among travellers who returned between November 1 and 30). “Of the 30 positive samples, 16 will undergo whole genome sequencing in BMC’s Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli and 14 at National Institute of Virology in Pune,” said state surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate. In Mumbai, the 14 Omicron suspects have been shifted to hospitals and their samples have been sent for whole genome sequencing. “Contact tracing of these travellers is still going on,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. As per the Union government’s directive, almost 200 contacts – primary, secondary and tertiary – of each of these suspects will be tested.  A total of 3,136 passengers have come to the city from high-risk countries as of Friday. Dr Gomare said the BMC has tested 2,149 of these people and results of around 150 are available so far. Results of another 810 will be available soon. The samples of each of these suspects are also being subjected to an RT-PCR screening test for the S gene, in BMC’s KEM Hospital, Parel. MUMBAI BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said that of the 11 international travellers (including one from outside the city) who have tested positive for Covid-19, eight have the S gene.  “We have detected the S gene in eight of them. It’s an indirect marker that they may not be infected with the Omicron variant (which doesn’t have the S gene). However, we will not rely on these completely and will wait for the genome sequencing report,” he said. The BMC’s fifth genomic surveillance, which includes samples of some Omicron suspects, will be available on Sunday or Monday. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state government’s task force, said while samples of all positive patients with a travel history to the high-risk countries are being sent for WGS (whole genome sequencing) at present, the test is too expensive to test all those who test positive. “At present, WGS results will establish if Omicron is present in Maharashtra. It will in the course of time also tell us if the Delta variant, the dominant Covid variant in circulation, is replaced by the Omicron variant,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-omicron-suspects-in-city-up-to-14-samples-sent-for-tests/articleshow/88080581.cms||Sumitra Debroy

This year, around mid-November, a team from the Goa Diving Centre, led by divemaster Lavito Rodrigues and comprising Gary Lamare, Jonathan Fernandes, Arun Seelan and Joaquim Fernandes, pulled up nearly 200kg of abandoned fishing nets entangled in the sunken ship, S S Mary, at Vasco’s Grand Island. In 2020, Rodrigues and his team had pulled up 100kg of ghost nets from the same area. While plastic waste discarded along the roadside and in water bodies is common sight, tonnes of ghost nets and fishing gear abandoned in the oceans every year remain hidden from human sight. These cause extensive damage, killing marine life such as turtles, dolphins, whales and even diving shore birds. “Ghost nets are mainly fishing nets discarded or lost at sea and on beaches. They are responsible for killing a large number of marine animals due to trapping. They also disturb and destroy fragile ecosystems such coral reefs, seagrass beds and have the ability to cause damage to boats as result of getting entangled in the rudder or propeller,” marine biologist and principal scientist at CSIR-NIO, Dattesh Dessai said. Stating that the issue of ghost nets in shallow and deeper waters has become a global issue, he said that when these nets sink to the sea bed, they can damage native habitats, mainly coral reefs. “Coral reefs are highly fragile ecosystems and these nets can harm reefs by snagging, smothering or even breaking the corals. When the nets sink and settle on the coral beds, they can reduce the penetration of sunlight, which is necessary their survival. Some studies have reported that sites with ghost nets in coral reefs had significantly less live corals and more of the bare substrate,” he said. Rodrigues said the government should discourage fishing near coral sites. “Neither does the government have any mechanism in place to periodically check or pull out ghost nets, nor does it appreciate or compensate diving centres for pulling them out,” he said. Dessai said that continuous removal of ghost nets from coral reef areas or from regions near the coast is the best way to deal with this issue. However, since the retrieval cost is high, alternative methods should be out in place, he said. His suggestions include educating the local fishing community about the negative impact of ghost nets on the marine environment and encouraging them to recover ghost nets and easy access at designated places for disposal or recycling of nets that are old or beyond repair and reuse. “Public awareness through communication and motivation through short films on environmental literacy in local and national languages can also be a powerful tool to tackle this issue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/continuous-removal-of-ghost-nets-best-way-to-save-marine-life/articleshow/88080572.cms||Nisser Dias

---||Pune||Samples with less than 25 CT value under lens for Omicron in Maharashtra||PUNE: Research labs in Maharashtra have started prioritising positive samples of Covid-infected patients without travel history with less than 25 cycle threshold (CT) value for genome sequencing to rule out the presence of Omicron in the community, the latest variant of concern of SARS-CoV-2. For those with travel history to at-risk countries or close contacts of such travellers, positive samples would be sequenced irrespective of the CT value criterion, Rajesh Karyakarte, the state coordinator for genome sequencing, said on Friday. A Bengaluru doctor found infected with Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 despite not having any travel history has raised concerns about the Omicron's presence in the community. The doctor had volunteered for testing after developing symptoms like cold and body ache. On testing positive, the hospital where he worked sent his swab sample for genomic sequencing as his CT value was less than 25. The Omicron variant was detected in his sample on Thursday. Karyakarte said, “We have started prioritising samples with less than 25 CT values for genome sequencing in Maharashtra. For some districts, we have stretched this limit up to 30 CT value because the Covid case count has gone down significantly in some places in Maharashtra. The objective is to ensure that an adequate number of samples from every district is sequenced.” The CT value was a useful screening criterion for sequencing, experts said. “A study from AIIMS in Odisha concluded that the proportion of patients with CT value less than 25 was higher during the second Delta wave in India and hence, it (the CT value) may act as an early indicator of an upcoming surge,” said infectious diseases expert Sanjay Pujari, a member of the National Covid Task Force. Even in vaccinated people, the viral load of Delta variant in the patients’ nose was similar to unvaccinated individuals. “There is no comparative data on the CT value in patients infected with Delta versus Omicron variants. The Omciron variant’s possible increased transmissibility may partly be due to higher viral loads as it is rapidly overtaking Delta in some provinces in South Africa,” Pujari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/samples-with-less-than-25-ct-value-under-lens-for-omicron/articleshow/88080585.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Goa||DHS starts activating ICUs at district hosps||Panaji: The directorate of health services has started the process of activating intensive care units at both the district hospitals, as part of its preparedness in view of the new variant of Covid-19. In the absence of the ICU facility at the North Goa district hospital, Covid patients had to be shifted to the Goa Medical College and Hospital during the second wave, while the South Goa district hospital had an ICU, the staff to manage the facility came from GMC. “As part of the preparedness, we want to ensure that both the district hospitals have some ICU beds,” health services director Dr Ira Almeida said. Meanwhile, DHS has issued fresh directions to health centres to increase testing with focus on RT-PCR tests, as well as to be diligent while conducting contact tracing. Health officials have been asked to be cautious if cases are detected among school or college students, and to take immediate measures since offline classes have started. The worries have become apparent with two clusters emerging this week with one each was identified in North and South Goa during last two days. As many as 25 defence personnel at Navelim camp tested positive and they have been isolated, whereas earlier this week, nine inmates at Apna Ghar, the state-run child care home, were found infected with Covid. The cases of two clusters led to increase in infections, and in the last three days, Goa reported 160 fresh infections coinciding with the warning of the Omicron variant.  “We had a meeting with health officials on Thursday and asked them to increase testing. They have been given targets.” Almeida said. District hospitals will have to conduct minimum 300 tests daily, sub-district hospitals 200 and health centres will need do 50 tests in a day. She said the methodology followed in contact tracing will be not be any different from what was followed during the first phase of the pandemic. Contacts will be placed in home isolation and health staff will call them to see if they develop any symptoms and will be tested on the eighth day. In case found negative, the contact will have to self -monitor. “Even if tests come positive, it is unlikely that the contact will spread the insfection since he/she was in isolation,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dhs-starts-activating-icus-at-district-hosps/articleshow/88080586.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Commodore A Devoji Rao (retd.) (78), only 27 then and a sub-lieutenant, was part of the legendary 'killer squadron' that breached the enemy defences and wreaked havoc on Pakistani forces. Rao, a Maharashtrian born in Tamil Nadu and resident of Kochi for the past 30 years, was missile officer of INS Veer -- part of the three Vidyut-Class missile boats, INS Nirghat and INS Nipat being the other two -- of the Indian Navy that carried out Operation Trident sinking three Pakistani vessels, including their battle-class destroyer PNS Khaibar, and killing hundreds of Pakistani Navy personnel. With zero casualties on the Indian side, the operation was considered one of the most successful in modern naval history and Indian Navy annually celebrates Navy Day on December 4. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the attack and the heroes of the missile squadron, including Rao, have been invited to the awarding of the prestigious President's Standard to the 22nd Missile Vessel Squadron -- the current avatar of the missile boats that caused havoc in Karachi -- on December 8 in Mumbai. “The Operation saw the use for the first time of Indian Navy’s missile boats and anti-ship missiles in combat. I was commissioned into the Navy in 1967 and it seemed like the training and activities in the first four years in service culminated in the operation", recalled Rao, whose INS Veer sank PNS Muhafiz, a Pakistani adjutant-class minesweeper, and inflicted extensive damage to Karachi harbour. Rao remembers that though the commander of Western Fleet deployed them with three missile boats on December 3 night, they had no idea about the operation until they reached Okha port in Gujarat. The plan was to make a quick attack on Karachi port and dart back. "Our commander asked all of us to write letters to our families as the operation was risky and unpredictable. Complete radio silence and no use of radar had to be maintained throughout the operation. The missile boats, which had four Styx missiles each onboard, had an operation radius of maximum 500 kms and Karachi was nearly 900 kms away. The missiles had a range of around 60 kms which means we had to be close enough to Karachi to carry out the mission. So we towed the boats till the surveillance radius range of the Pak Navy and then sailed close to Karachi and made the attack. Within an hour, the Styx missiles, which had high accuracy, did the damage and we sailed back at maximum speed. If the Pak Air Force had spotted us, we would be at the bottom of the ocean”, Rao told TOI. Rao was part of the team sent to the USSR in 1969 for training in using Soviet-made missile boats and Styx surface-to-surface missiles. "In 1970, India purchased eight missile boats for the first time and I was part of the unit that brought the camouflaged boats all the way from Odessa port (presently in Ukraine) to Bombay in merchant ships. I was part of the sea and weapon trials of the boats and later became part of the 25 Missile Boat Squadron,” said Rao. Though Pak Air Force attacked Okha port and destroyed the oil tanks there on Dec 5, the Indian Navy, which anticipated the attack, took the boats to safer places before that. Only after returning to Bombay was Rao and others briefed of the damage they had inflicted on Pakistan. "We became war heroes and 25 Kilo Squadron became ‘Killer Squadron’, a name we sailors wrote in red colour on the side of our boats out of the ‘josh’ we had following the attack. Those are the best memories in my 26-year-old service,” Rao recalled. Rao retired from the Navy in 1992 and later worked for 15 years in the merchant navy. As his wife Rugmini Rao was headmistress of Navy children’s school here, he decided to settle down in Kochi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/under-the-radar-hero-of-71-war-recalls-karachi-surgical-strike/articleshow/88080589.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

The Lokayukta, justice (retd) Ambadas Joshi, is likely to hear the application on December 22. In her affidavit, Kashyap, currently deputy commissioner of police, Delhi, said that since the complainant had approached the Lokayukta, no action could be taken by the ACB as per Section 28 of the Goa Lokayukta Act, 2011. The ACB manual states that when a Lokayukta is seized of a matter, the ACB shall not investigate them. “In view of the above submissions, it is submitted that there was no dereliction of duty on the part of the answering respondent,” it was submitted. Kashyap also said that there never was any intention on her part not to register the FIR on the basis of the complaint received from Aires Rodrigues. R ather, directions were immediately sought from the CVO (chief vigilance officer) through the proper channel to register the FIR/start a preliminary enquiry in the matter. “The ACB was bound to obtain orders from the CVO as per the rules of business laid down as per various precedents, because the complaint was not just against a public servant, but who also happened to be a sitting minister for which the governor is the appointing authority, and is also the competent authority to grant prosecution sanction. It therefore cannot be termed as a lapse on the part of the answering respondent, for the due rules were followed by the ACB,” she said. The complainant had approached the Lokayukta seeking a probe into the disproportionate assets of Madkaikar. He had stated that the Madkaikar-owned firm Nikitasha Realtors Pvt Ltd had, on April 1, 2019, inaugurated a palatial bungalow next to the Bom Jesus Basilica, Old Goa, which was estimated to have cost Rs 200 crore. In her affidavit, Kashyap, currently deputy commissioner of police, Delhi, said that since the complainant had approached the Lokayukta, no action could be taken by the ACB as per Section 28 of the Goa Lokayukta Act, 2011.

Viplav demanded that amendment in the labour codes should be made accordance with the suggestion of the trade unions.

---||Ranchi||Petrol pump dealers warn of strike on Dec 21||Ranchi: The Jharkhand Petroleum Dealers’ Association (JPDA), the umbrella association of the 1,400-odd fuel stations in Jharkhand, on Friday announced to go on a day-long strike on December 21 to demand a reduction of VAT being levied by the state government on each litre of petrol and diesel. A JPDA delegation met state finance minister Rameshwar Oraon at his office in Jharkhand Mantralaya in the evening and handed him over a memorandum addressed to chief minister Hemant Soren, seeking a reduction of VAT to 17% from 22%. However, Oraon turned down the proposal to reduce VAT on petrol, citing huge revenue losses which will be incurred by the state while remained non-committal on reducing VAT on diesel. Since 2016, Jharkhand government is realizing 22% VAT on each litre (or Rs 17.5, whichever higher) and a Re 1 cess on each litre of petrol. Likewise, VAT on each litre of diesel is 22% (or Rs 12.5, whichever higher), along with a Re 1 cess. JPDA sought the reduction of VAT by 5% citing plummeting sales in heavy vehicle industries and industrial supplies. “While the gross sale of petroleum in Jharkhand was 1.28 lakh kilolitre each month when the VAT was revised to 22% from 18% in 2015-16 FY, the sales have plummeted to 1.16 lakh kilolitre now. On the contrary, other states have witnessed a rise in 8% petroleum sales during this period,” the JPDA told the minister. JPDA claimed sales had plummeted as industrial units in the state have been procuring their fuel from neighbouring states such as West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, where diesel and petrol is cheaper and ranges anywhere between Rs 2 and Rs 4.5 per litre. “The high tariff is taking a toll on medium commercial vehicle operators, public transport operators and farmers,” the JPDA said. However, Oraon rejected the proposal of slashing VAT on petrol claiming that for each rupee reduced, the state will incur losses worth Rs 400 crore annually. “About diesel, he remained non-committal and said he will put up the matter before the state cabinet and seek its opinion when it meets next,” a JPDA delegation member said. The BJP has been demanding a reduction in VAT on petrol and diesel since the Union government slashed petroleum prices on Diwali eve. However, the state government has remained silent on the issue and maintained that VAT was increased by the previous BJP government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/petrol-pump-dealers-warn-of-strike-on-dec-21/articleshow/88080225.cms||Dhritiman Ray

A drawing competition was also organised for the children to mark International Day of Disabled Persons. The rally started at 11 in the morning from Koshish housing colony, Argora and ended at Argora Maidan. “Our organisation mostly deals with underdeveloped children. Therefore, to encourage them, we organised a rally and some fun games and competitions to celebrate the day,” said Deepa Choudhary, secretary of Koshish. Rahul Mehta, a rehabilitation professional, who was the chief guest of the event, shed light on the delay in the implementation of the drafted policies for the specially-abled people. “The State Disability Policy drafted in 2012 is still not fully implemented. Furthermore, the basic provisions under Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which envisages formation of district-level committees and lifelong support to specially-abled children by providing them Rs 2,000 per month are pending. The position of disability commissioner is lying vacant since February,” Mehta said. International Day of Disabled Persons is observed annually since its proclamation in 1992 by United Nations General Assembly resolution 47/3.

The deep depression converted into a cyclonic storm on Friday afternoon. The state IMD headquarters in Ranchi said after the landfall, the cyclonic storm is expected to re-curve north-eastwards and move along Odisha coast reaching near Puri on Sunday morning and further likely to continue moving north-eastwards along the coast of West Bengal. Director, state IMD, Abhishek Anand, said the cyclonic storm is expected to reduce in intensity once it starts re-curving. “Though there would be indirect impact over Jharkhand, no warning is being issued for the state as of now,” he said. Under the influence of the cyclonic storm that would likely turn into a low pressure, by the time it approaches southern Jharkhand, several districts in the state are likely to receive light to moderate rainfall with wind speed gusting upto 40kmph. Due to cloud cover, the day temperature during the next 48 hours would fall by around 3-4 degrees Celsius and the in absence of sunshine, cold conditions would prevail. The IMD in its bulletin has also predicted slight increase of around 2-3 degrees Celsius in the night temperature. Anand said that a cyclonic storm activity usually happens in the month of November. “This time there have been a low pressure and deep depression development over the bay of Bengal on several occasions but this is the first time that a cyclonic storm has originated post monsoon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jawad-no-warning-for-jharkhand-light-rain-likely/articleshow/88080253.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||World||US supports WTA for call to suspend tournaments in China over Peng concerns||The United States has said it 'applauds' the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for its decision to suspend tournaments in China over the treatment of former doubles world number one Peng Shuai. The US is monitoring the situation surrounding Peng and it has not seen or heard anything that allays its concerns for her well-being, a US State Department spokesperson said on Friday. Peng was not seen in public for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media in November accusing China's former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her into sex, with her whereabouts becoming a matter of international concern. Neither Zhang, who retired in 2018, nor the government have commented on Peng's accusation and the topic has been blocked on China's heavily censored internet. The WTA's decision, which could cost the women's tennis organisation hundreds of millions of dollars in broadcasting and sponsorship, was applauded by the sport's fraternity. On Thursday, Beijing took umbrage nL1N2SN04V at the suspension of WTA tournaments in China, with its foreign ministry saying China "opposes the politicization of sports". Peng, a three-time Olympian, appeared in mid-November at a dinner with friends and a children's tennis event in Beijing, photographs and videos published by Chinese state media and by the tournament's organisers showed. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had held a second video call with the 35-year-old on Wednesday following one late last month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-supports-wta-for-call-to-suspend-tournaments-in-china-over-peng-concerns/articleshow/88082060.cms||---

As a result, the applicant told NGT, the violator continued to carry out commercial activities from the alleged offending structures on the Calangute-Baga belt and even added extensions to it. The GCZMA minutes of the meeting were also submitted before the Tribunal, which show that the illegalities were found to have been carried out. The Tribunal has now imposed an injunction on any commercial activities being carried out in the illegal structures till the next hearing in January 2022. On March 16, 2020, the GCZMA had issued a showcause notice to the alleged violator for carrying out extensions to the illegal structure. “Though more than one-and-half year had lapsed, and from the date of the showcause, the GCZMA, having found the second respondent is a rank violator of CRZ norms and regulations, still chose not to take any action to demolish the illegal structures. Taking advantage of the same, the second respondent (the alleged violator) is also putting up an additional illegal construction,” the NGT was told. The Tribunal said that prima facie it appears that GCZMA ‘is exhibiting a lackadaisical attitude to demolish the alleged illegal structure’. “Despite one-and-half years having lapsed from the date of the showcause dated March 16, 2020, no much headway appears to have been made,” said the Tribunal. The NGT said that from the minutes of the GCZMA meeting dated February 25, it appears that the violator prima facie is in total abdication of law and is exploiting illegal structures for commercial operations. “The balance of convenience as of today, lies in favour of the applicant. Hence, there shall be order of ad interim injunction restraining the second respondent from exploiting the said alleged unauthorized structures for commercial exploitation, till the next date of hearing,” the NGT said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coastal-body-pulled-up-for-not-acting-on-ngt-demolition-order/articleshow/88080678.cms||---

Citizens have been sitting on hunger strike in protest of the construction of a bungalow at an Old Goa heritage site. The site comes under a protected area under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, where several centuries-old churches are located. The bungalow is reportedly being built by a BJP functionary, and drew widespread opposition from citizens. “We are shell-shocked to know that such instances could happen in a place like Goa. It is high time that things move in the right direction. We cannot let this happen at our heritage sites,” a protester said. With the feast of St Francis Xavier being celebrated at Old Goa on Friday and devotees, including politicians, expected to arrive at the scene, the protestors made a statement by demonstrating educative material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goa-protesters-put-up-signboards-to-educate-politicians-on-heritage-zones/articleshow/88080656.cms||Nida Sayed

Locals warned officials to turn back as they could not produce any warranted documents as to why they were inspecting the premises. “It appears that they believe they are above the law of the land and are attempting to trespass into private property, cut hills, undertake landfilling of low-lying areas without obtaining clearances from necessary authorities. They even feign ignorance to the land acquisition process under the Railway Act,” said Max De Souza, a resident of Velsao. He added that residents were disturbed by the impunity with which the robust code for the engineering department issued by the Railway Board is being flouted at every stage by RVNL. Velsao has a dense cluster of heritage homes, many of which are near the proposed track extension. Most of these homes are made up of a combination of stone and mud, which puts them at a greater risk. “One of the major problems faced by several people are the cracks that emerge all across the walls of these homes on account of the constant vibrations from passing trains,” said architect Lester Silveira.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/velsao-locals-to-keep-up-fight-against-rail-body/articleshow/88080728.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Former GFP Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar joins BJP, requests karyakartas for ‘one chance’||PANAJI: Former GFP Saligao MLA Jayesh Salgaonkar, along with his supporters, joined BJP on Friday. He is likely to contest the upcoming assembly elections from the constituency on the BJP ticket. Salgaonkar appealed to the Saligao BJP karyakartas and party functionaries to accommodate him in their family and give him an opportunity to work with them. “I don’t want to work like an MLA, but like a colleague. I want to try and make schemes available to the people,” he said. A day earlier, Saligao karyakartas had strongly opposed his entry into the saffron fold and had threatened to revolt saying they would put up an independent candidate against him in the Saligao constituency to defeat him in upcoming assembly polls. Salgaonkar joined BJP along with his supporters in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, among others. However, ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo was not present at the induction ceremony. Addressing his supporters after joining BJP, Salgaonkar thanked them for supporting his decision. Stating that “politics is service” he said that he has tried his best to serve the people of Saligao and that he has joined BJP for the people of Saligao, to solve their water, road and electricity issues. “Saligao constituency is still deprived of basic amenities like electricity and water supply. We have solved 90% of the power issues and the roads are being completed. However, people are still suffering due to water supply issues,” Salgaonkar, who was a minister from March 2017 to July 2019, said. Salgaonkar who held portfolios of ports, housing RDA said that when the high court has said that people should get water supply everyday, in Saligao they have to wait for two to three days for water. Sawant said that BJP is the only party that can turn the state into Golden Goa. Sawant said that any first time MLA gets scared of resigning, but Salgaonkar has done so for the people of Saligao and for the development of the constituency. Hitting out at Goa Forward Party for joining hands with Congress in Delhi, Sawant said that anyone can raise their hands in unity, but finally BJP will form the next government in the state. Tanavade said that BJP means development and that actual development started in the state only after it formed government in the state. Aldona MLA Glen Ticlo said that with Salgoankar joining BJP, once again the Saligao seat would be won by BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jayesh-joins-bjp-requests-karyakartas-for-one-chance/articleshow/88080726.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||2017 to 2021: From panthic political space to Tiranga Yatra, AAP’s come a long way||Jalandhar: From acquiring part of panthic political space by taking in prominent Sikh activists who identified with major Sikh causes but without adapting a clear Sikh agenda and facing accusations of courting Sikh radicals before the 2017 assembly polls, AAP appears to be playing a strong nationalist card in Punjab this time around. The party took out a Tiranga Yatra, generally identified with BJP and Rashtariya Swayamsewak Sangh parivar organisations in India and abroad, in Pathankot on Thursday. During the farm agitation also, similar yatras were taken out by pro-BJP NRIs. However in UP, AAP has already taken out Tiranga Yatras, apparently to play the political game on strong nationalistic credentials. Pathankot, where the took out one such yatra, happens to be a Hindu majority area. In 2014 and 2019 parliamentary polls, BJP had made major gains from the seats in the district. Pathankot region has been switching between BJP and Congress, and SAD and its alliance partner BSP have little presence. When AAP entered Punjab in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it had fielded senior advocate H S Phoolka, who is face of legal battle for justice for the 1984 massacre of Sikhs, and former diplomat Harinder Singh Khalsa, who resigned to protest against Operation Bluestar. Before 2017, it had more and prominent Sikh faces in its fold as anger was brewing against the Akalis due to Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan police firing. AAP caused maximum damage to SAD in 2014 and 2017 as several Sikh voters who neither wanted to vote for Congress, due to the 1984 happenings, nor SAD (Badal) had an option to vote for a third party which also promised clean politics. Congress, BJP and even the Akalis had accused it of flirting with Sikh radicals before the 2017 polls. When Maur blast took place on January 31, 2017, just four days before the elections, then deputy CM and home minister Sukhbir Singh Badal had pinned the blame on AAP and Sikh radicals. Former Punjab DGP K P S Gill had also pointed a finger at AAP and Sikh radicals for the blast. AAP faced a barrage of allegations which later turned out to be completely false as the Maur blast case was traced to Sirsa dera in 2018, after which Congress, BJP and SAD preferred to remain silent on the matter. AAP leaders had pointed out that it was falsely blamed to create fear psychosis about it during the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2017-to-2021-from-panthic-political-space-to-tiranga-yatra-aaps-come-a-long-way/articleshow/88081259.cms||IP Singh
---||Goa||Goa paves way for implementation of tourism masterplan, forms board, dissolves 3 allied panels||PANAJI: With the constitution of the Goa Tourism Board (GTB), three committees that held sway over the ministry — the state-level promotion and marketing committee, the high-powered monitoring committee, and the state-level permission committee — now stand dissolved. All important decisions pertaining to Goa as a tourist destination will henceforth be taken by the 19-member board, paving the way for earnest implementation of the tourism masterplan. Up until the constitution of the tourism board, the state-level promotion and marketing committee decided marketing strategies, including what international trade fairs and road shows Goa should participate in. The high-powered monitoring committee, headed by the chief minister, cleared tourism infrastructure projects, and the state-level permission committee was tasked with advising the government over big-ticket tourism events proposed to be held in Goa. An industry observer said that although the state-level permission committee was formed to facilitate the processing of applications pertaining to big events such as electronic dance music festivals, approvals took months to obtain. The GTB has been vested with powers to facilitate clearances, lay down guidelines, procedures and standards for organising events, and to accord approval for major and minor events. It shall constitute sub-committees to accord permissions for tourism-related events such as music shows, music festivals, concerts, night bazaars, beach weddings, tourism exhibitions, meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), and tourism events across the state. “We want an end to the delays. The ‘yes’ or ‘no’ should be communicated within a few days. Organisers should not be kept waiting for months. We expect the GTB to be prompt,” the industry observer said. Presently, organisers have to approach various authorities to get permissions even after the tourism department gives its approval for a particular event. A member of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa said that although the government has long been talking of a single-window clearance system, stakeholders were yet to see any development on this front. “With the tourism board coming into force, we hope that no more organisers are made to run from pillar to post for permissions,” the member said. The GTB has the chief minister as chairperson and tourism minister as co-chairperson. Besides officials of the tourism ministry and industry representatives, it will also comprise four subject matter experts and an environmental expert having at least 10 years of experience in environmental science and sustainable development. The board will meet every three months and even lay down rules regulating its own procedures. Interestingly, there is also a provision that the board may decide to allot a specific event or activity to the Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) for execution, while the execution of events and activities under the promotion and marketing segment shall be carried out by the tourism department. An industry member told TOI on the condition of anonymity that the clause involving the GTDC in execution of certain events and activities, and the tourism department for promotions and marketing would not only leave scope for duplication of work but would also complicate matters. “Indirectly, it provide a chance for interference, wherein one could push an agenda that may have earlier been vetoed by the tourism board,” the industry member said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-paves-way-for-implementation-of-tourism-masterplan-forms-board-dissolves-3-allied-panels/articleshow/88080749.cms||---

While talking to TOI on Friday, SSCK head Ravinder Pandita said on Thursday they had laid the foundation stone for Sharda Yatra Base Camp Temple and Centre and also installed the Nishan Sahib for the construction of gurdwara which existed before the Partition. He claimed that 10 supporters of Sharda mission from across the LoC also came to greet them. Pandita said they had also demanded similar infrastructure like that of Integrated Check Post at Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district of Punjab on the Indian side of Kartarpur corridor for pilgrimage to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib, in Pakistan . The ancient Sharda Peeth temple was located at Shardi village in Neelam district of PoK and the SSCK wants the Indian government to construct a corridor from Teetwal in India to Shardi in PoK, he said, adding that a 5 marla land had been earmarked for the construction of gurdwara. A resident of Tangdhar village, about 5 kms from Teetwal, Joginder Singh said both the gurdwara and the temple were completely at the time of Partition. The place was just five to seven steps from the Kishanganga river, across which was the PoK, he said. “We have made a beginning and hope gurdwara, temple and the corridor will come up in the near future,” he said. Tangdhar has a population of around 475 persons and around 130 houses of Sikhs, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/build-kartarpur-like-corridor-to-sharda-temple-in-pok-centre-urged/articleshow/88081286.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court allows Navjot Singh Sidhu’s appeal in tax case||CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday quashed an order passed by the principal commissioner, income tax, with regard to PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu. It also sent the matter back to the office of principal commissioner, income tax, directing him to adjudicate the matter afresh. The order was announced in the open court but the detailed copy of the order had not been released till the filing of this order. HC’s division bench comprising Justice Ajay Tewari and Justice Pankaj Jain passed these orders while allowing a plea filed by Sidhu against the dismissal of his revision plea by the income tax department. Sidhu had claimed that the order dated March 27, 2021, passed by the joint commissioner of the income tax department was illegal and in complete disregard of the principles of natural justice. According to Sidhu, he declared a total income of Rs 9,66, 28,470 in his tax return of assessment year 2016-17 on October 19, 2016. The assessment under Section 143(3) of Income Tax Act was completed by the assessment officer on December 21, 2018, at the assessed income of Rs 13,19, 66,530 after making an addition of Rs 3,53,38,067. Aggrieved by the erroneous assessment by the department, he filed a revision petition under Section 264 of the Act after taking various grounds before income tax joint commissioner, Range 1, Amritsar. But, according to Sidhu, instead of going into the merits of the revision, his entire focus was to seek an explanation on the reasons and circumstances behind Sidhu’s preference for revision under Section 264 of the Act instead of appeal before the Commissioner Income Tax (Appeal). Aggrieved from dismissal of his revision, Sidhu had approached the HC contending that the revision petition was an alternative available to him but the joint commissioner had dismissed it in an arbitrary manner in March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-allows-sidhus-plea-in-income-tax-case/articleshow/88081288.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||HC notice to Uppal, SVB officials on Saini’s contempt plea||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday issued notice to B K Uppal, former chief director, vigilance, and two other officials of the Punjab vigilance bureau on a plea filed by former Punjab DGP Sumedh Singh Saini seeking contempt of court proceedings against them for illegally detaining him in contradiction of the orders passed by the high court. Advocate S P S Sidhu, counsel representing Saini, confirmed that the bench of Justice Raj Mohan Singh has issued notice to the officials, seeking their reply by January 17. In his plea, Saini has sought directions for launching civil contempt proceedings against these officers under Section 2 read with Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for circumvention and violation of orders dated October 11, 2018, September 23, 2020, and interim anticipatory bail order dated August 12, 2021, passed by the HC. It has been stated that his detention by the vigilance bureau has already been held illegal by the HC while allowing a habeas corpus petition filed by his wife Shobha Saini through its order dated August 19. In its order dated August 19, the HC had passed directions to release Saini for being in illegal custody of vigilance police in FIR No. 11 registered at vigilance bureau police station Mohali for corruption charges. According to Saini, he retired as the DGP Punjab on June 30, 2018, and has been a target of the state government since then, by implicating him in five different criminal cases registered after retirement. He has also given complete details of five FIRs in which he has been implicated by the state police. “The petitioner remained in illegal custody of Harvinder Pal Singh, investigating officer in two FIRs registered against him, from 8.08 pm on August 18 to 2am on August 20, which took more than 30 hours. He was released on the basis of the order passed by the Punjab and Haryana high court on August 20 at 2 am. It was a political agenda of the state government to arrest and humiliate Sumedh Saini in order to gain political mileage in the forthcoming assembly elections in Punjab,” says the petition filed by Saini.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-uppal-svb-officials-on-sainis-contempt-plea/articleshow/88081292.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||ED court reserves order on Khaira’s bail plea for Dec 7||Mohali: Former AAP MLA and Punjab Congress leader Sukhpal Singh Khaira will have to stay in judicial custody as the local ED court judge reserved the order on his bail application till December 7. The application came up for hearing in the special ED court here on Friday. The judge, after hearing the arguments from the prosecution and defence,said the order had been reserved. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had on November 10 arrested Khaira. He was taken into custody by the central probe agency under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The agency had raided his premises in March this year. The ED has alleged that Khaira is an “associate” of drug case convicts and fake passport racketeers. Coming out of court, Khaira said: “I am innocent and ED’s action is total victimisation.” Khaira’s son Mehtab also called his father’s arrest “unconstitutional and illegal”. Mehtab said in 2017, his father had been framed in an NDPS Act case as one of his supporters was arrested in the case and was later sentenced to 20 years in jail. He said they had exposed one of the ministers of the Akali Dal in the case and the then ruling party had framed his father in the case. He said in the present case Delhi chief minister, in 2016, had asked Khaira to raise funds from NRIs abroad. He said the ED had framed his father for bringing one lakh Canadian dollars and asked how anyone could bring such a huge amount from abroad. He said the ED instead of checking the account of AAP was framing his father. He said they had every account of the funds they possessed. The politician had denied any wrongdoing and had said he was being targeted by central agencies as he had been vocal against the Centre’s three new farm laws. Last month, his resignation as MLA was accepted by the Punjab assembly speaker. Khaira had resigned as an MLA before rejoining the Congress in June and then had returned to the Congress nearly six years after quitting it. Khaira had joined the Aam Aadmi Party in December 2015, after resigning from the Congress and was elected from the Bholath assembly seat in Kapurthala in 2017. After he was unceremoniously removed as the leader of opposition of the Punjab assembly in 2018, he rebelled against AAP and resigned from the primary membership of the party in January 2019. He floated his own outfit, Punjabi Ekta Party, but unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from Bathinda seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ed-court-reserves-order-on-khairas-bail-plea-for-dec-7/articleshow/88081293.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Interestingly, this broke the previous record of highest Rs 51 lakh pay fetched in Covid year 2020 to boost the sudden digital switch. Covid-19 triggered digitalization continued to fuel salaries of computer engineers for the second consecutive year as premier engineering institutes saw companies shelling out nearly 30% higher pay to attract much in demand tech-talent. DAIICT officials said the highest package offered to the students from 2017 to 2020 were Rs 29.3 lakh, Rs 39 lakh, Rs 39 lakh and Rs 51 lakh respectively. "The Rs 52.75 lakh placement offer by Google is one of the all-time high offers," said Soman Nair, executive registrar, DAIICT. "For the first time, big talent companies like Google, Microsoft, Sprinklr and De Shaw participated, making a total of 36 offers to final year students and 62 to pre-final year students." The first batch of MSc (data science) at DAIICT also got Rs 16 lakh average salary, said officials. Year 2020 which witnessed most struggling to secure a job, computer and IT engineers were spoiled for choice as most companies shifted operations online. The trend continues, albeit stronger in 2021, said Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar-based educational institutes. Experts said that an average 25 to 30% rise in maximum salaries is observed at several institutes. Prof Mithun Radhakrishna, head of the career development services at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn), said that the UG batch of computer science saw the highest salary jump of 58% while median salary recorded a 36% jump, he said. "Some of the firms that participated in recruitment include Google India, Oracle, Swiggy, PayTM, Samsung Research and Barclays among others," he said. At Nirma University, computer science engineering has seen an average salary of Rs 8.5 lakh and highest at Rs 46.5 lakh this year. Prof Anup Singh, vice chancellor of the university, said that the discipline has seen 100% placement. "Other disciplines have placement at around 80%. The factor for the rise is surely the post-pandemic requirement for a skilled workforce," he said. The ongoing placements at Gujarat Technological University (GTU) has already seen placement of about 70% students with Rs 4.5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh annual package, said officials. Prof Vinod Patel, placement coordinator at LD Engineering College, said that they have recorded 100% placement in the last cycle with an average package of Rs 7 lakh. "The highest offer so far is Rs 10 lakh, which is likely to go up further," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-injects-30-booster-salary-hike-for-it-computer-engineers/articleshow/88082108.cms||Parth Shastri

Bilaspur chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Pramod Mahajan said the traveller is among two foreign returnees who have tested positive for Covid, the other one being a 49-year-old woman who had visited London. They had tested negative at Delhi airport but were found to be Covid-positive in RT-PCR tests after reaching Bilaspur on Wednesday. “Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing and we will get the reports by next week,” said Bilapsur collector Saransh Mittar. The CMHO said the 31-year-old was found missing from home isolation during an inspection by health officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/chhattisgarh-fir-against-covid-positive-man-who-broke-isolation-and-went-to-mumbai/articleshow/88082151.cms||---

The coastal state has been hit by more than 100 cyclones since 1891, when IMD started compiling cyclone data. “However, none of the cyclones hit the state in December in around 130 years,” said Umashankar Dash, an IMDscientist.  The east coast has witnessed 14 cyclones in December since 1891, hitting other Indian states or Bangladesh. Of them, only five December cyclones had some impact on Odisha, mainly in terms of rainfall. Most recently, Cyclone Phethai had made landfall in East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh on December 17, 2018. It caused some rain in southern Odisha districts. IMD-Bhubaneswar director HR Biswas said Odisha is generally hit by cyclones in May-June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jawad-to-be-first-cyclone-to-hit-odisha-in-december-in-130-years/articleshow/88082157.cms||Ashok Pradhan

CCMB has also assured that genome sequencing of positive samples from the airport would be delivered in 72 hours. "In the RT-PCR test, if there is 'S' gene dropout and only two genes are detected, it is an indication of Omicron variant. The same can be confirmed with genome sequencing. CCMB is currently working on a specific primer to detect the Omicron confirmative in the RT-PCR test. The work is in progress," CCMB director Dr Vinay Nandicoori told TOI on Friday. While cautioning that it was still premature to comment on Omicron immune response and transmissibility, Dr Nandicoori said: "Omicron as a strain has 32 mutations. It has deletions and insertions. Based on the analysis of mutations, there are certain kinds of hypotheses on transmissibility and immune response. 'Wait for more research' Only further scientific evidence will reveal how many previously infected people and vaccinated people are protected from Omicron. We have to wait for more research papers." Pointing out that Delta was still the major variant in India, Dr Nandicoori said there have been two confirmed Omicron cases from Bengaluru. Samples from airport positive cases are sent to Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium, including CCMB. "We get samples from Hyderabad airport. In 72 hours, we can confirm whether the sample is Omicron," he said. Prof Satyajit Mayor from NCBS said that information was being shared with local and national authorities within four days of receiving samples. The virus genomes have also been uploaded to global repository for SARS-CoV-2 sequences, GISAID, to be publicly available to the scientific community. "The consortium is monitoring the situation in all four cities," said Dr Rakesh Mishra of the CCMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-ccmb-working-on-primer-to-catch-omicron-in-rt-pcr-test/articleshow/88082158.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Flying squads to catch Delhi-NCR polluters, SC told||NEW DELHI: Facing the ire of Supreme Court for not being able to control the severe air pollution in Delhi, the Centre on Friday decided to take upon itself the responsibility of ensuring that various measures are complied with in NCR, a task that was earlier done by the pollution boards. It told the SC that an enforcement task force had been set up and 40 flying squads formed to catch hold of non-compliant persons and entities and penalise them. Acting within the stipulated period of 24 hours given by the apex court on Thursday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant that the Centre had taken immediate steps to augment the implementation of the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR after the court pointed out that the panel did not have enforceable powers. 8-hour daily cap for industries not operating on cleaner fuels  An enforcement task force with five members has been constituted by the commission in exercise of its statutory power. Earlier, inspections were carried out by CPCB, respective state governments and their state pollution control boards. It is submitted that now flying squads have been constituted which will directly report to the enforcement task force of the commission which itself will exercise powers of taking punitive and preventive measures against non-compliant/defaulting persons/entities," Mehta told the bench. He said the commission has further directed that industrial operations and processes in NCR shall be allowed only up to eight hours a day during weekdays and shall remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays if the industrial unit is not running on PNG or cleaner fuels. The bench then asked the Centre to file a proposal for all industrial units to switch to PNG or cleaner fuels in a time-bound manner. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, assured the bench that all necessary action would be taken to curb pollution and pleaded that the court allow construction work for seven hospitals which was essential in view of reports of a potential third wave of Covid-19. Allowing the plea, the bench said, "We permit the same, subject to compliance with CAQM directions in this regard." Satisfied with the response of the Centre and the Delhi government, the SC deferred the hearing by a week. Exasperated over air pollution continuing to be at a life-threatening level in Delhi despite the Centre and NCT governments claiming to have taken all possible steps to control it, the court had on Thursday granted 24 hours to them to come out with effective measures to deal with the problem and to implement its directions. In the wake of the air pollution crisis in the region, CAQM has ordered shutting of all the educational institutions in entire NCR and capped the operational time of all the industries not running on gas at eight hours. Delhi's air quality has been oscillating between 'severe' and 'very poor' for the past one month. CAQM has ordered formation of smaller state-specific task forces too with specific jurisdictions in Delhi and NCR states to implement, enforce, monitor and report pollution violations. The task forces for Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan will comprise the environment secretary of the state as chairman, member secretary, a technical or administrative representative of the respective pollution monitoring board as a member and a technical representative from Central Pollution Control Board. The commission has said that several instances of its directions not being complied with have been reported and that there was an urgent need to take further systematic preventive measures as a matter of "extreme emergency" to prevent deterioration in the air quality of Delhi-NCR. Reiterating its previous directions on industries and thermal power plants, stopping construction activities and banning DG sets among others, the commission has directed closure of all schools, colleges and other educational institutions till further orders and allowed only online mode of education, making examinations and practicals in laboratories the only exceptions. The Delhi government had on Thursday closed down educational institutions in the city from Friday till further notice. On Friday, the CAQM also called for stopping entry of trucks into Delhi, except the ones running on electricity and CNG and those carrying essential goods.

---||Gurgaon||Car crashes into pile of bricks in Gurugram, 5 on way back from wedding killed||GURUGRAM: Five employees of a private hospital in Sector 84 died after the car they were travelling in crashed into a pile of bricks along Sardhana road around 1am on Friday. Police said the car — a Swift Dzire — was hurtling down the empty road at 80-90kmph when the driver tried to negotiate a pothole and lost control. There were six men in the car, five of whom had died by the time a police team reached the spot from the Sector 93 outpost. The sixth one, who suffered grievous injuries, is undergoing treatment at a hospital. All six, the police said, worked in Genesis Hospital and were returning from a wedding at Sardhana village in Gurugram. As traffic was thin on the road, the car was speeding. The five who died were identified as Neyaz Khan (45), who was from Ghazipur in UP, Jagdir (38) from Jind in Haryana, Prince (22) from Bihar, Sagar (24) from Gurugram and Jibacss (19) from Nepal. Hardik Tiwari (21), who is from Ayodhya in UP, is undergoing treatment. Police said people living in buildings along the road were jolted out of their sleep when the Dzire crashed into the pile of bricks with a deafening sound. Sagar was behind the wheel. He was an ambulance driver at the hospital for the past 10 years. Neyaz Khan, police said, was in charge of housekeeping at the hospital and stayed in a rented accommodation in Manesar. The eldest of two brothers, Neyaz is survived by his wife and two children — a daughter (16) and a son (8). “His death is a shock to all of us. He had gone home with me to attend the wedding of our cousin in November. His body is on the way. The last rites will be performed in his village at 2pm on Saturday,” said Naseem Khan, his cousin who arrived from Delhi. Sagar’s father Virender, who works in a factory, said his son was a good driver. “I don’t know what happened to him. He had 10 years of driving experience and there was never any complaint against him. Before taking charge of an ambulance, he would drive a cab. We can’t trust this government to make good roads,” Virender said. Jagbir, who worked as an electrician at the hospital, is survived by his wife and daughter (8). “His father passed away last year and he was the sole earning member of his family. We are devastated. We don’t know how to sustain ourselves,” said Ashok, his cousin. Prince, who hailed from Bihar, was in charge of the store at the hospital. The family of Jibacss, who was the youngest of all the passengers in the car, is yet to arrive from their village in Nepal. He was a health worker. “Hardik is being treated at the same hospital where he worked. We will record his statement soon,” said Mandeep Kumar, the investigating officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/car-crashes-into-pile-of-bricks-5-on-way-back-from-wedding-killed/articleshow/88080378.cms||Sagrika Kissu

---||Kolkata||TMC ends dissent in key KMC ward, to hold stock-taking meet today||Kolkata: Trinamool Congress has doused the dissent in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s home ward 73, where the party gave ticket to CM’s sister-in-law Kajari Banerjee, prompting three-time councillor and borough chairperson Ratan Malakar to file nomination as an Independent candidate. Malakar withdrew his nomination on Friday following talks with Trinamool seniors Subrata Bakshi, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Madan Mitra, said sources. “I had become sentimental after my name was dropped from the Trinamool KMC candidate list. I had second thoughts after party seniors urged me to follow the party constitution. I withdrew my nomination,” he said. Two other rebels, Tanima Chatterjee from ward 68 and former KMC chairperson Sachchidananda Banerjee from ward 72, however, are still adamant. Trinamool chief Banerjee and party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee have called a meeting of the party’s KMC candidates at Maharashtra Niwas on Saturday, the last date for withdrawal of nominations. The meeting will take stock of the party organisation ward-wise and gauge the level of dissent in a couple of city wards and prescribe solutions. Banerjee is likely to hold a KMC poll campaign meeting at Baghajatin on December 16, followed by one in Behala. Tanima Chatterjee, who is late Trinamool leader Subrata Mukherjee’s sister, was in no mood to given in until Friday evening. “Dada (Subrata) wanted me to contest KMC polls. I am doing it to fulfil my brother’s wish. I am not under any pressure,” she said, days after she was given the party symbol that was later taken back. Trinamool’s ward 68 candidate is outgoing councillor Sudarshana Mukherjee. Sachchidananda, who too hasn’t pulled out of the fray from ward 72, announced that he was not a Trinamool member since 2016. These, however, are the only instances of dissent that have surfaced. Trinamool leaders, however, are not discounting the discontent brewing in select wards. KMC ward 103 is one instance. A section of Trinamool workers staged a dharna near Santoshpur Lake, heaping allegations of “corruption and domestic violence” on party candidate Sukumar Das. Similarly, wards 16, 28, 36, 52, 96 and 106 too are under the party’s scanner. Outgoing councillor and borough chairperson Sadhan Saha didn’t get the party ticket for civic polls, apparently over his age. Saha told his associates that he was quite active and ready to take up party responsibilities. Trinamool gave the Maniktala ward ticket to Swapan Das. Iqbal Ahmed and Rajesh Khanna were Trinamool councillors from wards 28 and 36. The party has fielded Ayan Chakrabarty from ward 28 and denied a ticket to Khanna. Iqbal has clout among ward 28 residents while Khanna is known for his “bhadralok” image. Trinamool brass are also not losing focus on MLA Swarnakamal Saha’s Janbazar turf, where Saha and his family members had been holding fort till recently when the party gave the ticket to Sohini Mukherjee. The nomination of late Left Front leader Kshiti Goswami’s daughter Basundhara Goswami as Trinamool candidate from ward 96 in Bijoygarh has ruffled feathers among a section loyal to former councillor Ratna De. Rumblings of discontent are also heard in ward 106, where outgoing councillor Madhumita Chakrabarty has been denied a ticket, though her brother Tarakeswar Chakrabarty is Trinamool nominee from ward 104. Followers of Md Yeajujar Rahman are upset over the way the party announced his name from ward 60 and later gave the ticket to Kaiser Jamil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-ends-dissent-in-key-kmc-ward-to-hold-stock-taking-meet-today/articleshow/88080524.cms||Saikat Ray
