Under the action, payments on federal student loans will remain paused through May 1. Interest rates will remain at 0% during that period, and debt collection efforts will be suspended. Those measures have been in place since early in the pandemic, but were set to expire Jan. 31.  President Joe Biden said financial recovery from the pandemic will take longer than job recovery, especially for those with student loans.  "We know that millions of student loan borrowers are still coping with the impacts of the pandemic and need some more time before resuming payments," he said in a statement, adding it was an issue he and the vice president "both care deeply about".  The Omicron variant of Covid-19 that has swept through the US with a fury has lent a new urgency to the question over whether the moratorium would be extended. Administration officials had initially said they expected the January extension to be the last. But even as the economy improves, there are concerns that borrowers are not ready to start payments again. Once the moratorium ends, those who were already behind on payments could have wages and benefits taken away as part of debt collection efforts.  The policy applies to more than 36 million Americans who have student loans that are held by the federal government. Their collective debt totals more than $1.37 trillion, according to the latest Education Department data. About a third of borrowers are in default or delinquency and the average monthly payment is $400 a month. Officials said the pause also helps about 5 million other borrowers currently in school who are not yet paying back loans but are accruing interest. Education secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement that the extension will allow for repayment plans responsive to the financial needs of the students, including an income-driven repayment plan.  The continued pause "will provide critical relief to borrowers who continue to face financial hardships as a result of the pandemic, and will allow our administration to assess the impacts of Omicron on student borrowers," Cardona said.  Erstwhile Trump administration initially suspended federal student loan payments in March 2020 and later extended it through January 2021. Biden has now moved to continue it twice, and the education department raised concerns about the effects of suddenly restarting payments, both for students and administratively within the department.  The extension of the loan moratorium comes as decision whether to erase large swaths of student debt altogether is still on the table.  Some Democrats are pushing for mass forgiveness of debt. But Biden has questioned whether he has the authority for that kind of mass cancellation, and legal scholars differ on that. Earlier this year, Biden asked the Education and Justice departments to study the issue. Officials have said that work is still underway.  Biden has previously said he supports canceling up to $10,000 in student debt, but he has argued it should be done by Congress.  Meanwhile, in October, the administration relaxed the rules for the student loan forgiveness program it has in place already, ditching some of the toughest requirements around the program that was launched in 2007 to steer more college graduates into public service.  Biden said that he was also asking all student loan borrowers to "do their part as well." He said they should take full advantage of Education Department resources as they prepare for payments to resume, look at options to lower payments through income-based repayment plans, explore public service loan forgiveness, and " make sure you are vaccinated and boosted when eligible."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pause-on-student-loan-payments-is-extended-through-may-1/articleshow/88440684.cms||---

A police officer said Rouf Ahmad Khan, 45, was seriously wounded in the shooting at Eidgah. He died in hospital. Minutes after the Srinagar attack, terrorists shot ASI Muhammad Ashraf from Awantipora at Bijbehara. He took four bullets in his neck and chest, and was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. The fatal attacks followed Tuesday evening’s shooting by terrorists from a car, targeting security forces guarding a check-post at Soura, Srinagar. They escaped, but one of them was wounded in counter-fire. Earlier on Sunday, J&K Police killed a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist from Pakistan’s Karachi in a shootout at Harwan on the outskirts of Srinagar. IGP Vijay Kumar had said he was the third Pakistani terrorist to be killed in Srinagar in 33 days. He also tweeted that “it shows Pakistan is hell-bent” on disturbing peace in the Valley, especially Srinagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terrorists-kill-srinagar-man-anantnag-cop/articleshow/88440687.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Addressing a group of supporters at his Gandhi Nagar residence in Jammu, Rana said equal participation, irrespective of regional, religious and ethnic affiliations, in decision-making holds key to transforming the destiny of this part of the great nation. "The much-awaited report has rekindled a ray of hope among all those who have suffered the ignominy of exploitation and discrimination due to unjust political manoeuvring over the decades as governance remained the hegemony of a chosen few,” he said. Rana said the draft report based on the basic tenets of delimitation — population, geography, topography, area, physical features, contiguity, convenience of administrative units, facilities of easy communication and approachability of public convenience — is the way forward for the political empowerment of the people of J&K. He said the draft, to an extent, addresses the genuine grievances of the people of Jammu region, who have a sense of deprivation and discrimination, which was upheld by the Gajendragadkar Commission, Sikri Commission and Wazir Commission, but never corrected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jk-delimitation-draft-defining-moment-for-marginalised-segments-rana/articleshow/88440713.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Over half of Afghan journalists lost jobs with Taliban takeover||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August this year has deprived more than half of Afghan journalists of their jobs as over 40% of media outlets that were functional in the war-ravaged country had stopped operations. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Afghan Independent Journalists Association (AIJA), which conducted a survey on the plight of Afghan journalists, said on Wednesday that since August 84% of women journalists and media workers have become unemployed due to restrictions. "A total of 231 media outlets have been closed and more than 6,400 journalists have lost their jobs since August 15. Women journalists have been hit the hardest, with four out of five no longer working," the survey revealed. Of the 543 media outlets operating at the start of summer 2021, only 312 were still operating at the end of November. "More than four out of every 10 media outlets have disappeared and 60% of journalists and media employees are no longer able to work. Women have suffered much more than men…," the survey report read. Before the fall of the US-backed Afghan government there were at least 10 media outlets operating in most provinces of Afghanistan. "There used to be 10 media outlets in the mountainous northern province of Parwan but now just three are functioning. In the western city of Herat (the country’s third-largest) and the surrounding province, only 18 of the 51 media outlets are still functional — a 65% fall. Central Kabul region, which had more TV and radio channels than anywhere else, has lost more than one of every two media outlets (51%). Of the 148 tallied prior to August 15, only 72 are still operating," the survey results showed. RSF and AIJA have said that the new restrictions imposed on media outlets, especially on female reporters, and economic and financial challenges are the two main reasons behind the closing of media outlets and female reporters becoming unemployed. "The dangerous ‘journalism rules’ open the way to censorship and persecution, and deprive journalists of their independence, forcing them to tell information and culture ministry officials what they would like to cover, get their permission to go ahead and finally inform them about the results of their reporting in order to be able to publish," the report said. "There is an urgent need to rein in the spiral leading inevitably to the disappearance of Afghan media and to ensure that respect for press freedom is a priority," said Reza Moini, the head of RSF’s Iran-Afghanistan desk.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/over-half-of-afghan-journalists-lost-jobs-with-taliban-takeover/articleshow/88440738.cms||Omer Farooq Khan
---||World||Work begins to open 1887 time capsule found under Lee statue||RICHMOND: A state conservator in Virginia began the delicate task Wednesday of trying to open a 134-year-old time capsule that had sat beneath a towering a statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee in Richmond. Chelsea Blake, a conservator with Virginia's Department of Historic Resources, pressed a vibrating tool with a hard metal tip against the rectangular capsule about the size of a large shoe box, covered in various tones of brown and green.  Opening the capsule has so far proven to be a challenging - and time consuming - task. As of early Wednesday afternoon, Blake was still sitting at a table with her gloved hands working various tools along the capsule's edges.  The container was made of lead, which was heavily corroded, not the copper that state officials had expected. The capsule was also partly covered in mortar, which must be gingerly chipped away while trying to preserve as much as they can. Both the box and its contents are considered artifacts.  The time capsule had sat under the massive bronze equestrian statue of Lee, which was erected in 1890, for more than 130 years. Long seen as a symbol of racial injustice in the former capital of the Confederacy, the monument was taken down in September.  The time capsule was found Friday by crews working to remove the pedestal where the Lee statue had stood.  Before the work began to open the capsule Wednesday, Gov. Ralph Northam said that Virginia doesn't need monuments that glorify the Confederacy.  "We are a Commonwealth that embraces diversity," he said. "We are inclusive."  The capsule was embedded in a 1,500-pound (680-kilogram) granite block. A newspaper article from 1887 suggests the capsule contains Civil War memorabilia and a "picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin," although historians believe it's doubtful the picture is an actual photograph, which would be rare and valuable.  Records from the Library of Virginia suggest that 37 Richmond residents, organizations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, many of which are believed to be related to the Confederacy.  It's removal in September came more than a year after Northam ordered that it be taken down following protests that erupted after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The day after the statue was removed, work crews spent more than 12 hours searching for the time capsule in the 40-foot-tall (12-meter-tall) pedestal but were unable to locate it.  The Lee statue was one of five Confederate tributes along Richmond's Monument Avenue and the only one that belonged to the state. The four city-owned statues were taken down in 2020, but the Lee statue removal was blocked by two lawsuits until a ruling from the Supreme Court of Virginia in September cleared the way for it to be taken down.  Northam, a Democrat, announced earlier this month that the enormous pedestal would be removed, a reversal from September, when the governor said the pedestal would stay in place so its future could be determined by a community-driven effort to reimagine Monument Avenue.  After Floyd's killing in 2020, the Lee statue became a focal point of the racial justice movement in Richmond. Since then, the pedestal has been covered in graffiti, some of it profane and much of it denouncing the police. Some activists wanted to see it remain in place as a work of protest art.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/work-begins-to-open-1887-time-capsule-found-under-lee-statue/articleshow/88440918.cms||---
---||World||Ex-Sen Chuck Robb, wife hospitalised after house fire||MCLEAN: Former United States senator Chuck Robb and his wife, Lynda, were hospitalised Wednesday after their northern Virginia home caught fire. Fire officials said the injuries were not life-threatening. Robb's family confirmed in a statement issued through Virginia governor Ralph Northam that their parents were the only two in the home at the time of the fire and that they were taken to a hospital by an ambulance. "Our entire family is deeply grateful to the firefighters for their rapid response and the medical professionals who are taking care of them," the Robbs' three daughters said in a joint statement. "We have what is most important to us: our mom and dad." Fire and rescue officials reported they responded to the home in McLean early Wednesday morning. Crews from neighboring Arlington County and Montgomery County, Maryland, also responded. Photos show flames consuming the home. Robb served as governor in Virginia from 1982 to 1986 and two terms in the US Senate, winning election in 1988 and 1994. Lynda Robb is the daughter of former President Lyndon Johnson. Northam tweeted that he and his wife, Pam, were saddened to hear of the fire at the Robbs' home. "Our thoughts are with Chuck and Lynda as they recover from this tragedy," he said. The stretch of Chain Bridge Road where the Robbs reside is a few miles outside the nation's capital and home to a number of wealthy political figures and diplomats. Tax records show the home has a value of $5.5 million, with an adjacent parcel of land owned by the Robbs valued at $3.4 million.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-sen-chuck-robb-wife-hospitalised-after-house-fire/articleshow/88440923.cms||---

Supporters of Rogel Aguilera-Mederos say the sentence is deeply unjust and truck drivers around the country have taken up his cause, using hashtags like #NoTrucksToColorado and #NoTrucksColorado.  Speaking at the rally at the state Capitol, Leonard Martinez, one of the lawyers representing Aguilera-Mederos, said the injustice of such long sentences needs to be addressed, both by reforming sentencing laws but also looking at the actions of prosecutors and judges.  "This fight is not just for him but for all," he said.  The Colorado judge has said mandatory-minimum sentencing laws forced him to impose the long prison term after Aguilera-Mederos was convicted of vehicular homicide and other charges.  His family said in a statement they do not want to minimise the loss of those killed in the crash, but are calling on Gov. Jared Polis to "take immediate action" to reduce the sentence for the 26-year-old man with no criminal record. He was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol and fully cooperated with investigators, supporters said in a statement. More than 4.5 million people have signed an online petition asking for a commutation.  Polis, a Democrat, said Tuesday he is reviewing a clemency application.  Prosecutors asked for a reconsideration of the sentence after the outcry, but also say the driver declined plea deal negotiations and the convictions recognise harm caused to crash victims. On Tuesday, District Attorney Alexis King filed a motion asking the judge to consider the issue quickly.  Aguilera-Mederos' trial attorney, James Colgan, said Wednesday the district attorney, who inherited the case from her predecessor, could have dropped some of the charges against him if she wanted a different sentence to be reached, given the state's laws. He said prosecutors can file extra charges against a defendant in hopes of convincing them to accept a plea bargain.  Colgan said he is open to having either the governor or the judge decide a new, fair sentence. He declined to say what that might be.  "When there's tragedy on both sides, there's got to be a happy medium, because ruining someone's life isn't going to make life better for the victims," said Colgan.  Aguilera-Mederos testified that he was hauling lumber when the brakes on his semitrailer failed as he was descending a steep grade of Interstate 70 in the Rocky Mountain foothills in spring 2019. His truck plowed into vehicles that had slowed because of another wreck outside Denver, setting off a chain-reaction wreck and a fireball that consumed vehicles and melted parts of the highway.  He wept as he apologised to the victims' families at his December 13 sentencing.  "I am not a murderer. I am not a killer. When I look at my charges, we are talking about a murderer, which is not me," he said. "I have never thought about hurting anybody in my entire life."  Prosecutors argued he should have used a runaway ramp designed for such situations. Aguilera-Mederos, for his part, said he was struggling to avoid traffic and trying to shift to slow down.  District Court Judge Bruce Jones said at sentencing that mandatory minimum sentencing laws required consecutive sentences on 27 counts of vehicular assault, assault, reckless driving and other charges. "I will state that if I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence," the judge said.  The crash killed 24-year-old Miguel Angel Lamas Arellano, 67-year-old William Bailey, 61-year-old Doyle Harrison and 69-year-old Stanley Politano. Relatives of victims supported at least some prison time at his sentencing hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/truckers-110-year-sentence-draws-outcry-clemency-calls/articleshow/88441055.cms||---

Book in advance: NCR’s restaurateurs||Basking under the winter sun with friends and family over mulled wine and rounds of barbequed delicacies and rum cake has been the ideal Christmas celebration for many over the years. The number of such private gatherings and Christmas parties might have gone down during the pandemic, but the demand for Christmas brunches at restaurants is still high. While most eateries offering an elaborate Christmas brunch menu are already reserved to their full capacity (restaurants are operating at 50% of their total seating capacity presently), some have decided to run the brunch offer for more days than usual to cash on the huge demand. “For many people, planning Christmas celebrations at home can be tough, but Christmas brunches offer a complete package with an excellent range of food and wine along with live music. The concept of Christmas brunch has become more popular over the last few years because of expats in the city, corporate crowd, etc. Also, Christmas brunch is a popular social media hashtag now. This year, we already have a high demand for Christmas Eve dinner as well as Christmas brunch,” says Akshay Anand, co-founder, Ophelia. Shubhankar Gupta, operations head, Kakapo, adds, “We will be doing Christmas brunches for three days due to high demand.” As Christmas is on the weekend this year, restaurateurs say that they have seen the number of reservations going up. “We have to plan the celebrations for two extra days following Christmas because of high demand over the weekend,” says Sahil Sambhi, co-founder, Vietnom. “The footfall has been high in the last four-six weeks. I think the ambience, décor, and range of food that one finds at a restaurant on a festival like Christmas has been an attraction for people. Most families have special plans for Christmas, so they prefer to go out for brunch over dinner,” says Vishal Anand, from SAGA and Cafe StayWoke. Keeping the high demand for Christmas brunches in mind, restaurateurs are advising patrons to make prior reservations so that COVID safety protocols can be maintained. Vikrant Batra, founder, Cafe Delhi Heights, says, “We will be taking walk-ins, but we will surely advise prior reservations to avoid waiting time and to make sure customers get private seating. We have spread the menu over 10 days so that more people can enjoy the merry season without any hesitation about stepping out or missing out on celebrations.” Priykant Gautam, founder, The Knot, adds, “We have divided our Christmas menu to be available at outlets over three days for better crowd management and to accommodate more reservations around Christmas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/planning-to-go-out-for-christmas-brunch-this-weekend-book-in-advance-ncrs-restaurateurs/articleshow/88435763.cms||Divya Kaushik

Sources said the operations, which started on Tuesday and were continuing on Wednesday, covered over a dozen locations, including Bengaluru and Gurgaon. The latest action follows a similar operation involving ZTE, the Chinese equipment and handset vendor, which allegedly threw up some incriminating data. Some contract manufacturers and vendors for these Chinese players are also under the scanner While separate investigations have been launched by other economic agencies, income tax sources did not rule out the possibility of a multi-agency probe against some of the companies. Although the tax department usually releases information on searches almost on a daily basis, on Wednesday it chose to remain silent. In an emailed statement, a Xiaomi spokesperson said: "As a responsible company, we give paramount importance to ensuring that we are compliant with all Indian laws. As an invested partner in India, we are fully cooperating with authorities to ensure they have all the required information." A separate statement on behalf of Oppo said: "As an invested partner in India, we highly respect and abide by the law of the land. We will continue to fully cooperate with authorities concerned as per procedure." Chinese telecom companies are facing action across the world, with the government too reworking norms to allow Indian service providers to procure equipment only from "trusted sources", a move that is expected to bar Huawei and ZTE from the Indian market. In recent months, Chinese companies have been under the lens in the country with several apps already banned and a crackdown ordered against e-commerce companies which were surreptitiously selling goods in India. Soon after the Covid-19 outbreak last year, FDI rules were tightened to allow companies from China and other countries sharing a land border with India only through the approval route. Besides, there are curbs on awarding government contracts to Chinese companies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/i-t-searches-at-chinese-telecom-firms/articleshow/88441082.cms||---
---||Delhi||Christmas, New Year public celebrations banned in Delhi amid Covid-19 spike||NEW DELHI: On a day when the Capital reported the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases in six months – 125 – all cultural events and gatherings to celebrate Christmas and the new year were banned by Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA). What is adding to the worry is the increase in the number of cases of the Omicron variant of the virus, which spreads faster, to 57. DDMA issued stern directions to the district magistrates on Wednesday to curb the spread of Covid. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will chair a review meeting on the city’s preparedness and management of the new variant on Thursday morning. Sources said the preparedness for a likely third wave of Covid-19, besides the arrangements for hospital beds, oxygen and medicine, will be reviewed. The CM will also review preparations for augmenting the infrastructure for home isolation management. The order says that there has been a persistent rise in Covid-19 cases in Delhi in the past few days and the presence of the Omicron variant has become quite significant. District magistrates have been asked to conduct an intensive survey of the entire area in their jurisdiction and identify pockets, colonies, markets, slum areas, crowded places etc., which have the potential of becoming a Covid super-spreader or hotspot. The district authorities have been directed to follow the prescribed protocol of test, track and treat in such areas, besides taking effective containment measures and enforcing Covida-appropriate behaviour. DDMA has pointed out that its order of December 15 prohibits all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings and congregations besides capping the capacity of restaurants, auditoriums and marriage-related gatherings. “However, it is observed that prohibitions/restrictions imposed by DDMA are not being strictly complied with,” says the order. The Authority has observed that Covid-appropriate behaviour — wearing of masks, social distancing etc — is being followed at public places. “There may be some laxity and leniency in general on the part of field functionaries/enforcement machinery at the ground level in the enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour,” the order states. Read AlsoNo large gatherings, DJs, Section 144: States impose new curbs amid Omicron threatAs Omicron cases steadily rise across the country, several states have started imposing new restrictions to stop the spread. The Centre on Tuesday asked states to activate war rooms and bring back curbs, including night curfews, strict restrictions on large gatherings, curbing numbers at weddings,While July this year saw 2.1 lakh challans being issued by the district authorities for violating Covid safety norms, the figure dipped to 1.8 lakh in August, 1.7 lakh in September, 1.2 lakh in October and 1.1 lakh in November. This month, a total of 66,850 challans have been issued till December 18. All district deputy commissioners of police have also been asked to tighten their enforcement machinery and deploy sufficient numbers of enforcement teams at public places. The DDMA has said that since “wearing of masks is the most important weapon in the fight against Covid-19,” resident welfare associations and market associations should be advised not to allow residents, shopkeepers and customers without masks in their areas and public places. District authorities have been asked to convene meetings with these associations to inform them about the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases, particularly that of the Omicron variant, so that they can further sensitize other residents, members and shopkeepers. DDMA has directed that market and trader associations should implement “no mask, no entry” at shops and workplaces and they should be made aware that district authorities would be compelled to take stringent action, including closure of the premises, if they fail to comply with Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/christmas-new-year-public-celebrations-banned-in-delhi/articleshow/88441270.cms||Sidharatha Roy

While Lok Sabha lost 18 hours due to disruptions and productivity dipped to 82%, far less than previous sessions, Rajya Sabha, where 12 opposition MPs were suspended, lost nearly 50 hours to disruptions and saw just 48% productivity. The two Houses, however, cleared several bills, including the election laws amendments that allow voluntary linking of Aadhaar with voter IDs, during this session. The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to raise the age of legal marriage for women from 18 to 21, was sent to a parliamentary committee. Rajya Sabha did work in fits and starts, with the opposition participating in some discussions. Speaker Om Birla said disruptions were a cause of concern and all parties should think about the situation and see that the House functions smoothly. PM Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Congress president Sonia Gandhi were present in the House when he read the valedictory speech. Birla said 18 sittings were held and Lok Sabha sat for 83 hours and 20 minutes. The productivity during the first seven sittings was 102%.As many as 12 bills were introduced and nine were passed, including the Agricultural Laws Repeal Bill, 2021; Central Vigilance Commission Bill (Amendment), 2021; Delhi Special Police Establishment Bill (Amendment), 2021; and the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021. The discussion and voting on Supplementary Demands for Grants-Second Batch for 2021-22, passed on December 20, lasted four hours and 49 minutes. The highest productivity was on December 2,at204%, when the Lower House discussed the Covid situation and 96 members spoke. The Speaker also informed that 91 starred questions out of 360 were orally answered and answers to 4,140 unstarred questions given. This LS session was more productive than the preceding monsoon session in August, which had witnessed a logjam over issues like the Pegasus spyware row. That session had functioned only 21 hours and 14 minutes against the stipulated 96 hours. The most productive in the current year was the budget session in Lok Sabha, which recorded 114% productivity. The fifth session witnessed 24 sittings that lasted 132 hours while productivity was 114%. In Rajya Sabha, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said the low productivity of the Upper House meant it had functioned below its potential. “I am not happy to share with you that the House functioned much below its potential. I urged all of you to collectively and individually reflect and introspect if this session could have been different and better. I don’t want to speak elaborately on the course of this session as it would lead me to take a very critical view.” Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge tried to raise the matter relating to a news report claiming that MLAs and officials had bought land in Ayodhya after SC’s Ram Temple verdict, but was not permitted by the Chair. Read AlsoRajya Sabha productivity falls to 47.9%, Venkaiah Naidu calls for introspectionNaidu expressed his concern and unhappiness over the functioning of the House. In his brief valedictory remarks, Naidu urged the MPs to collectively reflect and individually introspect on the way the session has gone by.The winter session’s productivity of 48% during its 18 sittings is the fifth lowest among the 12 sessions presided over by Naidu over the past four years. Out of the total scheduled sitting time of 95 hours and 6 minutes, the House could discharge business only for 45 hours 34 minutes. A total time of 49 hours 32 minutes was lost due to persistent disruptions and forced adjournments. Question Hour was the worst hit, with 60.6% of the available time lost as forfeited on account of disruptions. In seven sittings, it could not be taken up at all. Rajya Sabha passed 10 bills this session while discussion on the Appropriation Bill, scheduled to be concluded on Wednesday, was not taken up. A total time of 21 hours and 7 minutes was spent on discussing government bills, accounting for 46.5% of the functional time. As many as 127 interventions were made by the members in these debates. As far as Zero Hour was concerned, RS members availed only about 30% of the time and only 82 submissions were made. Seven department-related standing committees of Rajya Sabha held 19 meetings over 28 hours and 36 minutes.

The Haryana Excise (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was passed by the assembly with changes in Sections 27, 29, 30 and 62 of the Haryana Excise Act, 1914. With this, Haryana has brought its policy at par with the National Capital Territory of Delhi that earlier this year reduced the age limit to 21 years. “It was discussed that the above age limit may be reduced as many of other states have prescribed lower age limits,” the state government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/haryana-lowers-legal-drinking-age-from-25-to-21/articleshow/88441530.cms||---

The Centre will launch a platform where you would need to login once to avail a range of services from this common platform. The government agencies are also working on the plan to have a provision where the user, once logged in, will get details of the entitlements and services that would guide him/ her to access them. A single sign-on (SSO) service allows users to log in to multiple platforms and websites using a single set of credentials via secure session and user authentication. Sources said the platform offering access to multiple services would be launched by August 2022. To expedite the initiative, the electronics and IT ministry on Wednesday held a long session with a dozen ministries and state government representatives on on-boarding all citizen services offered by central and state governments as part of the ongoing ‘good governance week’. The roll out of national citizen-centric portal and the creation of a “National Digital Profile” for all citizens would be used to pre-fill government forms and will also be a tool for citizens to discover welfare benefits offered by the governments. Currently, to avail government services such as transport, passport, admission, pension and gas connection, people need to have a number of user IDs and passwords. The identification and authentication can be done by using details of Aadhaar number, PAN number, DL, email or mobile phone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soon-use-a-single-sign-in-to-access-plethora-of-government-services-entitlements/articleshow/88441610.cms||Dipak K Dash

Rawat’s comment in the form of tweets triggered unease in the party as its campaign in the hill state has been proceeding smoothly and gaining traction, with Rahul Gandhi holding a massive rally in Dehradun on December 16. Taking all by surprise, Rawat tweeted in Hindi, “The ruling party has left several crocodiles in the sea through which we have to swim across. Those close to the ones ordering me to swim are themselves restricting me in the effort. At times, I think enough is enough, and now I should rest, but a voice within propels me to go further. Hope the New Year shows a new way. I hope that Lord Kedarnath shows me the right direction.” The reference — “those close to the ones ordering me to swim in the crocodile-infested waters” — appeared to allude to the AICC managers. A spokesperson for Rawat, Surendra Kumar, confirmed that all was not well between Rawat and Congress state in-charge Devendra Yadav. “The role of a party in-charge is to guide. Party leaders need to motivate members rather than pulling others down.” An aide said the organisation of Rahul’s rally and some of the actions by the organisers had “disturbed” him. There is also anxiety about the selection of candidates and side-lining of Rawat’s choices at the behest of his rivals within. The Rawat group has also been pushing for him to be declared the CM face ahead of the polls. Asked about the controversy, state Congress president Ganesh Godiyal said, “There is need to rectify some flaws in the organisation, which have been brought to the attention of the high command and the leadership is considering them. Something satisfactory will emerge in near future.” Known for his proximity to the Congress leadership and Rahul Gandhi, Rawat’s actions caught many off-guard and brought in the open the factionalism within.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/trouble-for-congress-in-uttarakhand-as-rawat-attacks-party-managers/articleshow/88441689.cms||---

The subject expert committee (SEC), which advises the drug regulator on vaccines and new drugs, also did not clear Biological E’s other application seeking emergency approval of its Covid vaccine, Corbevax. It has sought more data on safety and other parameters, which could delay the vaccine’s launch. India is yet to take a call on booster shots in the wake of the spread of the Omicron strain. While taking up Biological E’s application on using the indigenously-developed Corbevax for booster shots, the SEC recommended that it submit a revised clinical trial protocol, noting that safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 trials is yet to be evaluated. It asked for complete safety and immunogenicity data of the vaccine, justification for the proposed age group, timing of the booster shot and the sample size. The SEC asked SII to conduct local trials to prove Covishield’s efficacy as a booster dose before its application can be reviewed. As per official sources, the panel said the company had not presented any data from India and that its request for approval of the booster was based on immunogenicity data of only 75 subjects from a UK study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-robust-trial-data-government-rejects-sii-and-bio-es-proposals-on-booster-jabs/articleshow/88441715.cms||Rupali Mukherjee
---||India||Amid Omicron scare, some states curb New Year revelry||Some states have announced restrictions on year-end and New Year celebrations and several more were contemplating amid rising Omicron-driven Covid cases in the country, with governments and health experts watching for signs of how the new variant may play out. On Tuesday, Karnataka banned for the second consecutive year large gatherings for New Year celebrations—December 30 to January 2—across the state that reported the country’s first Omicron case in November. Special New Year events at clubs, pubs and apartments are not allowed. However, there’s no restriction on celebrating Christmas, but gatherings are not allowed outside churches, where maintaining social-distancing norms is mandatory. In Tamil Nadu, Chennai’s beaches are off-limits for New Year revellers. The government has not declared any more restrictions yet, though vaccination and other Covid protocols have been made compulsory for entry into clubs and hotels. Odisha has been the first state to prohibit New Year festivities, parties in hotels, restaurants and public places on December 31 and January 1. District administrators of Nashik in Maharashtra, the state with the highest Omicron caseload, said on Wednesday that unvaccinated people wouldn’t be allowed inside government and commercial establishments such as malls, multiplexes and clubs. Haryana, for its part, will decide whether to ban or not outdoor, public festivities for Christmas and New Year after examining what the Delhi government does. “We will take a call soon,” an official said. As of Wednesday, no curbs were announced by the northeastern states, Goa, Rajasthan, UP, Kerala, Gujarat, Bihar, Andhra, Telangana, MP, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand, but most states are taking stock of the situation. The Centre had asked the states on Tuesday to activate war rooms and bring back curbs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amid-omicron-scare-some-states-curb-new-year-revelry/articleshow/88441788.cms||---
---||India||Advisory group opts for wait-&-watch policy on vaccination of kids||PUNE: The recent rise in coronavirus cases among children in some countries has prompted several experts to pitch for their vaccination, but the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) has decided to adopt a wait and watch policy on the issue. “We do not want to hurry into it as the country has not witnessed a single death among children below 12 years due to the virus. Moreover, lack of access to mRNA vaccines has made us decide to wait,” Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil, one of the members of NTAGI, told TOI on Wednesday. “Children’s vaccination should not be a priority now.” The eminent epidemiologist, who is a professor at CMC Vellore, said they would prefer to adopt a wait and watch policy regarding vaccination for children. He said studies done both within the country and outside have shown that Covid deaths among children were rare. “We have registered deaths among children due to cancer, leukaemia and other diseases, where the minors tested positive. But those deaths cannot be attributed to Covid-19,” he said. “Moreover, the current vaccine approved for children by Zydus Cadila is a DNA vaccine. But it has not been tried on adults yet. We should not be in any hurry and adopt a wait and watch policy till more vaccines come by, and more results of trials among children are clear,” Muliyal said. “As of now, the country should focus on adult vaccination and we as a group will dispassionately observe and then recommend whether vaccination should be allowed for kids, depending on the need.” Virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said until there was high coverage among those in older age groups and those with comorbidities, there was no reason for looking at vaccination of children. “Ultimately, we will vaccinate children though the risk of severe disease in children is low. But we should have access to other vaccine platforms as well, particularly the mRNA vaccines used in other parts of the world. There is also a worry that if we allow vaccination for children, we will lose focus on those who are more vulnerable, the elderly and those with comorbidities,” she said. “Given the low vaccination numbers in India, lack of availability of what might be better platforms, and high seropositivity rates in most places, except Kerala, I think we can afford to wait.” However, state paediatric task force experts and child specialists hope that the decision to vaccinate children would be taken soon. Child specialist and task force member Dr Pramod Jog said that there was a need to start paediatric vaccinations early. “All children (being unvaccinated) are a susceptible cohort for Covid-19 (of whichever variant). While children by and large have only a mild disease, a small number of them can get sick enough to require hospitalisation (as has been seen in South Africa of late),” he said. He said though protection from Covid-19 through vaccination was not foolproof, it could still mitigate severity of disease in children, and thus prevent load on healthcare services. “Though the disease may be mild in children, they can act as a reservoir to infect adults who may have worse consequences and increased morbidity and mortality,” Jog said. Although children have shown a sero-prevalence of antibodies of around 70% even without vaccination, if the new emerging variants have immune escape mechanisms to cause infection in them, it can only be reduced by vaccination, he said. The task force member added that the DNA vaccine ZyCov-D was safe for children in the age group of 12-18, while mRNA vaccines have already been used in children abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/advisory-group-opts-for-wait-watch-policy-on-vaccination-of-kids/articleshow/88441808.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||India||Suspension of MPs govt ploy to gain majority in Rajya Sabha: Cong||NEW DELHI: Accusing the Narendra Modi government of contriving a situation to disturb the proceedings of Parliament, Congress on Wednesday said the winter session started with the undemocratic revocation of controversial farm laws without a discussion and ended with equally undemocratic passage of the electoral law linking Aadhaar and electoral rolls, “which will lead to large-scale disenfranchisement of minorities, Dalits, tribal and poor people”. Addressing a press conference after the Parliament was adjourned sine die, Congress Parliamentary leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Jairam Ramesh said the winter session presented a bizarre situation where the opposition wanted to run the House but the government was looking for ways to create trouble, saying that suspension of 12 MPs from Rajya Sabha was done with that purpose. “The united opposition had 120 MPs in Rajya Sabha while the government side had 118, and the government would have lost in case of division over any bill. So they selectively suspended MPs against all rules, like punishment for one session cannot be handed out in the next session,” alleged Kharge. While Kharge alleged that the RS chairman is working under the government pressure, Ramesh wondered if some opposition MPs would be suspended again in the budget session as punishment for the winter session.  According to Kharge, the RS was adjourned right at the start just when he was about to raise the revelations about irregularities by officials and elected representatives in land purchases in Ayodhya.  Ramesh said the issue of suspension and demand for resignation of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni over Lakhimpur Kheri violence led to opposition protests but the government was not keen to resolve the deadlock. “After the SIT report on Kheri massacre, we had to demand the minister’s resignation. Else, Lok Sabha was running fine,” Chowdhury said. Kharge said the government actions cost the opposition dearly as there was no discussion on important issues like price rise, Chinese aggression, Kheri violence. “The government listed a discussion on price rise in Lok Sabha only after we started protesting, demanding Teni’s resignation. This was a ploy,” Chowdhury said. Raising concerns over the electoral law, Ramesh said it was a very dangerous issue as it will lead to mass disenfranchisement of the underprivileged sections. He said over 55 lakh people were taken off the electoral rolls in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh after a similar action, which was later stayed by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/opposition-wanted-to-run-the-house-but-12-rs-mps-were-suspended-to-create-trouble-cong/articleshow/88441300.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Other states which recorded fresh infections were Telangana (14 cases), Kerala (9), Rajasthan (4), Delhi (3), Bengal (2) and Andhra Pradesh (1). Haryana health and family welfare minister Anil Vij told the state assembly that three residents each from Gurgaon and Faridabad district have tested positive for Omicron. All three Gurgaon residents have a history of travelling to India via Dubai from the UK. Most of the 14 patients who tested positive for Omicron in Telangana are medical tourists. While two of them arrived from the UK, an ‘at risk’ nation, 12 came from Kenya and Somalia, both ‘non-risk’ countries. In Kerala, all nine fresh cases— six in Ernakulam and three in Thiruvananthapuram — had landed from abroad recently. While three of them came from the UK, two each came from Tanzania and Nigeria and one each from Ghana and Ireland. However, three of the four new Omicron cases that were reported from Rajasthan neither had any recent travel history nor did they come in contact with foreign travelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/first-case-in-haryana-omicron-tally-at-257/articleshow/88441875.cms||---

In this context, India has supported the call of the international community that access to humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan should be direct and without any hindrance,” he said. “Assistance should reach the most vulnerable first, including women, children and minorities,” he added. He said there are reports that suggest that over half the population is facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity. “As the largest regional development partner of Afghanistan, India is willing to coordinate with other stakeholders to work towards enabling expeditious provision of much needed assistance to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-votes-for-unsc-resolution-on-easing-curbs-on-aid-to-afghanistan/articleshow/88441900.cms||---

The court said through the crime, the accused had caused devastation in the girl’s life and also dented his life at such an early stage. “The sentence of the accused will send a message to youth of today, who are in the age group of (the) accused, that uncontrollable desire for satisfaction of lust can spoil their future, career and golden period of progress,” special judge Priti Kumar Ghule said. The court said the foundation of future progress lies in early days of youth, irrespective of gender. “In (the) present case, future of the accused as well as the survivor has come in the shadow of darkness due to the offence committed by accused,” the judge said. The court, however, said it was not necessary to give him maximum punishment as the accused will not repeat the offence and has understood the consequences of his act. It also said the girl was entitled for compensation under schemes with District Legal Services Authority. “It is seen that due to this act there is hurdle for marriage of survivor in future.

They included 34 from ‘at-risk countries’. Comparatively, five international passengers had tested positive on arrival in November. In December, 15,385 international flyers, including 12,913 from ‘at-risk countries’, underwent Covid-19 testing on landing at KIA, as per data with the health and family welfare department. However, positivity rate among such passengers from ‘at-risk countries’ has been closer to 0.3 %. Incidentally, all these travellers arrived with Covid-19 negative certificates not more than 72 hours old. On most days, there are two to five passengers from ‘at-risk countries’ turning Covid-positive, when tested on arrival. “On December 17 alone, there were eight such cases and none on December 21. However, the first case of a Covid-positive person from ‘non at-risk countries’ was seen on Tuesday. All the samples are sent for genomic sequencing. Reports of some of the passengers are still awaited,” said officers. On December 17, two UK passengers who tested positive on arrival and were treated at a hospital for 10 days were stopped at the airport when they were trying to take their return flight to the UK.  Though the passengers had tested negative for Covid, their genomic sequencing reports hadn’t arrived. After much confusion, they were allowed to travel only after BBMP officers accessed their reports from a government lab, which said they were infected with Delta variant and not Omicron. So far, Karnataka has seen 19 Omicron cases of which six are international passengers. This includes one person from South Africa, who had travelled to Bengaluru in November. However, the 34 international passengers who tested positive on arrival doesn’t include those who turned positive later during home quarantine. There have been a few cases of international passengers from ‘at-risk countries’ testing positive for the virus during quarantine period, but their exact number couldn’t be ascertained immediately. The government, however, has no plans to hand stamp international passengers arriving in the state. “We plan to start the Quarantine Watch app,” said D Randeep, health commissioner, BBMP. As per protocol, international flyers have to follow mandatory home quarantine for seven days and undergo a retest on day 8. If tested negative, they will have to follow a self-monitoring period for the next seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/34-out-of-12-9k-flyers-who-came-fromat-risk-countries-tested-ve-at-kia/articleshow/88442130.cms||Sunitha Rao R

Of the applicants, 3,060 have already paid an initial deposit of Rs 1 lakh as beneficiary contribution. The scheme seeks to fulfil the dreams of domestic workers, milk delivery persons, newspaper delivery boys, auto drivers, barbers and vegetable vendors to live under a roof of their own but are unable to afford it. According to an official estimate, there are 4.3 lakh migrant families without their own house in Bengaluru city alone, and the scheme envisages building one lakh houses for the poor. Constructed in ground+3 and stilt+14 formats, a 1 BHK house will cost Rs 10.6 lakh and 2 BHK Rs 15.6 lakh. The beneficiaries will have to pay the cost of the house, excluding the subsidy provided by the government, in easy EMIs. In all, 38,403 1 BHK houses and 8,096 2 BHK houses are being built at an estimated cost of Rs 4,476 crore in the first phase. They are being constructed using monolithic shear wall design, a fast- track technology. By 2023-end, the beneficiaries would be able to relocate to their new homes. Though the scheme was floated in 2017, there had been no progress due to unavailability of land. However, in 2019, fresh life was infused into it as the government saw a chance to woo the urban poor with an eye on BBMP elections. Recovery of encroached government land too came in handy for implementing the scheme. With 313 acres of land required at 45 locations for the first phase, the revenue department has granted land in phases. “In nearly four months, 290 acres of encroached land has been reclaimed and we are granting it for development of houses for the poor,” said J Manjunath, Bengaluru Urban deputy commissioner. “As it is a transparent system, people are allowed to check the floor plan online and decide which house they’d like to buy,” said a senior officer from RGHCL. Girijamma Thippeswamy, a vegetable vendor, who has been allotted a 1 BHK house in Nelaguli, said she is more than happy. “We have been living in houses with sheet roofs in shantytown all these days. With this scheme, we can at least lead a respectable life,” she said. Auto driver Manjunath L said the scheme has helped in getting a suitable bride for him. Her family was more than happy with the match when they got to know he will be getting a house under the scheme, he added. “Today, everybody wants a house in Bengaluru. As an auto driver, it is not easy to survive in the city. This scheme gives us hope to live independently. Paying low EMIs will be easy for us,” Manjunath said. “We are hoping to get 80,000 applications by January.

It added that to prevent occurrence of the third wave, it is necessary to trace, track and quarantine the primary and secondary contacts of Covid-positive persons within 24 hours. Primary contacts should be tested on Day 1 and Day 8 and home quarantined during this period. If they test positive, they are to be treated and managed as per the state Covid protocol. “Similarly, international travellers from high-risk countries need to be quarantined for seven days from the date of arrival, until the follow-up and (undergo) repeat RT-PCR test on Day 8,” reads the circular. The circular also said war rooms at the central, district, zonal and assembly constituency levels must be reactivated and made fully functional to closely monitor and supervise the activities. BBMP begins third wave preparation Following the global scenario of spike in Covid cases, BBMP has held meetings with private hospitals, lodges and hotels over the past two days, asking them to be prepared for the third wave. Private hospitals have been asked to renew their MoUs with medical oxygen suppliers and ensure they are ready to share beds with the government if cases surge. In a meeting, BBMP authorities mentioned that step-down ICUs may have to be set up in hotels as done in the peak of the second wave. “The bed occupancy rate in Bengaluru hasn’t changed and we don’t see a sign of a third wave. However, we have held meetings with key stakeholders to reactivate the required facilities, if the need arises,” said Dr AS Balasundar, chief health officer, BBMP. Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospital and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said BBMP has asked PHANA members to provide a consolidated list of paediatric ICU beds among all hospitals. “We will shortly share the list of paediatric ICU beds with private hospitals and also ensure all members renew MoUs with medical oxygen suppliers to avoid the second wave situation,” said Dr Prasanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-to-up-vigil-contacts-to-be-traced-in-24-hrs/articleshow/88442135.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Private vehicles eat into bus lane on Outer Ring Road; activists seek enforcement||BENGALURU: The city’s first bus priority lane between KR Puram and Central Silk Board (CSB) on Outer Ring Road (ORR) is in a shambles, especially after Namma Metro work. BMTC officials said the lane (road’s extreme left is reserved for BMTC buses) is now functional only between Lowry Junction and Iblur, and many private vehicles are illegally entering it. Mixed traffic is being allowed from Iblur to CSB. With the main carriageway on ORR shrinking due to ongoing Metro work, government agencies had allowed all buses and Tempo Travellers, including those belonging to companies and factories, to use the bus priority lane along the entire section between KR Puram and CSB. Earlier, only BMTC and emergency vehicles were allowed to access the lane, which was launched in November 2019. BMTC officials said travel time of buses had reduced and their occupancy rate along ORR had gone up after the lane was put in place. “The journey time of buses had come down by 15 minutes during peak hours,” said an official. However, they said enforcement by traffic police is poor. “We have created awareness among BMTC drivers and almost all are following lane discipline on ORR. But many private vehicles are straying into the bus lane and there has been no enforcement,” rued an official. Violators could be fined Rs 500 for the first offence and Rs 1,000 for subsequent violations. BMRCL requires a 4.5m width on both sides of the median during Metro work (CSB-KR Puram), which is likely to be completed only by 2024-2025. Many IT companies located along ORR are likely to reopen offices in the first week of January BMTC wants facility on two more roadsBMTC officials said they want bus priority lanes on Ballari Road (Hebbal-Kogilu Cross) and Goraguntepalya - Mysuru Road as well. “We are in discussions with DULT to extend such lanes to these two roads,” said an official. Srinivas Alavilli of Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy, an NGO, said: “Bus priority lanes are a low cost high-return investment. Lack of enforcement, Covid and Metro work have affected the ORR lane. The facility should be extended to all roads that have three or more lanes. ORR was designed for a Bus Rapid Transit System. Also, a rail network runs parallel, but now Metro is coming up, which has created a mess. Bus priority lanes will increase the speed of buses, which will encourage more people to use public transport.” Traffic police should intensify enforcement against private vehicles. CMP proposes bus lanes on 11 busy corridors The Comprehensive Mobility Plan for Bengaluru has proposed 202km bus priority lanes on 11 high-density corridors in the city. “To improve the average bus speed from 10-15kmph to 20-25kmph, priority corridors with exclusive lanes for public transport buses are envisaged on 11 corridors with high demand. Exclusive lanes should be earmarked for public transport buses with physical separation at the road with right of way being 24 metre or more on these corridors, while mixed traffic is allowed on the remaining stretches. Camera-based traffic regulation systems should be installed to prevent misuse of the exclusive lanes by personal vehicles,” it said. The 11 roads are: 30km ORR (Silk Board-Hebbal), 11km ORR (Nayandahalli-JD Marra), 19km Sarjapur Road (Iblur junction-Sarjapur), 8km Hennur Road (Cantonment Road-Hennur), 13km Hebbal road (Majestic-Hebbal), 5km Jayamahal Road (Cantonment Junction to Mehkri Circle), 10km Inner Ring Road (Swami Vivekananda Metro Station to CSB), 53km Yeshwantpur-Electronics City via Kengeri (along ORR, 100 Ft Road and NICE road), 12km Hosur Road (Majestic to CSB), 27km Old Airport Road (Majestic to Kadugodi) and 14km Magadi Road (Majestic to Gollarahatti).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pvt-vehicles-eat-into-bus-lane-activists-seek-enforcement/articleshow/88442137.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Fully vaccinated Bengaluru man recovers after 15 days on ECMO||BENGALURU: A 39-year-old techie from Bengaluru, who was fully vaccinated, suffered severe Covid-19 pneumonia and was on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) life support system for 15 days. He has since recovered. The man was admitted to BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital on November 22 with high fever and acute breathing difficulty. He was shifted from the ventilator to the ECMO on November 27 when his condition worsened. After two weeks of treatment on ECMO, he showed signs of recovery and was finally discharged from the hospital on Wednesday. Dr Sandeepa HS, pulmonologist at the hospital, said the patient was admitted with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which delayed his recovery period. His condition became critical because he presented late to the hospital and 90% of his lungs were damaged. Dr Gourishankar Reddy Mane, head of medical ICU and Covid ICU at the hospital, told TOI that the man’s condition had been deteriorating rapidly when he was brought in. “After looking at the test results, we were a bit sceptical, but the patient’s age and the fact that he had no no comorbidities gave us hope that he’d respond to treatment,” Dr Mane said. However, the man’s health continued to deteriorate for the next seven days despite all medical management, the doctor added. He also had gastrointestinal bleeding. The man had taken treatment from a family physician when he developed fever, but no Covid test was done when he showed initial symptoms. When he developed breathing issues on November 22, he went to a hospital where a Covid test was done and he was found positive. He was referred to BGS Gleneagles Global Hospital the same day. ECMO is a machine used for patients who are severely ill, especially when their heart and lungs aren’t functioning appropriately. “For patients suffering from ARDS and Covid pneumonia, ECMO allows the blood to bypass the lungs, allowing them to rest and heal,” said Dr Raghavendrra Chikatoor, senior consultant and head of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery at the hospital. The man, however, requires medical support for three months and physiotherapy to completely recover, the doctors said. “Vaccine doesn’t give 100 % protection, which everyone must keep in mind. Generally, vaccinated individuals have milder infection, but there can be cases that reach ICU...,” said Dr Mane, adding that a sense of complacency is seen among fully vaccinated individuals, who tend to lower their guard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fully-vaxxed-man-recovers-after-15-days-on-ecmo/articleshow/88442138.cms||---

The firm is learnt to be filing its DRHP later this week or early next week.Capillary uses its AI-powered cloud solution to help companies offer curated multi-channel loyalty programmes to cater to the sharp increase in online customers. The company counts Aditya Birla Fashion, Arvind Group, Puma, KFC, Pizza Hut, HP and Landmark Group as customers,Capillary has roped in five new independent directors to its board ahead of the IPO, including Neelam Dhawan, former MD of HP and Microsoft India, who has joined as the chairperson of the board; Farid Kazani, former MD and group CFO of Majesco and group CFO and finance director in Mastek; Sameer Garde, former president at Cisco and Dell; Venkat Tadanki, managing partner at Anvaya Ventures; and Yamini Bhat, co-founder of Vymo. An email asking about these developments to Capillary did not elicit a response till the time of going to press.Founded in 2008 by Aneesh Reddy and Krishna Mehra, Capillary has a reach of over 100 loyalty programmes, 120,000 stores and 500 million consumers. The company is backed by Warburg Pincus, Sequoia Capital, Avataar Capital, and Filter Capital. Sources told TOI that Capillary Technologies broke even last year at an operational level. Over the last 2-3 years, Capillary has morphed from a vertical-focused retail CRM solutions firm to embracing a horizontal loyalty playbook, with customers in oil & gas, travel and hospitality. The strategy pivot was to tap into large enterprises with better margin profiles compared to mid-market or SMBs that follow a different sales motion. Capillary’s large customers contribute between $300,000 to $2 million, and 90% of revenue now comes from customers who spend more than a $100,000 annually.The retail loyalty business in Asia is pegged at a $200-$300 million opportunity and Capillary has a sizable presence in the space. Loyalty programmes have undergone a makeover from a points bank to becoming multi-channel programmes, and at the heart of it is the consumer data platform that captures non-transaction-demographic data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/capillary-tech-to-file-for-1000-crore-ipo/articleshow/88442143.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

The latter runs Cloudtail, the largest seller on the Amazon India marketplace with revenue of over Rs 16,600 crore in fiscal year 2021. It is also Amazon's arm that helps bring in third party sellers onto its platform. Amazon already holds the remaining 24 per cent stake in Prione. So it will now fully own Prione. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal. Indian laws prohibit a marketplace operator to be a seller on the platform. So Amazon cannot run Cloudtail on its own platform. Amazon did not say what its plans are for Cloudtail. Sources in the retail sector said they would try to divide Cloudtail's business among multiple other vendors. It's not clear how much time regulators have granted Amazon to complete this process. On Wednesday, Amazon and Catamaran said in a joint statement that Amazon's acquisition of the latter's stake is subject to regulatory approvals. Amazon is said to have sought the Competition Commission's approval on the same. In August, the two companies had announced their decision to end their 7-year partnership that was coming up for renewal in May, 2022. The latest joint statement said the businesses of the joint venture would continue under the leadership of the current management. Amazon has a million sellers on its platform now, most of them small and medium businesses, and half of those from tier-2 & 3 towns. Prione has played a crucial role in getting these sellers on Amazon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-buys-out-murthy-firms-stake-in-cloudtail/articleshow/88442145.cms||---

Vatal Nagaraj, chairperson of the federation, on Wednesday said the bandh will be effective between 6am and 6pm on December 31. The government, he said, should issue an order banning MES activities in the state by December 29. “MES is harassing Kannadigas for the last 70 years. Recently, their activists burnt the Kannada flag. It is not enough if a sedition case is registered against the miscreants. We want the government to completely ban MES activities in the state,” said Nagaraj. He claimed over 35 organisations will support the bandh. Supply of essentials like milk and medical services won’t be affected. Activists of over 35 organisations met in the city on Wednesday to discuss their plan of action. One organisation suggested changing the bandh date to avoid clashing with New Year Eve celebrations on December 31. But others opposed the request and said if anyone wanted to celebrate New Year Eve, they were free to do so after 6pm. However, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike president TA Narayana Gowda said his organisation will not participate. “We will not support the bandh, but will continue our fight against MES and Shiv Sene in the state.” Karnataka Gadi Horata Samiti president Rao Byndoor too opposed the bandh call. “At a time when people have been hit hard by the pandemic, observing a bandh is not acceptable.” However, he urged the government to initiate legal process to ban MES. Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said necessary arrangements will be made for the bandh, adding, “No one has sought permission from us as yet.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/some-pro-kannada-bodies-call-for-bandh-on-dec-31/articleshow/88442148.cms||---

Citing a September 2020 communique, the inspector general (registration) in a new letter to his subordinates has reminded SROs about the mandate.As per norms, TNRERA issues notices to developers after getting planning permission details from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) or Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) if promoters have not registered projects with the regulator. In case they are not registered, SROs are asked not to register the housing projects. All ongoing housing projects with a minimum of eight units and plots must be registered with the Authority as per the Tamil Nadu Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017. So far, nearly 950 housing projects have been registered this year with the TNRERA. It was 755 last year and 492 in 2019. In a recent communique, the IG (registration) has asked the SROs to comply with the letter sent by the chief secretary last year regarding the issue. The letter had said instructions must be given to SROs to register plots by insisting on the proof of the Tamil Nadu Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules, 2017, wherever registration with the TNRERA was required under the real estate Act.Official sources with the TNRERA said that the real estate legislation, a central act, is binding over registration officials regarding registration of housing projects with a minimum of eight units and plots meant for sale. “In fact, it has helped in compliance as promoters are approaching the real estate Authority to register their projects, after the SROs refuse to facilitate any registration of units in the absence of RERA registration,” a TNRERA official said. The RERA Act came into effect in Tamil Nadu in June 2017.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/no-registration-of-flats-without-tnrera-nod/articleshow/88442150.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||SC rejects Karnataka govt plea to utilise Rs 19,000 crore to revive districts ravaged by mining||BENGALURU: The Supreme Court, even after 30 hearings over the last three years, has once again denied the state government permission to utilise Rs 19,000 crore accumulated with the Karnataka Mining Environment Restoration Company (KMERC), a special purpose vehicle (SPV) created to rejuvenate three districts destroyed by illegal mining — Ballari, Chitradurga and Tumakuru. According to senior government officials, the Supreme Court on December 16 “refused another oral mentioning for pressing the matter”, thereby forcing the government to sit on the accumulated funds with no date in sight to implement the action plan created to develop the districts hurt by illegal mining. This, despite the amicus curiae appointed by the same SC and the solicitor general urging the apex court to take up the case on an immediate basis to clear the decks for using the idle funds. The total accumulated amount of Rs 19,030 crore is inclusive of Rs 7,145 crore only in interest. Without the SC approval, the state government is stuck with the funds in the banks, making the SPV as good as defunct. With the SC refusing to take up its petition, sources in the government said Karnataka has no option now but to wait. “What more can we do? The SC wanted an amicus curiae, it was done. They wanted us to provide a comprehensive plan, we created one and got it cleared with the court-appointed curiae. They asked us to set up an oversight committee, we prepared a draft bill on the same and even filed it as an interlocutory application (IA), but to no avail. We have run out of options,” said a government official. Mines minister Basappa Halappa Achar told TOI the government has been relentlessly trying to get the SC to hear the case and greenlight the action plan. “Unfortunately, due to heavy investments involved in implementing the action plan in these illegal mining-ravaged regions, we are unable to proceed with our own government funds. It is much required for us that the SC clears the action plan and allows us to proceed,” said Achar. The minister said Karnataka government is lobbying and making efforts to convince the apex court to hear the case at the earliest. “While we are already in touch with the solicitor general. I will once again speak about this matter with the chief minister and ask him to have a serious discussion with the Centre,” said Achar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/sc-rejects-state-plea-to-utilise-19k-cr-to-revive-districts-ravaged-by-mining/articleshow/88442151.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

It can boost daily footfalls significantly due to its proximity to a busy market and an ancient temple. Its construction, which passed multiple deadlines due to Covid restrictions, was expected to be over before 2020. Officials now say the station may not be ready even by December-end. It is one of the eight stations on the 9-km Washermenpet-Wimco Nagar stretch. “Work is still going on,” an official said.According to residents and regular metro commuters, Thiruvottiyur Theradi may attract more footfall compared to other stations on the stretch as it is very near to a market. Many temples, including an ancient Pallava-period one, in the vicinity are frequented by devotees from across the city. CMRL officials said by 2026 an estimated 22,000 commuters are expected to use the station daily.At a time when CMRL is struggling to get back its pre-Covid patronage, the delay in getting the station ready may further affect its patronage. As of November, an average 97,000 people used metro services daily against pre-Covid numbers of 1.16 lakh. It was still only a small portion of the 7.76 lakh daily patronage estimated when the project was initiated.Officials said the failure to meet the initial deadline was due to the delay in acquiring land and subsequent changes made to the alignment of the elevated corridor. The elevated viaduct leading to the station is at its highest level — 17m from the road level — along the 9-km line. The elevation was made to allow movement of the temple chariot during the annual festival. At present, metro trains skip past the station which is in between Kaladipet and Thiruvottiyur stations. The station, previously called Gowri Ashram, is in cantilever style with the viaduct sitting on a single column of pillars in the centre of the road with staircase and 24m link bridge on either side of the road. Thiruvottiyur Theradi station will take commuters directly to the platform from the road through a staircase as the station does not have ticketing level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thiruvottiyur-theradi-stn-yet-to-be-completed/articleshow/88442152.cms||---

---||Chennai||GCC to set monthly target for officials to fine those littering||Chennai: In a bid to crack down on littering, the Greater Chennai Corporation is going to set monthly targets for its officials to fine those who leave garbage and construction debris on roadsides and other public places. The civic body will rope in the police to access CCTV camera footage to catch those who dump garbage on the roads. The civic body has been collecting more than 10 lakh a month as fines on an average. However, it hopes target-based collection will push the zone level assistant engineers and sanitary inspectors to rigorously implement the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.  “Not all zones fine people with the same rigor. We found some zones giving us ‘nil’ report on fines collected for dumping of garbage and debris,” said a senior corporation official.  The civic body so far this month has collected 4.29 lakh as fines from those dumping garbage and debris in the open. However, four zones - Manali, Madhavaram, Perungudi and Sholinganallur - have collected nothing. Some zones such as Teynampet have collected up to 35,900. Ambattur, where open dumping of garbage is spotted in various localities such as Maduravoyal, Mogappair East and West, has collected only 15,500. Officials said setting a target will boost the scope of enforcement in all zones and will make the city cleaner overall. “We have not decided on the target. We will calculate the monthly average and come up with an amount,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gcc-to-set-monthly-target-for-officials-to-fine-those-littering/articleshow/88442155.cms||Omjasvin M D

---||Chennai||Chennai-Mysuru high speed rail line on drawing board||CHENNAI: Preparatory work for the 435km Chennai-Bengaluru-Mysuru high speed rail corridor project seems to be moving rapidly as the final contract to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) has been awarded. The firm will prepare drawings of alignment of the line at areas where it crosses rivers, canals, bridges, roads, railway lines, highways and other similar facilities and will also prepare a general drawing of the stations. Work on carrying out a complete mapping of the alignment is already on. The contract is the last of the seven needed to prepare a DPR. If things go according to plan and the route is open, trains will travel at 300kmph-320kmph on standard gauge lines. The travel time between the three cities will be reduced to just one and half hours. Currently, Shatabdi Express covers the distance in seven hours.  Two lines will have to be laid along a fenced corridor that will be 50 metres to 60 metres wide.  Though a final alignment map is being prepared, a separate contract has been awarded to a company to map only the terrain where the line has to cross rivers, smaller water bodies and other obstacles because the rules require that a thorough study be done including, in the case of rivers, up to two km on either side of the line.  As the speed is high, the terrain and its character around the line, stations and depots needs to be studied before the alignment can be fixed and stations can be designed, said a railways official. The National High-Speed Rail Corporation (NHSRC) had already identified nine stations including Chennai, Poonamallee and Arakkonam in the state a year ago and early this year awarded contracts for final alignment design and for environment impact assessment and environment management plan.  The final alignment is being prepared using LiDAR technology which helps in mapping the terrain including rivers and small water bodies in three to four months instead of almost a year because a helicopter fitted with sensors will be used to map the terrain. After the DPR and environment impact study is completed, the NHSRC will float tenders for civil work to start construction, said an official.  The National Ral Plan has fixed an approximate deadline of 2051 for the high speed line. The Chennai-Mysuru line is part of the six corridors including Mumbai-Ahmedabad and Delhi-Varanasi proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-mysuru-high-speed-rail-line-on-drawing-board/articleshow/88442159.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Irular hamlet cut off, kids can’t go to school in Tiruvallur||CHENNAI: Harish B of Class I is upset he has not been able to attend school since the rain stopped. Reason: The road connecting his village Sirunai, 40km from Chennai, in Tiruvallur district to Palavakkam government high school, 5km away, is non-existent. The only route, his mother M Bhavani says, has been blocked by a private landowner. Despite this, six-year-old Lakshmi attends school. “Nothing can stop me. I am ready to speak to any official to ensure I go to school,” says the girl who goes to school on a neighbour’s bike. One of the houses being built under the flagship PMAY schemeThe Irular hamlet of 36 families was allotted land four years ago after their earlier settlement along the Kosasthalaiayar river in Kosavampet fell victim to floods. Construction of their homes has come to a halt due to fund shortage. The 25 primary school children and 10 higher secondary school children in Sirunai along with some from Seeni Kuppam, JJ Nagar and Eri Colony study at the government school. “We expected a better life as we were promised a home and other facilities. During the floods, we were cut off in November and December. Children couldn’t return to school at all due to lack of a road. Some teachers who helped by sending autos for a few days also stopped after a local landowner blocked the only way that could be accessed,” says R Nirmala. Living in the area that is part of a deserted reserve forest has been nothing short of a nightmare for these families. The local panchayat heads and councillors have promised them facilities such as healthcare, a high school, an anganwadi and a road linking the main road. Last month, a one-year-old died after he put his finger in a junction box. He couldn’t be saved as the villagers could not get an ambulance in time due to the lack of road. Many pregnant women in the hamlet have been shifting to other villages for delivery. The assistant director of panchayats, who visited the village after TOI alerted him, said the only route available belongs to the public works department. “There is a PWD canal and if the department strengthens the bund and lays a road to help this village, these people can use it. Else, we need to convert the forest land into revenue land and connect JJ Nagar Road to this village. We will submit these details to the Tiruvallur collector. The government will have to decide on this. Meanwhile, we have ordered the private landowner to allow the locals to use the route,” he said. Collector Alby John told TOI he had sought a report on the issue. “We will do our best to ensure the children go to school. We will also speak to panchayat officials and check why there is a delay in construction of their houses.” The construction of their homes began under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana scheme. However, 2.4 lakh allotted for each house wasn't enough and fund shortage has brought the work to halt. “It has been a year since the construction began. The panchayat hasn’t been able to complete it. We have been promised that we will celebrate Pongal in our new homes and not these thatched roof huts,” said Chandra, another resident. Pughazhvendhan, an RTI activist who visited the village, told TOI most in the community are scared to even seek their rights. “They should be provided with basic care and amenities. An anganwadi, a public health centre and schools within 5 km radius is a must. There is no bus or public transport as well. Imagine their life,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/irular-hamlet-cut-off-kids-cant-go-to-school/articleshow/88442161.cms||Komal Gautham

The new circular issued by the Centre also reduced the lease period to 20 years. The Salt manufacturers and merchants’ association contended that there is discrimination on ground rent charges and assignment fee between the state and the central government. The association argued thata policy decision cannot be taken unilaterally by the government as salt manufacturing involves many stakeholders and other mitigating factors should also be considered. The association also sought to strike down the addition of new clause to existing leases that there shall be an increase of 10% in the rates of assignment fee and ground rent every three years. In response, the government counsel stressed that the policy decision was based on recommendations by various committees. The court noted that cultivation of salt is akin to agriculture and the salt manufacturers, no doubt are facing difficulties. Justice S M Subramaniam said that a policy decision taken in public interest by the government cannot be interfered with.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/court-junks-salt-makers-plea-for-longer-lease-lower-rent/articleshow/88442162.cms||---

The first bench of acting chief justice, Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice P D Audikesavalu observed that the press council act does not provide for state level councils. When the case came up for hearing on Wednesday, the court questioned the state government as to why it has not complied with the order by a different bench, but then wondered whether forming such a council is possible. In August, a division bench had set a three-month deadline to form a ‘Press Council of Tamil Nadu’, saying it is necessary to weed out fake journalists, mushrooming journalists’ associations/unions and to regulate distribution of identity cards, passes and other state doles.

Passers-by and those living in the locality fail to hand over garbage to the door-to-door waste collectors in the morning and dump the same outside the park at their will. The mound of rotten vegetable and fruit waste, thermal and cardboard boxes and even used furniture raises a stink. An average of a thousand people frequent this park daily and the joggers say they are unable to breathe. The trash mound attracts cows and buffalos to this park causing fear among the visitors. R Raman of Panner Nagar Welfare Association in Mogappair East said there are several dustbins in the neighbourhood. “In streets like EB Office Road, it is the corporation staff who dump in garbage and waste remains rotting. But here (outside the park), it is the locals and passers-by,” he said.  The yoga and dance podium in the park are used by children every day while the 400-meter walking track is used by adults for running and walking. There are also swings, gym equipment and slides among other facilities. Ambattur zone corporation officials said the door-to-door collection was happening daily and people must at least keep garbage at doorsteps so that the staff can collect it. “We will team up with police and set up CCTV cameras for surveillance,” said a zonal official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/corpn-park-turns-dump-yard-in-mogappair/articleshow/88442168.cms||Omjasvin M D
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin to launch ‘Meendum Manjappai’ campaign today||CHENNAI: Chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday will launch ‘Meendum Manjappai’ campaign organised by the state pollution control board.  The campaign aims at reducing single-use plastic, which causes irreparable damage to the environment and natural resources. A senior state pollution control board official said as per their observations, a plastic bag is used by a person for about 20 minutes. When this used plastic is discarded, it takes hundreds of years to get degraded. Taking this into account, the state had banned 14 types of materials. Due to the Covid-19 lockdown implementation of the ban slowed down. Now, the government is keen to take severe action against violators of the banned items, said the official. Nearly a quarter of a century ago, most of the people across the country used to carry cloth bags while going to buy vegetables, groceries or to hotels. Slowly, with the arrival of the plastic bags, the use of cloth bags was given up by the people. In order to revive the practice, the board is launching the campaign. It will also organize an exhibition of items alternative to single-use plastics. The campaign and exhibition will be held at Kalaivanar Arangam on Wallajah Road. The board had also taken action against plastic bag making units. Some time ago, the board had appealed to the members of the public to inform it about the functioning of such illegal units. The board received a lot of information about such units, which were sealed, the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-to-launch-meendum-manjappai-campaign-today/articleshow/88442169.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Refund 1,300 euros spent overseas on stolen card: Bengaluru court to bank||BENGALURU: A city consumer court ordered a nationalised bank, which forced a 70-year-old Bengalurean to pay over Rs 1 lakh after thieves stole his credit card in Paris and swiped it for around 1,300 euros, to repay the senior citizen the money with interest. The bank was further told to give Rs 15,000 as compensation for the trouble caused to him. Despite filing a complaint within three days of the theft, the bank had failed to block the card. Vijay Basutkar, a resident of Mahalakshmi Layout and an engineer, had travelled to France. On December 30, 2019, when he was riding a Metro train in Paris, his wallet with 700 euros, three credit cards and a copy of the driving licence was picked by miscreants. The crooks spent 1,300 euros (equivalent of over Rs 1 lakh) on one of the cards. Meanwhile, the senior Bengalurean rushed to Paris city police, Préfecture de police, and lodged a formal complaint within hours of the incident. He also sent an email to the bank, asking it to immediately block his card. The septuagenarian landed in Bengaluru in two days and lodged a written complaint with the bank again on January 2, 2020. He also complained to Bengaluru city police the following day. But the bank, where he held a savings account, harassed him constantly to repay the sum swiped by fraudsters in France. Despite his grievance that the bank failed to block the card in time, Basutkar repaid the money. However, on January 29, 2020, he approached the Bangalore Rural and Urban 1st Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Shantinagar with a complaint against the bank’s credit card division for deficiency of service and unfair trade practice. Basutkar presented his case through his attorney, while the bank’s lawyer termed the complaint false and an attempt to make wrongful gain. The lawyer also stated that the matter doesn’t fall under the purview of the Bengaluru consumer court as the incident took place in France and Paris city police are probing the case. The judges of the consumer forum, however, noted that Basutkar had acted in the right manner by lodging a formal complaint with the French police and getting an FIR registered and alerting the bank via email soon after to block the card. He then reached Bengaluru and lodged a written complaint and approached police here as well, all within three working days. As per RBI guidelines, which the bank is bound to follow, in case of a fraudulent transaction from a bank card, the customer must alert the bank within three working days and the bank must probe and refund the lost amount to the customer within 10 working days as the fault lies with the system and not the bank or the customer, who alerts in time.  In this case, the customer alerted all the authorities within the prescribed period and making him repay the entire fraudulently lost sum was indeed illegal trade practice, the forum held in its verdict pronounced on December 13, 2021. The forum also said the bank authorities must refund Rs 1,00,556 to Basutkar with interest and pay him Rs 10,000 towards damages and Rs 5,000 for his court expenses, all within six months of the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bank-told-to-refund-1-3k-euros-spent-overseas-on-stolen-card/articleshow/88442220.cms||Petlee Peter

Acting on the complaint filed by the parents of M Ranjita, police arrested her husband Manjunath on abetment-to-suicide charges. Ranjita and Manjunath fell in love and got married in 2018 despite opposition from their parents. A few months ago, Ranjita gave birth to their second child and stayed with her parents for some time. Last week, she returned to her in-laws’ house. “Ranjita was heard fighting with Manjunath over his alleged affair with another woman. On Wednesday morning, she was found hanging inside the house when Manjunath had stepped out for his morning walk. The incident came to light when a neighbour, who heard the couple’s child crying, walked into the house and found Ranjita hanging from the ceiling,” a police officer said. Burglars strike doctor’s house, decamp with bootyMiscreants burgled a doctor’s residence at Arakere near Konanakunte, and decamped with 310 grams of gold ornaments, 600 grams of silver articles, digital video recorder and UPS. The robbery came to light when Dr Harish B returned home from Sakleshpur on December 20. He suspected his maid and her husband and complained to police. Harish told police he left home around 9.45pm on December 18 to bring his wife back from Sakleshpur. When he returned two days later, he found the main door open and the bedroom ransacked. “I suspect my maid Bharati, her husband and another domestic help, Sridhar,” he said in his complaint. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-found-hanging-at-home-husband-arrested/articleshow/88442141.cms||---

BMRCL recently installed advanced AFC gates that accept both National Common Mobility Cards and QR-code based ticketing in all stations.Naveen, a netizen, tweeted: “They had to build a separate machine and a separate mechanism just to credit the top-up amount to the card, instead of integrating it with the automated gates. That shows the will, integration plans, forward thinking in a Silicon Valley.”BMRCL managing director Anjum Parwez said: “AFC gates take about 30 minutes to read. The new machine will activate instantly.”Nihar Thakkar, another passenger tweeted: “If I can claim the online top-up amount instantly from the top-up terminal, why can’t the AFC gate just auto-claim my top-up amount while paying?”In 2012, BMRCL installed ticket-vending machines at major stations like MG Road and Byappanahalli. However, the machines which were meant to help passengers get tokens or recharge smartcards became dysfunctional after demonetisation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/card-terminals-at-metro-stations-a-waste-commuters/articleshow/88442221.cms||---

He claimed to have paid all the EMIs towards the loan till December. “I purchased the gearless scooter in October 2018 and have been paying Rs 2,345 every month. On December 19, I was riding near Manyata Tech Park when three men blocked my two-wheeler. Calling themselves bank staff, they shouted at me saying I hadn’t paid instalments.

---||Bengaluru||Race for oppn leader’s post hots up; caste factor holds key||Bengaluru: The race for leader of opposition in the council is hotting up in the Congress as the position is set to fall vacant after the winter session in Belagavi.The incumbent leader of opposition SR Patil is retiring on January 5 and the Congress leadership denied him ticket in the recently held MLC polls. The new leader has to take over in the joint session of legislature expected to be held in January. In all, 25 members are retiring next month, of which a few have been re-elected, and the posts of government chief whip and chief whip of Congress are also falling vacant. While BJP’s Mahantesh Kavatagimath, who is government chief whip at present, was defeated in the MLC polls, Congress chief whip M Narayanaswamy chose not to contest them. The outgoing MLCs had a group photo session with CM Basavaraj Bommai on Wednesday amid speculation over possible replacements for the strategic positions in the upper house. The leader of opposition is considered to be the most coveted among the posts falling vacant and seniors, including BK Hariprasad, Allam Veerabhadrappa and CM Ibrahim, are in the race.Sources said a section of the leadership is in favour of party working president Saleem Ahmed, who was elected in the MLC polls from Dharwad-Gadag-Haveri seat. “It is up to the high command to decide who should lead the party and the opposition in the upper house. I am ready for any responsibility,” said Hariprasad.The 67-year-old is considered to be close to party president Sonia Gandhi and was a Rajya Sabha member before he was elected to the Karnataka legislative council from the assembly last year. He had unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha elections from Bengaluru South in 1999 and 2019 and had also contested for the post of deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha in 2018. As AICC general secretary, he was in-charge of many states, including Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.“Someone like Hariprasad is needed to lead the opposition at a time when the strength of the BJP has increased although it fell short of majority by one seat. I hope the high command will weigh the options and choose the right one,” said the outgoing Congress chief whip Narayanaswamy.Hariprasd’s prospects are not yet clear as the high command is reportedly working on striking a fine balance in terms of regions and communities. Representing the Idiga community, Hariprasad is a backward classes leader like leader of opposition in the assembly Siddaramaiah. As both are from south Karnataka, the high command may even prefer a functionary from north Karnataka. Though Siddaramaiah is elected from Badami, he is considered to be originally from Mysuru and Hariprasad is from Bengaluru. If it chooses to replace SR Patil with another Lingayat, then Veerabhadrappa will have a bright chance. Ahmed, who was the chief whip for two terms, has also emerged as a strong candidate from north Karnataka.Ibrahim was miffed after he wasn’t considered for the post in 2019. He had even threatened to defect to JD(S). Siddaramaiah is reportedly batting for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/race-for-oppn-leaders-post-hots-up-caste-factor-holds-key/articleshow/88442225.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

He faced some resistance from Dey thereafter but regained his touch in the second game to score a 21-17, 21-12 victory in 39 minutes.“The match was one of long rallies, particularly in the first game. My legs were tiring but I had to retain my composure throughout.

---||Chennai||Entry 2-wheelers hit by rate hikes, pricey fuel||CHENNAI: Two-wheeler sales have hit skid row and the real culprit is the multiple price hikes that are pinching the mass-volume entry-level segment. Auto industry sources say that between April-December, prices of two-wheelers on an average have gone up by Rs 5,000-8,500, impacting the entry-level where affordability is key. “While the semiconductor chip shortage has hit production and sales of cars, in two-wheelers it is a problem of demand. The multiple price increases on account of raw material costs have hit entry-level two-wheeler sales,” said Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) president Sunjay Kapur. Steel prices have gone up by 60% in a year whereas copper, aluminium and rubber prices have shot up too, he added. Auto consultants say that the entry-level segment has actually not shrunk the most, but its volume hit is highest because of the sheer numbers. Two-wheelers are the most impacted automotive segment as affordability and demand sentiments of target clientele have been hit by the second wave.  The reduced discretionary income due to job losses, salary cuts and Covid-induced medical expenses coupled with relentless increase in two-wheeler prices, record high petrol rates, uneven monsoons and delayed harvest and moderation in financing availability have significantly impacted prospects. In April-November, the 75-110cc segment was down 1.5%, while the 110-125cc segment was down nearly 8%. The pricier 125 cc-150 cc segment however was down 36%,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP and sector head, ICRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/entry-2-wheelers-hit-by-rate-hikes-pricey-fuel/articleshow/88442230.cms||---

In the month of November, 2021, the drop in gems and jewellery exports was majorly driven by lower gold jewellery exports, which was down by 36.52% YoY. Speaking on the recommendation made for the Union Budget 2022-23, chairman of GJEPC Colin Shah said, “We have asked the Government to consider reduction of import duty on cut and polished diamonds, gold and other precious metals, and an amendment in taxation provisions to allow the sale of rough diamonds in the Special Notified Zones in Mumbai and Surat.” This would help the industry to achieve its export target of $70 billion in the next few years, he added. In rupee terms, the overall gem and jewellery exports for last month declined by 3.72 % to Rs 17,785 crore, as compared to Rs 18,471 crore in November, 2019. However, for the period of April to November 2021, overall gross exports of Gems & Jewellery grew by 3.54% YoY to $ 26.04 billion and 9.21% YoY in rupee terms to Rs 1.93 lakh crore. The USA continues to hold the top position with 38.33% of the major export markets, followed by Hong Kong at 24.46%, the UAE at 13.87%, Belgium at 4.10%, and Israel at 3.84%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gems-and-jewellery-exports-drop-8-in-nov/articleshow/88442231.cms||Mamtha Asokan

A decision in this regard was taken on Wednesday at a state-level workshop of district nodal officers for making educational institutions tobacco-free. It was organized by the education department in collaboration with School Evaluation, Empowerment and Development (SEED) programme. Addressing the workshop, Bihar State Health Society’s executive director, Sanjay Kumar Singh, said there was an urgent need of launching an awareness campaign for checking the use of tobacco among children. “The health department and SEED will launch an anti-tobacco campaign in some districts first and extend it to other parts of the state later,” he added. Education department’s special secretary, Manoj Kumar, pointed out, “According to a 2019 survey, tobacco consumption is prevalent in 6.6% of the boys and 8% of the girls in 38 districts of the state.” The executive director of SEEDS, Dipak Mishra, said almost 80 lakh people died every year from various diseases caused by consumption of tobacco. He continued, “In India, the number of deaths caused due to tobacco consumption exceeds 13 lakh every year.” Talking about the anti-tobacco campaign, Dipak said, “Student brigades will be constituted in each district to create public awareness about the ill-effects of tobacco.” Education department’s director (administration), Sushil Kumar, and Supreme Court advocate, Ranjit Singh, also addressed the workshop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/anti-tobacco-campaign-to-be-launched-in-bihar-soon/articleshow/88439459.cms||B K Mishra

---||Patna||Patna’s air quality continues to remain in ‘very poor’ zone||PATNA: Residents of Patna woke up to a “very poor” air quality for the second day in a row on Wednesday as cold wave conditions continued in the city. The air quality index (AQI) level of Patna was recorded at 311 owing to low temperatures and calm winds which resulted in stagnant weather conditions, not allowing enough ventilation for dispersion of pollutants. According to the bulletin of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the overall AQI of Patna was based on the readings of continuous ambient air quality monitoring centres – Eco Park (380), Planetarium (369) DRM office-Khagaul (329) and Patna City (152), where the prominent pollutant was PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micron). S K Memorial Hall (320) and BIT-Mesra, Patna (315) were also in “very poor” zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor” and 401 and 500 “severe”. A “very poor” AQI essentially means that people may suffer respiratory illness on prolonged exposure to such air and it may have more pronounced effect in people with lung and heart diseases. Ashok Ghosh, chairman of Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said climatic condition and anthropogenic activities were responsible for deterioration in air quality. “Sudden rise in temperature, low wind velocity and smog in the environment have led to rise in air pollution. We are working on the clean air action plan with the departments concerned and a committee has also been formed at chief secretary-level to monitor the situation,” he said. Ghosh added at a recent meeting, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had assured financial support to all states. “They also reviewed the utilization of funds by the states for the action plan. Bihar has fared well with 90% utilization. We have allocated the funds to different departments and municipal corporations. They are in the process of procurement of equipment, machines and CNG buses,” Ghosh said. He added, “The air quality has not deteriorated in a day or two. We have continuously abused the environment over the years. It will now take time to restore the quality of air. The Centre and the state have taken this issue seriously and we will see the improvement in year or two. However, it should be a collective effort of all states as the pollutants also come from the neighbouring states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patnas-air-quality-continues-to-remain-in-very-poor-zone/articleshow/88439367.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Patna||Take ‘no dowry’ declaration from wedding organisers: Nitish||PATNA: People in Bihar will now have to make a declaration that their wedding event would be “dowry-free, intoxication-free and child marriage-free” for taking permission from the local police station for organizing such events in the wake of the prevailing Covid restrictions in the state. Chairing a review meeting at Motihari as part of his campaign for social reforms, CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked the officials to add a new column in the prescribed format for giving permission for holding a wedding event in the wake of Covid restrictions. “Give permission for holding wedding events only when people submit a declaration that their wedding function would be a dowry-free, intoxication-free and child-marriage-free event,” Nitish told the officials at the review meeting. As per the Covid-related restrictions wedding events can be organized while following the latest standard operating procedures, but there would be no permission for DJ and marriage procession. People would have to inform the local police station three days prior to holding the wedding event. Stressing the need of bringing maximum awareness among the people about the bad impact of child marriage and dowry system, Nitish asked the district officials to keep a special vigil on those who indulge in the practice of marrying daughters in childhood. “Ensure proper training to the ASHA workers, Anganwdri workers and village chowkidars to check the cases of child marriage,” Nitish told the officials. “The newly-elected members of the three-tier panchayati raj institutions should be imparted training. Include the subjects of child marriage, dowry system and prohibition as part of their training programme,” Nitish told the officials. State’s chief secretary Tripurari Sharan, development commissioner Amir Subhani, DGP S K Singhal, additional chief secretary of many departments, district magistrates of East Champaran and West Champaran, the SPs of East Champaran and West Champaran districts were present at the review meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/take-no-dowry-declaration-from-wedding-organisers-nitish/articleshow/88439501.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Nitish should focus on improving system: Tejashwi||PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday described CM Nitish Kumar’s ‘Samaj Sudhaar Abhiyan (social reform campaign)’ as a “show off” and suggested him to instead focus on ‘vyavastha sudhar (improvement of system)’. Tejashwi said the administrative failure could not be termed as the failure of the social system. “Bihar needs reforms in the system, not social reforms. With the improvement in system, social issues will automatically be resolved. Administrative anarchy is prevalent in the state,” Tejashwi tweeted in the morning. Later in the evening, Tejashwi told mediapersons that it was the responsibility of a CM to work on improving the system, quality education, curbing migration, unemployment and setting up industrial units. “Bihar is at the bottom in all the parameters as per NITI Aayog. Nitish, who has been running government for the last 16 years, has also accepted that Bihar is a backward state. Who is responsible for this backwardness? He should first improve his ministers and officers,” Tejashwi said. The Congress also took a jibe at the CM over his yatra. Party’s state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said, “There is a popular saying that charity begins at home. Hence, CM Nitish should first give moral education classes to NDA people. Recently, we have seen the way Manjhiji was speaking in public and how BJP reacted to it. Also, I would like to remind him of liquor bottles which were recovered from the campus of a school run by a minister’s brother.” However, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad reminded Tejashwi of the three yatras he had started but could not complete. “He had started berozgari bhagao yatra, samvidhan bachao yatra and loktantra bachao yatra, but could not complete any. He had cited cold, rain and hot weather as the reasons for withdrawing his yatras. Hence, Tejashwi should not question the yatra launched by the CM, who is known for his connection and interaction with common people,” Nishad added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-should-focus-on-improving-system-tejashwi/articleshow/88439522.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Delivering the valedictory address, the former vice-chancellor of PU, Rash Bihari Prasad Singh, observed that urban ecology was being degraded due to anthropogenic activities and, hence, people should refrain from unmindful exploitation of natural resources. “Research in bioscience must be oriented towards conservation of environment and sustainable development of natural resources,” he said. Neel Sarovar Bhavesh, a leading scientist of International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology-New Delhi, pointed out, “Unless we nurture nature to sustain our lives and ecosystem, we won’t survive for long.” Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s former director, Janardan Jee, urged the authorities to develop a suitable agricultural technology for ensuring rural and urban development. Altogether 235 research papers, including nine by foreign delegates, were presented in different sessions of the conference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/2-day-international-meet-concludes-in-pu/articleshow/88439604.cms||B K Mishra

Talking to mediapersons at Gaya on Wednesday, Manjhi said he has made up his mind to field HAM (S) candidates in UP assembly election. However, he did not make it clear whether his party would contest the UP polls in alliance with BJP, any other combine or go solo. Given the sharp reaction that has been generated even in the Bihar BJP on the use of an expletive by Manjhi against the “specific type of priests,” he was asked if he would accept the invitation from the BJP, if it comes, to contest the assembly elections in UP, he said, “I don’t know if the invitation will come, but we have already made up our mind to field the HAM(S) candidates in the assembly election in UP.” “In Bihar, I am in the NDA. Therefore, it is obvious that we will first explore as to what we can get as part of the NDA in UP. If it does not work out, we will seek the alliance elsewhere or even go it alone,” Manjhi said. On Wednesday, Manjhi had clarified that he had not uttered the expletive against the people of Brahmin caste, Brahmin or even the non-Brahmin priests in general. “Instead, I had used the expletive against a specific type of priests who eat mutton, drink liquor and do hundreds of wrongs. They know nothing about priestly work and yet are asked to conduct the puja rituals. They don’t eat at the house of the host family from our caste, and instead ask for money. People of the Mushahar caste are being made fools by such priests,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ham-s-to-contest-up-election-manjhi/articleshow/88439549.cms||Abhay Singh

Ircon International Limited, a wing of railways, has been assigned the task to complete this ambitious project in three phases from Jayanagar to Kurtha, Kurtha to Bijilpura and Bijilpura to Bardibas, covering a stretch of 68 km. According to ECR chief public relations officer ( CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways has fully completed the project from Jayanagar to Kurtha long back. Konkan railways had handed over at least 10 DEMU coaches to Nepal government in September 2020 . But rail services between two neighbouring countries could not be made functional due to one reason or other. However, the Nepal government has asked the Konkan railways to carry out a thorough maintenance work of DEMU coaches lying idle in Nepal, he said. Given the present situation, Nepal government has expressed its keenness to run DEMU passenger trains comprising a load composition of five coaches on both up and down directions between Jayanagar and Kurtha initially to fulfil the needs of passengers, he said adding that railways has also completed the track laying and signalling work between Kurtha and Bijilpura. A joint team of experts both from India and Nepal will inspect the track fitness and conduct a speedy trial on Kurtha-Bijilpura route after commissioning of rail services between Jayanagar and Kurtha. The third phase will cover a stretch of 17km from Bijilpura to Bardibas. However, railways is yet to acquire any land from Nepal government for laying new lines and construction of station buildings in this stretch. The entire stretch from Jayanagar to Bardibas will have eight stations and six halts, the CPRO said . “The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has funded this project at an estimated cost of Rs 787 crore after mutual agreement between the governments of these two countries signed in August 2018. India wanted to promote trade and business through rail communication with Nepal,” he said. Besides this, a newly-built goods shed was made functional at Dhang, a distance of hardly 20 km from Nepal border under the Samastipur division of ECR to cater to the needs of businessmen of both the countries. Constructed at a cost of Rs 14.5 crore, Dhang goods shed will also help business community people of Sitamarhi, Champaran, Sheohar and Nepal region to load or unload their booked consignments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/indo-nepal-rail-services-likely-to-start-in-jan-2022/articleshow/88439906.cms||Kumod Verma

He has also directed them to pay the compensation amount to landlords who have given their land for construction of the highway. The NH-19 project, one of the ambitious projects of the district, aims at providing smooth road connectivity to several districts, including Saran, Patna, Vaishali and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh as well. Though the construction work started more than a decade ago, but the project is delayed in the 50-km stretch of Chhapra-Sonepur for the last few years, causing hardship to commuters and they have to opt for longer alternative routes via Parsa for going to the state capital. The contractor of NH-19 project, however, assured the officials during the meeting on Tuesday that work will be expedited from January. Sri Ram Tiwari, a resident of Doriganj (located on NH-19) said: “Due to non-completion of this road from the district headquarters, the worst sufferers are patients who are unable to reach the sadar hospital on time. Likewise, people of this area are unable to board long distance buses from here as these buses go via Parsa. Thus, traders, farmers, students and many others are facing hassles from the last one decade." Narrating his woes, Thakur Sangram Singh, a resident of Sonepur said: “Some portions of the NH, which have been completed earlier, are now in a dilapidated condition. Ambulances are unable to take patients to Patna due to frequent traffic jams on this route. Early completion of this NH project will help students in attending their classes at Chhapra, Khalpura and other places.” Meanwhile, during the review meeting of the land acquisition section of the district on Tuesday, Saran DM also directed the officials concerned to see that trucks are not parked along NH-19 so that traffic flow can be smooth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expedite-work-on-chhapra-sonepur-nh/articleshow/88439923.cms||H K Verma

Minister for environment, forest and climate change (EFCC) Neeraj Kumar Singh will inspect the site on Thursday. The aquarium, being set up to promote eco-tourism, will also generate employment opportunities and go a long way in conserving fish species on the verge of extinction. “The project will have two sections – a huge tunnel-shaped glass aquarium for keeping ornamental fish and rearing and nursing ponds equipped with modern technologies for conserving other fish, including those used for food,” the minister said. He added visitors passing through the large glass tunnel, the size of which is yet to be decided, would be able to capture views of the swimming fish from all sides. Birpur, situated at the Nepal border, also has locational advantage as many people of the neighbouring country come there round the year. The proposed aquarium will be an added attraction to them. The minister said the EFCC department would soon prepare the estimated cost and details of the specifications for both glass aquarium and ponds for final approval by the state government. Since many food species of fresh waters were vanishing for lack of proper aquatic habitat, the aquarium would ensure their conservation as aquatic gene bank. Exotic fish species of different countries will also be brought as part of conservation and development. “Colourful ornamental fish are in high demand for keeping them in home aquarium as decorative items. Their huge collection in a single large glass case will attraction the attention of nature lovers. We will hold a meeting with the experts on fish science and environmentalists soon to get technical suggestions on the aquarium project,” Neeraj said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/min-fish-aquarium-to-be-set-up-at-birpur-in-supaul/articleshow/88440017.cms||VK Tripathi

In the month of November, 2021, the drop in gems and jewellery exports was majorly driven by lower gold jewellery exports, which was down by 36.52% YoY. Speaking on the recommendation made for the Union Budget 2022-23, chairman of GJEPC Colin Shah said, “We have asked the Government to consider reduction of import duty on cut and polished diamonds, gold and other precious metals, and an amendment in taxation provisions to allow the sale of rough diamonds in the Special Notified Zones in Mumbai and Surat.” This would help the industry to achieve its export target of $70 billion in the next few years, he added. In rupee terms, the overall gem and jewellery exports for last month declined by 3.72 % to Rs 17,785 crore, as compared to Rs 18,471 crore in November, 2019. However, for the period of April to November 2021, overall gross exports of Gems & Jewellery grew by 3.54% YoY to $ 26.04 billion and 9.21% YoY in rupee terms to Rs 1.93 lakh crore.

---||Business||Insurers to up term policy rates for 2nd time in FY22||Mumbai: Top private life insurers are revising their term insurance rates by the fourth quarter. According to industry officials, reinsurers have taken a tough stance with the new Omicron variant adding to the uncertainty. This is the second round of price increases in the current fiscal that the life insurance industry is witnessing. According to distributors, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance have sounded them off about the likelihood of an upward revision in the fourth quarter. HDFC Life Insurance chief financial officer Niraj Shah said protection prices in India are a lot lower than in some of the developed countries with superior healthcare facilities and higher life expectancy. “Historical increases in India have been lower than inflation growth. We should expect pricing and underwriting norms to evolve in line with expanding geographical and demographic coverage over time,” said Shah. IndiaFirst Life Insurance MD & CEO R M Vishakha said, “Global reinsurers follow business considerations in revising their rates. Domestic insurers are dependent on their support for providing cover and have to increase rates whenever reinsurance rates are revised.” HDFC Life is currently engaging with reinsurers to refine underwriting practices, deploy new technologies such as deep-learning underwriting models and address the protection opportunity through our group platform (Credit Life) apart from the individual business, which will distribute risks more evenly. In addition to revising prices, what some private insurers are doing is to be more stringent in their underwriting policies on non-health criteria like education qualification of the proposer, their geographic location and their income levels. High-value (multi-crore) policies are now being sold to only those who are graduates or have salaries of above Rs 10 lakh. “Discussions with reinsurers on re-pricing are currently on and it is expected to kick in from early Q4FY22. We will continue to follow a nuanced risk-based pricing approach and increase customer prices in line with emerging experiences. We believe that protection is a long-term and multi-decade opportunity in India given the level of under-penetration and protection gap,” said Shah. Covid had hit the life insurance industry hard. “Companies maintain global reserves and high solvency margins to meet extraordinary situations. Given this is an extraordinary situation, there could be special provisions made for lower solvency margins and reserves that can be built up subsequently,” said Vishakha. Earlier this month, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance CEO Tarun Chugh had told TOI that his company would be raising rates this month following a communication from reinsurers on the increase in rates and stricter underwriting requirements. “Term is not an easy product to buy anyway, but now the discussions have become elongated. As a result, the issuance rate has come down,” said Chugh. Another private reinsurer has launched a new product with higher term insurance rates. Insurers said that the reason for two rounds of increases is that while reinsurers have hiked rates sharply, the regulator frowns upon companies increasing rates by more than 25%. This has prompted companies to go for two rounds of hikes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurers-to-up-term-policy-rates-for-2nd-time-in-fy22/articleshow/88440901.cms||Mayur Shetty

He said that the regulator will not shy away from taking appropriate steps if any of them does not adhere to the mandate of maintaining a proper balance between the issuers’ aspirations and investors’ interests. Tyagi emphasised that appropriate pricing is crucial for public issues. The stern warning came in the backdrop of the recent frenzied activity in the IPO market and instances of a sharp slump in prices of some of the recently listed stocks. The Sebi chief was speaking at the annual meet of the Association of Investment Bankers of India’s (AIBI). Between April and November this year, about Rs 90,000 crore was raised from investors through 76 IPOs. In comparison, in fiscal 2020-21, through 55 IPOs, around Rs 31,000 crore was raised. “In just eight months, the IPO proceeds almost trebled, compared to the level for the previous whole year. The average size of IPOs has also grown from about Rs 350 crore during 2019-20 to about Rs 1,200 crore in this financial year,” Tyagi said. Amid the market’s wide division about how to value the stock prices of new age, tech-enabled companies that are hitting the IPO market, the Sebi chief hinted at the regulator’s willingness to tweak rules for these companies. Sebi had published a public consultation paper on this issue in November 2021 and the regulator would soon take “a view on the issues raised in this paper”, he said. The top markets regulator also listed the responsibilities of merchant bankers, which include protecting interest of investors, conducting business with fairness & integrity, and ensuring true disclosures to investors in a timely manner so that investors are made aware of risks associated with IPOs before taking investment decisions. “It is incumbent upon the merchant banker community to not only follow the regulations in letter but also in spirit,” he said. “It may be an opportune time for AIBI to reflect upon and review the standards of due diligence adopted by merchant bankers in various issue management activities offered by them,” Tyagi said. The Sebi chief also pointed out that the growth in the IPO market is accompanied by various challenges, including in the form of non-traditional business models of issuers, disclosure requirements for new-age technology companies and valuation-related apprehensions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/appropriate-pricing-vital-for-ipos-sebi/articleshow/88440865.cms||---

With Zee’s founders holding a tad below 4% in the company, the support of Invesco, which owns nearly 18%, could be crucial as the merger requires the approval of 75% of the shareholders. The definitive agreement retains the terms of the preliminary merger proposal, first announced on September 22. Though Invesco had welcomed the merger between Zee and Sony, it had said that it was against any such terms that unfairly rewards the former’s founders at the expense of other ordinary shareholders. According to the contours of the deal, Sony will pay a non-compete fee of Rs 1,100 crore to Zee’s founders, which they will use to acquire 2% in the merged entity. This will help them maintain their 4% shareholding, similar to what they held prior to the merger. Besides, the founders can raise their stake to 20% from 4% in the combined entity through open market purchases. The merger will dilute Invesco’s stake to 8%. Invesco had requisitioned Zee to call a special shareholders’ meeting to remove CEO Punit Goenka, whose father founded the company in 1992, over alleged “corporate governance failures”. But Zee got a judicial order against the Atlanta-based fund’s request. Invesco had challenged this and the matter is currently being heard in the Bombay high court. According to the terms of the deal, Goenka will lead the combined entity, which will be India’s second-largest media and entertainment company with over $2-billion revenues. However, an adverse judicial order for Zee could throw a spanner in the works of the merger. “We hope shareholders will see merit in the deal in totality. We will be approaching them, including Invesco, with the proposed transaction, in due course,” said Zee CEO Goenka. He also said that he hasn’t approached Invesco to resolve the feud yet. But he would be willing to engage with them. “Unfortunately, the matter has been sub-judice, so we consciously decided not to engage with Invesco.” Besides the approval of shareholders, the merger is subject to regulatory and other third-party approvals. Zee and Sony expect the merger to be concluded in fiscal 2023. Sony will hold about 51% in the combined entity, which will be listed on the bourses. “The merger will transform Zee into a subsidiary of Sony USA, an MNC. This would also enhance corporate governance practices,” said InGovern founder Shriram Subramanian. “Invesco would find it hard to vote against the merger as it would be counterproductive and put Zee back to the past.” Subramanian further said that minority shareholders should be happy with the merger as it projects a better future for the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zee-sony-ink-merger-deal-dissenter-invescos-nod-key/articleshow/88440858.cms||Reeba Zachariah

Ramya, who completed her education till class XII in Visakhapatnam, pursued her BTech (computer science) and minors in computational biology from IIIT Delhi. Ramya and Lakshay Sahni are the founders of the company. Explaining her entrepreneurial journey to TOI, Ramya said she wanted to develop products related to neuroscience to help persons with mental health issues. “After my BTech, I enrolled in Tech Leaders Fellowship at Plaksha University in 2019,” said Ramya. Ramya said Gen-Z and millennials are no longer afraid to discuss their mental health issues or seek help. “But, the most common solutions are antidepressants and these have serious side effects. Even the first-line medications have adverse effects The alternative, rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) is very costly and available only in key institutions like AIIMS Delhi, NIMHANS, and select private clinics in metro cities,” said Ramya. “People want help, but there are no safe, affordable solutions in the market today. It is here that ‘Ease’ comes in handy for people seeking personalised care to improve their emotional control. It is a first-line depression treatment that can be used independently or as an add-on to the patient’s treatment. The combination of stimulation and digital therapy provides a holistic treatment in the comfort and privacy of the patient’s home,” added Ramya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/vizag-girls-startup-eases-its-way-into-neurocare/articleshow/88439601.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

However, despite the threat, most people in Bihar continue to violate Covid norms. They can be seen moving at public places without masks and crowding at restaurants and party venues ahead of New Year. In the advisory issued by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday, the states have been cautioned following initial signs of increase in Covid-19 cases and detection of Omicron variant in different parts of the country. The states have been asked to ensure strict adherence of protocols as per population density and transmissibility of the virus. Though no Omicron case has so far been detected in Bihar, the state’s dense population and violation of Covid guidelines may invite trouble. Delhi and Mumbai are having the maximum number of Omicron cases in India and these are the two cities from where a large number of people are expected to come to the state during the winter vacation. “Many people come to Bihar from Delhi and Mumbai daily. If people continue to remain ignorant, the situation will become difficult,” said an official of the health department, adding these aspects will be discussed at the next crisis management committee’s meeting. “If need be, new guidelines will be issued for the state,” he added. State IMA senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar said though Bihar and some other states have no Omicron cases, complacency should be avoided. “Whether it’s Omicron or any other variant, following Covid-appropriate behaviour is a must,” Dr Kumar added. He said no scientific data was available on Omicron at present, but it was spreading at a very fast pace in some countries. “People should remain cautious in such a situation,” Dr Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rampant-violation-of-covid-guidelines-worries-experts/articleshow/88439435.cms||Sheezan Nezami

In his speech, the CM focused on the benefits of total prohibition and bad effects of social evils like dowry and child marriage. Describing the dowry system as a very bad practice, Nitish vowed not to participate in those wedding events where dowry is taken. The CM said henceforth he would attend only those wedding events in which a clear-cut declaration about ‘no exchange of dowry’ will be mentioned in the invitation card. “When we launched a campaign against dowry a few years ago, some people used to declare on the invitation card that ‘this wedding is being solemnized without dowry’. Now we are not receiving such invitation cards,” the CM said. He called upon the people not to participate in wedding events which are solemnized after exchange of dowry. The CM also called upon Jeevika workers, youths and social workers to launch a vigorous campaign against liquor consumption, child marriage and dowry system and go to all homes in villages to raise awareness against these evils. Nitish said during his Champaran Satyagrah in 1917, Mahatma Gandhi had started a movement against liquor consumption and asked the poor and illiterate people that consumption of liquor is bad for health and healthy life. The CM also distributed cheques for Rs 5 crore among 246 Jeevika didis for their works in villages. He was seemingly happy with the presence Jeevika workers in large numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/growth-without-reforms-in-society-meaningless-nitish/articleshow/88439723.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Judge recuses himself from hearing poll plea||VIJAYAWADA: The litigation on Kondapalli municipal election took a curious turn on Wednesday as the judge hearing the matter recused himself from the case after interruption by the counsel representing the winning members of YSRC who also moved the high court. Justice Ch Manavendranath Roy said he is recusing himself from hearing the case and it will be referred to the Chief Justice for transfer to another bench. Chaparla Sitaram, the counsel for YSRC counsellors, interrupted the hearing when N Ashwani Kumar, the counsel for Kesineni Srinivas, was arguing on the maintainability of the petitions. Ashwani Kumar said the election tribunal comes into picture in case of contesting candidates only and not in case of ex-officio members who have the statutory right to vote. Writ courts can interfere in matters where statutory rights are infringed, and such cases have been settled by the Supreme Court and various high courts before, he argued. While he was citing a judgement given by the Punjab & Haryana high court in a similar matter, Sitaram raised objection and interrupted the hearing by stating that the judgement cited by Ashwani Kumar does not apply in the present case. Justice Roy asked Sitaram to let Ashwani complete his argument. As Sitaram kept interrupting, the judge asked him to sit down. The court room became tense as Sitaram raised objections to the tone of Justice Roy, stating he is assisting the court and showing anger on him is uncalled for. When he refused to calm down, Justice Roy left the bench and returned after lunch break to announce he is recusing himself from the bench and the matter will be referred to the Chief Justice. Ashwani Kumar requested to record the reasons for the recusal, to which Justice Roy agreed. The high court has been hearing the matter to decide whether Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas can be an ex-officio member of Kondapalli municipality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/judge-recuses-himself-from-hearing-poll-plea/articleshow/88439611.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The incident occurred on Wednesday at Kumhaila village under the Charpokhari police station area of Bhojpur district. Charpokhri police station SHO Prashant Kumar told this newspaper: “As per our initial investigation, a 65-year-old man Bharat Shah, resident of Kumhaila village, died after a minor boy (about 16-17- year old) of the same village hit him hard with his fist when the elderly person opposed the eve-teasing of a minor girl (about 12- 13 year old). As Bharat Shaha was old and weak he could not bear the fatal blow of the youth and succumbed.” He added, “We have sent the body of the deceased to sadar hospital Ara for postmortem. Though an FIR is yet to be lodged, we have identified the culprit and conducting raids to nab him.” According to local sources, the elderly man had gone to the house of the accused boy to ask him why he was eve-teasing a minor girl, who happens to be a family member of the deceased old man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/minor-boy-kills-65-year-old-man-for-opposing-eve-teasing/articleshow/88439942.cms||---

The woman had died two months after the incident due to depression. The special court of ADJ-III Triloki Dubey also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on the convict, Karu Kumar alias Karu Singh. Karu is also accused of raping a minor girl in the village and he is still facing trial in the case. He was also accused of sodomising a minor boy in the village, but no case was lodged by the boy’s parents due to social stigma. The widow was raped on July 21, 2015 when she was working in fields near her house. She somehow returned home and narrated the incident to her son and other family members. The woman was later taken to a hospital for treatment. Special public prosecutor Shyam Nandan Kumar Singh and junior counsel Meena Kumari had demanded life imprisonment for Karu. However, the court awarded 10-year RI to Karu as the deposition of the victim, investigating officer and government doctor who had conducted medical examination could not take place in the course of trial.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/youth-gets-10-yr-ri-for-raping-elderly-woman/articleshow/88439980.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Varanasi||Uttar Pradesh: PM Modi to launch Amul unit today, gift projects of Rs 2,000 crore to EUP||VARANASI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the second itinerary of Operation Flood, which was initiated in 1970 to usher in ‘white revolution’ in the country, for the east UP region from Karkhiyao area here on Thursday by gifting dairy projects worth over Rs 500-crore to the people. The PM will not only lay the foundation of Rs 475-crore Banas Kashi Sankul for Amul products, but will also begin the project of the National Dairy Development Board, which had taken over the failed unit of Parag dairy in Ramnagar, to restart the plant using bio-energy with an investment of Rs 19-crore. White revolution, associated with a sharp increase in milk production in the country, is also known as Operation Flood. “The new logo for milk and its products being introduced by the animal husbandry department of the Central government will also be released for the country by the PM,” said divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal, mentioning, “As these initiatives are going to give a mega boost to the dairy sector from Kashi, it is being considered the beginning of a new ‘white revolution’ in east UP region. Giving all credit to Modi for ensuring establishment of Amul plant in Kashi, Banas Dairy managing director Sangram Chaudhary recalled, “The PM asked us to do something which would benefit Varanasi and surrounding east UP region as Gujarat has already benefited a lot by the ‘white revolution’. This led to the decision of establishing Banas Kashi Sankul for the production of a full range of Amul products in Varanasi.” Banas Dairy chairman Shankarbhai Chaudhary said the Amul unit would benefit dairy farmers of 1,000 neighbouring villages of Varanasi and surrounding districts, including Jaunpur, Machhlishahr, Chandauli, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Azamgarh. “It will save their time and also end the problem of price fluctuation in different seasons of the year. They will start receiving payments timely while the company will also pay a dividend on its profit. This project is expected to provide direct employment to 750 people in the plant, about 2,350 people in allied areas and about 1,00,000 people in villages,” he added. “Further growth in dairy sector is sure in this region as capacity of this plant, which is being started with a capacity of 5 lakh liters production per day, will be double in phase-II after operationalising of Amul unit in Kashi in 18 months,” said the chairman, adding, “Focus would also be on breed upgradation of cattle of this region for improvement in milk production of dairy farmers. Also, Rs 35.19-crore would be paid to around 1,75,000 milk farmers as a year-end dividend for the year 2020-21 on the occasion by the PM through digital transfer in farmers' bank accounts,” he added. Agrawal said, “NDDB’s project with an investment of Rs 19-crore to operationalise the plant, which was run by Parag dairy at Ramnagar, will also be launched by the PM. This milk processing plant of the capacity of 2 lakh litres per day will be operated by NDDB by generating power from a bio-gas plant. To run a bio-gas energy plant, NDDB will purchase cow dung from farmers.” “Another milk and milk product-related work would be the launch of new logo for it by the PM,” said Agrawal, adding, “Initially, the logos for milk and milk products were separate but now the animal husbandry department of the Central government has initiated a move for fixing uniform standard as per which this logo is being introduced. The portal of the department for certification of milk and allied products will also be operationalised by the PM on this occasion.” “The PM will also lay foundation of the work of widening and strengthening of Mohan Sarai (Varanasi)-Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar Chakia Road (Chandauli) of Rs 412.53 crores and Varanasi-Bhadohi-Gopiganj road of Rs 269.10 crores,” said district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma, adding, “The total value of new projects for which the PM will lay foundation is Rs 1,225.51-crore.” He added that 22 completed projects of Rs 870.16-crore will also be dedicated to the nation by the PM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-to-launch-amul-unit-today-usher-in-2nd-white-revolution-in-east-up/articleshow/88441095.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Business||RBI governor: Growth still needs policy support||MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said that risks stalking the global economy have amplified with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, leading to countries scrambling for restrictions. Given the uncertainty, continued policy support was warranted for a durable, broad-based and self-sustaining recovery, Das said in the minutes of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting released on Wednesday. In the meeting held between December 6 and 8, all members, except external member Jayanth R Varma, voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis. The other five in the MPC are external members Shashanka Bhide & Ashima Goyal, RBI ED Mridul K Saggar, and RBI deputy governor Michael Debabrata Patra. “While the Indian economy is on its way to achieving the projected growth of 9.5% in 2021-22, there are still significant areas of concern. Private consumption — the mainstay of aggregate demand with a share of around 55% — is languishing below its level recorded two years ago, suggesting that we still have a distance to go in nurturing a more durable recovery,” said Das. According to Patra, the global outlook has suddenly darkened because of the new variant. “The path of the recovery is still being shaped by the pandemic and its second-order effects. The question that is uppermost is: Has the global recovery peaked prematurely, leaving behind the scars of the pandemic?” said Patra. According to Goyal, additions to durable liquidity have stopped and the next step is to decrease excess durable liquidity itself. “Some of this will be absorbed as growth rises. Banks are already raising some deposit rates in anticipation of a rise in credit. Even as excess aggregate liquidity reduces, the RBI policies targeting liquidity at stressed sectors must continue,” Goyal said. According to Varma, the current repo rate of 4% corresponds to a negative real rate in the range of 1-1.5% based on forward-looking inflation forecasts. “In my view, this level of rates is currently appropriate for reviving economic growth without excessive risk of an inflationary spiral,” said Varma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-guv-growth-still-needs-policy-support/articleshow/88440896.cms||---

Read AlsoPM Modi, Amit Shah, Priyanka Chopra ‘tested’ for Covid in Bihar's ArwalIf the data entry of the state health department is to be believed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi besides cine-stars Priyanka Chopra and Akshay Kumar had recently been tested for Covid-19 in Arwal district of Bihar.Sanjay Kumar, son of late Lalo Devi, who died on September 19 this year, said he has received a certificate in the name of his mother getting the second dose of Covid vaccine on November 25. Sanjay, who is a resident of Kharmauli village under Birpur block of the district said, “ I am surprised to see the vaccination certificate. On November 25, a vaccination camp was organised at the Birpur Kisan Bhavan. But my mother had passed away at the age of 72 in September this year. However, she had got the first dose of vaccine on August 16.” District immunization officer Gopal Mishra said the error might have been occurred due to some mistake at the data entry level at the camp. “A show-cause notice has been issued to Birpur Primary Health Centre (PHC) in-charge on this issue,” he said. Dr Ratish Raman, nodal officer for Covid vaccination in the district said the error might have been caused due to some other family member using the Aadhar card of the dead woman for taking the jab, as her second dose was due. “The district immunization officer has conducted an inquiry personally in the case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-dead-woman-issued-vaccine-cert-in-begusarai-district/articleshow/88440005.cms||---
---||Business||Entry two-wheelers hit by rate hikes, pricey fuel||CHENNAI: Two-wheeler sales have hit skid row and the real culprit is the multiple price hikes that are pinching the mass-volume entry-level segment. Auto industry sources say that between April-December, prices of two-wheelers on an average have gone up by Rs 5,000-8,500, impacting the entry-level where affordability is key. “While the semiconductor chip shortage has hit production and sales of cars, in two-wheelers it is a problem of demand. The multiple price increases on account of raw material costs have hit entry-level two-wheeler sales,” said Automotive Component Manufacturers Association (ACMA) president Sunjay Kapur. Steel prices have gone up by 60 per cent in a year whereas copper, aluminium and rubber prices have shot up too, he added. Auto consultants say that the entry-level segment has actually not shrunk the most, but its volume hit is highest because of the sheer numbers. Two-wheelers are the most impacted automotive segment as affordability and demand sentiments of target clientele have been hit by the second wave. The reduced discretionary income due to job losses, salary cuts and Covid-induced medical expenses coupled with relentless increase in two-wheeler prices, record high petrol rates, uneven monsoons and delayed harvest and moderation in financing availability have significantly impacted the industry’s prospects particularly in the entry level segment. In April-November, the 75-110cc segment was down 1.5 per cent, while the 110-125cc segment was down nearly 8 per cent. The pricier 125 cc-150 cc segment however was down 36 per cent,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, VP and sector head, ICRA. “But the 75 cc-110 cc segment is around 57 per cent of the overall volumes so if that segment does not grow, it is difficult for entire industry to grow,” he added. The sub-125 cc segment is 75 per cent of the two wheeler market. According to the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the auto industry apex body, total two wheeler domestic sales in November came down more than 37 per cent from 16 lakh units in 2020 to 10.5 lakh units this November. “Since March 2019 to now, two wheeler prices have gone up by 28 per cent-35 per cent including BS6, safety norms and now raw material hikes. Also petrol prices have gone up by 30 per cent in the last 6 months. It has hit the sub-125 cc segment really hard,” said Hero Motocorp dealer Nikunj Sanghi, MD, JS4Wheel Motor. What is also eating into entry level sales is the new interest in sub-45 km range electric two wheelers which do not even need registration and so don’t show up on official data. “It takes a mere 10 per cent of an ICE showroom cost to set up an EV showroom and there are Ev outlets coming up all over rural India,” said Sanghi. “That’s affecting entry level sales too,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/entry-2-wheelers-hit-by-rate-hikes-pricey-fuel/articleshow/88440520.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Doctors rush for booster, unofficially||VADODARA/ AHMEDABAD: A prominent Vadodara-based realtor last Saturday took a Covid booster shot. The realtor, with a good NRI clientele, was wary that the two doses of vaccines that he had already taken would prove to be less effective at a time when the newly detected Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading in Gujarat. This realtor is not the only one. Scores of doctors across Gujarat have themselves started taking booster shots. Since a third shot is not yet legally available across the country, doctors, healthcare workers and those close to the community, are using their access to vaccines to take a booster on the sly.  Almost all doctors with whom TOI spoke to in all major cities of Gujarat - Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Surat - confirmed this rampant practice.  In most cases, TOI has learnt, the booster doses come from the extra injectable available in every vial of the vaccine, which is marked as ‘spillage dos’. “Each vial of a Covid vaccine actually has 11 doses of which one is marked as a spillage dose. Out of the eleven doses, only ten doses are administered to the beneficiaries. If the doses are properly extracted, all the eleven doses can be given. So, technically, from ten vials you can save ten doses (or one full vial) which is given to those who have access. This obviously does not come on official record,” a Vadodara-based private practitioner, explained. “A doctor friend of mine had arranged the shot for me. I was told that the effect of the last vaccine shot that I got in the month of April will start wanning. Who wants to take a risk?” the Vadodara-based builder told TOI. “The vaccination drive is on. But most of the time, only 6 to 7 people, who are officially eligible for second dose, turn up to get the jabs when a vial having ten doses is opened. The remaining will be anyways counted as waste. My friends have got the additional shots from these doses,” a senior doctor, in his mid-60s, told TOI. “There are several doctors in Rajkot and Amreli districts who have taken the third dose. They get an extra 1.5 ml in one vial which is used to take a booster dose,” another senior doctor from Saurashtra said. “Scientific studies have proven that the acquired immunity wanes after about 6-7 months of vaccination. Hence, doctors and other health professionals who work with critical patients are opting for booster doses to get the additional immunity. Now there is no dearth of vaccines to administer, the only thing is, it is not legal yet. Thus, the shots that might anyway go into waste are administered to someone,” a medical professional, based in Ahmedabad, said on condition of anonymity.  In Surat, several senior doctors, physicians, pulmonologist and pathologists involved in management of Covid-19 cases are taking booster doses as additional shot after the second dose in February this year. “After almost 10 months it is better for medical professionals handling Covid-19 patients to take booster doses, especially at a time when Omicron cases are on the rise,” said a senior doctor. “I took the dose at a clinic in rural area where they were anyways going to dispose of the remaining doses while closing the clinic as there were no takers for the day.”  “I took the booster dose around a week ago and my family is relaxed now,” said another Surat-based doctor.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: CBI court denies businessman Gautam Thapar's bail, says offence grave||MUMBAI: In a detailed order dismissing 61-year-old businessman Gautam Thapar’s bail plea, the special CBI court said prima facie, the allegations are sufficient to show his complicity in a grave and serious offence. “From the chargesheet and connected papers thereto, prima facie the allegations are to the effect that the applicant along with co-accused indulged in the commission of offence which resulted in serious dent to the financial health of the State. The allegations are serious in nature. The accusations against the applicant prima facie show his complicity,” special judge M R Purwar said. The court accepted the prosecution’s submissions that since he is married to a foreign national and has business interests aboard, there is every possibility that he may abscond. While the bail plea was rejected on Tuesday, the detailed order copy was made available on Wednesday. In October, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Rana Kapoor, his wife Bindu, her company Bliss Abode Pvt Ltd, Thapar and his company Avantha Reality for several offences, including cheating and corruption. Following this, Thapar moved the bail plea. He was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in August. The court did not find substance in the submissions of the defence that he was entitled to bail as Yes Bank had contended that the fraud amount was considered to be nil and as such there are no dues. The court cited a Supreme Court order which said that repayment of the public money is not sufficient and the offence committed as such does not come to an end nor exonerate the accused from the criminal acts. While Thapar’s defence had cited an order in the case of of senior Congress leader P Chidambaram to seek the relief, the court said he was in custody for about two months and the other accused in that case were already granted bail. “However, such is not the fact situation in the case in hand. Undisputedly some of the witnesses are the employees of the applicant and the applicant is an influential person. As such possibillity of tampering or influencing the witnesses cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the applicant is also having antecedents,” the court said. The CBI had alleged that Kapoor had conspired with other accused for illegal gratification of Rs 307 crore when he purchased a bungalow at Amrita Shergill Marg in Delhi from Thapar’s Avantha Realty for Rs 378 crore. The CBI claimed its market price was Rs 685 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cbi-court-denies-bizman-bail-says-offence-grave/articleshow/88441104.cms||Rebecca Samervel

According to police sources, a first-year PUC student at the Government Jr College in Hosadurga, was harassed by some youths in her village. She was teased and harassed while she was on her way to college and on her way back home. Unable to bear this harassment, she hanged herself on Sunday. The girl’s parents and villagers protested till Monday night seeking action against the youths. They withdrew their protest after the police assured them of arresting all four youths. “When she was first teased, village heads solved the issue with the girl’s parents and youths’ parents a few months back, but youths did not mend their ways and continued to harass the girl, which finally drove her to end her life,” the police said. Chitradurga Superintendent of Police G Radhika told TOI: “Our initial reports suggested that the girl faced harassment by eve-teasers. But we are investigating this case to find out the exact reason for her death.” SP Radhika added that whenever girls were teased, they should immediately approach police, rather than going for settling the matter with the other side. She said: “We have now kept a strict vigil on all schools and colleges in each taluk by increasing police patrolling. We have also asked schools and colleges for help to get information of teasers who are harassing their students.” She added that the police had started “educating people about 112 emergency services by visiting each village. Besides, our women police squad, Obbavva, will be deputed at schools and colleges to curb eve-teasers.” She said a hunt is on to nab the four teasers. “We will soon arrest them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/girl-teased-on-way-to-college-commits-suicide-police-to-step-up-vigil/articleshow/88440442.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

Pednekar asked Patil if the BJP would make Amruta Fadnavis, wife of opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, the opposition leader in the assembly. “They should first ask if Amruta Fadnavis will be made the opposition leader. She is always in the limelight. Rashmi vahini is never in the limelight. If Rashmi Thackeray’s name is being taken by the BJP, then they must tell us if Amruta Fadnavis is being made the opposition leader,” she said. Patil on Wednesday said Thackeray should step down as the CM and give the charge to someone else till he is well. State Congress chief Nana Patole said PM Narendra Modi should do the same. “The BJP should check the PM’s Parliament attendance first. Even he is not present in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on many occasions. If the PM is not in the house then his charge too should be given to another minister. I have had discussions with him (the CM), but the opposition is politicising the issue for no reason,” Patole said. Patole said the CM was in good health and will attend the ongoing legislature session. Thackeray, who is recuperating after a spine surgery, did not attend the winter session on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mayors-tit-for-tat-make-amruta-leader-of-oppn-in-mumbai/articleshow/88442017.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Mangaluru||Karnataka: Students, elderly donate hair as a part of Christmas joy of giving||MANGALURU: More than 50 people, including three males aged between 12 to 70, donated their hair to cancer patients, as part of Christmas joy of giving. It was a dream come true for Alroy D’Souza, a software engineer working in Bengaluru, who grew his hair to donate it for cancer patients. He donated his hair at ‘beautiful lengths,’an initiative of St Aloysius College, that was held on Tuesday. The event was organised by Centre for Social Concern (CSC) of St Aloysius College, Canara Organisation for Development and Peace (CODP), Indian Catholic Youth Movement, Caritas India, CODP Sparsha-Campaign Against Cancer and Mercy Beauty Academy. “During my college days, I had come across hair donation drives for cancer patients. Inspired by them, I started growing hair for the past three years. When I heard about the hair donation drive happening in the college, I decided to participate, and I am happy that I could bring smiles on the faces of the needy this Christmas,” said Alroy, who donated hair which was of a length of 12 inches. Sejal D’Souza, a first-year BCom student at the college, who never went to a beauty parlour for a hairdo for quite some time, said that she had grown her hair to a length of 39 inches, and donated hair of a length of about 14 inches, during the drive. “Everybody was envious about my long hair. I never went to the beauty parlour for a hair cut for all these years. I was moved when I heard about the plight of cancer patients. Though my family members opposed it, when I told them that I was cutting my hair, I convinced them by showing that it was for a good cause. I will donate hair once again, when it grows back,” expressed Sejal. Philomena Fernandes, staff coordinator, CSC, said it takes more than three months to prepare wigs, which will be later distributed to the needy. A person with hair of a minimum length of 12 inches, can donate. The wigs are prepared at the Hair Bank, Thrissur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-elderly-donate-hair-as-a-part-of-xmas-joy-of-giving/articleshow/88439566.cms||Kevin Mendonsa
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Revenue department raids film theatres in Krishna district||VIJAYAWADA: Revenue officials in Krishna district have started cracking the whip on movie theatres which are not having valid licenses and have failed to comply with norms. Since Tuesday, revenue officials along with police have been conducting raids on movie theatres across the district and detected violations in 15 theatres. Krishna district joint collector K Madhavi Latha said out of 134 theatres in the district, 102 are in working condition. She said four aspects are being checked in the theatres with respect to cleanliness, license, ticket prices and rates in canteens. Violations have been identified in 15 theatres, of which 12 are running without valid license. “The 12 theatres which do not have Form-B license will be sealed, while fine will be imposed on one theatre for not maintaining cleanliness. Inspections will continue to check violations and action will be initiated against erring theatres. Theatre managements should renew their licenses from time to time,” she said. While officials claim the inspections are a routine process, the timing of these raids did not go well with the exhibitors in the state. The film exhibitors’ association has called for an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss on the future course of action as the raids have come immediately after initiation of legal fight over fixation of ticket prices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/revenue-dept-raids-film-theatres-in-krishna-dist/articleshow/88439629.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada: After nearly 80 years, Mahanti market to get new home||VIJAYAWADA: The Vijayawada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has intensified its exercise of beautification of Besant Road as a shopping zone. The civic body, which successfully developed ‘Eat Street’ in the lane adjacent to the Indira Gandhi Municipal Stadium, has now set out to develop Besant Road. As part of the plan, the VMC is looking to shift Mahanti fish market. Mahanti Market on Besant Road was established in 1943. Wholesale fish and prawn traders import products from across the state to the market and sell them to retailers in the city. Along with wholesalers, 14 retailers ply their trade in the market. As per reports from the market association, around 80 tonnes of live fish and 75 tonnes of prawns are sold here every week, leading to congestion from heavy trucks and goods vehicles that unload fish at the market on Besant road. “The market is very old and was constructed considering the needs of residents before Independence. But the city’s population increased and so did the demand for non-vegetarian food. Most of the wholesale shops are running short of space to sell the catch. We are forced to continue our operations at night considering the rush on Besant Road,” said M Prasada Rao, a trader. The VMC in 2014 proposed shifting the market to a less populated area. But the proposal did not materialise following differences between the VMC and traders’ associations. The VMC had proposed to construct a multistore parking complex on the market site. The civic body recently started the beautification works of Besant Road, raising once again the proposal to shift Mahanti Market. “Mahanti Market is located in a commercial zone. The traders face problems working in a congested atmosphere. They are ready to move from this place if we provide an alternative. We have identified sites near Ajith Singh Nagar and Sambamurthy Road for the relocation of Mahanti Market. The proposal will be finalised soon,” VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/after-nearly-80-yrs-mahanti-mkt-to-get-new-home/articleshow/88439794.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy lays stress on lowering inequality||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy emphasised the need to reduce economic inequality among people and said the country’s economy should focus on sustainable development and reduction of economic inequality. The chief minister joined the virtual conference of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav on Wednesday. The chief minister recalled the services and sacrifices of freedom fighters and told the Prime Minister about AP’s freedom fighters, such as Pingali Venkaiah who designed the national flag. The chief minister told the Prime Minister that he had visited Venkaiah’s granddaughter.  He also recalled the sacrifices of freedom fighters like Alluri Sitarama Raju, Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy, Andhra Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam Panthulu, Potti Sriramulu, Duggirala Gopala Krishnaiah, Ayyadevara Kaleswara Rao and Vavilala Gopala Krishnaiah. Continuing on the economics of the country, the chief minister stressed the need to meet economic requirements of the present generation while laying a foundation for future generations. On reducing economic inequality among the people, he asserted that governments should protect the right to free education and ensure food security. “Economic growth has not sufficiently trickled down to the poor in the country. The recently published ‘World Inequality Report 2022’ estimates that top 10 per cent and top 1 per cent of the country’s population hold 57 per cent and 22 per cent of the total national income respectively,” the chief minister said. He further asserted that, “income inequality would result in increased rural indebtedness, lower purchasing power and reduction in rural aggregate demand. Interventions must be made more impactful by identifying and effectively addressing the bottlenecks and thereby making inclusive economic growth possible,” the chief minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/jagan-lays-stress-on-lowering-inequality/articleshow/88439761.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Now, park a car next to the door of your apartment in a high rise||AHMEDABAD: Imagine stepping out of your 13th floor apartment and getting straight into the driving seat of your car parked near the entrance door to hit the road. In concrete jungles where parking is becoming a headache in public places as well as residential complexes, developers across major Gujarat cities are getting creative to lift home-owners above the parking woes. In Bhavnagar, a developer of a 13-floor high-rise residential building on a 6,200 square yard plot, has got a building plan passed to provide parking slots for owners on each floor. The building will have a concealed hydraulic platform that will lift cars to the residents’ floors. This will effectively allow a resident to park his or her vehicle next to the home’s entrance. The developer has provided parking space for 10 luxury cars to be shared between five apartments on each floor. Kamlesh Shah, the developer, told TOI that every 4BHK and 3BHK flat has parking space for two cars each. “As for conventional parking, there will be a two-level cellar," Shah said. Bhavnagar municipal commissioner M A Gandhi confirmed approval of the project with parking on each floor. “We have permitted the construction of the 13-floor building under Gujarat’s comprehensive GDCR (General Development Control Regulations),” Gandhi said. Earlier, nod was given to two projects in which vehicles are taken to the first floor by hydraulic lifts, he added. In Vadodara, a commercial complex on the posh Racecourse area will have parking on its terrace, claimed to be first-of-its-kind parking space in the Banyan city. Amit Srivastava, project architect, said the complex has two levels of basement parking but an elevated parking area was added to accommodate more vehicles. “We wanted to boost the convenience factor for users without reducing the building’s commercial value,” he said. Srivastava said that installation of solar panels is mandatory in new projects. “As these are installed at a height of 7 to 10 feet, they will provide shade to the parked vehicles. Lifts will be used to carry vehicles to the terrace.” In Rajkot, a commercial building to come up on Kalavad Road will have a separate parking tower for cars. The tower will use the hydraulic lift system. Permission for the tower envisioned as a 70 metre, 22-storey parking facility is underway. Tejas Joshi, president of CREDAI Ahmedabad-GIHED, told TOI: “Parking has become a very crucial aspect of building planning. Experiments of mechanised parking are finding favour with many developers in major Gujarat cities," said Joshi. Experts said that Ahmedabad's expensive space economics is proving a deterrent to major experimentation with parking. "While many commercial and residential buildings are looking at stacked hydraulic parking systems, issues like limited consumable FSI (floor space index), height restrictions in certain areas due to zoning and limited plot sizes are some aspects that prevent builders from experimenting with new parking spaces.” Joshi said that builders are eagerly waiting for the 2022 GDCR norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-park-a-car-next-to-the-door-of-your-apartment-in-a-high-rise/articleshow/88440375.cms||Paul John

The draft guideline has been pending with the ministry of environment, forest and climate changes for the finalization of the same. Green activist Subhas Datta, who filed the case with the NGT, expressed dismay at the inordinate delay in such crucial matters. The NGT bench of Justice B Amit Sthalekar (judicial member) and Saibal Dasgupta (expert member) directed CPCB to file the guideline for HMP by March 2022. The bench has also released the performance bank guarantee of Rs2 crore each for KMC and PWD lying with the state PCB so that the fund can be used for clean technology for road repairing and road laying. The bench asked WBPCB to file an affidavit on this and KMC to file an action taken report on HMP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-pwd-escape-ngt-penalty/articleshow/88440476.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||14 inmates sign up for literacy programme at DK District Jail||Mangaluru: Response to the literacy programme for prison inmates, launched by the state government on November 1, has been encouraging at the Dakshina Kannada District Jail, where 14 undertrials have enrolled in the programme. The initiative was launched by the Karnataka government after a survey found that nearly a third of the inmates in the state’s prisons were illiterate. Although one of the objectives of the initiative was to provide an opportunity to educated inmates to impart lessons to their fellow prisoners, the authorities at the Dakshina Kannada District Jail in Mangaluru have appointed a dedicated teacher, who has been deputed to work at the prison under the Adult Education Programme. Chandan J Patel, who was the superintendent of Dakshina Kannada District Jail when the literacy programme was launched, pointed to some of the challenges they faced in implementing the programme. “Lack of motivation to learn among the prisoners was one of the major challenges, while inmates eager to learn often had to face mockery from the educated prisoners. However, since the prison houses only undertrials, they can always opt out of the programme once they are released,” said Patel. He pointed to a 65-year-old undertrial who had learnt to write his name as being emblematic of the initiative’s success at the prison. Dakshina Kannada District Jail superintendent BT Obaleshappa, who recently took charge, said that the authorities at the prison had many programmes planned through the Skill Development Centre for the welfare of the inmates in the pipeline. “At the behest of the prisons department, we are looking to equip the inmates with various skills so as to enable them to lead a comfortable life once they are released from jail. We are working closely with the Skill Development Centre, and with assistance from the district administration and Mangaluru city police, we have organised various programmes, such as computer training sessions, training inmates to tend to a plant nursery, etc. We will continue with the literacy programme as well,” Obaleshappa told TOI. During his stints at the prisons in Davanagere and Hassan, Obaleshappa was successful in developing a plant nursery that was maintained by the inmates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/14-inmates-sign-up-for-literacy-programme-at-dk-district-jail/articleshow/88439591.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED may make Nora Fatehi a witness in PMLA case||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate may make actor Nora Fatehi a witness against fraudster Sukesh Chandrasekhar in the Rs 200 crore money laundering case it is investigating against him and his actress wife Leena Maria Paul. Fatehi had received expensive gifts from Sukesh and Leena. Meanwhile, ED officials have been discussing actor Jacqueline Fernandez’s role in the case and have rejected her request to cancel the look out circular (LoC) issued against her. Earlier in the month, authorities had prevented Jacqueline from flying to Dubai for a show, based on ED’s LoC. A former deputy legal advisor of ED and independent practising lawyer Satya Prakash Singh said, “If a person receives proceeds of crime unknowingly, admits and discharges the burden of proof in statements to ED, the investigator is most likely to cite such a person as a witness against the key accused in the case. However, the proceeds in the hands of such a person shall come within Section 5 of the PMLA and is most likely to be provisionally attached.” He added, “To make someone accused in the case, the investigator needs to establish he or she received proceeds of crime with prior knowledge of the offence and actively participated in any activity or process of money laundering. The element of ‘mens rea’ kicks in at this stage.” The ED claimed Nora Fatehi reportedly received a BMW from Sukesh, and Leena gifted her a Gucci bag and an iPhone. Sukesh had reportedly gifted Jacqueine expensive gifts, including a horse and a Persian cat. The ED had mentioned names of both actresses in a chargesheet it filed against Sukesh before a court in Delhi recently, where it had also accused Leena of money laundering. The ED had recorded statements of Nora Fatehi and Jacqueline. In October, Nora’s spokesperson issued a statement stating, “Nora Fatehi has been the victim around the case and being a witness, she is co-operating.” Conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar had extorted hundreds of crores from businessmen and others. He extorted Rs 215 crore from the wife of Ranbaxy ex-promoter Lab Shivinder Singh, while he was in jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-may-make-nora-fatehi-a-witness-in-pmla-case/articleshow/88441110.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Trichy||Buy dark-maroon jaggery, not pale yellow: Food safety dept||Trichy: With Pongal festival around the corner, food safety department has advised people to buy jaggery in dark maroon colour and avoid the adulterated one in pale yellow. Designated officer (DO) of the department Dr R Ramesh Babu said on Wednesday that wholesalers and retailers dealing with jaggery have been instructed to shun the adulterated variety. Consumption of jaggery will be higher than normal during the festival. On Monday, the food safety department organised a meeting with 130 wholesalers and retailers in the district. District collector S Sivarasu advised the traders not to deal with the adulterated one failing which they will face legal consequences. The meeting with traders threw light on the lack of awareness among the people in distinguishing between the original and adulterated one. “The jaggery traders say that consumers go for the pale yellow jaggery presuming it to be unadulterated whereas it is the one in dark brown colour that is the original,” Ramesh Babu told TOI. On the health hazard of using adulterated jaggery, Ramesh Babu said manufacturers mix sulphur in it which changes the dark maroon real colour into pale yellow. “Sulphur contains carcinogenic agents which may cause cancer in the long run,” said the DO. M Subramanian, a jaggery trader in the city, expected the food safety department to tighten the grip over manufacturers. “It is true that people are accustomed to the pale yellow colour. If only the dark maroon coloured jaggery is available in the market, they will also be aware and switch to the original one. The traders are ready to sell only the original one,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/buy-dark-maroon-jaggery-not-pale-yellow-food-safety-dept/articleshow/88441111.cms||Gokul Rajendran

On this property, Mukhtar’s family had given shops on rent on the ground floor while a hotel was being run on the upper floor, which was demolished by police in October 2020. Providing details of the action of Ghazipur police to TOI, ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, ”Taking note of the report of police, the district magistrate of Ghazipur issued an order to attach the property, which is in the name of Mukhtar’s son Abbas Ansari and his patron and mother Afsha Ansari on Tuesday. The police executed the order by sealing the entire building on Wednesday.” “The total value of the seized land is Rs 9.30-crore while the cost of shops built on it is estimated at Rs 80-lakh,” he said mentioning that with this action, the financial loss to Mukhtar, his family and gang members in the ongoing drive against organised gangs and mafia has gone over Rs 397- crore.” When SDM Sadar Aniruddh Pratap Singh and CO City Ojaswi Chawla reached Mahuabagh market along with heavy police force to execute the DM’s order of seizure of this property, chaotic scenes were created as owners of 17 shops located in the building started vacating their premises in a hurry. Some of them were also seen requesting the officials to avoid seizure, but the latter expressed helplessness in doing so. On October 31, 2020 Hotel Ghazal, which existed on the upper floor of this building in the centre of Ghazipur city, was bulldozed amidst tight security.This action was initiated following the order of the eight-member controlling authority board under district magistrate MP Singh. After isolating the areas between Mahuabagh and Mishra Bazar, the officials engaged five high capacity bulldozers, which took less than six hours to turn the prestigious hotel of the don’s family into debris in front of hundreds of spectators. The shops on the ground floor were not disturbed during last year’s action. As per records, Mukhtar had constructed the hotel in 2004 and landed in jail in 2005. He has not been able to come out of jail so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rs-10-crore-property-of-mukhtar-ansaris-son-attached-in-ghazipur/articleshow/88441112.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The court said that through the crime, the accused had caused devastation in the girl’s life and also dented his life at such an early stage. “The sentence of the accused will send a message to youth of today, who are in the age group of [the] accused, that uncontrollable desire for satisfaction of lust can spoil their future, career and golden period of progress,” special judge Priti Kumar Ghule said. The court said that the foundation of future progress lies in early days of youth, irrespective of gender. “In [the] present case, future of the accused as well as the victim has come in the shadow of darkness due to the offence committed by accused,” the judge said. The court, however, said that it was not necessary to give him the maximum punishment as the accused will not repeat the offence and has understood the consequences of his act. The court also said that the girl was entitled for compensation under schemes with the District Legal Services Authority. “It is seen that due to this act there is hurdle for marriage of the victim in the future. Her engagement is already broken,” the court observed.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Deepan Bhadran among 7 to make DIG grade||AHMEDABAD: With Gujarat anti-terrorist squad (ATS) DIG and 2005-batch IPS officer Himanshu Shukla (R) heading to RAW (research and analysis wing), SSP ATS and Jamnagar SP Deepan Bhadran, a 2007-batch IPS officer, has been promoted to the post of DIG in the ATS by the state home department. As heads of Ahmedabad crime branch and the anti-terrorist squad, they cracked some of the most difficult cases, as the two premier agencies worked in tandem. Their work includes the seizure of the synthetic drugs raw material ephedrine, worth Rs 700 crore, on city’s outskirts in 2016. They later nabbed the prime accused, Kishorsinh Rathod, son of former Congress MLA Bhavsinh Rathod. Shukla and Bhadran saved the state government many blushes, be it the case of the 2019 police exam paper leak where 45 accused from states like Karnataka and Haryana were nabbed or the Jayanti Bhanushali murder case where BJP leader Jayanti Patel was caught for allegedly killing his party colleague. The two IPS officers also raided a hotel with other officers on Relief Road when they knew a shooter named Irfan Iliyas Shaikh of the Chhota Shakeel gang was there to kill Gujarat BJP leader Gordhan Zadaphia in August 2020. He was nabbed even though he fired two rounds at the cops. The two IPS officers also broke networks of extortionists like Vishal Goswami and Ravi Pujari and played a pivotal role in tracing them and putting them behind bars. As Shukla moves to RAW early next month, a rare feat for a Gujarat cadre IPS officer, it was only fitting that the state government decided to bring Bhadran as his replacement. While Shukla took ATS to new heights, Bhadran, as Jamnagar SP tightened the screws on gangster Jayesh Patel, a special assignment given to him while he was heading the Ahmedabad crime branch. Apart from Bhadran, the Gujarat home department also promoted SP of the motor transport department D H Parmar; superintendent of Surat central jail M L Ninama; SP CID crime Saurabh Tolumbia, DCP Zone 3 Makrand Chauhan; SP (Western Railway) Ahmedabad Parixita Rathod and Commandant of SRPF Group 20 R M Pande to DIG rank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-ats-dig-himanshu-shukla-heads-to-raw-ssp-ats-deepan-bhadran-promoted/articleshow/88440482.cms||---

They have limited the number of members who will attend the Christmas services. Some churches are making arrangements in spaces adjacent to the main church so that people don’t have to huddle in a small space increasing the chance of spreading any infection. The news of the latest Omicron strain which is fast spreading in India has prompted church authorities in Kolkata to take this decision. They are making alternate arrangements of either live streaming the proceedings or making video recordings and sharing with the parishioners. “We have requested our members who are above the age of 60 to avoid coming to church for special Christmas mass. We are expecting more than 300 people to attend the service, so we don’t want the senior citizens to risk their safety. We will be recording the entire proceedings and sharing with them so that they can be a part of the service from the safety of their homes. It is very important that we do everything to keep people safe,” said Rev Biswajit Biswas of Duff Church in north Kolkata. At Church of Christ The King on Syed Amir Ali Avenue, the authorities have made seating arrangements at three places and will be holding multiple services so that there is no overcrowding in the church. “We are making arrangements in the parish hall and the church compound so that social distancing can be followed properly. We will also have multiple Christmas services throughout December 25 so that everybody gets a chance to attend without the church getting crowded,” said Father Basil Mandi, parish priest of the church. St Andrew’s Church on Brabourne Road and St John’s Church on Council House Street too have urged their members to wear masks and follow all Covid-19 guidelines. “It will be mandatory to wear masks when inside the church for Christmas prayers,” said Father Swarup Bar of St Andrew’s Church. Several churchgoers in Kolkata are also in a dilemma whether they will celebrate the birth of Jesus at a church service or over a livestream on Christmas Day for the safety of their family members and their own. “Covid-19 is not yet over and our church has many members. I am in two minds if I should go in person or attend the Christmas service on livestream,” said Angela Biswas, a resident of Bowbazar.

Thomas had expressed his wishes on how to conduct his funeral and opposition leader VD Satheesan at a press conference here said after discussions with his family, a decision was taken to ensure that his wishes are respected. His mortal remains will be cremated at Ravipuram crematorium as per his wishes and the ashes would be later buried in the family tomb at Upputhodu in Idukki where his mother rests. “He had written down his funeral wishes before his death. He has instructed not to place wreaths on his body and to play the song ‘Chandrakalabham Charthi Urangum Theeram’ written by Vayalar, composed by Devarajan and sung by Yesudas at his funeral in a low volume,” said Satheesan. Thomas’ eyes were donated. Ernakulam DCC president Mohammed Shiyas said the body will be brought to his house at Upputhodu on Wednesday. It would be brought to his residence at Palarivattom by 6.30am on Thursday. Later, it will be brought to Ernakulam DCC office where party leaders and workers can pay homage. From 8.30am till 1.30pm the body will be kept at Ernakulam Town Hall for the public to pay their last respects.

The idols of Adi Poora Amman and Vinayagar were found at Rathinagireeswarar temple at Thirumarugal, said director general of police (DGP) C Sylendra Babu here on Wednesday. “Idol wing police believe the two panchaloha idols could date back 1,500 years to 2000 years. Villagers of Sannasi Panangudi will get the two idols,” the DGP told reporters while appreciating the investigating team. The Adi Poora Amman idol, a bronze pot, a bell, a nagabaranam and two copper vessels were stolen from Dhalaraneswarar temple in 1992. Thittacheri police had registered a case but it was closed as untraceable in 1993. When all old cases of idol thefts were taken up again by the idol wing police following a Madras high court direction in 2017, the files related to the theft at Dhalaraneswarar temple were missing in the police station. So the idol wing police team led by additional superintendent of police R Rajaram registered a fresh case last month based on the complaint of the temple priest. The DGP said intensified investigation of the team made headway. Based on eyewitness accounts of villagers, the team came to know that the Adi Pooram Amman idol was recovered in the same village the day after its theft. Concerned over its safety, the temple administration and the villagers had transported the idol and the Vinayagar idol in the temple to Rathinagireeswarar temple on a bullock cart. The team visited the Rathinagireeswarar temple and found the two idols there. They identified the idols with confirmation from eye-witnesses. There was no record to show the idols were the properties of Rathinagireeswarar temple. Idol wing police said that both the idols will be submitted to the Kumbakonam court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/2-metal-idols-recovered-from-another-temple/articleshow/88441115.cms||---

In individual letters to the deputy speaker, the 12 MLAs said the opposition has already tendered an unconditional apology. The letters state that they have already served over five months of the suspension period. The MLAs say that if the resolution suspending them for a year is not reconsidered and the period of suspension is not reduced, it would only deprive their constituencies of the representation in the House. It would also prevent them from raising important issues pertaining to their constituencies, the MLAs said.

Turning out in unprecedented numbers, the community sent a message of its political reawakening and unity to the corridors of power. Ministers from BJP and Congress governments at the Centre and the state, respectively, participated in the celebrations of the non-political organisation but subtly praised their parties. BJP leaders such as Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore found common cause with the organisation inspired by the RSS, while Congress speakers, cabinet minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and former employees' union leader Dharmendra Rathore, stressed on showing their love for Lord Ram and 'Kshatriya Dharm'. The Congress leaders did not miss the opportunity to credit Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot for implementing the quota for economically weaker sections (EWS) in state jobs. Dharmendra Rathore demanded the Modi-government to implement EWS in central government jobs, while minister Khachariyawas wanted the Centre to give relaxations in EWS eligibility criteria. Union minister Shekhawat refrained from responding to statements by the two Congress leaders. “People have made political statements here, but my grooming in the Sangh (RSS) tells me not to do so at the community programme,” he said and praised the Rajput organisation for promoting values and ethos among the youth to build a strong society. Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore recalled the role of the organisation and its branch ‘Pratap Foundation’ in getting EWS quota for the community in the non-reserved category. “Come together, time is calling you again. We should again come into the role of a ‘sardar’ (leader); let us win the trust of all (communities) and take everyone along with us. Let us prove that we will have participation in the history being written in this democracy. I have never seen such a large gathering of people in my lifetime,” said Rathore. Pratap Foundation convener Mahavir Singh Sarvadi said, “There were 57 Rajput MLAs out of 160 in the first state assembly (1952-67); but today, there are just 17.” On the occasion, the organisation passed the chief's baton from Bhagwan Singh Rolsahabsar to Lakshman Singh Bainyakabas after a gap of 32 years. The event witnessed an impressive turnout of Rajputs from across the state. The venue — Bhawani Niketan Shikshan Samiti campus spread over a couple of bighas — was overflowing with men and women attired in saffron turbans and ‘odhani’ (saree/sari). The organisation’s new head, Lakshman Singh Bainyakabas, spoke about its founder late Tan Singh, who was a two-term MP and two-term MLA between 1952 and 1979. Citing examples from the Ramayana and Gita, he stressed on character building of people to have a strong nation. Other community leaders such as cabinet ministers Mahesh Joshi and Sukhram Bishnoi, BJP state president Satish Poonia, general secretary Chandrashekhar, and former minister Arun Chaturvedi were present along with several other Rajput MPs, MLAs and leaders from both parties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajputs-flex-political-muscleat-community-event-in-jaipur/articleshow/88441129.cms||Bhanupratap Singh

---||Pune||Teachers hope schools stay open for sustained learning||Pune: Teachers strongly feel that schools must be allowed to remain open and parents must have the choice on whether they want to send their children to school or not, despite the looming Omicron threat. Online classes have led to huge learning gaps incurred by the students which the teachers had just begun to compensate for via the offline classes. However, if the schools close down again, their work in the past weeks to bring students up to the mark would go down the drain, teachers said. Allauddin Shaikh, secondary school teacher from a Zilla Parishad school in Aurangabad with over 24 years of experience, said that the schools need to stay open if SSC students have to appear for board examinations. According to a McKinsey report, educators, parents, and students know firsthand the high cost of this prolonged period of remote learning, from rising rates of depression and anxiety to the loss of student learning. Along with robbing them of lives and livelihoods, school shutdowns could deny students from these communities the opportunity to get the education they need to build a brighter future, the report added. In rural areas, online classes are still a big problem because students either do not have a smartphone, or a valid internet pack or even network to access the internet. “Hence, whatever study happens, it happens via physical classrooms. When schools reopened three months ago, we almost had to teach them everything that was covered online again because students had completely lost their touch with studies. It was such an uphill task and even now we are working really hard. If the schools close down again, students will once again blank out, and that will seriously affect their studies and their performance in board examinations,” Shaikh said. He was not just worried about the board examination, but also their future prospects. “Without studying the fundamentals in Stds VIII, IX, X, higher education will turn out to be even more difficult for them. Hence it is imperative that we keep our schools open,” Shaikh said. Vijay Kombe, general secretary of Maharashtra State Primary Teachers’ Council, said that it was time to take maximum precautions while treating Covid-19 as part of life. No primary teacher or any other teacher wants the schools to close because they know how much students have suffered due to school closure. Teachers are working hard to bring back the students to a level where they would have been in the schools were regular. “Now, if they close it down again, citing the Omicron variant threat, it will kill whatever efforts we have put in and an entire generation will suffer. The effect will be even worse on rural students and those from economically weaker sections of society because for them, accessing online education is hard. Hence, to ensure that Maharashtra doesn’t suffer in education, we need to keep schools open as long as we can,” Kombe said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teachers-hope-schools-stay-open-for-sustained-learning/articleshow/88440501.cms||Ardhra Nair

At least four banners were reportedly found in the Vittal town panchayat limits, calling for an election boycott. The Election Commission will hold elections to Vittal and Kotekar town panchayats in Dakshina Kannada district on Monday. Farmers have demanded that they want their agricultural land to be protected, and that they will not accept any compensation. It is learnt that the Udupi-Kasargod 400kV (quad) DC line was planned for improving the reliability of power supply, and stability in the northern area of Kerala, and relieving congestion between Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka as well as between Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It was decided to take up this project in 2013. On getting to know that the banners were found at Vittal town panchayat limits, chief officer Malini rushed to the spot and tried to convince the villagers. “We tried to convince the locals to remove the banners, however, they are not in the mood to listen. We will speak to the senior officers about this development, and based on their guidance, further action will be taken up. The transmission system is being developed by Sterlite Power, and according to officials, a detailed survey as well as design and engineering work is in progress,” she said. Vittal Raitha Horata Samithi secretary Lakshminarayan said that they have written to the deputy commissioner, asking the district administration to drop the project. “For almost a year, we have been reaching out to politicians and officials. No information about this project has been shared with farmers. On November 30, we organised a protest, and a memorandum was handed over to the tahsildar. Two days ago, the company started a survey in Veerakambha Nadavalachil, despite the fact that the energy minister had assured to hold a meeting with the villagers,” he said. “Hence, farmer organisations have put up banners, calling for a boycott of panchayat elections. We do not want this project in Dakshina Kannada. More than a lakh trees will be felled due to this project. We are worried about the health hazards that will be caused due to the project. Let the government take up this project through the sea. There are chances that the project capacity could be upgraded in the future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/locals-threaten-to-boycott-tp-poll-over-transmission-line/articleshow/88439642.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

A Covid war room had been running from the medical college till earlier this year to manage all pandemic related decision making. “A decision was taken to once again reactivate the war room. It will help to make prompt decisions in case the situation worsens. We are prepared to handle a third wave if it comes,” said Dr KC Pant, chief medical superintendent, Doon hospital. The pandemic had earlier witnessed a severe shortage of oxygen at the establishment. But officials have claimed that such a situation will not arise again. “We have three fully functional oxygen generating plants here now, two of which were installed by DRDO. There is plenty of oxygen supply and shortage will not be an issue this time around,” added Dr Pant. The hospital, meanwhile, is yet to have an operating MRI facility. The machine is there but the infrastructural work for the installation is still underway. Officials said that a special wing is being created for MRI and it should become functional by the end of the year. In addition, the hospital doesn’t have the peritoneal dialysis unit. “This is one method of dialysis. The other is hemodialysis for which we earlier had seven units. Now the number has increased to 10. We are working on improving all our facilities,” said the CMS. Meanwhile, a nursing staff member on condition of anonymity said the expanding infrastructure of the hospital requires an increase in nursing and house cleaning staff. “During the pandemic, we were stretched thin. If that situation happens again, the existing staff strength isn’t enough. They are also adding another wing. We will need more people,” said the nurse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-medical-college-preparing-covid-war-room/articleshow/88440507.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The 500 students who were in the waiting list received the admission after which the state primary education department concluded the admission process. In Pune district, 13,720 students were given admission under this scheme this year. The admission process was conducted between June 11 and June 30. It was later decided to extend the deadline until July 9 . However, the extension did not help boost admissions under RTE. Education officer Anil Gunjal said that the last date for the regular round of admission was July 31 after which the admissions of students in the waiting list was started on August 8. “The admission went on till December 18 and since we wanted to ensure that every child that has applied and was eligible for admissions is given allotment hence the process took longer time,” Gunjal added. The admissions were conducted in 9,432 schools in Maharashtra for 96,684 seats. The department had received 2.22 lakh applications and about 1.2 lakh allotments were announced. Of the total number of allotted seats, 71,716 applicants confirmed their admissions whereas 24,968 seats have remained vacant this year at the end of the admissions in Maharashtra. Gunjal said, “The lottery was announced in March. However, some restrictions imposed as a result of Covid-19 had delayed the process. The regular round admissions were conducted between June 11 and July 31 after which the admissions were allotted to students in the waiting list.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rte-admission-concludes-after-six-months-29k-vacancies-still-remain/articleshow/88440510.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt tables ordinance for 27% reservation to OBCs in local body polls||Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday tabled the ordinance providing 27% reservation to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local body polls in the legislative assembly on Wednesday to be converted into Bill. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court directed that the Election Programme in respect of all the local bodies across the State in respect of reserved seats for category Other Backward Class, shall remain until further orders. tnn Later the SC also asked the state government to denotify the 27% seats reserved for the OBC into general category for the local body elections. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar questioned the state government for bypassing its verdict on OBC reservation by taking the ordinance route without fulfilling the ‘triple test’ criteria enumerated by the top court, under which the state was bound to set up a commission to collect data on OBC representation and ensure reservation does not breach the 50% ceiling. On September 23, the state rural development department had issued an ordinance to provide 27% reservation to the OBC community in election for local bodies like zilla parishads and panchayat samitis. On October 1, the state urban development department issued another ordinance for similar reservation in municipal corporations, municipal councils, nagar panchayats and industrial townships. Senior officials said that the SC court has not stayed the ordinances and has directed that the 27% quota should not be implemented for the local body elections. "There is no problem in completing the legislative process of the ordinance," said the official. The validity of the ordinance is just for six months and has to be converted into a bill before that. The ordinances will be taken up for discussions in the next few days. A senior official said that there is no stay to the ordinances. On December 6 the elections on the seats reserved for OBC category were stayed and later it directed the state election commission to denotify those seats into general category to facilitate the elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-govt-tables-ordinance-for-27-reservation-to-obcs-in-local-body-polls/articleshow/88442021.cms||---

The court granted the man bail but said his release is subject to the woman paying the amount. “…as the informant (mother) after filing the FIR with such grave allegations, is giving no objection to grant bail to the accused by filing an affidavit, I am of the view she has misused her right to take legal recourse,” said the court. Three previous bail applications of the accused had been rejected. The accused, in jail since November 30, 2019, had claimed he was in a relationship with the girl. When her father learnt about it, he opposed it. She may have cooked up the story that he had raped and threatened her under her parents’ pressure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-backs-bail-for-minor-daughters-rapist-fined/articleshow/88441134.cms||Rebecca Samervel

He told reporters in Thanjavur that the process to recover all such properties with the help of the state government has begun.Unlike properties owned by HR and CE departments, wakf board is only the custodian of properties. The original rights are vested only with the respective dargahs and mosques. So, without the cooperation of dargah and mosque authorities, it would be very difficult to execute the process successfully. Wakf board will extend the required legal guidance and support to the authorities if they commence the process of recovering the properties, Abdul Rahman said.  “We have got permission from the government to accord zero value to the entire properties owned by dargahs and mosques. If a particular property would be provided zero value, nobody can buy or sell them. The properties which had already been sold or bought using fake documents would also come under zero-value category. Entire sale proceedings would be nullified,” the chairman clarified.The chief minister has promised all support to recover the entire property from encroachers. With the help of officials from the registration department, the process of uploading original documents of properties has begun. Those titles would be blocked by the registration department from illegal sale, he further added. Abdul Rahman condemned the Union government’s plan to bring a bill to increase the minimum legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21. “It is reprehensible that the central government has engaged in this attempt in a dictatorial manner, in violation of a fundamental right of the Constitution. This will lead to huge cultural degradation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/properties-of-dargahs-worth-crores-encroached-says-wakf-chairman/articleshow/88441135.cms||---

The counselling helpline that has been started by Saurashtra University’s psychology department is being pounded with calls from citizens, especially those who saw their near and dear ones dying of Covid-19 or were themselves infected with the virus in the first and second wave. Prakasbh Bhambhi (name changed), who spent 35 days in the hospital in the second wave, is spending sleepless nights, after learning about the new variant. But he told the counsellers that fear of contracting Omicron has gripped him and that he had locked himself up in the house. The department made a detailed analysis of nearly 2,160 calls they received regarding the fear of new variant and found that 72% people were extremely anxious while 63% feared getting infected. The calls to the helpline had dropped drastically as Covid-19 cases eased, but there has been a sudden spike following the entry of Omicron in Gujarat. Assistant professors Dhara Doshi and Dimpal Ramani, who conducted this survey, said “There are many people now who are avoiding attending social functions. Around 45% in our survey admitted that they avoided attending marriages while 15% admitted to having postponed their picnics or weekend getaways. There are people who also fear taking exams or attending job interviews.” According to the survey, 90% participants have started Ayurvedic ukala and home remedies to boost their immunity like they used to do during the first and second peak of Covid. T Majority of the participants were those who had suffered from Covid-19 during the second wave or had lost some family member or near one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/omicron-fear-spreads-faster-finds-saurashtra-uni-survey/articleshow/88439668.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Goa||Goa: Season’s first flippered visitor lays eggs at Morjim||PANAJI/POINGUINIM: An early morning flippered tourist sparked off some excitement at Morjim beach after it laid 130 eggs and kicked off the nesting season for Olive Ridley turtles on the back of a productive season last year. The beach on the mouth of River Chapora and Mandrem in Pernem, and Agonda and Galgibaga in Canacona taluka are four turtle nesting sites designated under coastal regulation zone (CRZ) notification 2011. “This is the first nesting of the season. Our staff and forest guards who keep a watch on the beach noticed the turtle around 1.30am,” range forest officer (RFO) John Fernandes said. Goa’s modest turtle conservation programme was pioneered on Morjim beach in late 1990s, followed by Galgibaga, though the entire coast was open to the flippered visitors before tourism activities pushed them to isolated spaces. Around 30 to 40 nests are laid during the season, unlike the Odisha coast where mass nesting in thousands takes place. Forest staff keep vigil over the nests round-the-clock to protect them from stray dogs and poachers. Bright lights, noisy music and other tourism activities affect nesting activity. On the two beaches in the north, a total of 24 nests were laid and more than 1,700 hatchlings were released into the sea. “Last season was one of the most productive one in recent years,” a source said. Meanwhile the nesting season in Galgibaga and Agonda seems to have been delayed a bit. Nesting season in the past used to start in October though in the recent years, it has shifted to December-January and ends in March-April. This change in the start of the nesting season is attributed to climate change, RFO (wildlife) Anant Velip said, adding that the incubation period takes between 48 to 52 days. The first Olive Ridley turtle nesting was witnessed last year on December 23 with the forest department officials protecting eggs at Galgibaga beach but it was just a fortnight later that Agonda beach also witnessed the first Olive Ridley turtle nesting. A total of 22 Olive Ridleys visited the twin turtle nesting beaches of Agonda and Galgibaga last year laying a total of 2,278 eggs. The Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) in the first week of November ordered the removal of a temporary swimming pool on Agonda beach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/seasons-first-flippered-visitor-lays-eggs-at-morjim/articleshow/88462179.cms||---

It is very likely that the no-objection certificate (NOC) for starting Metro services for Kanpur would be handed over to the Uttar Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation (UPMRC) in the next two days. It is only after the NOC from CMRS that the Metro services could be launched commercially. It is due to this reason that this inspection that began on Monday was very crucial.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Trivandrum airport grossed Rs 726 crore as user development fee in 6 years||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Trivandrum airport grossed Rs 726 crore as user development fee in six years; however the collection dropped by 82% in the last two years, according to figures presented in the Parliament in the on-going session. As per the data, between 2014-15 and 2020-21, Trivandrum airport’s revenue from user development fee (UDF) peaked from Rs 58 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 194.86 crore in 2018-19; recording over 200% growth. However, the collection then plummeted to Rs 34.02 crore by 2020-21. Trivandrum recorded an astronomical rise and fall in UDF when the revenue from UDF for Calicut airport from 2017-18 to 2020-21 never crossed 100 crore for respective fiscals. The sharp fall in revenue from UDF for Trivandrum airport in 2020-21 is mainly due to Covid restrictions when flights were cancelled. However, even otherwise the fall was expected, according to the airport users consultative committee. “The huge revenue from UDF was recorded mostly during the pre-Covid era and that period was marked by attempts to bring in more flights. By 2019, news about privatisation emerged and it was followed by the drop in passenger footfall and Covid added to the crisis. “It is never good for an airport to depend solely on user development fee as the major source of revenue. The duty free shop was also closed around 2017,” said Raghuchandran Nair, chairman, airport users consultative committee and member of advisory committee.  Trivandrum’s collection of UDF has always been seen as a major reason for its negative growth. The airport recorded a loss of Rs 100 crore in 2020-21. Between 2018-19 and 2019-20, Trivandrum’s profitability dipped by 20% and in the next fiscal, mainly owing to Covid impact, it recorded a loss of 100.31 crore. “The user development fee in Trivandrum is about Rs 550 for domestic and Rs 1,200 for international passengers which is the main cause of negative growth. “Cochin airport has no UDF. All these years, this was the revenue which kept the flag flying with claims that the Trivandrum airport is on profit,” Raghuchandran Nair added. A statement presented in Parliament earlier this year showed that the profitability of Trivandrum airport dropped by above 50% in the past three fiscals. The statement showing airport wise profitability from 2017-18 to 2019-20 showed that the profit of Trivandrum airport dipped from Rs 141.87 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 64.41 crore in 2019-20 marking a dip of 55%. “There has been a 40% shift of passengers to Kochi from Trivandrum. One of the main reasons is the lack of shopping amenities and closure of duty free shops. There has to be new revenue avenues to increase the profitability of the airport,” said Raghuchandran Nair.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/airport-grossed-rs-726cr-as-user-development-fee-in-6-yrs/articleshow/88440532.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Even the two children of Priyanka are destined to become Congress chief. In the BJP, even a chai wala and a common man can become party head.” Addressing Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttarakhand, an event organised by Times Now Navbharat, at a hotel in Dehradun on Wednesday, the CM said, “Unlike the Congress, where a family calls the shots, the BJP follows a democratic setup. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the biggest example. He scaled greater heights and is an inspiration for crores.” Taking a swipe at the Congress, he said, “Priyanka’s son Rehan and her daughter – whose name I can’t recall -- are destined to become Congress chief, which is not the case in the BJP as only hard working and dedicated party members are given an opportunity in the party.” On the controversial social media message of former CM Harish Rawat, he commented, “Crocodiles are within his party. If he does not have the freedom within his party, how will he work for the people. Congress’ insiders are not letting him go out. The party does not stand anywhere, it works as a gang, it works as a group.” In poll mode, Dhami said that it was only due to the motivation by the BJP and PM Modi that the “Congress members have taken up the path of religion. It is only for vote bank that party leaders have started showcasing themselves as religious people and started felicitating defence personnel.” On the issue of land law, he said that a decision will be taken at the right time. “We aim to win more than 60 seats in Uttarakhand in the 2022 polls,” he added. With all three prominent political outfits – Congress, BJP and AAP – staking claim to form government in the Himalayan state, a wide-ranging political debate hogged the limelight during the event. In reply to questions during the session “Khel Abhi Baaki Hai” Harish Rawat said that “15 members of my family have served in the Army and I need not learn nationalism from the BJP”. The former CM maintained that some second (younger) generation leaders of the Congress have left the party “but the day is not far away when they will return to the party fold”. Rawat did not fail to mention that some of the most important defence, including Rafale and Bofors, took place during the Congress regime. “The Congress has never disrespected any serving or retired defence personnel,” he added. Meanwhile, AAP CM face Col Ajay Kothiyal (eetd) asserted that the Aam Aadmi Party was going to come to power in Uttarakhand with full majority. “In case of a hung assembly, we are neither going to support the BJP nor the Congress.” He stated that the AAP has made a number of pre-poll promises to the people of Uttarakhand and the party will fulfill each one of those if voted to power in 2022. Delhi’s Deputy CM Manish Sisodia claimed that the BJP and the Congress had no problem “if they were given benefits, but had issues if the same were extended to the common man. People are going to forget the BJP and the Congress if the AAP is voted to power.” He further mentioned that the best use of taxpayers’ money was being done in Delhi. “Unlike other states, where the taxpayers’ money was going into the pockets of ministers, it was directly benefitting the people in Delhi,” said the Delhi deputy CM. Earlier in the day, Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal locked horns with BJP state president Madan Kaushik during a debate on “Fight Kitni Tight Hai”. While Godiyal cornered Kaushik on issues of employment, migration and three CMs, the BJP leader pointed out the failure of the opposition party to name a CM face. The event started with lamp lighting by assembly speaker Prem Chand Aggarwal. Poet and lyricist Prasoon Joshi spoke on tourism activities and promotion of Uttarakhand. Director, research foundation for society technology and ecology, Vandana Shiva, spoke on environmental concerns. Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat, Congress MLA Qazi Nizamuddin, Uttarakhand AAP incharge Dinesh Mohaniya, Congress state spokesperson Garima Dasauni, Congress spokesperson Pratima Singh and BJP leader Deepti Rawat debated various issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cong-run-by-dynasts-bjp-by-common-man-dhami/articleshow/88440540.cms||Kautilya Singh

He has no commitment to one party. He goes where he finds opportunity,” Salkar said after Carlos Almeida resigned as a MLA, quit BJP and joined Congress. “If he was loyal then he wouldn't have left the party which made him MLA twice. BJP has done a lot for him, but his leaving the party shows his true colours,” Salkar said. Almeida had said on Tuesday that he was told that he will not be given a BJP ticket to contest the forthcoming elections from Vasco and this compelled him to quit the party. Sources said that Salkar, who recently joined BJP, is being considered as a front-runner for the BJP ticket from Vasco. “Almeida's Congress jump will make no difference to BJP as it is an ocean that stands on it’s own feet. BJP requires no support to win,” the former councillor said. Asked about his take on a few MMC councillors and BJP Vasco mandal members seen with Almeida on Wednesday, Salkar said, “Those are his supporters and it is obvious that they will follow him.” He said, “Almeida says late Manohar Parrikar was a good man, then why only his constituency was left without development as Parrikar was alive till 2019 and many opposition MLAs were given opportunity to develop their constituencies. Almeida is only putting his blame on the party, but people know everything. BJP will win for sure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/inefficient-mla-has-quit-good-day-for-vasco-bjp/articleshow/88441208.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Goa: Church gears up for full-fledged Christmas Mass with SOPs||PANAJI: For the first time during the pandemic, Christmas midnight Masses will be full-fledged, and open to all faithful while following Covid protocol. Clergy are increasing the number of Masses on the feast day and holding additional services in churches and chapels on the feast day as well as putting up additional screens outside and in other available spaces in the church to accommodate as many faithful as possible. Most churches are doing away with the restrictions followed last Christmas of allotting devotees’ Masses ward-wise, permitting only two from a family and insisting on prior registration. At Se Cathedral, the mother Church of Goa’s archdiocese, archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao will celebrate midnight Mass which will be telecast live across the state. One of the largest churches in Asia, the cathedral will accommodate faithful in and around the church with special screens set up and arrangements made outside for those who don’t fit inside, parish priest Rosario Oliveira said. “Christmas services are open to all on first come, first served basis. We have roped in additional volunteers to maintain SOPs and sanitisation for the faithful. We have also kept masks ready for those who may show up for services without a mask,” he said. This year, the parish doesn’t expect foreign tourists to join in services as the influx has been low. Cultural programmes after Christmas Mass have also been curbed in wake of the pandemic. St Alex parish in Calangute has more than doubled the Masses for the faithful compared to pre-pandemic times on December 24 and 25 in the church. Services will also be held at chapels at Khobrawaddo and Saunta Vaddo with no prior bookings. It has also toned down its family day celebrations, holding Samudai-wise celebrations instead. In Paroda, midnight Masses and morning Masses in the church and chapels are open to all parishioners without restrictions, but while following all SOPs. “Right now, churches are open everywhere. I have been watching the news, and if any restrictions are brought in, we will have to announce it as soon as possible. We can only hope and pray,” parish priest Fr George Ratos said. At Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji, additional Christmas Masses will be held. “Since we cannot accommodate all our parishioners, we have made arrangements to accommodate people in our hall, lobby and outside the church where screens are being fitted,” parish priest Fr Walter de Sa stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/church-gears-up-for-full-fledged-christmas-mass-with-sops/articleshow/88461549.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt panel increases punishment for crimes against women, kids||MUMBAI: A report recommending increasing the quantum of punishments for several offences under the proposed Shakti Act by a 21-member joint select committee under the state home minister was tabled in the assembly on Wednesday. A revised bill for the laws on crimes against women will be moved in this session itself.The bill, modelled on the Disha Act in Andhra Pradesh, was first tabled in the legislature in December 2020. The government referred it to the committee, which held 13 meetings before submitting its recommendations. It has recommended increasing the quantum of punishment for acid attack cases under section 326A of IPC to at least 15 years that may extend to the remainder of a convict’s natural life, and a fine to be paid to the victim (see box). “The expenditure of plastic surgery and face reconstruction operations for the victim will be taken care of from the monetary fine to be charged on the accused,” home minister Dilip Walse Patil told the House. The panel has also increased the punishment under the ew IPC section 175A for failure to share data for probe by social media platforms, internet providers (see box). Also, under Pocso Act, the data must be within three days at the pain of penalty. Punishment will be increased for false complaints and for giving wrong information to a public servant. “The provisions under the bill are being made more stringent to punish the culprits and set deterrence. However, it is also necessary that the innocent are saved and so severe punishment is required against people filing false or wrongful complaints,” said the report. Under section 354E, which provides for punishment for any act of intimidating woman by any mode of communication and insulting her modesty, the category of offenders has been increased to cover men, women and even transgender persons. The draft bill provides for capital punishment for crimes against women and children, and as part of the revision, the police have been given 30 days to complete the probe in offences like rape and acid attack. Another 30 days can be given after specifying reasons by a special IG or police commissioner. The committee has also scrapped the provision of not giving anticipatory bail to people making wrongful or false complaints.

---||Goa||‘By invoking temples, BJP creating divide’||Panaji: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday said that chief minister Pramod Sawant and BJP are trying to create a divide between Hindus and Christians ahead of the coming state assembly polls. NCP said that BJP should focus on the basics such as the Mapusa bus stand, roads, schools and hospitals instead of trying to divide people in the name of religion. Questioning the need for Sawant to speak about rebuilding temples, NCP general secretary Sanjay Barde said that BJP is trying to polarise voters and draw attention away from BJP’s misgovernance. Sawant had said that the Goa government wants to start rebuilding temples that the Portuguese destroyed. “NCP is all for building temples, but this is not the way to go about and try and create division between Goans. If BJP wants to build temples, why not first demolish the illegal structure next to the Old Goa Church built by someone from Delhi,” said Barde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/by-invoking-temples-bjp-creating-divide/articleshow/88461590.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai:Youth gets 6 months in jail for molesting woman in BEST bus||Mumbai: Observing that at 21 a woman is mature enough to distinguish between the touch of man’s private parts and his belt, a magistrate’s court handed a 27-year-old Mahim man six months’ rigorous imprisonment for repeatedly touching her shoulder with his private parts while she was seated on a running BEST bus in Worli in 2015. The accused had claimed that the woman had mistaken his undone belt for his private parts. The court also fined Vinayak Vaiti Rs 10,000, of which Rs 7,000 is to be paid to the woman as compensation. She had slapped the accused, pulled him down from the bus with the help of her senior citizen father and handed him over to the police. The court chided the defence lawyer for suggesting the woman should have changed her seat to save herself from molestation. “In my view, it is the worst and ugly thinking that the victim should ignore the dirty and illegal act of the culprit and change her place or way for avoiding further molestation,” said the magistrate. “The accused has committed serious offence against a woman in a crowded and running public bus without fear of anybody. He did not fear and bother about the consequences of his act,” the court added. The woman said at 1.40pm on November 5, 2015, she and her father had taken a bus to their home. Vaiti was standing next to her seat and kept getting closer. She said when she confronted him, he smiled and replied that he was adjusting his belt. The woman alerted her father and subsequently the driver and conductor asked them to alight. She and her father took Vaiti to Dadar police station. When the defence questioned the lack independent witnesses, the court said nobody except the woman had seen the incident. It also pointed out that passengers in Mumbai are always in a hurry, and nobody would wait long to give statement in a case in which they had no interest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiyouth-gets-6-months-in-jail-for-molesting-woman-in-best-bus/articleshow/88442044.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Govt to set up land acquisition units||Thiruvananthapuram: The government has decided to set up land acquisition units for the doubling of the railway line from Thiruvananthapuram to Kanyakumari. The cabinet on Wednesday decided to set up two special land acquisition units headed by tahsildars for the second phase land acquisition from Nemom to Neyyattinkara and the third phase from Neyyattinkara to Parassala for doubling the tracks. The two land acquisition units will have 21 posts each in them. The Railways had asked the state to expedite and complete the land acquisition for the completion of the doubling of railway lines in the state, by March 31 next year. The deadline was given in the wake of the railway board fixing the date for completion of the doubling process by March 31, 2024. According to the government documents accessed by TOI in this regard, as much as 63 hectares of land (155.67 acres) are pending for acquisition in various stretches covering a total length of 54.3 km where doubling is to be completed, and bridges to be reconstructed. The railway board has sanctioned the necessary funds for the land acquisition, and the state government has given the administrative approval for the acquisition. The major land acquisition pending is the Thiruvananthapuram- Kanyakumari route (87 km), in which 31 km from Thiruvananthapuram to Parassala fall under the state. As much as 40 hectares (98.84 acres) falling in Thiruvananthapuram and Neyyattinkara taluks are pending for acquisition in this segment alone for the doubling and allied purposes, for which the railways have provided Rs 50 crore towards the acquisition expenses in the first phase. The Railways have asked the state to complete the acquisition process by the end of the on-going financial year itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-set-up-land-acquisition-units/articleshow/88440574.cms||---

The sarpanch was called for a meeting on Monday by the Maoists, but was subsequently abducted and killed. Cops denied that he was an informer, accusing Maoists of targetting locals to create terror. According to Mulugu district police, Korasa Ramesh was a former sarpanch of Suraveedu panchayat in Venkatapuram. On Monday evening, he had gone to Bheemaram in Chhattisgarh along with Kurusam Ramesh of Eturunagaram after receiving a phone call from Sudhakar, a Maoist from Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mahabubabad, Warangal. “At Bheemaram, Maoist militia members detained them, covered their eyes and took them to an unknown location after a six-hour trek. At 8.30 am on Tuesday, Korasa Ramesh was shifted to another location and around 10.30 am Kurusam Ramesh was left at Pusuguppa village in Cherla mandal by the Maoists,” Mulugu SP Sangram Singh Patil said. On Tuesday, the abducted man’s wife Rajitha, a contract ANM in Eturunagaram, had appealed to the Maoists to free her husband. But on Wednesday, police received alert about body of Korasa Ramesh being found on a forest road at Kothapalli village. “We are yet to receive body as incident happened in a remote area of Chhattisgarh. The cause of death is yet to be ascertained,” the SP said. In a handwritten letter released by CPI (Maoist) Wajedu-Venkatapuram area committee secretary Shanta, the Maoists said that Ramesh had been working for cops since 2019 and SI B Tirupathi had convinced him to inform on what Maoists asked him to procure. “Ramesh was paid Rs 35,000 by police to work for them. Police had even given him poison-mixed milk powder to deliver to party members. After consuming it, several of our comrades fell ill and one of them, M Bikshapathi alias Vijayender, died. Ramesh was also responsible for one encounter for which he received Rs 2 lakh from police. Ramesh has been killed for betraying the people and the Maoist party,” the letter stated. Mulugu SP Patil, countered the claims of Maoists. “To create panic in Agency areas and extort money from people, Maoists are resorting to such acts,” the SP said.  On Tuesday,Korasa Ramesh was shifted to another location and around 10.30 am Kurusam Ramesh was left at Pusuguppa village in Cherla mandal by the Maoists||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/maoists-dub-ex-sarpanch-police-informer-abduct-kill-him/articleshow/88440570.cms||---

Written by Prem Uke and directed by Harsh Yadav, the play, which had artistes from the city, depicted the journey of Amrapali from a concubine to a celibate. Her sacrifice for peace and harmony in Vaishali and significant contribution to the advancement of the Buddhist order were the highlights of the play. Raised in a modest background, Amrapali grows up to be an exceptionally beautiful and ethereal woman in Vaishali Nagar, which was notorious for the trade of young women as dancers and courtesans. Aware of her elegance, the king plots to own her by declaring her as Nagarvadhu – bride of the kingdom – forbidding her from being committed to a single man. However, the schemes of the king go wrong and Amrapali, against her will, is compelled to accept the title for the sake of her kingdom in the name of a sacrifice as her enchanting beauty becomes the reason for the commencement of the war. Later in the plot, Amrapali renounces her position as a courtesan, follows Buddhism and dedicates her life to the service of the poor and the destitute. “At the age of 70, Prem Uke has written this exceptional script based on the enlightening teachings of Gautam Buddha and has manifested them in an artistic form. Amrapali’s sacrifice as a woman for her nation and thereafter to Buddhism is inspirational,’ said Sandeep Gawai in the introductory speech. He added, “Union minister Nitin Gadkari believes the development of a modern society is incomplete without its culture. Khasdar Mahotsav has provided a grand stage to artistes from cross-sections of society.’ Among the guests were Kanchan Gadkari, former MLA Jogendra Kawade, former minister Surekha Kumbhare, Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram and NU vice-chancellor Sanjay Dudhe. Ravindra Thakre, Puranchandra Meshram, Nanaji Shamkule, Milind Mane, Sidhhhant Gaikwad, Anil Hirekhan, Sandeep Jadhav, Babasaheb Deshmukh and Dharampal Meshram were present on the dais.

---||Kolkata||Trinamool seniors leave mayor decision to West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: The new Kolkata Municipal Corporation board is likely to see at least four to five new members, mayor-in-council (MMiC)s. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is expected to announce the name of the mayor of Kolkata on Thursday in a meeting with the newly elected councillors. According to sources, while former mayor Firhad Hakim is a frontrunner for the mayor’s post, the party leadership is also considering some other proposals. Hakim himself indicated this when he said it was for the party to decide who would be Kolkata’s next mayor. According to the new one-person-one-post rationale adopted by Trinamool, if Hakim is made the Kolkata mayor, it remains to be seen whether he will have to divest his cabinet portfolio. A senior minister in the state cabinet, Hakim is also a key confidant of Banerjee. A section of the party leadership wants Hakim to be part of the state cabinet and not limit him to Kolkata. Some party leaders suggested a possible way out of this mayor-or-minister issue, advocating a woman mayor, Kolkata’s first. No senior party leader seemed willing to speak on this issue. “This is for the CM to decide. Everything else is speculation,” a leader said. Hakim had a couple of meetings with Banerjee on Tuesday over the formation of a new mayor-in-council. Change being the key word, chances were all outgoing MMiCs might not find berths in the new civic board, said a Trinamool veteran in the KMC. A party functionary said on Wednesday four-five new faces were being considered for induction in the MIC. They, according to the source, will come from a fresh youth brigade, replacing some existing veteran leaders. Those likely to be dropped were in their 70s and a couple of them were not well and could hardly attend office, said a source. This apart, out of 12 MIC portfolios or departments, one was vacant after Ratan de, the outgoing MMiC in charge of the KMC roads department, was denied a ticket. According to a KMC source, discussions were on to delink a few departments from the mayor’s office and hand them to deserving candidates. “Besides looking after mandatory departments, like assessment-collection, finance and accounts and personnel, the present board had entrusted departments, like water supply and buildings, which earlier were looked after by senior members of the MIC. Delinking these departments will create opportunities to induct more faces in the MIC,” a Trinamool senior leader said. According to sources in the KMC, the Trinamool brass have stressed effective civic governance and hence was in favour of mixing experience with dynamism when it comes to formation of the new MIC. For example, the leadership is keen on revamping the sewerage and drainage department, especially following the large-scale flooding of the city in September. “In all likelihood, the new MMiC who will be entrusted with this department will need to coordinate with KMC and KEIIP for an effective implementation of a multi-crore drainage upgrade project for areas off EM Bypass and in Behala,” said a source. Similarly, the new board needs a dynamic member who will be instrumental in mitigating water scarcity for residents of the Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt who still depend on groundwater. Improving the city’s roads will be another challenging task that needs a member in the MIC who will oversee the job 24X 7, said a senior KMC functionary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trinamool-seniors-leave-mayor-decision-to-mamata/articleshow/88440575.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Goa||Old Goa civic body revokes bungalow licence||Panaji: Old Goa panchayat on Thursday revoked the construction licence granted to the controversial structure built next to the world heritage site. With the revocation of the construction licence, the structure has become illegal, Old Goa sarpanch Janita Madkaikar told reporters. “The way town and country planning department revoked construction clearance given to the project, we have similarly revoked its construction licence. The decision was taken at Thursday’s meeting,” said Madkaikar. Another panchayat member said the structure being built on CRZ land could not have been transferred to a third party. Secondly, the permission granted was for repairs, while a structure was built at the site. Thirdly, since the town and country planning department has also withdrawn the permission granted, the structure has been rendered illegal. Last month, the town and country planning department revoked the technical clearance granted to the project, only after the protest had intensified. The protests have continued as the illegal structure had not been razed yet. The project proponent’s reply to the show cause notice issued by the Old Goa panchayat has been that it (notice issued) was vague. A panchayat member said they were not satisfied with the reply given by the project proponent, and the decision regarding demolishing the structure will be later while a site inspection has been planned. “The demolition process will start soon, but we need to follow the due process of law,” said Madkaikar. If the panchayat’s order either for demolition or revocation of the licence is challenged in court, the panchayat member said they will fight it legally till the structure is demolished. The panchayat has been under immense pressure to remove the illegal structure which appears as an eyesore close to the heritage structure, and clearly built violating various provisions of law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/old-goa-civic-body-revokes-bungalow-licence/articleshow/88461612.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Missing file probe takes three years instead of 6 weeks, finds no one culpable||MARGAO: Appalling as it is, an inquiry ordered by the state government and mandated to be completed within six weeks, took over three years for completion. The inquiry, set up in August 2018, was with regards to the case of missing files and records pertaining to illegal construction in CRZ areas in Sernabatim, Colva, from the offices of the deputy collector, Salcete, and the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA). The report was submitted to the government in October 2021. Despite the inordinate delay, the inquiry report has failed to fix direct responsibility against any government official or employee for causing disappearance of the records, though it has held the then member secretary of GCZMA “vicariously liable” while also calling into question the “unreasonable” delay by then deputy collector and sub-divisional officer, Salcete, in disposing the case in question. Giving reasons for the delay in submitting the inquiry report, Amarsen Rane, the inquiry officer in the case who is currently the Goa Human Rights Commission secretary wrote to the chief secretary that relevant documents required for conducting the inquiry were not available with the offices concerned, and the officials who were working at the relevant time from the office of the GCZMA have since been retired or demitted office. In the report’s covering letter addressed to the chief secretary, Rane that as he was engaged with day to day office duties and subsequently transferred, he “lost track of the inquiry” and hence couldn’t complete it within the stipulated time, and apologised for it. The inquiry was conducted following the Goa state Information Commission’s order in an appeal under the RTI Act. The case dates back to October 2000 when the South Goa district administration initiated action against illegal constructions in violation of CRZ norms under provisions of the Land Revenue Code and subsequent proceedings in the case by the GCZMA. Subsequently, based on the district collector’s report, the GCZMA issued a notice to the Sernabatim panchayat for demolishing the said constructions. Responding to the notice, one of the affected persons, Shilston Furtado, objected to the GCZMA notice, claiming that the structures in one of the properties were legal. Further, in order to defend his interest in the adjoining property, Nevil Furtado, an “interested party” in the case, sought certain information under the RTI Act, including report of the illegal constructions in Sernabatim from the collector’s office and panchnama/site inspection by the GCZMA of the affected structures. As the panchnama report and relevant documents “were not available in the office” as per the RTI reply, Nevil moved the first appellate authority, the GCZMA member secretary, who failed to pass an order in the matter. The state information commission, in its order in the appeal filed in the case, directed that an inquiry be held in the loss/misplacement of the records, following which the government appointed Rane as the inquiry officer in the case on August 20, 2018. The inquiry has held then GCZMA member secretary N S Varde “vicariously liable for improper maintenance” of records and proceedings of the case in question, but has failed to hold anybody culpable. “This inquiry could not ascertain as to who could be this official who had the access and custody of the said record, as there are no work allocation records available in the office of GSCZMA with respect to handling of cases of construction in violation of coastal regulation.” As regards the missing file from the office of the deputy collector, Salcete, the inquiry report states that Sanjit Rodrigues, the then deputy collector and SDO “owes an explanation as to why he didn’t dispose the said case within a reasonable time period despite being continuously posted for a period of over two years (in the post), which resulted in ample scope for missing of the said file.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/missing-file-probe-takes-3-yrs-instead-of-6-weeks-finds-no-one-culpable/articleshow/88462344.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

Congress’ legal cell in-charge Carlos Ferreira Almeida said a sale deed was registered in 2015. The property was sold in two plots by the original owner. However, a year later, when an application for reconstruction was made, it had the name of the previous owner, but it was signed by a different person. They were unable to find out who was the signatory, but it was not the previous property owner. The question that arises, Ferreira said, is when property was sold, how could be that the previous owner submits an application for reconstruction.“We have official documents in our possession that makes it clear that all applications made then seeking permissions were fraud. Once the property was old, the previous owner has no right over that property, even to seek a construction license or development permission,” he said. The signature on the application is not that of the original owner. “He told us that the signature was not his,” he said. He said they will also file a complaint with Old Goa panchayat attaching the documents to prove that there has been a fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fake-docus-submitted-for-approval-cong/articleshow/88461636.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Kadamba Transport Corporation likely to increase bus fares||PANAJI: With increase in fuel prices, the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) is looking at hiking the fares for its bus services. A proposal for it has been moved and approval from the government is awaited. “We cannot say yet that there will be a hike since the proposal has not yet been approved. The fare is being hiked owing to a rise in diesel costs,” said KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate. The KTC has already increased the fare on its electric buses citing GST as the reason, owing to which the bus fare for the Panaji to Margao shuttle service is currently Rs 50 per commuter. The fare for KTC’s diesel vehicles on the same route is Rs 45 per passenger. The Goa Green Brigade had recently written to the KTC to protest this hike and had demanded that bus fare be reduced and ensure that the prices are at par with that of the diesel vehicle rates. “The Goa government must immediately replace the entire fleet of diesel buses with e-buses in a time bound manner and on a war-footing without any delay and ensure that last mile public transport is provided to the citizens and drop the Rs 5 arbitrary and discriminatory ticketing policy,” a letter to KTC by the co-founder and coordinator of Goa Green Brigade, Avertino Miranda, read. “There is no discrimination in fare charges. The 5% GST is being recovered from the passengers only on the electric buses,” Ghate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kadamba-corp-likely-to-increase-bus-fares/articleshow/88461645.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Bareilly||Sikh farmers fume after Nitin Gadkari comments on Kheri violence||BAREILLY: Soon after Union minister Nitin Gadkari allegedly voiced support for minister of state (home) Ajay Mishra Teni by calling the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on October 3 an "accident that should not be politicised", Sikh farmer leaders called for burning his effigies across the country. A video message was released by Jasbir Virk, national president of Bhartiya Sikh Sangthan. Virk said that his organisation will file a defamation case against Gadkari as he “gave a statement against the investigation, which is being monitored by the Supreme Court.” He told TOI, “We are conducting telephonic meetings with Sikh leaders across Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. We have decided to burn the effigies of Gadkari and Teni to express our anger. We would finalise the dates of our protest by Thursday and want Gadkari to apologise for his statement.” Virk further said that his organisation plans to protest for an "indefinite period" in Kheri until its demand to sack Teni is fulfilled. "He has not been questioned even though we had named him and the special investigation team called the incident a planned conspiracy’," he said. Palwinder Singh, a Sikh leader in Kheri, added, “We are very hurt by the Union minister's statement, which we got to know about from news reports. Ruling party leaders are coming to support Teni despite knowing that he has a criminal history and that he had threatened farmers even before the incident.” An official of the local intelligence unit (LIU) in UP said, “We will speak to the Sikh leaders and try to convince them to drop the idea of burning the effigies as it may create a law and order situation across the state.” Senior superintendent of police of Shahjahanpur S Anand said, “No one has approached our department to seek permission for the protest. We will take appropriate action to ensure order in areas dominated by the Sikh population in the district.” The October 3 violence in Lakhimpur Kheri resulted in the death of eight people, including four farmers and a journalist. Teni's son Ashish Mishra is the main accused in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/sikh-farmers-fume-after-gadkari-comments-on-kheri-violence/articleshow/88439740.cms||---
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Nod for marine exports office in Bhimavaram||AMARAVATI: In what could be a dream coming true, the Centre has cleared the decks for the construction of integrated office complex for Marine Exports Promotion and Development Authority (MPEDA) at Bhimavaram of West Godavari district. The integrated complex is expected to benefit thousands of aqua farmers and exports. The regional office would also house an advanced laboratory to test the feed and also the end produce before export. AP is the biggest exporter of marine products in the country with a share over 55-60 per cent. Interestingly, more than 50 per cent of the AP’s marine produce is coming from Bhimavaram region. MPEDA had agreed to locate the regional office in Bhimavaram, the hub of marine exports in the state, almost four years ago. The proposal was cleared by the authorities at MPEDA headquarters in Kochi following an initiative taken by a senior official worked in the state. He exerted pressure on the top management to set up an exclusive regional office including an ultra-modern laboratory in Bhimavaram for the benefit of the local farmers. He worked overtime in prevailing upon the district collector and top officials in the marketing department to get the land allocated in the local agriculture market yard. The regional office would help local farmers in getting clearance for exports, and quality testing reports.  Ironically, the project did not take wings despite MPEDA being headed by a Telugu origin IAS officer KS Srinivas. The delay in sending the request for budget approval to the commerce ministry caused the delay in getting the final go-ahead from New Delhi. In a recent communication, commerce ministry directed MPEDA chairman KS Srinivas to launch the work on the integrated complex in Bhimavaram with a cost of Rs 16.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/nod-for-marine-exports-office-in-bhimavaram/articleshow/88439732.cms||Samdani MN
---||Pune||Pune: Bhimashankar temple to get new mandap||PUNE: The state public works department (PWD), in association with various heritage experts, has started the construction of a ‘Sabhamandap’ with a seating capacity of 1,000 at the Bhimashankar temple in Khed, about 110km from the city. The mandap will be made of basalt stone and lime and built with the traditional construction techniques, like that of the main temple. The existing “mandap” was constructed in 1967 and can accommodate 500 devotees. But it now has several leakages due to rainfall. Kiran Kalamdani, the architect who has designed the mandap, said that since the new construction needed to be symmetrically aligned with the centre of the ‘gabhara’ (sanctum sanctorum), space has been made available on either side allowing enough room for the crowd to pass around. “During Maha Shivaratri, when the temple gets the maximum visitors, the queuing arrangements are done with removable barricades. These can be placed in the new cloisters and it will immediately lead to the mandap. The plinth and the levels will be maintained to match the existing levels. There will be minimum obstructions,” he added. ER Patil, the executive engineer of the PWD, said, “Considering the current status of the work, it may be completed in the next two years. The total cost of the project is Rs148 crore.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bhimashankar-temple-to-get-new-mandap/articleshow/88440586.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Goa||This Christmas, people more mindful about reusing decor||PANAJI: Goa is welcoming yet another Christmas season during a pandemic. However, unlike last year, the virus and its new Omicron variant haven’t dampened the festive spirit this time. Whether it’s white or multi-coloured lights, traditional or trending decor, small or large-sized Christmas trees, people are going all out to decorate their homes. However, proprietors of some of the popular decoration stores seem to have noticed a shift in consumer purchases, with more people opting for long-lasting products that can have repeated use, instead of single-use purchases. “The trend is going upwards with people no longer interested in low quality decorations and there is a progression in terms of taste, quality and upmarket products as people choose premium quality products,” said Darlene Fernandes, proprietor, Casa J D Fernandes. Ganesh Phadte, another decor seller in the state capital, said that more people are plucking heavy streamers off his store’s shelves compared to the regular light glitter-plastic ones that have a single-use. “The whole pattern of one-time purchase is pretty much disappearing,” he said. While it is a celebratory time of the year where people are ready to burn a hole in their pockets with the spending, the mindfulness behind recyclable or reusable products has compelled proprietors to consider a sea-shift in product placement at their stories. “We have not sourced anything from China and only displayed locally sourced, good quality products,” businessman Suresh Narvekar said. Businessmen said they are witnessing a 30% decrease in sales this year due to the pandemic. In addition to this, difficulties in imports has led to an increase in costs by 35-40%. “The cost of products as a result has also gone up depending on the source of purchase. Indian-sourced products have jumped in price by 10-15% while those imported from overseas have seen a 35-40% jump,” said businessman Cornelio Fernandes. However, the wider range of pricing allows people to pick from the basic to the best. For instance, a Christmas star is available from a range of Rs 30 to Rs 2,500 per unit, while a Christmas tree can cost anywhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 20,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-christmas-people-more-mindful-about-reusing-decor/articleshow/88461656.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Goa||Goa: Parrikar was my guru, but BJP no longer the same, says Carlos Almeida||PANAJI: Two-time Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida, after quitting BJP along with seven councillors, joined Congress on Wednesday. Congress which suffered a fresh setback with the quitting of former Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco two days ago, believes Almeida will help strengthen the party in Mormugao where its presence in terms of winning constituencies so far has been nil. “I have seen BJP closely. It is no longer the party it was when Parrikar was alive and who was my guru,” said Almeida after his induction in Congress. He said he was happy to join Congress, a “secular party”, and that his decision to quit BJP was taken after discussion with his supporters. Almeida also said the people of Vasco were not happy since the port town has seen no development under BJP rule. It is however believed that his decision to leave BJP was largely due to the “loud and clear” signal by the party that he will not be given a ticket. He had also demanded that BJP give adequate number of tickets to minority candidates. A fortnight ago, Almeida’s arch rival Krishna Salkar, who had contested as an independent in the 2017 polls, joined BJP. Salkar is likely to be BJP’s candidate in Vasco. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said BJP’s “use and throw” policy is well-known and that it gave the same treatment to Almeida. Further, he said Almeida’s “goodwill” will help strengthen the party in Mormugao taluka. Despite having other offers, Almeida has chosen Congress, Kamat said. “Almeida has a clean image and a connect with the common man. I’m confident the people of Vasco will stand with him.” Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar said that besides the seven councillors, over 100 party workers and BJP functionaries have joined Congress along with Almeida and that more will follow suit. Congress will undertake a membership drive in the port town, he said. Congress vice-president Sanklap Amonkar, who lost against BJP’s sitting MLA and former minister Milind Naik by a narrow margin of a little over 100 votes in the 2017 polls, said their efforts to do well in Mormugao taluka have received a fillipwith Almeida’s joining. Congress Goa desk in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao said BJP has become a negative and destructive force and needs to be thrown out. In the 2017 assembly polls, BJP did well in Mormugao taluka winning all four constituencies while its performance in other talukas was bad. It needs to be seen if it will be able to retain the four seats in the face of recent controversies. Following allegations of sexual exploitation of a woman, last week Naik was forced to step down as minister. Earlier this week, in a sudden move, former Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha resigned from BJP and joined AAP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/parrikar-was-my-guru-but-bjp-no-longer-the-same-almeida/articleshow/88441257.cms||---

Police said that Jairam was high on alcohol and in a spurt of excitement, took out his pistol and fired. Kheri SHO Randha Singh said, “We have registered an FIR under IPC section 302 (murder) against the man and sent him to jail.” In similar past incidents of celebratory firing reported from Kheri district, a groom was killed moments before his wedding on April 30, 2018, while in 2020, a relative of the bride was killed during celebratory firing and the marriage ceremony had to be called off soon after.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/woman-killed-in-celebratory-firing-during-sons-birthday-bash/articleshow/88439765.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Diaphragm protection wall construction gathers pace||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With clear weather aiding the work, the construction of the diaphragm wall as part of the reconstruction of Shangumugham road and pathway has gained pace. The work is expected to be finished by the last week of February. The road constructions can only start once the diaphragm wall work is finished. The wall will be constructed at a depth of 8m and a width of 50 cm. The diaphragm wall is conceived as a protective cover that will guard the land from high tides. It can only be built only with the assistance of machineries, which have to be transported from Pune to the spot. Prior to the construction of the diaphragm wall, a guide wall has to be built in order to give a grip to the machineries. The guide wall construction has already begun and workers are labouring day and night to complete the project before the machineries arrive. The guide wall is the temporary platform which gives grip to the machinery. The diaphragm wall will be constructed in between the guide walls. It will be removed once the construction of the diaphragm wall is finished. As the beach soil is not tightly packed, a bentonite solution has to be used prior to the construction of the diaphragm wall. The wall will be built with concrete. Boulders will also be placed about 4m in front of the wall. A Gujarat based firm has been entrusted with the construction of a diaphragm wall. “The works of the diaphragm walls will be finished by the last week of February. The work for the temporary platform for the machinery has already started. We will start the work of the diaphragm wall when the machinery arrives. Around 45 workers will work both day and overnight on a shift basis,” a project staff explained. The agreement for the construction of a diaphragm wall was signed in August 2020; however work could begin only in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/diaphragm-protection-wall-construction-gathers-pace/articleshow/88440597.cms||---

People of Goa have made ‘sankalp’ (resolve) to send BJP home,” Kamat’s statement said. He said that the BJP government has “already broken the backbone of the people with the rise in petrol-diesel-domestic gas prices”. Kamat termed BJP’s 10-year ‘report card’ as “gross failure. He attacked the government for “grabbing power by stealing people’s mandate and disrespecting the Constitution”. “The BJP government, which was selling government jobs for lakhs of rupees, had to appoint a committee to probe the scams due to pressure from Congress. Sawant set aside the staff selection commission to sell jobs. Unemployment in Goa has reached its highest point in 60 years. While Sawant kept on promising jobs, not a single eligible youth got the job,” Kamat said. On a minister resigning following allegations of involvement in a “sex scandal”, Kamat said the government had “failed miserably in protecting women and maintaining law and order”. He said that the government had failed to take action against the deputy CM for allegedly sending pornvideos from his phone and that government failed to reveal what happened to the probe investigation into mysterious death of a teenager, whose body was found on Calangute beach in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamat-betrayals-corruption-mark-bjps-10-year-rule/articleshow/88461677.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Runner and female army officer completes 100km run in 15 hrs||Prayagraj: One of the ace long-distance runners from the city and an administrative officer of 6 UP Girls National Cadet Corps (NCC) Battalion, Major Farah Deeba has successfully completed the 100 kms long Border Ultra Hell race, in around 15 hours. Starting on December 18 from Jaisalmer and ending on December 19 at Longewala, the run tests the ultimate stamina and commitment of the runner. “I am so proud to run at the border on the occasion of 75 years of independence (Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav) as the 1971 war victory imagination made me complete this race which is not meant for the weak of the will,” says Maj Deeba on her return to the city, on Wednesday. “The race was really a ‘hell’ as the name suggests. The challenges were the lack of active medical team. Hydration at only 10 km gaps, plus the biting desert dry heat during the day and the icing cold at the night, was the biggest challenge. There were no human beings visible for lengths on road, except the runners. The night on road gave a haunting look and the terrain was full of elevations upto 30 km,” she added. The run, started from the Golden City of Jaisalmer and ended at the battlefield of Longewala, via Ramgarh and some ruined, evacuated villages. The route has almost all the likes of any famous 100 milers and 100kms. The participants are exposed to the elements of nature, face-to-face, while fighting their own demons mentally, as is the case with any ultra, philosophically speaking. This race was devoted to the martyrs and the brave soldiers who confronted the enemy the entire night Longewala is a border town in the Thar Desert in the western part of Jaisalmer district. It is very close to the border with Pakistan and is most notable as the location of the Battle of Longewala during the Indo-Pakistan war of 1971 (December 4-7). The lady army officer and mother of two, 40-year old Maj Deeba further said, “Frankly speaking, I covered 110 km approx as I missed the marking at 80 km. Some kind runner was fair enough to remind me to retreat. That was the worst feeling. As my mobile and watch too did not supported me, and my equipment failed, but my mind remained positive because of which I completed the run well before the stipulated timing of 16 hours”. “There were mixed emotions of anger, sad, curse, sorrow, but as it was my choice to choose the toughest and the ugly, so I should not repent. The thought gave me the needed boost and as people had told me that it’s not an easy race, but again ‘asaaan maanga hi kisne tha’ (who had wanted aneasy task),” said the ace runner, who had in August, this year, completed the stadium run held in Bengaluru. In that run, Maj Deeba had ran continuously for 12 hours, covering a distance of 82.91 kilometres at an average speed of 8.21 km/hr. She had also completed the run, held in March this year, in Chandigarh stadium, wherein she covered 70.62 km in 12 hours. Major Deeba has been a regular participant in several major long-distance runs of the country, including Indira Marathon, which is held in November in Sangam city. She is also one of the founding members of Prayagraj Pacers, a group of female fitness enthusiasts from the city who often undertake long-distance runs, along with routine yoga, cycling and exercises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/runner-and-female-army-officer-completes-100km-run-in-15-hrs/articleshow/88441248.cms||---

A year later, a tweet by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary referring to the city as ‘Bhagyanagar’ has sparked a fresh debate on renaming Hyderabad as Bhagyanagar. In a tweet recently, RSS functionary Sunil Ambedkar said: “The Samanvay Baithak (coordination meeting) of the chief functionaries of various organisations inspired by the RSS working in different areas of social life will be held from 5th to 7th January 2022 at Bhagyanagar, Telangana (sic).” “Going by the tweet, it is evident that there will be a key meeting in the city,” sources said. The meeting will be attended by RSS chief Mohan Bhagawat, BJP national president JP Nadda and representatives from 36 affiliated organisations of BJP and RSS. The meeting will primarily focus on developing a strategy for the upcoming assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh. Though the RSS has never publicly demanded that Hyderabad be renamed Bhagyanagar, the BJP has been talking about it in the last few years. Especially, party MLA T Raja Singh has been vocal about it. During the GHMC election campaign, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had said that if Faizabad could be renamed as Ayodhya and Allahabad as Prayagraj, why cannot Hyderabad be renamed Bhagyanagar. In fact, the BJP made its intentions abundantly clear when party state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar addressed the city as ‘Bhagyanagar’ in public meetings. Sources said that in party meetings, some leaders refer to the city as Bhagyanagar only. “The fact that the tweet is now trending shows that people are interested in changing the name of Hyderabad. Renaming cities by linking them with their culture and heritage is nothing new,” said BJP leader NV Subhash.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rss-ignites-hyd-as-bhagyanagar-debate-to-hold-key-meet-in-jan/articleshow/88440610.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

To keep the bhajan tradition alive, music teachers will be roped in to teach bhajan in temples, Sawant said. “Through the spiritual tourism circuit, buses will be arranged for tourists so that they can visit villages. We are looking to increase tourist inflow to the state, and we want them to visit our villages,” he said. The chief minister also said that the state government will assist temple committees and churches to generate revenue. BJP held a meeting with temple committees at Mapusa on Wednesday. Addressing the meeting, Sawant said that culture and dharma survived owing to religion. “Credit goes to the temples for protecting our culture. Temple committee representatives are working to protect dharma,” he said. Sawant said that construction of the Ram temple was not a poll plank, rather it was “close to our heart”, and its construction commenced after the Supreme Court order. “I mention it because whatever promises BJP had made have been fulfilled,” the chief minister said. Sawant said that through various government departments and the Union government, major development work was carried out in most of the temples and churches across the state, including beatification and construction of halls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-develop-spiritual-circuit-to-boost-tourism-cm/articleshow/88441293.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We had received a proposal to develop the riverside where there are mangroves so that tourists also come here. There will be a walkway of around 1.5km so that people can come here for their morning or evening walks. We’ve received proposals from locals who want to start boating activities because locals have to benefit from this. There will also be four fishing galleries where people can come and fish or simply come and spend their time here because it’s a god-given natural beauty,” he said. “We should not look at only beach tourism, we have to also look at inland tourism. This has been our plan so that tourists who come here can enjoy the interiors of the village. It’s something nice which will attract tourists to this place also,” Candolim sarpanch Blaize Fernandes, who was also present, said. Once completed, the area will be managed by the Candolim panchayat. The project is being undertaken by the water resources department (WRD). Officials said in 2012, they had started the restoration of the 1.5km ‘bund’ alongside the river “to avoid entry of saline water and flooding of adjoining areas” which has now been completed at a cost of around Rs 8 crore. The beautification work is now being started in the area on top of the ‘bund’ at a cost of Rs 4 crore. Entry to the walkway and fishing galleries will be ticketed, with security guards at the entrance to prohibit people drinking alcohol there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/candolims-mangroves-to-be-tourist-attraction-lobo/articleshow/88462295.cms||---

The deceased were identified as Akchansh Verma, 22, from Allahabad, and Divyansh Anand, 23, from Saharanpur. Police said that the students were on their way back from a birthday party of one of their batchmates. The speed of the car was roughly 100 kilometres per hour, they added, which was the probable cause of the accident. The vehicle was damaged to an "unrepairable extent", cops said. According to the people standing at the Saket petrol pump, a gray-coloured Honda City was coming towards the Saket crossing from the Jail Chungi road when it hit the divider. The car broke the divider and hit the wall near the petrol pump. Those who were at the spot heard the loud sound emanated by the accident. Locals living nearby rushed out of their homes after hearing the noise. “According to our information, four people were travelling in the car, among which two were declared 'brought dead' by doctors. They were Akchansh and Divyansh. The two others who got injured were Ashish Varshaneya, who has been referred to Max hospital in New Delhi because of a critical injury to his spinal cord, and Adesh Jain, an MBBS 2018 batch student from Baraut, who is under treatment at the trauma center of the Lala Lajpat Rai Medical (LLRM) College, where all four were studying,” said station house office of Civil Lines police station Ramesh Chandra. Cops said that the kin of the deceased had been informed and the bodies were sent for post-mortem. The cause of the accident is being investigated by scanning the CCTV footage from nearby establishments. Authorities of LLRM said that Akchansh was an only child. His father had expired due to Covid-19 earlier this year. “His relatives visited the medical college to take his body home. It will be handed over to the family after due formalities,” said Dr V D Pandey from LLRM, who added that Divyansh’s father is an eye surgeon who is working with the state government in Saharanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-mbbs-students-dead-2-critically-injured-after-speeding-car-rams-into-divider/articleshow/88439792.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Delhi||Delhi waits for rain as AQI stays severe||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘severe’ category for the second consecutive day on Wednesday with an air quality index (AQI) of 407. Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, a system under the Union ministry of earth sciences, said significant improvement in the air quality was likely from December 27. The city is expected to receive rain on December 27 and 28 under the influence of a western disturbance. Experts said calm wind, low mixing layer height and temperature led to accumulation of pollutants. Though no cold wave was reported in the capital on Wednesday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 4.4 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal, at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station. The night temperature was recorded at 4.2 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road. Low temperature slows down the dispersal of pollutants. Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board’s laboratory, said, “The air quality goes from ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category when the wind speed reduces close to 2m/s. In these circumstances, the local pollutants cannot disperse and accumulation increases concentration of pollutants. The only solution is to reduce emissions from all possible sources.” RK Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department, said, “The wind was almost calm but it picked up to 5-10 kmph speed during the afternoon. However, relatively stronger winds are expected from December 27.” Track the pollution level in your cityAfter the air quality had deteriorated in November, Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas had imposed some restrictions to control the pollution. However, the major restrictions like closure of thermal power plants, construction ban, entry of trucks into Delhi, closure of schools and educational institutes and closure of industries were recently lifted. According to the early warning system, the air quality is likely to remain in ‘very poor’ category till December 25 and improve thereafter. “Significant improvement may be seen from December 27 when AQI will reach in poor/moderate category.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-waits-for-rain-as-aqi-stays-severe/articleshow/88441296.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

---||Allahabad||Anticipatory bail should be used only in a special case, says Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Rejecting the second anticipatory bail application of a person, who allegedly used forged BEd mark-sheet/degree to obtain employment, the Allahabad high court has observed that “anticipatory bail being an extraordinary remedy, should be resorted to only in a special case.” Rejecting the anticipatory bail of one Hemant Kumar @ Hemant Kumar Saraswat, Justice Samit Gopal took serious note of the charges levelled against the applicant and observed, “By the act of the applicant of seeking appointment on the basis of a forged mark-sheet/ degree, one deserving candidate has lost his seat and chance of appointment and it may be a lifelong loss for many reasons like crossing the bracket of prescribed age and many other factors.” An FIR was lodged against the applicant at Manth police station, Mathura district under Section 420 (cheating) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), alleging that the applicant is a beneficiary of a forged marksheet, which he had allegedly obtained from Agra University, showing him to have qualified the BEd Examination in the academic session 2004-05. Declining the plea for anticipatory bail, the court observed, “The case prima facie indicates involvement of the applicant in the offence-in-question as he was the beneficiary by making use of the forged mark-sheet/degree. The applicant has not established any special circumstance. No reason is found to falsely implicate the present applicant.” The court also rejected the ground of parity raised by the applicant, saying, “In so far as the orders of the other persons are concerned who have been granted anticipatory bail/interim anticipatory bail, the same are not binding on this court.” Referring to the rejection of the first anticipatory bail by the high court, the court in its order dated December 21 further said, “While rejecting the first anticipatory bail application, the court was of the opinion that during investigation, even at times, the custodial interrogation may be necessary to reach the roots of the crime, the same cannot be overlooked. Therefore, looking into the gravity of the offence, nature of offence and the legal position enumerated above, this court is of the view that the anticipatory bail application has no merit and is liable to be rejected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/anticipatory-bail-extraordinary-remedyshould-be-used-only-in-a-special-case-hc/articleshow/88441254.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Seven candidates win with 90% plus vote share in Kolkata Municipal Corporation polls||KOLKATA: At least seven winning candidates, all belonging to Trinamool, managed to secure over 90% votes polled in their wards during KMC elections on Sunday. While the statistics have drawn scrutiny from experts, the confident winners said the opposition could not find either an issue or a candidate to take on Trinamool’s development agenda and the work done in the pandemic. Most of these wards are close to Bypass and port, which have a significant minority voter base. A large chunk of voters are from urban slums, who are biggest beneficiaries of the state’s welfare schemes. “This is not only a win for an individual but also a thumping rejoinder to those who practise divisive politics. Voters chose the path of development because they know chief minister Mamata Banerjee is their saviour,” said a party functionary. Jiban Saha, the influential councillor from Tangra, said the victory margin was a reflection of the work done by the party over five years. “The massive mandate is due to our work,” he said. Shams Iqbal, who won from Garden Reach, said there was no challenger. “We did all the work under Firhad Hakim’s leadership and all the government schemes were delivered. Opposition candidates had given up long before the voting day,” Iqbal said. Asutosh Das polled 93% votes in Ward 35. “ People have negated the negative politics of BJP, CPM and Congress,” said Das. Sources said at least two of them were eyeing MMiCs’ posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/seven-candidates-win-with-90-vote-share/articleshow/88440617.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

VFS honorary secretary Narava Prakasa Rao has written a letter to minister for information and broadcasting (MIB), Anurag Thakur on the issue.  Prakasa Rao said as one of the critical stakeholders in the matter, they are concerned about the lack of clarity and transparency in the process of this merger. “There is a widespread speculation in the media that the entire exercise is a precursor for future privatisation of our film archives and government properties,” said Rao.  The fact that this report has not been made publicly available despite an RTI application raises further questions about the legitimacy of the whole process. We are concerned about the inaccessibility of this report, especially in light of the recent announcement of the government of shutting down three of these units from as early as January 2022,” Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vfs-resents-merger-of-film-bodies/articleshow/88439813.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 2km Park Circus flyover final plan sent for nod||KOLKATA: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) has finalised the alignment of the proposed flyover from Park Circus to Ballygunge on Syed Amir Ali Avenue. Officials said the cost of the two-km flyover has been pegged at around Rs 350 crore. The KMDA officials said that the final detail project report (DPR) of the flyover has been prepared and submitted to the state finance department for approval. As per the proposed alignment, the two-way flyover, which will have four lanes, will take off from the area near Quest mall, close to the Park Circus crossing, and terminate near the Gariahat Road-Anil Moitra Road crossing. Earlier, it was planned that the flyover would have an arm from Maa flyover, but the officials discarded this idea later. The alignment of the proposed flyover has been tweaked a couple of times. Following the original plan, an arm was supposed to be bifurcated from Maa flyover and to terminate at Ballygunge before Gariahat crossing. The authorities had even floated a tender for the project. However, the tender was cancelled after the bridge advisory committee had come up with a revised plan, asking the authorities not to bifurcate an arm from Maa flyover but to set up an independent two-way flyover from Park Circus to Ballygunge. The bridge advisory committee had proposed that a two-way ramp should be bifurcated from the Park Circus-bound flank of the flyover to descend on Gurusaday Dutta Road. However, the plan of constructing the ramp had to be scrapped later due to space constraints. The authorities engaged a consultancy firm to finalise the alignment of the proposed flyover after the ramp plan had been discarded. “The earlier plan to bifurcate an arm from Maa flyover was not considered as it would have only benefited the motorists coming from or entering Maa flyover. The revised plan will cater to all the south and north-bound cars taking the flyover,” said a KMDA official. Going by a survey conducted earlier, once the proposed flyover comes up, about 1,500 cars are likely to use it per hour during peak time. “All the queries of the finance department on the proposed flyover have been given satisfactory answers. We are ready to float tenders once we receive the final approval,” said a KMDA official. Meanwhile, the KMDA is also waiting for an environmental clearance for the proposed EM Bypass to New Town flyover and is also working on finalising a few new flyover plans in and around the city, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2km-park-circus-flyover-final-plan-sent-for-nod/articleshow/88440628.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Goa||Tourism board’s first meet delves into masterplan, policy||Panaji: The Goa Tourism Board (GTB) held its first meeting on Thursday wherein members were given presentations on the tourism masterplan and tourism policy, a road map for further development of destination Goa. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, who is the chairperson of GTB, said the board will work towards promotion of heritage and culture of Goa, and open new avenues of tourism. The board will also work towards reducing bottlenecks in implementation of tourism projects. It will implement the tourism master plan that aims to transform Goa into an innovative and responsible tourism destination, while preserving the state’s culture, heritage and natural assets. “All decisions regarding promotion of Goa will be taken by the board. The appointment of a chief executive officer was also discussed,” Sawant told reporters post the meeting. The Goa Tourism Board has a provision to appoint a chief executive officer who shall not be a government functionary, unlike other corporations and boards. Tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar, who is the co-chairperson, said Goa Tourism Board will ensure sustainable and speedy growth of the tourism sector. “It will play an instrumental role in implementing the tourism policy and introduction of several new tourism services in the state,” Ajgaonkar said. A board member said that all three major committees, including the high-powered committee headed by the chief minister, have been dissolved and their powers now rests with the board. As provided, empowered committees were formed. The empowered committees will assist the board in its various functions, the officer said. The board, he said, also decided to appoint a legal consultant that would help drafting a legislation that is needed to implement provisions of the policy. Presently, the tourism department does not have a tourism legislation.“Whatever available is piecemeal. We have some guidelines and policies. All of it has to be consolidated and made into a single legislation,” he said. The next meeting of the board is likely to take place next year when the new government is formed. The board has to meet at least once in three months. The development of additional infrastructure to facilitate tourism business such as public conveniences, beach infrastructure, security and surveillance, roadside amenities and signages will be done through Goa Tourism Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-boards-first-meet-delves-into-masterplan-policy/articleshow/88462306.cms||---

Without media, what is the strength of Parliament? Denying media entry into Parliament is like denying people their fundamental rights,” he said. Held against the backdrop of 75 years of Independence, the seminar was also attended by former secretary general of Lok Sabha, PDT Achary. Leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, who could not attend, sent a letter conveying his support to the media fraternity demanding restoration of entry rights into Parliament. “Media is the fourth pillar of democracy. It is through the press that information about parliamentary debates reaches people... The government objects to the media giving to the opposition. With this mindset, not just media, but all pillars of democracy are under threat,” he said in the letter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/denying-media-entry-into-parl-is-like-denying-rights-says-mp/articleshow/88442323.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Two-day traffic trial at Chingrighata may start this weekend||Kolkata: Trials for a new traffic arrangement may start at Chingrighata crossing this weekend as Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) has razed the pavement on the eastern flank to make way for the movement of vehicles. Twelve metres in the middle of the road are set to be barricaded for the construction of a Metro pillar. Kolkata Police’s traffic department is likely to conduct the two-day trials before implementing the new vehicular movement this Saturday. The construction of the pier 318 was approved by IIT-Kharagpur when KMDA — keepers of the 29km EM Bypass — had asked RVNL, the implementing agency of the 32km New Garia-Airport Metro corridor, to discard the project as it will eat into space at the congested Chingrighata crossing. TOI on August 13 and 20 had reported that RVNL would temporarily demolish the pavement on the eastern side of the crossing to expand the width of the road and prevent a traffic bottleneck during the construction of the Metro pier. A senior RVNL official told TOI on Wednesday, “We have taken all the necessary preparations, razed the pavement, created road space and shifted the utilities including a 132KV CESC underground cable, water pipelines, sewerage line, street lights, traffic signals and CCTV cameras. Kolkata Police has told us that the trials through the newly carved out road will be conducted this weekend, after which 12-metre in the middle of the junction will be barricaded and we shall start the work for pier 318.” Blocking the road around the median divider will reduce the width of both the Ultadanga-bound and Science City-bound flanks. The extra 16-metre newly created space has widened the carriageway so that traffic movement on both the directions will not be hit during the 45-day construction period of the Metro pillar. Initially, the site at the busy and accident-prone Chingrighata crossing was supposed to be handed over for the Metro work before Puja. But Kolkata Police, jittery over managing traffic during the festival, waited until the foot overbridge (FOB) at Chingrighata was ready. The new FOB will allow pedestrians to cross the road from Jal Vayu Bihar on the east to Chaulpatty Road on the west. “The FOB will make it easier for cops to manage the changed traffic flow,” said a KMDA official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/two-day-traffic-trial-at-chingrighata-may-start-this-weekend/articleshow/88440645.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty

---||Hyderabad||YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case: Court rejects accused’s bail||HYDERABAD: While rejecting the bail application of Devireddy Siva Shankar Reddy, one of the accused in former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case, Kadapa special court said further investigation by the CBI was on to unravel the conspiracy. The special court said: “As further investigation with regard to conspiracy and sponsorship of execution is at an advanced stage, it is not a fit case to enlarge the petitioner on bail.” The CBI, however, said Devireddy went to the house of Vivekananda Reddy at 6.30 am on March 15. CBI further alleged: “Further investigation has revealed that Devireddy scolded circle inspector Shankaraiah to keep mum and also instructed that they have to manage to portray it as a heart attack. He also called accused Shaik Dastagiri in March 2021 to the house of Bayupu Reddy, a close friend, at Pulivendula and told him not to disclose his name and others before the CBI. It is also revealed during investigation that Devireddy is found influencing or inducing vital witnesess.”  CBI has already filed an application for cancellation of bail granted to T Gangi Reddy as he was found influencing and threatening the vital witnesses during the investigation.

---||Kolkata||For first time, women councillors hold up half the KMC sky||Kolkata: Almost half the councillors of this city—69 out of the 144 elected representatives at KMC for the next five years—will be women. Sixty-three out of the 64 women candidates fielded by Trinamool emerged victorious, making the new KMC one of the most gender-equal elected bodies. Poll pundits pointed out Trinamool’s massive mandate in Kolkata might well be a reflection of the party’s ever growing reach among women. “For many women, chief minister Mamata Banerjee is a role model. She is a woman who took on the patriarchal setup head on. As her representatives, they feel women will be approachable, more understanding and less arrogant,” said sociologist Banani Sen. But the trend is not limited to Trinamool. Both the Left winners are women: Madhuchhanda Deb and Nandita Ray. Meena Devi Purohit is one of the three BJP councillors and all the independent councillors are women, too. “All the winners have a strong area presence, an identity that is equal—and in some cases—independent of their party. Purohit is rooted to her ward much more than she is sighted at her party headquarters,” said a commentator. Trinamool seniors also pointed at the various schemes introduced by Banerjee, especially for the urban poor, and most of them were “women-centric”. Academics are, however, divided on the impact of this mandate. “Even if we discount the number of women candidates contesting due to family legacy, the numbers are encouraging. It is also a sign of gender equality in the electorate,” said political analyst Biswanath Chakraborty. But sociologist Prasanta Roy differed: “Almost all parties have a central command and a party discipline. They can come up with new ideas but how much support they will receive or the autonomy they will enjoy is doubtful.” Even Loreto College assistant professor Sayoni Chowdhury Patra, who studies women empowerment in politics, said most candidates who won had little or no experience as councillors and were either politicians’ daughters or wives. Clinical psychologist Vasundhara Goswami, elected from Ward 96, said it was time women were not seen differently from men. “Our party (Trinamool) has ensured more female candidates than the compulsory 33% figure. This shows we are equally capable. I see it as an insult to discriminate on gender basis,” said the daughter of the late RSP leader Kshiti Goswami. Trinamool minister Shashi Panja’s daughter Pooja said she idolized Banerjee. “I will try to put forward my thoughts on women empowerment,” It is a unique opportunity for us,” she said. Congress-leader-turned-TMC councillor Monalisa Banerjee said, “Women coming to the forefront and contesting from unreserved seats reflects the changing times.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/for-first-time-women-councillors-hold-up-half-the-kmc-sky/articleshow/88440660.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Winter veggie prices go through the roof, traders blame untimely rain||Kolkata: Even though winter has set in, the prices of seasonal vegetables are yet to climb down. Most of the vegetables are priced at Rs 50 per kilogram while a few have also crossed the Rs 100-mark. The price of pumpkin only remains Rs 20 per kilogram. The retail prices of the vegetables have remained static in the past 15 days. The untimely rain in early December wreaked havoc on crops, thus widening the demand-supply gap, said Kamal De, president West Bengal Farmers’ and Vendors’ Association. The supply line may improve in January, depending on the weather,” De said.  Capsicum, beans, carrots that are usually cheaper this season remain high-priced and beyond the reach of many people. “We wait for winter to buy capsicum, beans and carrots. But this year, these vegetables are priced at around Rs100 a kg, which is beyond our affordability,” said Shankar Ghosh, a postal department employee. The prices of the vegetables like okra (Rs120), pointed gourd (Rs100), bottle gourd (Rs 60 a piece) and bitter gourd (Rs 80-Rs 90) are going through the roof. These vegetables, used to be known as summer vegetables, are now produced round the year. In winter, the price of eggplant (brinjal) falls to Rs 20 a kg but this time it is hovering between Rs 60 and Rs 70. “The price of cabbage in 2019 fell to Rs 10 a kg around this time while it is Rs 30 now. The supply of tomato floods the market and sometimes its price plunges to Rs 10 a kg in winter. This time it is being sold at Rs 60-Rs 80 a kg,” said Subal Saha, a trader at Lake Market. “It seems that the winter days have come to an end when we used to have the variety of vegetables in curries and salads. Earlier the winter vegetables were affordable. I am surprised to see the price difference now. Even five years ago, these vegetables were cheaper,” said Amiyo Dasgupta, a buyer at Gariahat market. The erratic weather makes the vegetables vulnerable to pests and locusts. Most of these vegetables cannot be preserved for long, leaving farmers in the lurch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/winter-veggie-prices-go-through-the-roof-traders-blame-untimely-rain/articleshow/88440650.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

State agriculture minister Singireddy Niranjan Reddy should explain. They met Union minister on paddy procurement issue many times. The next season begins in January.

The father complained to SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary that after the accused uploaded the video of the act on social media, both the reputation and security of his daughter and the family were at stake. He told the SSP that he and his daughter had since then been running from pillar to post to get the accused arrested, but in vain. Following the complaint, the SSP ordered the station house officer (SHO) concerned to register an FIR and arrest the accused. In his complaint, the father identified both the accused and alleged that “they abducted my daughter when she was on her way to school. They took her to a hotel in Delhi road and gang-raped her on December 14. One of the accused filmed the act. They threatened my daughter with dire consequences if she disclosed the matter to anyone. She, however, gathered courage and narrated her ordeal to us.” “Following the SSP’s order, we registered an FIR under relevant sections and arrested the accused,” said Lisari Gate police SHO Uttam Singh Rathor. The SHO added that action would also be taken against the owner of the hotel for allowing the minor girl to enter the hotel. “According to the father, both the accused had molested his daughter over a year ago. They have been harassing her since then. They also forced the girl to drop her studies, but the family managed to convince her to continue with her school,” said a police officer who wished not to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/class-12th-girl-gang-raped-by-two-father-reaches-ssp-office-threatens-to-kill-self-if-action-not-taken/articleshow/88439854.cms||Ishita Mishra

Expressing strong objection to the Union minister’s comment that “the TRS delegation has no work other than meeting him,” Harish Rao hit back at Goyal stating he spoke like a politician and not as a Union minister. “Goyal has insulted and humiliated not only a high-level state delegation comprising six ministers and several MPs but also 70 lakh farmers and four crore people of Telangana. Why is BJP playing politics? Just tell us how much paddy you will procure,” Harish Rao said . The language used by Goyal was unbecoming of a central minister, he said. “Goyal has no right to humiliate our ministers and the state,” he said. “The state delegation is in Delhi to ask the Centre to clarify if it would procure the entire paddy during the current kharif season or not. Earlier, the Union government had fixed the target of procuring 40 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from Telangana and the state has already procured 50 lakh metric tonnes from farmers and another 20-30 lakh metric tonnes is lying in the market,” he said.

The EGI also said that “grand conspiracy theories have been cooked up to show how independent journalism that exposes communal violence and the rise of Hindu majoritarianism is an attempt by the enemies of the state to undermine a democratically elected government”. The report says that a three-member fact-finding team of the EGI was deployed to Tripura after reports of the government using draconian laws to deter journalists and civil society activists from reporting on the communal violence. While the EGI clarified that its team, comprising independent journalist Bharat Bhushan, Guild general secretary Sanjay Kapoor, and Editor of Imphal Review of Arts and Politics Pradip Phanjoubam, was “in no position to go to the spots where the communal violence had taken place”, it did speak to local journalists to be apprised of what had happened. It also said that the team met Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb, ministers, the DGP, state government represetantives and civil society activists to assess the state of media freedom in Tripura. Basis this, it said, “The Tripura Police and the administration have displayed lack of professionalism and integrity in dealing with the communal conflict and with those reporting on the issue. This makes them complicit in the growth of muscular majoritarianism that subverts democratic institutions.” It also said the result of this “subversion of institutions” has been visible everywhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tripura-govt-and-police-showed-lack-of-integrity-editors-guild/articleshow/88442326.cms||---

Rest of the people have come and gone and only made tall claims,” Patel, who is also the university's chancellor, said. “This government has built a sports stadium and done so much for Meerut which is known for its sports industry. It is building the Mahabharata circuit here. We had this asset for 5,000 years but the circuit is being made now,” the governor said, adding, “Jiske bhagya me likha hai wo hi kar sakte hain, or koi nahi kar sakta hai (only those who are destined to do certain things can do them, not anyone else)." Patel also hailed the PM for the Saryu canal project and said the scheme could have been completed 40 years ago if those in power had earlier made some efforts. “This scheme was proposed with Rs 100 crore 40 years ago, but no work was done. Now, PM Modi took up this project and completed it in 4.5 years,” she said. The governor and deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma gave away 53 gold medals to students from various streams.

More than 2,000 litres of adulterated petrol was also recovered. It came days after police had busted a racket involving a 12-member gang who used to steal fuel from pipelines in Saharanpur. On Wednesday, SSP Akash Singh Tomar said, "We are working in coordination with the local supply department to ensure that such illegal activities don't happen here again. After a tip-off, police raided vacant premises and arrested Amit Kumar, Sunil Kumar and Situ Kumar. Further investigation is on." The stolen fuel, petrol and diesel, used to be sold through unlicenced 'petrol pumps' in Muzaffarnagar and Saharanpur. The 12-member gang had earlier stolen at least a lakh litres of diesel and petrol in the past two years in 16 incidents in western UP and Uttarakhand. Following investigation, involvement of DSO, BK Shukla, was established. He was then arrested and sent to jail. Meanwhile, in Bijnor, seven people, including petrol pump owners, were booked. The supply department on Tuesday launched a crackdown and found their involvement in adulterated petrol and diesel in the district. The DSO has now registered a case against nine people under relevant sections of the IPC. The accused are still at large. Bijnor DSO Dhruv Raj Yadav said, "Several people have been booked. Their machines have been confiscated and samples of fuel were collected for testing.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Farmers step cautiously into alternate crops in Sangareddy, reap benefits||HYDERABAD: Open to an idea that had been sown into his mind, Havappa, a farmer from Chapta village in Sangareddy district, experimented by cultivating sesamum, much before the government started advising farmers not to cultivate paddy. Havappa was cautious. He chose to grow sesame in only 10 guntas of land. The yield fetched him good returns. The experiment with sesame two years ago has given Havappa the confidence to scale it up to cultivating the crop on one acre of land. The farmer is set to gain a profit of Rs 52,700 after an expenditure of Rs 4,900 is deducted. He is set to get an yield of 480 kg which will be sold at Rs 120 per kg. Havappa says agriculture officials explained to them on the benefits of alternate cropping. “Not only have we been explained well about what other than paddy can be cultivated, but have also been shown how to go about it,” Havappa said. Gandla Santosh, agriculture extension officer from Tadkal cluster, has been doing his bit by introducing the farmers to alternate crops. Not just sesamum but even garlic is an option. Santosh has been advising the farmers on alternate cropping for the last four years. When Santosh advised Vadla Anand, another farmer from Chapta, on how garlic would fetch him returns, the latter experimented. While cultivating paddy and other crops, Anand opted to garlic in two guntas (0.02 acres). There was an yield of 120 kg. The cost per kg was Rs 65 and after it was sold, he earned Rs 7,800. When the investment of Rs 1,850 was deducted, his profit stood at Rs 5,950. The experiment proved to be a success. Now, the plan is to cultivate garlic in one acre of land and the yield is expected to be 20 quintals. Two other farmers have joined him in growing garlic now. “At least 20 farmers who have seen the success stories of these farmers are now opting for alternate crops and shifting from paddy,” Santosh explained. The officer says it’s not an easy task to convince the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/farmers-step-cautiously-into-alternatecrops-in-sangareddy-reap-benefits/articleshow/88440679.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

But they will not be able to enjoy the holidays. They will have to utilise the break to complete projects, update practical files and start with second semester syllabus. For over three months, the focus was on MCQ pattern test for the first half of the board exams. Now, a new phase started with subjective learning and analytical answering for the second half. Teachers have already given reading and writing assignments to students before they get on with the remaining syllabus. CISCE schools have asked candidates to study the new question pattern uploaded on the Council website on Tuesday. The second half of the board exams are likely to be held in March-April. Since January will be spent doing lab practice and practicals, schools are worried about the short time span to finish the syllabus for second semester/term. Moreover, students will have to write the exam instead of marking answers. “Our students have been instructed by teachers about deadlines for submitting their projects and practical files. These will have to be done during the vacation. This is a different situation and requires a lot of adjustments,” said John Stephen, acting principal of La Martiniere for Boys School. Most have called off their vacation plans. “Project and practical files are one half of the huge mass of work staring at us. We will have intense practical lab work the moment school re-opens. We are under a lot of stress,” said Sam J Anandh, ISC candidate. “On one hand we have our exam preparations and on the other, rigorous process of college applications abroad. There’s no time to relax,” said Aditya Lahiri, also an ISC candidate. DPS Ruby Park principal, Joyoti Chaudhuri feels there cannot be an automatic switchover from MCQ to subjective learning and writing. “Apart from projects and practical work, they will have to focus on reading and writing,” she said. “Even parents called to express their anguish over the vacation workload,” said John Bagul, principal of South City International School.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/not-a-holiday-its-a-working-vacation-this-winter-for-cbse-cisce-board-students/articleshow/88440686.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Dheeraj Kumar, 25, allegedly stole a car with the help of an accomplice, dragged a police constable with it who was trying to stop him, and injured two people in a busy market during his escapade. The incident occurred within four days of Kumar getting bail in a separate case. Police said that he is already accused in 14 different cases, with charges varying from theft to attempt to murder. Kumar and his accomplice Gaurav stole a Honda Amaze car from Greater Noida’s Pari Chowk and headed towards the Yamuna Expressway. Once Agra police came to know of the theft, they put up barricades at the Khandauli toll plaza. When the stolen car was spotted, a police constable, who was at the toll plaza tried to pull put the car key after the vehicle stopped briefly. However, Kumar swiftly rolled up the car’s glass window, turned on the ignition again, and drove through the boom barrier, dragging the constable along for a few metres. The constable's right hand was injured and he is currently being treated. Police said that the thieves sped toward Khandauli’s busy market in a hurry and hit two people on the way. One's leg was fractured while the other received minor injuries. Later, the vehicle got stuck in traffic at the market.

---||Delhi||Green corridor from IGIA to bring lungs for transplant||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Wednesday created a green corridor for smooth passage of organ transportation from IGI airport to Max hospital in Saket. According to police, at 10 am, they received a call from the head of the department of Max hospital in Saket for creating a green corridor to facilitate organ transportation (live lungs) from IGI airport terminal-3. The organ was brought on a flight from Ahmedabad at 10.30 am. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Vivek Kishore formed a team led by traffic inspector Kuldeep Singh. Additional commissioner of police (traffic) AK Singh said despite the engagement of the traffic staff, who were deployed for VVIP route and traffic regulations in peak hours, a green corridor was provided and the live lungs was successfully transported. “It was a challenging task as the timings were peak traffic hours. But keeping in view the emergency, the green corridor was provided successfully to the ambulance carrying the human organ,” Singh said. The distance of about 20 km from the airport to the hospital was covered within 16 minutes (10:40 am to 10:56 am) for transportation of live lungs. During peak hours, it usually takes 65-70 minutes to reach the destination, an officer said. Lung transplant is extremely rare and very few such cases have been performed globally. In this case, officials from Max hospital said, the recipient was a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. He was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for many years, they added. The donor, an official said, is a 44-year-old man from Ahmedabad who was declared brain dead after suffering from haemorrhage. “The transplant took nine hours. It was carried out by a team of 15 doctors led by Dr Rahul Chandola,” said a hospital spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-corridor-from-igia-to-bring-lungs-for-transplant/articleshow/88441312.cms||---
---||Jaipur||People deprived of Shahar camp gains due to official laxity||Jaipur: Despite the state government organising Shahar-2021 camps to resolve land related issues in the city; many residents are not able to procure lease deeds due to technical issues. The civic bodies are also not showing their willingness to come up with a solution and provide relief to residents. Cases have been reported where records of colonies have not been found by the municipal corporation and people who have applied for lease deeds are returning disappointed. Ajay Singh, resident of Arjunpuri Zone-5 said, “Our colony was approved by the JDA in 2013 in the previous Prashasan Sheharo ke Sang camps. I have applied to procure the lease deed of the house at JMC-Greater area. However, the civic body replied saying my house record was not there with corporation. The corporation has lost the colony record and residents are suffering,” he said. Recently BJP’s former cabinet minister and present MLA Kalicharan Saraf from Malviya Nagar had written to CM Ashok Gehlot for regularisation of Jaipur’s Lal Kothi and 13 colonies adjoining the area. The regularization of these colonies has been stuck for 40 years and more than 650 house owners are suffering. However, Saraf claimed his plea was not heard and the process had not moved an inch forward. “Request was made to regularise these colonies during the campaign. But, officials are not interested to resolve the issue and provide benefit to the public,” added Saraf. Till date, the process of regularisation of Lalkothi in Jaipur and its adjoining Krishna Nagar I, Krishna Nagar II, Friends Colony, Indrapuri, Greater Kailash, Kailash Vihar, Everest Colony, Satya Vihar, Raghu Vihar, Laxmi Colony, Saraswati Colony, Salt Colony and Dev Colony has not even started. The fate of nearly 900 plot owners living in Jadon Nagar (A) and Madhav Nagar developed on the prime location behind Durgapura railway station hangs in balance. Residents continue to run from pillar to post as the Jaipur Development Authority is in no mood to issue lease deeds. These colonies are more than 35 years old and thousands of residents living and civic bodies have developed roads, streetlights and other facilities using their funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-deprived-of-shahar-camp-gains-due-to-official-laxity/articleshow/88441302.cms||---
---||Delhi||37,000 Covid beds at disposal to tackle spike in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With cases of the Omicron variant growing, Delhi government has chalked out a plan to increase the number of beds for treating infected patients from around 9,000 now to 37,000, if required. Currently, only 2.3% of the ward beds and 1.4% of ICU beds reserved for treatment of Covid-19 patients are occupied. Delhi government has earmarked 19,225 beds, which includes Covid-19 beds in 15 of its own hospitals, apart from six hospitals of the municipal corporations and eight Covid Care Centres. Apart from these, 3,775 beds in central government hospitals and 14,000 beds in private hospitals will be used for treatment of Covid-19 patients. As a result, 37,000 beds will be available, if needed. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had chaired a meeting with the authorities concerned on November 30 to review preparedness amid the growing concerns about the Omicron variant and its probable threat. Delhi government had said in a statement that plans had been carved for health services — beds, oxygen, medicines and vaccines — to reach each ward and every city resident. The government has assessed that 30,000 Covid beds are ready in Delhi, with 100 beds per ward to be arranged as and when required on a two-week notice, taking the total bed capacity to over 64,000. Additionally, 6,800 ICU beds will also be ready soon. The largest number of Covid beds would be at Lok Nayak Hospital, which is also the biggest facility for treatment of such patients in the NCR. The hospital and a nearby Covid centre attached to it would have 2,200 beds, apart from 900 ICU beds. GTB Hospital in east Delhi would have 1,800 Covid beds, the second highest in the city, apart from 900 ICU beds. Apart from hospitals, beds would also be arranged in Covid Care Centres. The centre at the Yamuna Sports Complex would have 5,000 ward beds and 200 ICU beds. The Commonwealth Games Village centre, which is already partially operational, would have 1,040 Covid beds and the Sant Nirankari Burari centre would have 1,000 beds. Both centres would also have 500 ICU beds each. While the number of ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 patients is less than 3,000 at present, they would be increased to 10,594, if required. Out of these, 5,150 ICU beds are in hospitals of Delhi government, municipal corporations and Covid Care Centres. In all, 4,253 ICU beds would be made available in private hospitals and 1,191 ICU beds in central government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/37k-covid-beds-at-disposal-to-tackle-spike/articleshow/88441298.cms||Sidharatha Roy

According to a communication received from NGT, senior officials from the Kerala state pollution control board (KSPCB), state environment impact assessment authority, legal counsels from advocate general’s office, state officials and officials from the district have been called for the meeting. “Despite the best efforts by us and several other departments, solid waste management has become a major challenge. It is not just in Ernakulam, we are seeing issues in several other districts. But it is huge here and we also want to chalk out a solution and will be going to Chennai for the discussions,” said KSPCB chairman Pradeep Kumar. “All local bodies, Kochi corporation, district collector, chief secretary, environment and local self-government secretaries have been asked to file their progress report on or before January 24 when the court will hear the case. Their reports will be on implementation of solid waste management rules and its success to avoid any coercive orders to be passed by this tribunal for non-implementation of the same since even after a long time, no improvement has been shown in this regard, since 2012 onwards,” the NGT bench said. The PCB has been asked to give a bird’s eye view as to how the waste management rules are being implemented across the state.  “Government has taken no effective steps to implement the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016,” the green tribunal said. The chief secretary had submitted that a task force of corporation, police, PCB and health department would conduct inspections and catch vehicles transporting waste in an illegal manner and dumping septage waste at Brahmapuram. The state has directed the Kochi corporation secretary to take urgent action to complete the annual maintenance of the faecal sludge treatment plant (FSTP) at Brahmapuram. The green bench said that a report submitted by the chairman of the Kerala state level monitoring committee had exposed the pathetic condition of implementation of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 in Ernakulam district, especially Kochi corporation. He had also filed photographs which showed that no biomining work has been started and there is no improvement as far as Brahmapuram dump yard is concerned. The report also stated that they have not even obtained necessary authorization from the PCB since 2016 for carrying out their activities at the waste disposal facility. The PCB counsel had submitted that though Kochi corporation has filed an application for authorization, they cannot process the same, since they have not complied with the directives issued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ngt-calls-state-officials-for-discussions-on-waste-mgmt/articleshow/88440693.cms||Sudha Nambudiri
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Road being widened to translocate 70-year-old tree||HYDERABAD: To save the 70-year-old banyan tree and translocate it, a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of road is being widened to facilitate its transportation. The 12 feet road is being expanded to at least 18 ft so that a huge crane carrying the 50-60 feet tall tree with a girth of at least 15 feet can be taken to the place where it can be translocated from Suddala village in Konaraopet mandal in Rajanna Sircilla district. Rajya Sabha MP J Santhosh Kumar has taken up the responsibility of getting the translocation of the tree done and his office is coordinating with Prakruti Prakash, a tree lover, who revived the banyan tree after it got uprooted and had almost dried up. A team of ‘Vata Foundation’ is using its expertise in preparing for the translocation of the tree. The non-profit organisation works towards saving the tiger and its jungles and urban bio-diversity by translocating fully grown trees and distributing bio-diverse saplings. Although 32-year-old Prakash had intended that the tree be translocated in a government school in the village, a survey taken up in the village has shown that the huge crane with the 70-year-old banyan tree will not be able to wind itself through the small lanes in the village. Manoeuvring the huge vehicle at the curves and bends will also not be possible. For this reason, it has now been proposed to get the translocation of the tree done on the Rajanna Sircilla district collectorate premises which is only a few kilometre away from the village. “The translocation has to be done scientifically done. A team from the Vata Foundation has been working on the uprooted tree to be able to lift it and facilitate its transportation. In so far as funds are concerned, they are being provided by Santosh Kumar who responded positively when he got to know about the fallen tree,” tree lover Prakruti Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-being-widened-to-translocate-70-yr-old-tree/articleshow/88440696.cms||Ch Sushil Rao
---||Kolkata||Avoid dark clothes if riding a bike at night: Kolkata police||KOLKATA: According to an analysis done by the Fatal Squad of Kolkata traffic police, at least six deaths of bikers — especially those on roads that witness heavy truck movements — happened due to victims wearing dark clothes at night that are not visible from a distance. Especially during winters when most bikers wear dark colour jackets. The traffic police, led by the southwest traffic guard that handles the Port and Budge Budge bound trucks, are now holding workshops and asking the two-wheeler riders to wear clothes and jackets that are bright in colour and visible from a distance. The first such workshop was conducted close to the Taratala crossing on Wednesday evening where cops used real time CCTV footage and photographs to drive home their point. Lalbazar stated that other guards too will meet bikers in this regard. The cops used the Kolkata Traffic Police Facebook page to spread their message about the need to wear bright coloured clothes and even use fluorescent lights on helmets. “While analysing the causes of motorcycle or scooter accidents, it has been seen that in many cases accidents took place only because the riders were not properly visible to other vehicles. An awareness camp was organized on Taratala road on Tuesday late evening under the supervision of OC Prosenjit Chatterjee of southwest traffic guard to alert motorcyclists. In addition to road safety awareness, motorcyclists were specially informed about wearing brightly coloured clothes,” the cops stated on Facebook. DC (traffic) Arijit Sinha said the worskshop is essentially a result of experience of cops and drivers on the road. “Black or dark coloured jackets are preferred usually. Yet, as a responsible rider, I should be taking all possible measures on my side to stay safe. It is better to be safe than sorry,” said Sinha. According to police, studies found that motorcyclists are 37% less likely to be involved in a crash when wearing highly-visible or fluorescent clothing. “Most importantly, be sure that your motorcycle gear has retro-reflective panels that will glow when hit with light from your headlights, and that will be the main distinguishable feature on you while riding,” the cops told bikers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-avoid-dark-clothes-if-riding-a-bike-at-night/articleshow/88440706.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Telangana state government has written to the National Commission for Backward Classes, New Delhi to include these castes and sub-castes in the central government’s OBC list so that they get quota benefits in education and employment in the central government sector. NCBC has started a three-day hearing asking the leaders, representatives and welfare associations of the 38 castes and sub-castes from Hindu and Muslim communities among others to present their case to the commission on what grounds they qualify to be included in OBC reservation list. Representatives of various castes rushed to Delhi on Wednesday to present their cases. DV Krishna Rao, president, Sistakaranam welfare association, Hyderabad who attended the hearing told TOI over phone that they submitted the details of socio-educational-economic conditions of Sistakaranam caste to the commission. “Our people used to maintain land records under the patwari system. That system was abolished few decades ago. We don’t even have traditional occupations,” he said. Leaders and representatives of various castes reached Delhi seeking inclusion of their communities in the central OBC list. The hearing by NCBC will be held on Thursday and Friday too. NCBC will submit its detailed report to the union social justice and empowerment ministry to take a final call on inclusion and deletion of castes from the central OBC list.

This feeling is for a four-wheeler he made using spare parts and which has now attracted the attention of Anand Mahindra, the chairman of the Mahindra group. A resident of Devrashtre village in Sangli district, around 200 km south of Pune, Lohar makes a living through his welding shop. He has a passion to make products out of spare parts. He has now made a small four-wheeler using parts usually discarded — such as the engine of a two-wheeler, tyres of an autorickshaw and the iconic front panel of a Mahindra jeep. A video of his home-made vehicle caught the attention of Anand Mahindra. Mahindra, in his tweet, wrote, “Local authorities will sooner or later stop him from plying the vehicle since it flouts regulations. I’ll personally offer him a Bolero in exchange. His creation can be displayed at Mahindra ResearchValley to inspire us, since ‘resourcefulness’ means doing more with less resources.” The 45-year-old, however, doesn’t want to part with his creation. He has promised to make a similar model for the business leader. Lohar has got a call from the Sangli branch of Mahindra and Mahindra to see his vehicle on Thursday. “Somebody told me that Anand Mahindra is ready to give me a Bolero in exchange of the vehicle I made. I will make a similar vehicle for him, but will not give this one. It is a toy for me, made by me. Does any child give away his toy to anyone?” he told TOI. Lohar was born in the family of ironsmiths in the perennially-drought prone Devrashtre village. He said that he joined the family work very early and hardly went to school. The humble background and lack of formal education never held him back from trying new things. “A few years ago, he tried his hands at making a wind mill to produce electricity for his house. For the past two years, he was gathering, assembling parts to make a four-wheeler for himself. After several corrections and improvisations, he was able to make a vehicle which works,” said Atul Jadhav, a resident of Devrashtre who has known Lohar for several years for now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/sangli-man-makes-own-vehicle-impresses-anand-mahindra/articleshow/88439940.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The case was registered on Tuesday against the then project officer of the district urban development agency (DUDA) Anupam Garg at Matsena police station. According to the FIR, the officer had transferred Rs 1.92 crore into the bank accounts of 221 ineligible applicants under the PM housing scheme in 2019. The then district magistrate (DM) Selva Kumari J had sent a probe report to the state government in the entire matter. The incumbent project officer of DUDA, Subhashveer Singh Rajput said, “The state government had sent a letter concerning the malpractices in the PM housing scheme on December 15. Following the orders, a police complaint was filed against the then project officer Anupam Garg for approving the benefit under the scheme to the ineligible applicants in 2019.” Matsena police station house officer Anjesh Kumar said, “On basis of the complaint received from the incumbent project officer of DUDA, an FIR has been registered against the former project officer under the IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonesty). Documents concerning the case have been sought from the department. The matter is being investigated in detail.” In the last two years, Firozabad district administration has recovered over Rs 1 crore from the majority of the 221 "ineligible beneficiaries". Process of recovery in 69 cases is still pending. According to the sources, 35 beneficiaries are "missing", and revenue department teams have been unable to find them so far. Under the PM housing scheme, central and state governments together provide monetary assistance of Rs 2.5 lakh to the people of low-income groups living in urban areas. The sum provided in three installments is meant for construction of a house on a piece of land owned by the applicant. The first installment provided to the applicant is of Rs 50,000, second installment of Rs 1.50 lakh and third installment of Rs 50,000. After the initial probe and report sent by the district administration, the accused project officer Anupam Garg was transferred to Hathras on the same post. Earlier this month, he was attached to the state cooperative bank. According to the police, the officer will be called for questioning soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rs-1-92cr-scam-in-pm-housing-scheme-fir-registered/articleshow/88438373.cms||Deepak Lavania

ULCSS has submitted the tender nearly two months ago but the decision on its approval was pending since then. The Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (KIIDC) floated the tender for the reformation of damaged sunken seawall using tetrapods by the end of October. In the first phase of the project, the construction of seawall will be held at a length of around 7km in between CP stones 986 and CP 1026 at a cost of Rs 254 crore under KIIFB funding. ULCSS was the only eligible bidder for the multi-crore project as Thrissur District Labour Contract Co- Operative Society (TDLCCS) got disqualified for not meeting the eligibility criteria. Earlier there were reports that the estimated cost proposed by ULCCS in its bid was 13%, around Rs 30 crore, higher than the tender estimate of Rs 254.2 crore announced by KIIDC. However, as per the cabinet-approved tender, the project cost is Rs 256.89 crore. The residents have been complaining that the delay in awarding the contract would delay the works, which is schedule to be completed before the monsoons. They said that if the seawall is not constructed at least in those places which are most vulnerable to sea erosion before the monsoon, the sea will wreak havoc along the coast. With the tender having approved the works are expected to begin soon. “We hope the government will start the works on the project at the earliest. We want the works to be completed before the monsoons as sea erosion will be severe by then,” said Care Chellanam coordinator Jinson Veluthamannungal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chellanam-tetrapod-seawall-project-gets-cabinet-nod/articleshow/88440704.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||MNS expels 4 party leaders in Aurangabad||Aurangabad: The recent visit of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party chief Raj Thackeray has opened pandora’s box for the local MNS unit. After Thackeray sacked the Aurangabad district MNS president Suhas Dashrathe, taking many by surprise, and reorganized the delegation of powers, the newly appointed office-bearers expelled four party leaders on Wednesday. Sandeep Kulkarni, Chetan Sharma, Ramesh Puri and Deepak Pawar are the four-party functionaries who have faced ‘disciplinary action’ in the form of expulsion. Notably, some of these leaders were associated with MNS since its genesis in 2006. As the cracks are wide open within the local unit of MNS, the infighting and bickering could prove costly for the MNS ahead of preparations for the elections. Dashrathe, who left Shiv Sena two years back to join MNS, has been accused of ‘autocratic’ behaviour. Taking note of such complaints, the MNS chief asked him to step down. A local MNS leader, preferring anonymity, said, “Many loyal party workers are either made to quit or sidelined completely. We will appraise the party chief about the unrest before deciding our future strategy,” said. When contacted, MNS state spokesperson Prakash Mahajan said, “After Dashrathe was asked to step down, a few leaders were found making defamatory comments against the party over the social media. We have zero tolerance for such gross indiscipline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/mns-expels-4-party-leaders-in-aurangabad/articleshow/88439102.cms||---

He lives in Gadia Lohar Basti in Azadpur with his family of six. On December 13, the Public Works Department pasted a notice in his basti asking illegal occupants to vacate the encroached spaces on GT Karnal Road by December 21, failing which the agency would itself remove all encroachments. It warned that PWD would not be responsible for any damages incurred in the process. “I have four children. The youngest is one month old and the eldest is 10 years old,” pleaded Rajesh, whose family is among the 33 facing eviction from the plot. “My family has lived here for nearly 40 years and I have nowhere else to go. It is very cold and if I don’t get help, I will be forced to make my children sleep out in the open in this cold weather. My income is not even enough to meet our daily expenses.” Taking suo motu cognisance of PWD’s eviction drive in the Gadia Lohar community, the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) advised the construction agency on Wednesday to stay the campaign “given that forced evictions will have a direct implication on children’s health and well-being.” The commission also sought an action-taken report from PWD in this regard. “The state is bound to fulfil its constitutional obligation towards all children, especially in the need of care and protection. The commission has little hesitation in noting that this eviction drive is when there is imminent threat of Omicron spread and dropping temperature in the winters,” observed DCPCR in its letter to PWD. Housing Land Rights Network (HLRN), a charitable trust working on housing and land rights, has filed a plea in Delhi High Court for an immediate stay on the eviction drive. The court has listed the matter for hearing on Thursday. Ashok Pandey, campaign coordinator, HLRN, said, “Gadia Lohar Basti has been on GT Karnal Road for more than 40 years. The people earn their living as blacksmiths. PWD has given them notice to vacate the place without any survey and proper arrangements for rehabilitation. Considering the winter season and the threat of a new variant of Covid, this notice is unethical, immoral and illegal. This notice should be withdrawn immediately.” TOI did not get a response from the Delhi government when asked about the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-just-cold-33-families-on-gt-road-also-battle-eviction-scare/articleshow/88441318.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Police said the accident was so severe that all the three occupants — Asha Devi, her daughter Hema and their neighbour Lalit (32) at the wheel — on their way home to Kanpur from Jaipur died on the spot. According to locals, the speeding car crashed into the truck as the car driver could not see the parked truck due to a drop in the visibility owing to fog and failed to apply the brakes. The front half of the car was badly smashed. Police said the truck driver managed to flee the scene after the accident. Deputy superintendent of police Kamlesh Kumar said, “The accident occurred as the car driver could not see the truck parked near the divider of the highway. By the time police reached the spot, the truck driver had fled. The bodies were sent for postmortem. An FIR will be registered after we receive a complaint from the victims’ families. We are, however, trying to arrest the truck driver.” Meanwhile, a video of district hospital staff dragging the victims’ bodies on a broken stretcher to the postmortem house went viral on social media. Chief medical officer DK Premi said, “We have taken cognisance of the video. The matter will be investigated.” Moderate fog resulted in low visibility in the Agra region on Wednesday morning. Traffic movement on highways and major roads remained affected, while at least five trains got delayed. With heavy snowfall in the Himalayan region, cold winds have intensified and the mercury level in the region dropped to 7 degrees Celsius.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mother-daughter-duo-among-three-killed-as-car-crashes-into-truck-in-firozabad/articleshow/88439925.cms||Deepak Lavania

The Union minister of state for railways had said this while speaking to reporters at a party leader’s residence after visiting RSS headquarters in Nagpur in Maharashtra. He had also called on Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat. Animal husbandry minister from Greater Hyderabad Talasani Srinivas Yadav said: “It is better that Raosaheb takes care of his home state first and talk about any city or state he is connected to or knows it well. Has he lived in Hyderabad? How many times has he visited Hyderabad? It is not correct to speak as they like to derive political mileage.” “There is a BJP unit in Telangana. There are other political parties. There are a lot of other stakeholders. We know better what decisions to be taken in our state and city. There are nearly one crore people living in Greater Hyderabad. It is the people who will decide. A Union minister or a politician who actually does not belong to Hyderabad will not decide what is good for this city. There is a meaning if such a demand comes from the people,” the minister said. Telangana Congress president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy sought to ask whether the suggestion made by BJP MP was his personal opinion or his government’s stand. The BJP government should formally make its stand clear on renaming issue in Parliament. “It is not correct on the part of any leader to make comments on renaming cities without actually knowing the local aspirations. These type of leaders should be seen as political tourists, who make such comments to derive political mileage. If the BJP government at the Centre makes it stand clear in Parliament, Congress will react appropriately,” he said. Recently, RSS Akhil Bhartiya prachar pramukh Sunil Ambekar had tweeted about holding a coordination meeting of chief functionaries of various organisations inspired by the Sangh’s social service in “Bhagyanagar, Telangana”, between January 5 and 7. Queried whether BJP and its ideological mentor were planning to rename Hyderabad as Bhagyanagar, Raosaheb Danve said, “I feel foreigners who had invaded our country changed the old names (of various places) by hurting the sentiments of Hindus. In independent India, if we change their names again to respect our feelings, I feel there should be no objection in doing that”. Danve, who is a BJP MP from Jalna in Maharashtra, said they have been demanding renaming Aurangabad city in the Marathwada region as Sambhaji Nagar for a long time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-talks-bhagyanagar-but-trs-cong-leave-it-to-people/articleshow/88440710.cms||Roushan Ali

IGIB is one of the lead labs where genome sequencing is being carried out to identify the variant responsible for Covid-19 in international travellers. A senior scientist said every day 15-20 samples were being sequenced at IGIB and nearly 20% were positive for the Omicron variant. Coronavirus in India: Live updatesThe first case of Omicron was detected in Delhi on December 2 in a 37-year-old man who had returned from Tanzania. In the last 20 days, this number has gone up to 57. Three new cases of this variant, which is three times more transmissible than the Delta variant, were confirmed in the last 24 hours. Initially, the Omicron variant was limited to international travellers, but epidemiologists said the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases over the past week suggested that it may have spread in the community too. “We have 17 Omicron patients admitted in the hospital. Of them, three have no travel history,” a senior doctor at Lok Nayak Hospital told TOI. The state-run hospital is designated for isolation and treatment of Omicron cases in Delhi. Read AlsoIndia reports 7,495 new Covid-19 cases; country's Omicron tally stands at 269India has reported 7,495 new cases of Covid-19 and 434 deaths in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry bulletin on Thursday stated. India, as per the bulletin, has reported 269 cases of Omicron variant so far. The ministry also said 104 Omicron patients have so far recovered. India's activeThe capital accounts for nearly 27% of the total 213 cases reported in the country. After Delhi, Mumbai has maximum (30) cases among all metropolitan cities. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said Delhi and Mumbai both had the busiest airports where hundreds of international travellers arrived daily. That was the reason behind the high number of cases in the two cities. He added that most Omicron patients were either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. “We haven’t had to administer steroids, antiviral drugs or oxygen therapy to a single patient till date,” said Dr Kumar. Read AlsoMost Omicron cases show no symptomsThe patients of Omicron variant of Covid-19 are not drastically different from the Alpha and Delta variants the experts have seen in the first and second waves — for the start, majority of the patients that got detected with the variant are asymptomatic, and don’t need oxygen support.Data released last week by Covid Symptoms Study, which was conducted in London, showed that the top five symptoms reported for the Omicron infection were runny nose, headache, fatigue (either mild or severe), sneezing and sore throat. The study was conducted by a health science company called Zoe and King’s College, London.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tests-show-1-out-of-every-5-flyers-with-covid-infected-with-omicron/articleshow/88441311.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Youth Akali Dal (YAD) president Parambans Singh Bunty Romana contradicted Punjab Police’s claim that Majithia was on the run. He said at a presser in Chandigarh on Wednesday that the legislator, whom multiple police search parties haven’t been able to trace, was in his constituency Majitha in Amritsar district. The home ministry’s lookout circular was issued on a request by Punjab Police to the Bureau of Immigration. It will remain in force till a deletion request is submitted, officials said. The ministry has made it clear that “accountability” in executing the circular would lie with the state police and not the immigration authorities. The FIR registered on Monday by the crime branch accusing Majithia, a former minister, of knowingly permitting the use of his property for drugs smuggling, financing drugs trafficking, harbouring offenders, abetment and criminal conspiracy. He has been charged under Sections 25, 27A and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The police have constituted a three-member special investigating team comprising additional inspector general Balraj Singh and DSPs Kulwant Singh and Rajesh Kumar to probe the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/drugs-case-mha-lookout-notice-against-majithia/articleshow/88442344.cms||---

Taking cognizance of the affidavit filed by authorities of Kadayanallur panchayat union, Justice R Mahadevan said that according to records, several land parcels belonging to the Adheenam and panchayat had been encroached and buildings constructed. The judge said what the affidavit reveals could only be the tip of the iceberg and there could be a large extent of land under encroachment. Saying that the court cannot remain a mute spectator to such rampant encroachments, the judge directed the panchayat union authorities to make a request with regard to removal of encroachments made in the adheenam lands to the commissioner of HR and CE department. The commissioner shall issue appropriate instructions to the respective joint commissioners to undertake the following exercises: The joint commissioners should find out the nature of occupation or encroachment, if any, over the lands of Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam and the people in their unlawful occupation of such lands. Thereafter, the authorities shall issue notice indicating the extent of encroachment by giving a time frame for their removal on their own costs. If the encroachers fail to remove them within the given time, then appropriate action be taken according to law, said the judge while disposing of a civil revision petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/remove-encroachments-on-adheenam-lands/articleshow/88440714.cms||---

As a part of the crucial exercise, the local civic body on Wednesday signed a letter of intent with World Resources Institute, India, a research organization. The initiative of framing the Climate Action Plan, which will be ready by September 2023, is also supported by the Government of Maharashtra and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) an independent philanthropic organization, said an official release. AMC administrator Astik Kumar Pandey said the proposed Climate Action Plan for Aurangabad would have two main components. “The first is reducing greenhouse gases emissions or critical pollutants and the second is to enhance city community capacities to cope with the climate change. The Climate Action Plan will help the city to get funding to work on the climate change under various schemes of the Centre and State governments,” he said. Speaking at a virtual event, Lubaina Rangwala from WRI said a timely-planned programme was needed to prepare the city for the climate change-related risks and vulnerabilities. “The agreement with AMC will enable WRI to assist Aurangabad in gaining a better position in the Central Government’s Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework,” a release said quoting Rangwala. As a part of the initiative, the AMC would set up a dedicated climate change cell, which will be headed by a deputy commissioner level official. The cell is slated to get inaugurated by Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in January next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-civic-body-starts-charting-climate-action-plan/articleshow/88439108.cms||---

At the meeting, public health experts and representatives of the food industry called for urgent action on FOPL. Food Safety Standards Authority India (FSSAI) has already published a draft regulation for the labelling. The health minister said, “Awareness workshops on food safety measures with a special reference on the importance of FOPL in reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases are necessary.” Designated state food safety officer Dr Narottam Sharma said, “When FOPL regulations come into effect, we will go to any length to ensure that food companies abide by the standards.” Guru Bhakti Kalyan Samiti president Shuchi Sharma said, “We are consuming dangerous quantities of packaged foods. We need to work with the government and with the industry since a strong FOPL with clear ‘high in’ warning label signs as adopted by Chile, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina is in the best interest of everyone.” Dr Vijay Pathak, professor of cardiology at SMS Hospital, said early adoption of food policies such as front-of-package warning labels, marketing restrictions and taxes on junk food and sugary drinks all could help consumers to make healthier food choices. Dr Ashok Gupta, head of the department (pediatrics) of JK Lon Hospital emphasised the need of FOPL for the wellbeing of children and adolescents who are addicted to fast food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/experts-discuss-front-of-package-labelling-for-healthy-food-habits/articleshow/88441321.cms||---
---||Jaipur||UDH minister nod must for local bodies for work above Rs 5 crore||JAIPUR: Urban local bodies (ULBs) will not be able to provide technical approval of development works up to or more than Rs 5 crore. The locals bodies will have to take permission from the urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal before giving approval. An order to this effect was issued to be implemented in 213 ULBs including 10 municipal corporations. A senior official at UDH said the decision has been taken to scrutinise the utility of big projects. “The board of the municipal body first provides approval. Following this, technical approval is provided by chief engineer. It was seen that many projects were taken up which were not much of public use.” Sources claimed the move will affect the pace of development work as technical approval will not be issued even after the board gives financial and administration nod. Earlier, work orders for projects above Rs 20 lakh were bound to have approval of the (UDH) minister before they were released. Official sources in the department claimed that these decisions are taken as the assembly elections are two years away. “UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal wanted to tighten the noose on officials who initiate costly projects without the ministry’s involvement. Moreover, instructions for the government officials have come at a point when the ruling party legislators and office-bearers have repeatedly complained that the state bureaucracy was going unbridled,” a source said. Sources said after several work orders were issued, the minister expressed disappointment and questioned bureaucratic nod. “In many local bodies, officials did not bring the project to the minister’s notice. The minister termed many projects “infeasible” and claimed that local bodies do not have funds for the project at the moment to support the projects,” added a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/udh-min-nod-must-for-local-bodies-for-work-above-rs-5-cr/articleshow/88441315.cms||---
---||Madurai||Jallikattu: HC disposes of plea to streamline token system||Madurai: Madras high court on Wednesday disposed of a plea, which sought to streamline the system of providing tokens for bulls to participate in jallikattu events conducted in Madurai district. A division bench of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana and P Velmurugan said that directions have been issued earlier by this court regarding the conduct of jallikattu. The judges also took note of the fact that the government has also issued standard operating procedures to the officials of all the government departments with regard to jallikattu events. Hence, the judges said that no separate order is required in this regard and disposed of a public interest litigation filed by S Mahendran, a resident of Uchapatti village in Madurai district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that though jallikattu is conducted across the state, the jallikattu events conducted at Madurai district are very famous. He stated that jallikattu is conducted at 23 places starting with Avaniyapuram on January 14, 2022. He stated that though officials from various departments along with the organizing committees make arrangements for the jallikattu events, the tokens for bulls are issued on whims and fancies. Due to this reason several bulls are not able to take part in the events, despite getting tokens. The petitioner stated that tokens for bulls should be issued on a first come first serve basis in order to avoid such confusions. Instead of making all the bulls line up behind the vadivasal of the jallikattu arena, a group of 50 bulls per batch could be lined up by fixing steel barricades. Since no actions were taken by the authorities on the representation submitted in this regard, the petitioner moved HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/jallikattu-hc-disposes-of-plea-to-streamline-token-system/articleshow/88440723.cms||---

Earlier, on June 22, the city had recorded 134 cases of Covid-19. The cases of Covid-19 have been rising steadily in Delhi over the past three weeks and many public health specialists are linking it to the spread of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus. According to data shared by the union health ministry, since December 2, the national capital has reported 57 cases of the new variant, which is known to be highly transmissible. “The genome sequencing capacity of the country, although is doing a brilliant job, needs to be enhanced so that every travel-related case and their contacts can be immediately traced,” Dr N K Mehra, an honorary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said. He added that while it may not be possible to stop the new variant from spreading completely, preventive measures can help reduce transmission speed and, therefore, avoid a sudden burden on our healthcare infrastructure. At present, data shared by the Delhi government, shows there are 624 active cases of Covid-19 in the city. Of them, 210 are admitted in hospitals and 289 are in home isolation. City hospitals say admissions due to Covid-19 have gone up. In November-end, Lok Nayak hospital had only five Covid-19 patients admitted. Currently, this number has gone up to 64. Doctors say very few patients have severe symptoms, on the brighter side. In the last 22 days, the capital has recorded an average of 72 Covid-19 cases daily. This is the highest in the last four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-125-highest-new-cases-in-last-6-mths/articleshow/88441329.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

However, more than half of the complaints (9,300) were lodged from September to December 21 this year as the pollution levels rose in the capital. The highest complaints were related to illegal dumping of garbage. Officials said agencies have been asked to focus on the sectors, which are receiving maximum complaints. A total of 34,296 complaints on the app have been registered since it was launched in October last year. However, of these, 18,008 complaints were lodged so far this year. The official data shows that out of the total complaints, around 92% complaints have been resolved so far. As the air quality deteriorated in the city, the number of complaints, which were around 20 every day earlier this year, rose to about 70 per day for the past four months. Out of the total complaints received between January 1 and December 21, 6,236 were related to illegal dumping of garbage on roadsides or vacant land. The second highest complaints were about the presence of potholes on roads with 3,790. While 2,138 complaints were on road dust. The lowest complaints (162) till date have been on vehicular pollution. An official of the environment department said, “We had earlier identified 150 hotspots through the app on those sites that received repeated complaints. We will monitor if the number of complaints has been reduced at these hotspots or not.” Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai has been asking the public to support the government in fight against the pollution by lodging complaints on the app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/50-of-18k-complaints-on-green-app-filed-in-4-mths/articleshow/88441359.cms||---

Speaking at the launch, Calangute sarpanch Shawn Martins said the large water body, close to the Baga road, has been totally neglected for decades. “We had moved a proposal for redevelopment of the place and the work has finally been approved. The work order has also been issued,” he said, adding, “We’re building a retaining wall with a jogging track around it and other facilities for the public.” The work is being undertaken at a cost of Rs 2.7 crore and will be completed in the next six months. Martins said the water body is the biggest nullah in Calangute which drains rain water from a large part of Calangute into the Baga river. “The redevelopment will be done in a way that the water remains there for harvesting during the dry season,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/wrd-begins-redevelopment-of-nullah-at-calangute/articleshow/88462387.cms||---

The police officials are investigating how the same pattern is possible in several cases from the Marathwada region. “The possibility of the candidates being recruited through inappropriate means in the past cannot be ruled out,” an officer said. However, the authorities have clarified that neither the credibility of the candidates recruited during the particular span is being questioned, nor are they being given a clean chit. The officer said, “We have a list of candidates, who performed miserably in one exam, while in another exam held sometime later, they ended up scoring 194 and 196 out of 200.” More than one candidate from particular families and clans in Beed and surrounding districts have scored suspiciously taking the investigation team by surprise. Confirming the same, Bhagyashree Navtake, the Pune city’s deputy commissioner of police (cybercrime and economic offences wing), said, “We are working on this angle as well. Prima facie, it is suspicious how candidates who had a single-digit score in one exam are suddenly ending up in the top 10 in another exam.” Refusing to elaborate further, the officer said that the probe is at a crucial stage and divulging further details may hamper the progress of the investigation. Sources said that the arrest of Sanjay Sanap from Beed is turning out to be a major development in the probe. Sanjay Sanap, an office-bearer of BJYM, who is in police custody for the past two days has already started spilling out the beans about the alleged transactions he carried out by taking a huge amount from the candidates for getting them recruited through several examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aspirants-who-scored-miserably-in-one-exam-topped-in-another-probe/articleshow/88439137.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Petitioner C Senthil Kumar, a resident of Sivaganga, stated that he had passed Class X in 2006, obtained a driving licence in 2009 and registered in the employment exchange in 2010. Subsequently, he completed diploma in mechanical engineering and also registered the same at the employment exchange. A registration number was allotted to him so that he could check his seniority and employment status on the official website of the employment and training department. When he checked the website on September 9, he was shocked to see that an appointment was given to another person using his registration number.  Since no action was taken by the authorities on the representation he submitted, he moved HC Madurai bench seeking to cancel the appointment and provide him employment. The state submitted that the Sivaganga district employment officer was placed on compulsory retirement and the employment given to the person using petitioner’s registration number was also cancelled. Taking cognizance of the submissions, Justice B Pugalendhi sought response from the director of the employment and training department as to how such a malpractice happened, why such lenient punishment was imposed on the official and as to why a criminal case was not registered in this regard. The case was adjourned to January 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-response-on-malpractice-in-job-dept/articleshow/88440733.cms||---

He later flagged off the Sankalp Rath Yatra, which will tour all constituencies in Goa with a suggestion box to receive the people’s inputs. These suggestions will then be incorporated in the BJP’s manifesto for the upcoming 2022 state assembly polls, he said. “BJP governments in Goa, first under Manohar Parrikar and now under Pramod Sawant, have taken a leap. And we are not done yet. We want to move forward by taking people’s suggestions. We will tell people (during the Sankalp Rath Yatra) what we have done and also listen to what they want to be done,” said Nadda. Voters will be able to provide their suggestions in person as well as digitally, he said. “We will incorporate as much as possible. Goa has rich mining resources and huge tourism potential and we want to take religious tourism forward. We will take Goa to new heights under the BJP government. Our endeavor is to involve the people and to evolve their thoughts to realise your dream of the development of Goa. Your dream for Goa is our dream for Goa,” said Nadda. Nadda said that he has seen the lack of facilities in Goa before BJP governments in the state. “I have been coming to Goa from the time one had to use the ferry to cross the river. Today, we are speaking about covering distances in 20 minutes, 40 minutes and they will be shortened even further once the new Zuari bridge is ready. One should remember the dark days to be able to enjoy the good days,” said Nadda. He said that after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over, there is a change in the working culture of the government. “Before 2014, the political culture in India was to only make promises in speeches. There was votebank politics. Issues were being raised only of a particular community, trying to prove oneself champion of that community. The idea was to take votes by hook or crook,” said Nadda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/will-bring-about-the-kind-of-devpt-in-goa-that-people-want-says-nadda/articleshow/88441375.cms||---

Saini said the team brought the accused to Jaipur and arrested him. Meanwhile, the team expedited the investigation by collecting evidence, recording statements of the witness and the girl. Similarly, forensic teams were urged to speed up the process which allowed the police to swiftly move ahead in preparing their chargesheet. “The entire police station was roped in to ensure that the girl could get justice as soon as possible. The team prepared the chargesheet and submitted it to the court,” Saini said. Police said special efforts were made to track down the accused who lived at a rented accommodation in the city. Earlier in September, Jaipur police had set a record after a chargesheet was filed in the court within 18 hours after an FIR was filed in a rape case of rape of a nine-year-old girl.

---||India||TMC-Cong ‘backchannel talks’ bolstered opposition unity||NEW DELHI: Soon after the winter session of Parliament ended a day ahead of schedule on Wednesday, the 12 suspended opposition MPs called off their protest at the Gandhi statue, but not before Leader of Opposition in the House Mallikarjun Kharge joined them to wrap up the dharna by singing the National Anthem together. For the entire session, the site of the Gandhi statue was witness to opposition unity while proceedings were disrupted in both Houses. While there was talk of rift between Congress and TMC because of the latter’s expansion moves beyond Bengal, the two parties remained in tough through back channel communication to coordinate opposition moves, sources said. The six suspended Congress MPs played their role in convincing their leaders on holding the joint dharna, sources said. It was TMC, which mooted the idea of the sit-in protest at the Gandhi statue as a mark of protest and discussed it with members of Samajwadi Party, CPM, CPI, DMK and Shiv Sena, who agreed with the idea. “The plan was to think of a way to protest that would last the entire session,” O’Brien told reporters on Wednesday. The protest venue saw members from all opposition parties joining the dharna as a mark of solidarity. It was a ritual for members of different parties to take turns in bringing lunch for the suspended MPs. In fact, Kharge suggested there should be only vegetarian food at the venue in deference to Mahatma Gandhi, all others followed. “We saw the tactics of (Narendra) Modi and (Amit) Shah, when the suspensions came. It was to create disruption. They do not want Parliament to run, as that would make them accountable to people,” O’Brien said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tmc-cong-backchannel-talks-bolstered-opposition-unity/articleshow/88442363.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

---||Madurai||HC dissatisfied with CB-CID probe into custody death in 2019||Madurai: Madras high court on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction at the CB-CID investigation into the 2019 Avaniyapuram custodial death case in Madurai district. A division bench of acting chief justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that the custodial death of the youth happened on October 25, 2019. An FIR was registered but investigation was not completed even after two years. The judges observed that after going through the records, they cannot record satisfaction at the manner in which the investigation was conducted. It was not just about the delay but the lapses on the part of the investigating officer despite the case being transferred to CB-CID. The judges said they are not going to make further comments on the investigation since an assurance was given before the court that the CB-CID would complete the investigation and file the final report before December 31. The case was adjourned to January. The court took serious view of the delay in completing the investigation after the state informed that CB-CID officials collected CCTV footage of Avaniyapuram police station only this month. The victim, Balamurugan, was arrested by police as an accused in the abduction of R Parthiban, a resident of Villapuram Housing Board, for a ransom of Rs 20lakh. Balamurugan sustained injuries in police custody at Avaniyapuram police station and died at Government Rajaji Hospital. His father Muthukaruppan had filed a writ petition before HC Madurai bench in 2019 seeking probe into the custodial death, but he withdrew it by changing the counsel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dissatisfied-with-cb-cid-probe-into-custody-death-in-2019/articleshow/88440736.cms||---

The market has been in the limelight due to heavy footfall, especially on weekends. Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, said, “We have deployed 10 guards at the four entries to stop visitors without masks and to maintain social distancing. There is no denying the fact that the situation has been horrible for the past few weekends. All civil defence volunteers, policemen and New Delhi Municipal Council teams deployed during the pandemic have left.” The traders complained that the root cause for the mess was illegal hawkers. “Whenever we raise this matter, officials point out that shopkeepers also encroach upon the pavements and common areas. We are doing this to ensure that hawkers don’t sit in front of our entrances and restrict the movement of customers,” said Randhawa. A senior government official said they would engage sufficient staff in the market. They also registered complaints regarding encroachment on Wednesday. Chandni Chowk Market Association also wrote to the district administration on Wednesday about blatant violation of Covid norms in the area and demanded strict action. “Touts, illegal hawkers, rickshawpullers and the homeless are not wearing masks and spitting in the entire area. We have repeatedly sought implementation of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court orders to clear all non-hawking and non-squatting areas, but no action has been taken,” said Sanjay Bhargava of Chandni Chowk Vyapar Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sarojini-ngr-traders-to-deploy-volunteers-to-stop-violations/articleshow/88441351.cms||Vibha Sharma

During a programme at Smart Village Madar where governor Kalraj Mishra was present, the MLA was felicitated with a picture of Maharana Pratap. After receiving the picture, Gameti, instead of keeping the picture on the table, kept it on the floor near his feet. This went viral and came to the notice of many political rivals. Parties and leaders including Karni Sena and Congress have termed it as an insult of Pratap. Karni Sena has warned Gameti of dire consequences. Bhanwar Singh Salariya of Karni Sena questioned Gameti and said if he had no respect for Pratap, why did he accept the photograph. “You have no right to insult Maharana Pratap. You are a public representative and we expect you to behave like one. You will realise the gravity of the situation once Karni Sena calls an agitation against you in the state for your deeds,” said Salariya. If leaders in BJP do not have the courage to hold Maharana Pratap’s photopraph in their hands, why do they accept it, he asked. Earlier Gulab Chand Kataria and Satish Poonia too had landed into controversy for allegedly insulting Maharana Pratap during different functions. Gameti clarifying the incident said it was a human error and absolutely unintentional. As there was no space on the table, the picture was kept on the floor, he added. I have full respect for Maharana Pratap and Bhil society has always stood for and supported him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/karni-sena-warns-bjp-mla-for-insulting-maharana-pratap/articleshow/88441344.cms||---

This is part of BEST’s initiative to popularise its new mobile app ‘Chalo’ which helps commuters purchase digital tickets, besides plan a journey and live track any bus across the city. In order to further promote its app and mobile ticketing, BEST has also decided to “reserve” one out of every five buses during peak hours exclusively for those purchasing tickets online. “At starting bus points, such as outside CSMT stations, we already have separate queues for men and women. There will be an additional queue for those with digital tickets,” said Chandra, adding that it will be supervised by BEST inspectors at the bus station. He further said, “We want maximum people to switch to digital and give them priority while boarding our buses. It will save time, there will be no need for ground staff issuing tickets.” “We just hope there is no chaos while boarding a bus and queues are handled properly by bus inspectors,” said Aakash Verma, a regular commuter from CSMT to Nariman Point.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-best-announces-3rd-queue-for-only-digital-ticket-holders/articleshow/88441856.cms||Somit Sen
---||Delhi||Delhi: Father, son held for cheating investors||NEW DELHI: A father-son duo was arrested by Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for allegedly duping hundreds of investors, including senior central government officials, of crores of rupees on the pretext of investment in a housing project under the land pooling policy of Delhi Development Authority. The accused, Ashok Sharma (69) and Nitya Sharma (37), are residents of Paschim Vihar in west Delhi. Joint commissioner (EOW) Chhaya Sharma said initial investigation revealed that over 600 investors had been duped till now. The probe was started after a complaint was received from PK Gautam, deputy director (security) of Rajya Sabha, and several others against the accused and Skylark Multi-State Group Housing Society. “It was alleged that the father-son duo had misrepresented that the project was a part of DDA’s land pooling policy. They had also claimed that there was a P-2 zone in Narela where residential flats would be developed,” said Sharma. The accused allegedly managed to get Rs 19 crore invested from 600 members of the society. No land was purchased and the amount was never returned to the complainants. The investigation revealed that DDA had not issued any approval or licence to any housing project under the policy. “It was also illegal to advertise about any plot or flat in any project without registration under Real Estate Regulatory Authority Act, 2016. Bank accounts were scrutinised and it was found that the accused had withdrawn huge amounts in cash and siphoned off around Rs 9 crore,” said the joint commissioner. A team comprising ACP Virender Singh, SI Naveen Dahiya and others conducted a raid and arrested the accused. They were being interrogated about their associates. A probe regarding diversion of funds to other assets was also being conducted. The son of a former intelligence official, Ashok formed Skylark cooperative society to dupe people. He came in contact with some government officials and started luring senior officials of different ministries and departments to invest in affordable housing projects under DDA’s land pooling policy. Nitya was the society’s CEO and conspired with his father to cheat investors, police claimed. Elaborating on their targets, police said the duo mostly targeted senior government officials. Most complainants were either working or retired IRS officers and income tax commissioners. The con began years ago. The accused told investors in 2008 that they would form a society and land would be purchased within a year under DDA’s policy in Narela. Interestingly, no land pooling policy existed at the time, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/father-son-held-for-cheating-investors/articleshow/88441347.cms||---
---||Madurai||Madurai may get more international flights||MADURAI: The civil aviation ministry has agreed to start direct flights to select international destinations from Madurai. This was conveyed by civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia to MPs Su Venkatesan (Madurai) and S Manickam Tagore (Virudhunagar) who submitted a representation from seven south Tamil Nadu MPs with a clutch of demands on development of the airport. However, this has come only as a mild consolation for the MPs as the minister has turned down many of their key requests. The MPs called for making Madurai airport functional round-the-clock besides declaring it an international airport, which will bring several additional infrastructural facilities. Lack of comprehensive international connectivity at Madurai is critically retarding industrial, export, tourism and economic growth in this part of the state. The MPs also pressed for including Madurai as a ‘Point of Call’ in the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) with other countries. Scindia agreed to take steps to operate direct flights from Madurai to select countries. “He asked us for a list of preferred cities to which we suggested Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur,” Venkatesan told TOI. However, the response was negative for 24 x 7 operation, inclusion in Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) and making it an international airport. “Jyotiraditya Scindia said there is only one international airport in most North Indian states but that Tamil Nadu already has three. Hence, he said it would not be possible to make Madurai the fourth international airport in the state,” the MP said. On night operations the minister stated that only one or two flights are operated at that time and it would be an expensive affair to increase the CISF deployment. In the representation, the MPs pointed out that the Madurai–Tuticorin industrial corridor will get a substantial boost only if the region is adequately connected to many foreign destinations. The airport is also severely affected by unavailability of central industrial security force personnel at night. They alleged non-cooperation by the Airports Authority of India as the reason behind inability to operate flights from 10 pm to 6 am and declaring the airport round-the-clock operational. They claimed that this was despite the fact that the airport handled much more domestic and international passengers than certain other airports in the region. As a result, many new flights scheduled for Madurai were diverted to other airports. Noting that the Union government had declared Coimbatore, Vijayawada and Tirupathi as international airports, they said Madurai, with much higher international passenger traffic, is still a Customs airport handling international flights. The representation was also signed by Karthi P Chidambaram (Sivaganga), K Navaskani (Ramanathapuram), P Velusamy (Dindigul), Dhanush M Kumar (Tenkasi) and V Vijay Vasanth (Kanyakumari).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-may-get-more-intl-flights/articleshow/88440737.cms||---

---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: 21kg heroin worth Rs 21 crore seized in Tuticorin, 6 arrested||TUTICORIN: At least 21 kilograms of heroin worth more than Rs 21 crore was seized and six people were arrested on Tuesday night and Wednesday for smuggling and selling the drug in Tuticorin. District superintendent of police S Jayakumar told TOI that the accused claimed to have got a 30 kg package of the drug floating in the sea off Minicoy islands while fishing there. A special team is on the lookout for the key accused who is on the run in the state. The arrested are M Ansar Ali, 26, M Marimuthu, 26, and S Imran Khan, 27, of Tuticorin city and S Antony Muthu, 42, Prem Singh, 38, and S Kasali, 27, of Tharuvaikulam coastal village. They were booked under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Thoothukudi central police began the probe based on information that drugs were sold in the city. During investigation they stumbled upon Ansar Ali and his accomplices Marimuthu and Imran Khan late on Thursday evening.  The police said that 162 grams of heroin worth more than Rs 16 lakh was recovered from Imran Khan’s house. Their confession led to seizure of 21 kg of heroin from the house of mechanised boat owner Antony Muthu and arrest of his accomplices Prem and Kasali. “Close to the beginning of this year, Antony Muthu’s boat that goes for multi-day deep sea fishing stumbled upon a strange parcel floating when they were fishing close to Minicoy Islands in the Arabian Sea – about 250 nautical miles (463 kms) from mainland,” the SP said. The floating package had nearly 30 kg of heroin in packs weighing about a kilogram each. The boat owner and his accomplices left the parcel untouched for more than four months and then sold six kg for Rs 9 lakh at Rs 1.5 lakh a kg through his accomplices Prem and Kasali, who in turn sold it to the accused from Tuticorin. Antony Muthu got only Rs 40,000 for a kilogram while the rest was shared by the accomplices and middlemen. They had also distributed a portion of the drugs as samples. Police believe there could be truth in the fishermen’s statement as there have been instances of smugglers dumping drugs in the sea when enforcement and security agencies close in on them. The police got the drugs tested and confirmed it was heroin. Mobile phones and other gadgets used by the accused were also seized for the probe. A special team is on the lookout for Murugan of Anna Nagar in Tuticorin as he is suspected to be the key accused in the drug racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/heroin-worth-rs-21-cr-seized-in-tuticorin-six-arrested/articleshow/88440739.cms||---

The report card also stated that the rate of road accidents has reduced by 15%, due to the various road improvement projects taken up in the state. “Citizens of Goa have seen a drastic change in the quality of road infrastructure as reflected in the fall in road accidents. Injuries due to road accidents decreased by 45% and deaths due to road accidents decreased by 7%,” the report card states. This was possible despite the increase in vehicles on Goa’s roads from 6.2 lakh in 2008 to 14.5 lakh in 2020, the booklet released by BJP national president J P Nadda on Wednesday reads. As the tourism sector employs 35% of Goa’s population, the budgetary allocation was increased to Rs 1,004 crore for the sector in 2020-21, as against Rs 318 crore during the Congress government, the report stated. Goa currently tops the country in crime detection with a rate of 93%, Nadda said. “Have you heard of previous governments presenting a report card of what they have achieved on ground. Earlier manifestos were to be forgotten,” Nadda said. The budgetary allocation for the education sector was increased three-fold to Rs 3,000 crore from Rs 1000 crore in 2011, the report card reads. “We are not making claims, but we are putting before the people facts of what has been achieved by us,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said. Under the BJP government, the number of police personnel went from 4,670 in 2008 to 7,907 in 2020, the report card stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/101-reduction-in-crimes-claims-bjp-report-card/articleshow/88441397.cms||---

Reverent of Chandpol’s St Andrews Church Deepak Baristo said they are holding regular prayers along with praying for people who died due to Covid. “This year people are excited about the festival. We will be singing hymns and praying for the lost souls. Preparations for the celebration have begun although we have asked people not to crowd the church premises during Christmas,” said Baristo. Prayers for Covid patients and those who succumbed due to the virus were also being conducted at Rockson Memorial Cathedral in Ajmer. As the Yuletide season has already kicked in, singing of carols is picking up pace. Groups are visiting each other’s family to wish them. Veenita Peter, a member of a carol group said, “Earlier we used to go inside a house and sing, but due to the pandemic, we have created small groups and avoiding going inside houses. We are visiting homes of people who lost their loved ones to Covid and singing special prayers for them,” said Peter. Gift shop owners said that small items are popular now. “Christmas cards are completely out of market but small showpieces are popular. Christmas trees range from Rs 30 to Rs 4,000,” said Madhu Suklecha, owner of a card and gift shop at Chaura Rasta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/covid-curbs-down-city-gears-up-for-christmas/articleshow/88445299.cms||---

Both the states have identified sectors like mines, food processing, textiles and energy as common potential areas where they can drive synergy. Unlike the roadshows in Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Bangalore, no MoUs were signed in Kolkata. Rajasthan Foundation commissioner Dhiraj Srivastava said, “Kolkata has a deep connect with Rajasthan as many migrants from the state have set up strong economic base in the City of Joy.

---||Goa||This is a strange situation for FC Goa but our goals have not changed: Edu Bedia||Panaji: For three days, Edu Bedia kept wondering about the “strange situation” at FC Goa. The exit of coach Juan Ferrando on Sunday after just six games, and that too to join rivals ATK Mohun Bagan in the Indian Super League (ISL), caught everyone, including the players, by surprise. “This week was very different, but i think it has changed nothing about the team,” Edu, the Goa captain, told TOI on Thursday. “The team has the same target, which is to win the ISL. I was really upset about the situation for the last three days, but I’ve now forgotten about it. I know (new coach) Derrick (Pereira). He can help us a lot now and start a new journey.” The new journey starts against Odisha FC at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Friday. For Edu, who is now into his 15th year as a professional player, such setbacks should be easy to handle. He has the experience and the mentality, but what about the youngsters in the team, particularly those who may have been thankful to Ferrando for the starts, and possibly even improvement to their game? How do they handle this? “This is professional football and they have to learn (to handle) all situations,” said Edu, the longest-serving foreign player at any club in ISL. “This is a strange situation I know, but we are trying to forget everything and start afresh with Derrick. I saw the players in training during the last two-three sessions and they are happy. “Whatever the circumstances (within the team), we have the same target; to win games, win ISL. We know Derrick and he knows many players in our team. We will work hard. I am sure we will have opportunities (to go far).” The Spanish midfielder led Goa to a memorable showing in the AFC Champions League last season where they secured three draws against high-profile opponents. This season, with the Durand Cup in the bag, the captain has been vocal that Goa is the best team. When the league started, though, Goa were handed a reality check with Mumbai City, Jamshedpur FC and NorthEast United all handing them defeats in the first three games. “I know that the first three matches were very difficult. Maybe it was the (lack of) motivation after we won the Durand Cup, after everyone said FC Goa are one of the best teams in the league. After the third game, which we lost, we changed our mentality. “We played with more intensity, and like Derrick said, there is room for improvement (in defence). It’s not just about the line of defence, we have to defend like a team. When we lose the ball, try to recover very fast, try to win all the duels, try to fight, try to be more aggressive. If we improve in these details, this team has enough quality to win every game,” said Edu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-is-a-strange-situation-for-fc-goa-but-our-goals-have-not-changed-edu-bedia/articleshow/88461835.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Pune||Complaints galore about auto drivers overcharging||Pune: A huge number of auto rickshaw commuters in the city are complaining about the rising trend of drivers’ refusal to ply by the meter. They are also facing demands to pay anything between Rs50 and Rs60 and sometimes much more extra, as meters of less than 20% of three-wheelers in the city have been recalibrated per the new rates, which came into effect from November 22. “Last week, I had to travel from Shivajinagar to MG Road. Around seven auto drivers refused to ply by meter, saying they were yet to be updated. They were all ready to ply without the meter and asked me to pay Rs300-400 for the trip. I came across one ready to ply by meter, but even he took Rs50 extra,” said Arvind Jadhav, a working professional. Early in November, the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), headed by the Pune collector, had announced increased fares for autos plying in Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Baramati. The minimum fare for autos was to be Rs21 instead of Rs18 for the first 1.5km, and then Rs14 per km instead of earlier Rs12. The last date to recalibrate all meters to new fares is January 31. Pune’s deputy RTO Sanjiv Bhor told TOI, “There are around 1lakh autorickshaws in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad areas at the moment. Some 15,800 drivers have got their meters recalibrated and approved. RTO has come up with five special tracks in Kothrud, Ramtekdi Industrial Area, Alandi Road RTO office, near EON IT Park and at Dive Ghat, where autos with recalibration done are tested and approved. Auto drivers need to contact the meter manufacturers for resetting and come these tracks.” Pune deputy RTO Sanjay Sasane said that drivers whose meters weren’t calibrated were to charge fares as per old rates. “In no case are they supposed to charge more from customers. Plying without the meter on is illegal in any case. People should approach the RTO if they have gone through such an experience — strict action will be initiated after investigation,” the official told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/complaints-galore-about-auto-drivers-overcharging/articleshow/88440745.cms||Joy Sengupta

Local sources said, “The villagers had cordoned the entire village since Tuesday night after they got reports about drug buyers’ entry. They apprehended one of the addicts with drugs on Tuesday night and three on Wednesday. They have handed over all four addicts to the police.” In a video, a villager is heard saying that they don’t have much confidence in the police so they themselves would be on guard day and night to save the village from drugs. The villager said Tuesday night one of the three persons who had come in a school bus was caught and on Wednesday at 7am three men, who had allegedly come to the village to buy chitta (drugs), were nabbed. The villager said in the video that for the past four to five years, chitta was being sold there and 200-300 youths come to the village to buy it. The villagers had approached the police and the local leaders several times, but when no action was taken, people, along with sports clubs, finally took it upon themselves to catch the addicts.Many angry villagers raised slogans against the government and the administration and said they have written to the chief minister too and demanded strict action. It was alleged that the name of a person selling drugs was earlier mentioned to the police many times and some buyers were also nabbed and handed over to the police, but to date no action has been taken. Samrala SHO inspector Surjit Singh said the three youths have been booked under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. Asked why they have not been booked under the NDPS Act, the SHO said they were probing the case and there has been no recovery from the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/villagers-catch-drug-addicts-hand-them-over-to-police/articleshow/88440018.cms||---

S Preethika, a Class V girl student from Pachalur village near Kodaikanal, died of severe burns near the kitchen of her school under suspicious circumstances on December 15. Police investigating the case ruled out any signs of sexual abuse. However, it is yet to be ascertained whether it was a murder. Meanwhile, the family members of the girl and villagers have been protesting demanding justice for Preethika. On Wednesday, the villagers blocked Batlagundu Main Road and Lake Road in Kodaikanal disrupting traffic for more than four hours. The protesters raised slogans as to why there has been no action or arrests by police so far. Dindigul superintendent of police V R Srinivasan and revenue department officials held talks with the protesters. Later, the protesters dispersed after the SP assured them of proper action. Meanwhile, PMK youth wing leader Dr Anbumani Ramadoss demanded to transfer the case to CBI if no progress is made by the state police investigation. “The incident happened on the campus of a government school and hence it is of utmost importance to find those responsible for the death. Otherwise, the public will start to lose faith in government schools and regard it to be unsafe,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/villagers-block-roads-in-kodaikanal-seeking-probe-into-death-of-class-v-girl-student/articleshow/88440746.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The first-of-a-kind set-up of Punjab was inaugurated by additional director general of police (prisons) Parveen Kumar Sinha on Wednesday and a man lodged under an NDPS Act case became the first radio jockey (RJ).ADGP Sinha said, “The prime objective is to rehabilitate the inmates, who are isolated from society. Involving them in such activities will help in creating a good atmosphere. Moreover, welfare opportunities inside jail will help to keep them away from crime.”Sinha, who also interacted with the jail inmates, said, “Initially, the radio will be available for three hours, one hour each in morning, afternoon and evening. The morning and evening shows will be religious and in the afternoon, a cultural programme will be played. In this hour-long cultural programme, songs will be played on the demand of the inmates. A day prior, their choice of songs will be collected. Besides, the inmates with any kind of talent, be it writing and composing songs or mimicry, will be provided a platform. On Wednesday too, some inmates gave live performances, which were commendable as they had written and composed the songs. As the inmates don’t possess radio sets, these have been attached to speakers installed at all the barracks.”Balkar Singh Bhullar, jail superintendent, said, “In another initiative under this project, we will share the performances of the inmates with their families through WhatsApp. We will start recording the performances to be sent to them.”Bhullar said that the inmate lodged in a drug peddling case, Kapil Shelly, became the first radio jockey and they have trained one more. Bhullar added that they have a team of nine inmates who would be running the radio set-up. The jail authorities have provided the inmates with some musical instruments, like harmonium and tabla. The officer said the jail authorities would also use the set-up to make important announcements, conveying wishes for festivals and other special occasions.Sinha said six more Punjab jails would get the same radio set-ups soon in association with India Vision Foundation, a pioneer in conducting various reformatory projects in prisons.5,900 cellphones recovered in 3 yrsWhile interacting with the media about the recovery of mobiles from the jail inmates, ADGP Sinha said about 5,900 devices were recovered from the Punjab jails in the past three years. He said security in all jails has been strengthened. He said no mobile phone or other prohibited commodity enters the jails from the doors, but these are dropped over the compound walls. To stop it, patrolling around the premises would also be started, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/jailhouse-rocks-radio-system-starts-in-prison/articleshow/88440016.cms||Payal Dhawan

And indeed, the stories of the Class XI students of Government Girls Senior Secondary School in south Delhi’s Pushp Vihar, would have gladdened many hearts. Riya spoke about her mask business, started with the Rs 2,000 seed money provided under the scheme. She has earned Rs 10,000 in two months. She buys cloth from the wholesale market and set up an arrangement with a neighbourhood tailor who didn't have much work due to the Covid situation. “I asked him if he wanted to work with me, and he immediately said yes because he needed work to stay afloat,” said Riya. Khushi and Lisa earned a profit of Rs 5,000 from seed money the two got of Rs 4,000. They started a bakery business and collaborated with local women who were good cooks. “The housewives learned the new skill of baking and we started taking orders for them during the holiday season and online. If I had been in a private school, my friend and I might have missed out on this opportunity of learning how to run a business,” said Khushi. For Akriti Singh, the Business Blasters programme was not only useful in helping her father change his mindset about business, but also brought her profits. “I am now a seller on Amazon and Flipkart,” the teenager said proudly. “My father, an engineer, lost his job during the Covid lockdown and our financial situation was dire. So, with a seed capital of Rs 2,000, I began buying and collecting waste jars, cans, sauce bottles and so on. I began painting them and selling them on platforms like Flipkart and Amazon. I made a Rs 12,000 profit in two months during the festive season of Diwali and Christmas,” smiled Singh. Other students also shared stories about their businesses. Vanshika, who has started a clothing business, got emotional seeing Sisodia. “I am so happy to see my inspiration in front of me that I am unable to control my emotions,” Vanshika mumbled. “We collect clothes from various sources, refurbish them and sell them to people who cannot afford high-priced clothing."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/girls-share-their-business-success-stories/articleshow/88441368.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||HC orders release of kid in custody despite bail||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the release on bail of a juvenile in conflict with the law after the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) alleged he was in illegal custody. While dealing with the commission's plea, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed that the child be released upon his mother furnishing the bail bond fixed by the Juvenile Justice Board, while granting him relief. The court's intervention came after the Delhi State Legal Service Authority said that the juvenile in question would be released as his mother was already tendering a bail bond. Lawyer Vrinda Grover, appearing for DCPCR, claimed that the child was granted bail in November but remained in custody due to non-fulfilment of bail conditions. The court was informed that there was a delay in the case on account of a difference in opinion between the principal magistrate and two social worker members of the JJB while granting relief. DCPCR stated that the child, aged 16 years, was taken into custody in October for the alleged offence of robbery under the Indian Penal Code and was granted bail by the JJB on November 29. It submitted that even after the child could not meet the conditions of the bail order, his bail conditions were not modified and was once again sent back to the observation home in December. “The child in conflict with the law was to be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board for modification of bail conditions. However, the child was not produced on December 5, 2021, and was instead produced with a further delay of 8 days, i.e. on 13.12.2021....the child victim was rather once again sent back to Observation Home without modifying the conditions of the bail,” the petition stated. DCPCR claimed that the Juvenile Justice Act left no scope of discretion and it was mandatory for the JJB to modify the bail conditions in favour of the release of the juvenile. DCPCR has also sought in the plea that HC issue “broad guidelines to be followed when deciding the bail application of a child in conflict”. The matter will be heard next on December 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-orders-release-of-kid-in-custody-despite-bail/articleshow/88441370.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba said that the city police had instructed all police stations that the investigation in such heinous offences should be completed on time so that complaints could get timely justice. The average investigation period of crimes against women in Rajasthan this year was around 76 days. But in the city, the period of days in which investigations were completed improved following strict monitoring over cases of rapes involving women and minors. Lamba added that the city police are working towards further improving the probe time by ensuring that no case lingers on. “In such important cases, the investigation officers are instructed to move swiftly and not keep any case pending, barring in those cases where there are some doubts which warrant special examination,” he said. The city police said that the drastic fall is also due to the constant monitoring of cases by senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-cops-improve-avg-probe-time-in-rape-cases/articleshow/88441364.cms||---
---||Pune||Pashan Rd one-way can work if rules well followed: Commuters||Pune: If the no-parking and no-halting rule is strictly implemented on Abhimanshree Road, commuters will not find it hard to navigate the detour and one-way rule proposed on Pashan Road, said many residents who use the route on a daily basis. As per data with the traffic police, commuters on Ganeshkhind Road going to Baner Road will need to take a left towards Pashan Road. The latter will be a one-way road till Abhimanshree Chowk on Pashan Road, from where they can go to Baner Road via Abhimanshree Road. Some said that the traffic signal at Abhimanshree Chowk on Pashan Road may need to be made functional during peak hours. K Mujumdar, a senior citizen who lives in Pashan, said, “Though we understand that the proposed changes have been made after many deliberations, reaching hospitals in the Deccan part of the city will become harder now. Especially during peak hours, there is already a lot of traffic on Baner Road towards Ganeshkhind Road. Now, that same traffic will increase as the entire Pashan side traffic will flow there. Special care must be taken to ensure there is no halting or parking on that stretch.” Another citizen of the area said particular diversions can work if people follow rules diligently, adding that it would still be hard for school students, especially since the stretch between Ganeshkhind Road and Abhimnshree Chowk on Pashan Road has three schools and Modern College on it, of which the latter has multiple institutes on campus. “Students coming from Pashan to these campuses will now need to take a major detour, especially in peak hours. We also need to carefully check how buses will ply here as many people use these services. Students coming from Pashan will need to take a bus to Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) Chowk and then cross the busy junction to Pashan Road, and then probably walk to school/college,” said Ashish Goyal, an IT professional who works in Kharadi. Further, the road adjacent to Cosmos Bank on Ganeshkhind Road will be available to enter Bhosalenagar, while those coming out from the area will only be able to use Range Hills Road. “Construction of an integrated double-decker flyover at SPPU Chowk will begin soon. To avoid traffic jams when work begins, changes are being made to major traffic movement at the SPPU Chowk, Baner Road, Pashan Road, Ganeshkhind Road and affected areas. The proposed trial will start from December 23 and continue on an experimental basis till further orders,” said Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (DCP-traffic), in an official circular.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pashan-rd-one-way-can-work-if-rules-well-followed-commuters/articleshow/88440747.cms||Ardhra Nair

Several of the projects are nearing completion, while the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Goa, campus at Cuncolim will be ready by August 2022, the international law school will begin operations from June 2022 and will have 20% seats reserved for Goans, Sawant said. “The government of India has certified that we have utilized 96% of the funds sanctioned to us during my tenure,” Sawant said. He was speaking after releasing the report card on the achievements of the BJP governments in Goa over the last 10 years. Since 2014, Goa received Rs 25,000 crore funding from the centre under PM Narendra Modi, for both human development and infrastructure development. This is more than Goa’s annual budget, which is Rs 21,000 crore, he said. “While carrying out all this development, many are ready to shoot us claiming that we are carrying out haphazard development. But it has been certified by the government of India that we have climbed to number three from number seven in sustainable development,” Sawant said. “In the case of Mormugao Port Trust, we were only being blamed so far for coal transportation, but Roro services and other such projects are coming up with sanction of the central government,” the chief minister said. By March 2022, a national water sports institute is expected to be completed at Miramar, which will offer graduate, postgraduate and MBA programmes in water sports, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-has-used-96-of-funds-sanctioned-by-centre-cm/articleshow/88441411.cms||---

Meanwhile, I got a marriage proposal from Amanjot Kaur. Her family said Amanjot has secured good bands in IELTS, but after the death of her father, they did not have enough money to send her abroad.

---||Hubballi||Demanding job security, guest lecturers threaten to boycott classes||Dharwad: With the state government not ready to fill vacant posts of lecturers in government and private aided degree colleges, the colleges are run with the help of guest lecturers who are paid a paltry sum of Rs 12,000 per month. This practice has been in vogue for more than 10 years. This has affected the quality of teaching and has also put the careers of guest lecturers and students in jeopardy. There are about 14,000 guest lecturers waiting for job security. They have launched a sit-in protest in Dharwad and in front of Suvarna Vidhana Soudha in Belagavi since December 10. The guest lecturers who started off with honorarium of Rs 2,000 per month 10 years ago are now getting Rs 11,000 per month. “We had joined with the hope that our services will be regularized as we were working in clear vacancies. Now we have crossed the age limit and there has been no service security,” said a guest lecturer. Higher education minister Dr CN Ashwathnarayana held a meeting with legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horatti and later promised that he would study the West Bengal model where the services of guest faculty were regularized and constitute a committee to consider providing service security to guest faculty. However, no concrete action is forthcoming. “We will not withdraw our agitation till there is an order issued to regularize our services,” said Sanju Sataradid, a lecturer. West Bengal Model The West Bengal government has regularized the services of guest lecturers. As per its formula, those who have completed 10 years of service will get a salary of Rs 35,000 per month for 12 months while those with a service of less than 10 years will be paid Rs 25,000 per month for 12 months. Both will get a 3% hike in salary every year and a one-time lump sum of Rs 5 lakh on retirement. The agitating lecturers are upset with Ashwathnarayan’s threat that legal action will be initiated if lecturers do not engage classes. “The government while allowing recruitment of lecturers should relax the age limit and provide us weightage. The government lacks political will to provide us job security and tries to intimidate us. We too know the law,” said Hanumantgouda Kalmani, leader of the Guest Lecturers’ Association. BJP MLC SV Sankanur said he has drawn the attention of the higher education minister about the plight of guest lecturers and, the minister has promised to constitute a committee to look into the problems and suggest remedial steps. The government is expected to come out with a solution within a month, Sankanur said and urged the guest lecturers to call of the protest and return to classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/demanding-job-security-guest-lecturers-threaten-to-boycott-classes/articleshow/88440427.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

Members of SFI questioned the silence of the state on the issue and added that the chief minister should immediately respond on the suicide of students. “Students died because of government failure in conducting online classes.

In the previous week, the state had reported 1,288 total cases, trailing behind Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Mizoram. Between December 12 and 19, the total caseload in the country stood at 48,457 with 10 states, including Telangana, adding to the numbers. Surprisingly, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, which has a higher cumulative caseload of over 20 lakh, reported only 975 cases during the same period. However, AP is also among the top contributors to the case tally. Telangana reported 180 cases per day on an average in the last few days. Kerala had the highest weekly caseload of 23,766, followed by Maharashtra at 5,515, Tamil Nadu (4,481), West Bengal (3,903) and Mizoram at 1,294 cases. Telangana is also among the top three states in the country in terms of Omicron variant cases. However, the authorities are keeping the results of more than 1,100 tests conducted for secondary contacts of Omicron variant tested people in Paramount Colony and Tolichowki under wraps. The results of the tests have not been revealed yet though the samples were taken four days ago. Meanwhile, private hospitals have increased their guard following the detection of a doctor who tested positive for the Omicron variant. There are only a few hospitals that provide medical tourism services and not all of them have separate lounges and wards for foreign patients. As a precaution, private hospitals have stopped accepting foreigners who do not have Covid-19 negative certificate, according to sources. When the first case of Omicron was discovered, a dozen staff members at a private hospital were asked to remain in home isolation. On the other hand, the state’s largest Covid-19 nodal centre, Gandhi Hospital, has begun genome sequencing of the samples. The hospital currently has about 50 Covid-19 patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-stands-6th-in-caseload-kerala-tops-list/articleshow/88440615.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The doctor is the first local case of Omicron transmission in Telangana and contracted it from a cancer patient being treated at the corporate hospital. A massive exercise was launched by the health department to trace all first contacts of the doctor, including ward boys, nurses, doctors, friends and family. As per the latest details available, five contacts were tested for Covid-19 of which now one has tested positive. With the state recording its first local transmission of Omicron, health authorities have warned that the new variant in all likelihood would spread fast. “It is bound to spread rapidly and by February we are likely to see a surge in cases of Omicron variant,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director public health, Telangana. As per details from the state health department, a cancer patient, who had landed in the city from Somalia (a non-risk country) on the 14th of this month, was admitted at the hospital the same day. His sample taken at the airport had tested positive for Covid-19 the next day and the following day it was found to be Omicron. Soon after, the corporate hospital’s authorities were contacted by the state health department for admitting the patient to the Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences (TIMS) Gachibowli. “The hospital had said that they cannot transfer the cancer patient, who was in critical condition, to TIMS. On learning that he was positive for Covid-19, they said that they can manage the patient at their facility and he remained under the treatment of the corporate hospital.

Yash Ghoderao, a sales executive at a toy shop in Camp, said, “Due to the recent release of a Spider-Man movie, there is a lot of craze for superhero action figures. This apart, there is a high demand for edu-tech toys.” “Do-it-yourself (DIY) kits pertaining to science experiments, art projects and model making are popular this year as children have been studying from home. Remote control toys are also in demand — cars and trucks for younger children and toy drones for older ones,” said Sanchit Kumar, an employee at a toy shop in Rasta Peth. Siddharth Khanna, a parent of an 8-year old out shopping for toys, said, “I feel that prices have increased in stores, while online products seem cheaper. However, nothing can beat the joy of seeing my daughter taking her pick of her favourite toy among the varieties on offer.” Adrian Menon, shopping for his six-year- old son, said, “I was so glad to find the games that I played as a child, such as marbles and gilli danda which have been formatted into a box. I want to teach my son how to play these desi games.” Availability of toys has reduced due to drop in supply of Chinese products. “Since the lockdown we have hardly been getting toys from China. Around 80% of products usually come from China. Indian products make up only 20%. Indian brands that manufacture quality toys are few, and quantity of production is less,” said Amit Kasbe, a salesperson at a toy shop in Kothrud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/christmas-sales-high-but-supply-of-toys-from-china-low-traders/articleshow/88440766.cms||Anjali Jhangiani

The governor had asked the authorities a few days ago for feedback on worries among students and what steps were being taken to tackle the issue, sources said. Sources said that after the nomination of Padi Kaushik as MLC under the governor’s quota was stopped, her involvement has been more on the Intermediate exam results issue. “There is nothing political in her seeking facts on the Intermediate exam results. The governor is always interested in the education and health sectors,” sources said. Authorities reportedly told her that all the students will most likely be passed and that a system similar to that used in other states would be implemented. Though details of the TSBIE report have not been revealed, it is said that those who want to reverify or rewrite the exam will be given a chance and the highest percentage will be carried as their score. Post-pandemic, a majority of the states used a system in which all students were passed without taking the exam. But, students can take the exam if they want and if the exam results show a high percentage, the score will be considered for the students. “An announcement will be made soon in this regard. Students and families should not be concerned,” officials said. During the pandemic last year, the governor sought reports from the health department and openly stated that testing and tracing of Covid-19 mechanism needed to be improved. The governor also wanted the state government to fill the posts of vice-chancellor in all the universities.

A government order in this regard was issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar which granted permission to execute the sale deeds of government lands to Rangareddy district collector. It maybe recollected the government sold Kokapet lands through e-auctioning in July this year which garnered huge response as eight plots over 48.27 acre were offered for a minimum upset price of Rs 25 crore per acre. In its GO, the government made it clear that the rights on the land belong to government and that the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) will conduct the auction as a government agent. “The HMDA is the only agent of the government and all transactions conducted by the HMDA in the matter are on behalf of the government of Telangana only,” the GO number MS 125 reads. The CS also directed Rangareddy district collector to carry out due diligence for the lands purchased by the bidders in the auction held in July. Previously, the auctioning of some lands was postponed following petitions in high court opposing the land auction. During July’s auction, there was tremendous response for the Kokapet lands as the highest bid amount was recorded at Rs 60.2 crore per acre for plot number 2/P which measured 1.65 acre. Rajapushpa Realty LLP successfully won the bid for the plot for a total of Rs 99.33 crore. The move to sell lands was done by the government in a bid to recuperate the losses caused by the Covid pandemic. Kokapet village of Gandipet mandal is situated close to the outer ring road and also nearer to IT and ITES offices. The government is keen on earning a total Rs 5,000 crore by auctioning these lands. So far, the HMDA made Rs 2,000.37 crore by auctioning Kokapet lands alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-green-signal-to-auction-kokapet-land/articleshow/88440785.cms||---

Gujarat's largest milk union - the Banaskantha District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Limited - popularly known as Banas Dairy already runs milk processing plants at Kanpur and Lucknow. The plant at Karkhiyaon, 18 km away from Varanasi, will be Banas Dairy’s third plant in UP. After it gets commissioned, the plant will generate employment for 10,000 people of seven districts including Banaras, officials said. The plant will have processing capacity of five lakh litres of milk per day. The project is expected to be commissioned in a year and a half at a cost of Rs 457 crore in 30 acres of land. Apart from laying the foundation stone, PM will digitally transfer Rs 35.19 crore as dividend for the year 2020-21 in the accounts of 1.75 lakh milk producers, registered as members of Banas Dairy. Banas Dairy's chairman Shankar Chaudhary said on Tuesday said that the plant will benefit farmers of 1,000 villages of Varanasi, Jaunpur, Chandauli, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Azamgarh districts. “These farmers will get a price range from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month for the milk they procure and provide at the plant. Around 750 people will get direct employment through this project,” he said. The plant will produce 50,000 litres of ice-cream, 20 tonnes of paneer, 75,000 litres of buttermilk, 50 tonnes of curd, 15,000 litres of lassi and 10,000 kg of Amul sweets per day.

The L&DO under the housing and urban affairs ministry rejected the application in this case. The federal auditor also found that the authority took as many as 13 years to reject a substitution and a mutation case. According to the report on the ‘Administration of Nazul land’, which was presented in both Houses of Parliament on Tuesday, while the CAG had found that 49% lease applications were disposed of within the stipulated 90 days in 2009-10, the recent audit shows that barely 29% of total applications were disposed of within the timeline. Nearly 9% of the applications were disposed of after a lapse of 1,500 days, it pointed out. Nazul lands are those that the government had acquired in 1911 for the formation of Delhi as the national capital. These properties were given on leases for residential, commercial and institutional purposes. Highlighting how the government’s land-owning entity not just took years to dispose of applications, the CAG found that 1,199 applications for conversion, substitution and mutation were rejected after taking more than 1,500 days. “Maximum time taken in rejecting a particular application for conversion, substitution and mutation was more than 23 years, 13 years and 13 years, respectively. The maximum time taken in approving a particular application for conversion, substitution and mutation was more than 18 years, 14 years and 12 years, respectively,” the report said. The audit report mentions that the L&DO informed the CAG that the 90 days’ time given in the Citizens’ Charter is indicative in nature and it strives to timely process the cases relating to substitution, mutation and conversion of properties. However, the federal auditor did not accept the submission. The Citizens’ Charter of L&DO stipulates that it would ensure good quality of service by disposal of applications on conversion, sale permission, mutation, and substitution within three months from the date of receipt of information and documents from the lessee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cag-land-dept-took-23-years-for-conversion-case/articleshow/88441412.cms||Dipak K Dash

Health authorities, however, said they were keeping a close watch on the situation and most of the cases reported were mild, not requiring hospitalization. The active caseload in Maharashtra, which had dropped to 6,481 during the week ending December 14, increased to 7,093 at the end of the December 14-20 period. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI, “We have seen a slight rise in cases in the last one week, especially in Mumbai. We are continuously monitoring the situation.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, told TOI that there have been no rise in hospitalizations and most positive cases are mild. “Having said that, hospitalizations do not increase as soon as the cases start rising. Hospitalizations always lag by around two weeks after a rise in Covid cases. We need to wait for another 10-12 days to see if there has been any impact on hospitalizations. Since there has been no rise in hospital admissions for Covid, one can surmise that most of these new cases are mild and in home isolation at best,” Dr Pandit said. He said strict adherence to air ventilation indoors, Covid-appropriate behaviour, masking and vaccination plus strategy should be the next steps to curb the spread. Data showed that Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Raigad, Solapur and Aurangabad are some of the districts recording a rise in Covid caseload this week. Infectious diseases consultant Vasant Nagvekar, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force, said, “We have seen a marginal rise in Covid admissions in the last couple of weeks. Most patients go home post therapy, so the rise has only been marginal. Hence, over 95% new Covid cases coming to the hospitals are mildly symptomatic.” He said, “The person-to-person exposure to the virus is more when people dine and talk with masks off during such gatherings. The duration of exposure during such scenarios is longer.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/active-cases-up-in-state-but-hospitalization-trend-steady/articleshow/88446658.cms||Neha Madaan

Later, we shall increase the service to weekdays as well,” a PMPML (Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited) official said. Presently, there are commercial four-wheelers carrying passengers to the fort. Besides, many private vehicles also go to the fort. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had announced that only e-buses would run on the stretch. “The state forest department has instructed to take steps, like making a parking lot in Golewadi and to train local youths to be tourist guides. Each bus going to the fort will have a tourist guide. Once these buses start, no private or commercial vehicles will be allowed on the weekends. However, on weekdays, other vehicles can go until the bus service becomes more frequent,” the official said. Another PMPML official said a fare of around Rs100 for both ways would be charged for the bus service. “Presently, the commercial vehicles which are plying charge Rs120 for both ways. The PMPML is in discussion with the MSEB (Maharashtra State Electricity Board) towards coming up with a charging station near the main gate of the fort,” the official added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-bus-service-to-sinhagad-fort-likely-from-january/articleshow/88440788.cms||Joy Sengupta

The corporation claimed that this assertion was ‘bogus’ and asked the minister not to misguide the public. “Aam Aadmi Party is making false allegations against the north corporation to hide its failures. A person holding a constitutional post should not make such allegations without getting facts and complete information. We are open to debate in any public forum regarding the outstanding funds of the corporation,” said mayor Raja Iqbal Singh. According to the civic body, the Delhi government in its budget provisions has reduced the fund given to this particular agency by 20% (Rs 328.6 crore). Iqbal claimed that the government was not releasing the outstanding funds to make the corporation financially paralysed. Jogi Ram Jain, standing committee chairman of the north corporation, said: “AAP spokespersons keep making false allegations against the civic body to mislead the citizens. The lieutenant governor had also written a letter to the Delhi government for the outstanding funds of the corporation, but the funds were still not released.” Earlier, South Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor had also refuted the claims of the deputy chief minister. In a meeting of the SDMC House held on Wednesday, AAP councillor Prem Chauhan said: “If the corporation follows the rules and diligently collect property tax then there will be no problem of funds, but that is not done and then the Delhi government is accused of cutting funds, which is not true”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/open-to-debate-on-outstanding-funds-n-corpn-mayor/articleshow/88441410.cms||---

The maiden test of the surface-to-surface missile, which can carry a payload of 1,000 kg and is powered with a solid propellant rocket motor, met all objectives. “The new missile followed the desired quasi-ballistic trajectory and reached the designated target with high degree of accuracy, validating the control, guidance and mission algorithms,” a DRDO official said. “All the sub-systems performed satisfactorily. All the sensors deployed near the impact point across the eastern coast, including the down range ships, tracked the missile trajectory and captured all the events,” he added. The guidance system of the missile, which can be launched from a mobile launcher, includes state-of-the-art navigation system and integrated avionics. Pralay is meant to be a short-range tactical missile with a huge payload to hit enemy targets. Defence minister Rajnath Singh congratulated for the fast track development and successful maiden launch of the modern Pralay missile. DRDO chairman G Satheesh Reddy, in turn, said Pralay was a new-generation surface-to-surface missile equipped with modern technologies and induction of this weapon system will give the necessary impetus to the armed forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-tests-its-new-surface-to-surface-short-range-missile/articleshow/88442380.cms||---

The figure was 1,164 per day in the week ending December 3; 15,77 on November 13; 1,233 per day in the week ending November 5; and 1,217 on October 23 evening. It was 1,159 per day in the week ending October 2; 1,156 on September 30; 2,158 on August 2; 1,865 on July 30; 2,337 on July 15; and 2,772 on July 8.The latest figure puts Ludhiana at eighth spot in the state.

Mansa, Moga and Sangrur have 0% positivity rate.The health department officials admitted that testing is less in Ludhiana. An official of the department said, “Tests per million, which are directly related to daily tests, have decreased as contractual staff are on strike. Even as our target is at least 8,000 tests a day, there have been days recently when the number was below 4,000.”The civil surgeon couldn’t be contacted for his comments.The health experts said testing should be increased.“Given the fact that cases of Omicron are being reported in some states, I think the cases are here as well but are going unreported due to less testing. The government should encourage people to get themselves tested, as for Omicron as well, the strategy remains the same which is to test people, identify patients, isolate and treat them if required,” said Ludhiana IMA former president Dr Narrotam Dewan.District vs stateWhile Ludhiana had 937 tests per million on December 20 evening, the state had 805.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/tests-per-million-go-below-1000-mark/articleshow/88440068.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Pune||WPR higher than Maha average in only 7 districts||Pune: The weekly positivity rate in seven districts, including Pune, continued to remain above Maharashtra’s average of 0.82% for the seven-day period ending on December 20, prompting the state public health department officials issue a directive to the local authorities to keep a watch on any spikes. According to the public health department report, Pune (1.75%), Sangli (1.19%), Solapur (1.17%), Palghar (1.16%), Satara (1.13%), Nashik (1.03%) and Ahmednagar (1.03%) registered a higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state average this week. Pune’s WPR was around 2% in the last week of November. Last week it was 1.6% and this week it increased marginally by 0.15%. The state Covid task force member, Dr Shashank Joshi, told TOI that Maharashtra was currently registering very few cases and was at the end of the second wave. “The Covid pandemic in the country is hitting record lows as the numbers are between 5,000-6,000 a day. So, clearly, there is a sustained decline in cases except in few geographic spots, predominantly from Kerala. From the Delta derivative standpoint, we are clearly seeing lower numbers being reported,” he said. “There is a clear decline in cases in Maharashtra also with 600-800 active cases being registered daily. The only exceptions are urban metropolitan areas. These areas may register some marginal increases because of increased testing. But the WPR is not very high,” he said. “If Delta continues without Omicron interference, there is no possibility of a third wave. But if Omicron dominates Delta variant like in the US or Europe, then there is a possibility of a third wave because the former spreads rapidly. This needs to be kept in check,” said Dr Joshi. “The reassuring factor is that the cases are mild, and no deaths have been reported. A large number of infected people are vaccinated and there have been no major cluster outbreaks yet,” said a health official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wpr-higher-than-maha-average-in-only-7-districts/articleshow/88440792.cms||Nisha Nambiar

But the person contesting for the councillor post has to visit other wards to canvas voters. There is another dimension to the issue. If people from other wards demand basic facilities, how can a councillor elected from a ward can attend to the issues of people in another ward?” he asked.Ramu of Karamadai, a DMK representative, said that there is a huge difference in the number of voters in each ward. “While some wards have hundred voters, others have more than 2,000 voters. Instead of taking into account the number of voters, the ward delimitation exercise is carried out by the number of assessments in each ward as per the local body records. This can be resolved only if door-to-door check is conducted,” he said.At some places, unrelated areas were added to wards, which will cause inconvenience to both public and candidates, said another representative.Chairman Palanikumar said that there can be a 10% difference between each ward in the average number of voters. “There are predefined rules on how to fix boundaries to each ward. There should be clear marking of boundaries,” he said. “The issues raised by the representatives of political parties and public would be taken into account and decisions would be made as per the rules and regulations before the delimitation exercise is completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/public-hearing-on-ward-delimitation-held/articleshow/88440803.cms||---

He had gone out of Ahmedabad with his family. Upon their return, the father’s friend with whom they had travelled, tested positive. When his father got to know this, he came to the school and got his son tested,” said Raja Pathak, trustee of the school. The school authorities have decided to halt in-person classroom studies for a week and switch to online students to check further spread of the virus. The student was in school for about half an hour and the school authorities have informed all parents to get their children tested if they suspect any symptoms of coronavirus, according to Pathak. “The teachers of his class have also been asked to get tested for Covid,” said Pathak. According to DEO (Ahmedabad Rural) R R Vyas, another child, a Class 12 student of Maharaja Agrasen School in Gurukul has tested positive for Covid. “The student did not attend school for one week as he was studying online. A member of his family tested positive following which he was tested for Covid. His class mates have been alerted in case they have been in touch with him recently,” said Vyas. Many schools in the city have come under scanner after reports of Covid cases in students of two other city schools came to fore recently. Earlier this month, some students of Nirma School in Chharodi and Udgam School in Thaltej had tested positively following which the DEO ordered closure of offline studies for one week. “Some schools did not report to the DEO despite coming across such cases following which the education department has tightened its vigil,” said sources in state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/two-kids-from-2-ahmedabad-schools-test-covid-ve/articleshow/88441424.cms||---

The police also arrested the candidate, who fled from the examination centre, after a policeman on duty became suspicious and checked his mask, which was fitted with an electronic device, including batteries, SIM card and mic. Two more persons, who helped in preparing the device, have been arrested from Aurangabad, taking the total number of people arrested in connection with the case to four. Senior inspector Balkrishna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police told TOI, “Constable Rahul Uttam Gaikwad (33) and arrested candidate Ganesh Vaidya (25) are friends. Our probe revealed that Vaidya had used the same device during the Nashik police recruitment exam in August this year.” Sawant said that the suspects had attached a battery and SIM card with the facemask. The battery was connected to a charging cable. The setup was attached to a mic and a button, Sawant said. Police constable Shashikant Devkant became suspicious after he spotted Vaidya with the mask at the examination centre in Hinjewadi. “When the candidate was told to remove the mask, he handed it over to Devkant and fled from the centre on the pretext of fetching his identity card,” Sawant said. Sawant said that police initially arrested Nitin Misal (24) and Rameshwar Shinde (25), both from Aurangabad, for helping the arrested constable and his friend in making the device. One of them was also found with a micro Bluetooth device. “During custodial interrogation, the duo revealed Vaidya and Gaikwad’s name. They also revealed that Vaidya had used the device to appear for the Nashik police recruitment exam and Gaikwad had helped him by dictating answers over the phone,” Sawant said.

---||Hyderabad||IMS-ESI scam: Telangana HC issues notice to accused||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court has issued notice to Omni Medi company MD Kancharla Srihari Babu, an accused in the IMS-ESI scam, asking him to explain his case by December 28 in a petition filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against the trial court’s decision not to send him to judicial remand. Srihari Babu was arrested by the ED under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on December 18, but the trial court’s refusal to send him to judicial remand allowed him to walk free the same day. Babu is facing allegations of swindling about Rs 230 crore of public money in the IMS-ESI scam. Aggrieved by the decision of the metropolitan sessions judge-cum-special judge for ED cases at Hyderabad, the ED filed an appeal against the decision in HC. Additional solicitor seneral T Surya Karan Reddy said that the decision of the trial court was based on a belief that every agency has to follow CrPC section 41-A before effecting arrest, which was not applicable to ED. “But we follow Section 19 of PMLA and it too has certain mandatory provisions. We fulfilled all such requirements and we need not follow CrPC again,” he said. Large-scale irregularities in the purchase of medicines and medical equipment took place during the time of IMS director Devika Rani. According to ACB, she colluded with Srihari Babu and caused loss to the exchequer to an extent of Rs 230 crore, and both had swindled most of the scam money. Sri Hari Babu floated several shell companies to sell the medicines at inflated rates to IMS and also to conceal flow of funds from the state exchequer into the accounts of various accomplices in the crime. ED had attached Rs 144 crore worth of assets from the accused after identifying them as proceeds of crime under the provisions of the PMLA. The ED and the ACB found that the accused had started illegal operations in the neighbouring states too. The ED has identified 131 immovable assets of the accused. In this there are 97 land plots, 18 commercial complexes, four flats, six agricultural land plots, and si villas. They are situated in Hyderabad, AP, Bangalore, and Noida. Some fixed deposits lying in the name of these accused were also attached.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ims-esi-scam-court-issues-notice-to-accused/articleshow/88440794.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Indapur taluka tops the list of pending beneficiaries with over 59,000 such people, followed by Khed (58,867), Haveli (53,870), Baramati (53,154) and Maval (50,163). The health department officials have been instructed to vaccinate these beneficiaries by December 31. The higher authorities expressed displeasure over the health department’s lethargic approach towards vaccinating these beneficiaries after the stipulated interval between the two doses. The officials concerned have been advised to start the vaccination work from the areas where the first dose is still pending in large numbers, followed by the second dose. The Pune Zilla Parishad officials stated that the list of the first and the second dose beneficiaries had been prepared and their counselling through visits under Har Ghar Dastak was under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/5-5l-due-for-second-shot-in-rural-areas/articleshow/88440808.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Delhi||Covid cited for delay in recovering dues: CAG||New Delhi: The latest Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report has flagged how the Land and Development Office (L&DO) cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason for delay in revising and recovering ground rent and damages from big hotels, schools and prime properties in the national capital. But it has observed that the government authority did not take effective action even before the outbreak. The federal auditor carried out the examination of records relating to a sample of 29 properties, including properties leased out to two five-star hotels, three presses, two hospitals, six cinema halls and three reputed schools. In response to delay in recovery of the government dues in most of the cases, the L&DO submitted this was due to the Covid pandemic. The CAG observed that the authority’s reply is to be viewed in light of the fact that the recovery of government dues has been pending much before the outbreak of Covid and it did not take effective action for recovery of the dues even before the outbreak. CAG has also flagged how the land owning authority was not having adequate control over its properties, saying it was not able to manage the lease administration efficiently as there was “irregular” inspection and “inadequate” documentation of the leased properties.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-cited-for-delay-in-recovering-dues-cag/articleshow/88441420.cms||---
---||Delhi||Demand up in Delhi, but not liquor supply||NEW DELHI: The winter chill and the ebullience of the festive season both make people seek liquor at this time. But consumers have been left high and dry with 500 of the 850 new liquor stores yet to open following the transition to the new excise regime in the city. With even the stores that have opened not fully stocked, tipplers only have the choice of picking up a bottle from neighbouring Gurgaon or Noida. Apart from the teething troubles faced during the transition that began on November 17, the ban on construction caused delays in the opening of the new shops, compounded by a shortfall in supplies due to heavy trucks being prohibited from entering the city. Senior officials of the Delhi government’s excise department didn’t respond to queries sent by TOI. A liquor store owner said, “Many new vends haven’t even started construction work due to local protests or because they are awaiting official inspection. While bigger restaurants had stocked adequately sensing such a scarcity, smaller outlets, daily events and individual consumers are having problems finding a brand or size of their choice.” He also disclosed that not all liquor brands are available because they haven’t been registered yet. A newly licensed store owner revealed, however, that prices in Delhi under the new policy would be the lowest in the region. He said that the requirement of the new policy to mention the production cost, dealer margin and to fix the price at lower than in other markets would make alcohol cheaper in Delhi. He said the MRP for some beers in the city was half of what they cost in Gurgaon. “There is no cap on the discounts that retailers can offer to consumers either,” the store owner added. “If the hassles are ironed out fast, Delhi will have premium liquor at the best prices. Till then, this sadly remains a promise on paper.” Rahul Singh, former president, National Restaurant Association of India, said restaurants could no longer buy wholesale and since the retail stores weren’t fully open or weren’t well stocked, there was pressure on restaurants too. Another issue that NRAI and alcohol dealers have written to the excise department to urgently address is nonavailability of draught beer and imported beer due to system glitches and policy overlook. Singh, who also runs The Beer Cafe, says there is a dearth of tap and imported beer in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/demand-up-but-not-liquor-supply/articleshow/88441417.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Ahmedabad||Post-tensioning triggered bridge collapse in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: A deck of an overbridge in Mumatpura that was to be opened for residents of South Bopal and neighbouring areas in a few weeks collapsed during a stressing activity late on Tuesday. No one was injured but the incident has sent shivers down the spine of south Bopal residents. The stressing process is crucial so that the deck is strengthened as a pre-stressed concrete block and is able to withstand tension and not crack or collapse owing to vehicle load. TimesViewAbridge deck collapse incident a few weeks ahead of project inauguration has already led to a loss of faith among citizens. This is the first such incident in Ahmedabad in recent times. The state government should ensure that an enquiry committee does not get reduced to a mechanism to divert public attention or even to pass the buck on private consultants and structural experts. Responsibilities should be fixed. Bodies like AUDA that are short of engineering staff should be provided government support. Responsibilities should be fixed. Inspection of bridges should be a routine affair.The bridge work was to be completed by late December and by mid-February authorities were already thinking of opening the bridge for public use. Now it will be delayed for three months. The concrete deck that collapsed was cast on November 19 and was placed on top of the bridge. It had completed the mandated 28 days of wait for strengthening. The post-tensioning or stressing exercise was undertaken on Tuesday. The preparation for the activity had begun at 9 am and was to culminate at 10 pm on Wednesday night. Witnesses like Rajesh Parmar, a tea-stall owner near the site, claimed that a few labourers and engineers were stationed at each end of the deck when the post-tensioning process was taking place. Suddenly around 10.15pm, a portion of the bridge deck sagged and collapsed in seconds with a loud noise. “I heard a blast and was startled,” says Parmar. There were close to 90 engineers and labourers at the site when the incident happened. The bridge is 853m long and design for each of the 114 girders was passed by consultants, Delf Consulting Engineers as well as the state roads and building department. “About 113 girders, each of which are 48m in span, were successfully placed. It was the 114th that broke during the post-tensioning process. This is extremely rare and surprised all at the site,” claimed a senior AUDA engineer at the accident site on Thursday morning. Chief executive authority of Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA) AB Gor claimed that the ACS (urban development department) had written a letter, requesting an expert team of the roads and building department to inspect the site and submit a report at the earliest. “The department will be assisted by AUDA team to investigate the cause of the deck or girder giving way during the post-tensioning exercise,” says Gor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/post-tensioning-triggered-bridge-collapse/articleshow/88441421.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: PT Thomas, popular but unafraid of being unpopular, dies||KOCHI: Senior Congress leader and Thrikkakara MLA P T Thomas died at Christian Medical College, Vellore in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday morning. He was undergoing treatment for cancer at the hospital for the past few months. He was 71. Thomas -- or just PT to many close to him -- was a leader who was close to people's hearts. He was known for standing his ground on issues and not afraid to speak his mind and his unexpected demise is a big loss for the Congress party. The body will be cremated at Ravipuram crematorium in Ernakulam at 5.30pm on Thursday as per his wishes and the ashes later buried in the family tomb at Upputhodu in Idukki, where his mother rests. The firm stand of Thomas favouring implementation of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel report of the Madhav Gadgil-led committee had cost him the Idukki Lok Sabha seat in 2014 when his party denied him the seat fearing a backlash from the Church in the election. He was not ready to mend his ways with the Church even after that. He was the first leader to criticise Pala bishop for his controversial narcotic jihad remarks against Muslims, saying that such statements would only create a communal divide. Known for his clean image, Thomas was also a strong voice of the party in the assembly. Even his political opponents admired him for his sharp and dignified attacks. He had maintained his record of research even in his recent attacks on chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the assembly on gold smuggling case, the LIFE Mission scandal and Muttil tree felling row. Thomas never used to make political speeches in the assembly but he was a well-studied legislator. He was also a guide and teacher to the young MLAs. He had informed the party high command that he was ready to take up the opposition leader's post when the party was searching for a new face after it suffered a humiliating successive defeat in the assembly election. The Congress leadership picked V D Satheesan for the crucial job but it gave due recognition to Thomas by appointing him as the KPCC working president. He was a staunch loyalist of senior leader A K Antony and a known face in the 'A' group in its earlier days. However, he later parted ways with the groups and stood as a neutral leader. He won from Thrikkakara in 2016 defeating LDF's Sebastian Paul by 11,996 votes. In 2021 also, he romped home against Dr J Jacob by a margin of 14,329 votes despite a smear campaign by the CPM. Thomas had represented the Idukki parliamentary constituency from 2009 to 2014 and Thodupuzha assembly constituency from 1991 to 1996 and 2001 to 2006. He was defeated in Thodupuzha in 1996 and 2006. He has also served as the editor and managing director of party mouthpiece Veekshanam. Thomas, who was born in Idukki in 1950, had his education at Thiruvananthapuram Mar Ivanios College, Thodupuzha Newman College, Ernakulam Maharajas College and Government Law Colleges in Kozhikode and Ernakulam. He began his political career through KSU, where he served as Idukki district secretary, state general secretary and state president. He became the general secretary of Youth Congress in 1980 and had been a KPCC member since then. Thomas is survived by wife Uma Thomas and children Vishnu Thomas and Vivek Thomas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/p-t-thomas-popular-but-unafraid-of-being-unpopular-dies/articleshow/88440806.cms||---

A walkway with a shed is being constructed at the city airport to connect the domestic terminal to a designated taxi parking stand, confirmed sources. “We are anticipating an increase in passenger movement around VGGS 2022. To add to passenger convenience, a dedicated walkway from the domestic arrival to the taxi parking space is being constructed so that there is no heckling or unnecessary crowding right outside the arrival area,” said a well-placed source. A separate parking space to accommodate some 100 app-based cabs is being set up outside the domestic terminal. The walkway will be linked to it. The city airport authorities have also revamped the ceremonial lounge into a general aviation terminal. “The idea is to eliminate inconvenience caused by VIP movement. A separate GA terminal has been set up to handle non-scheduled operations,” said the source. The city handles 5-7 charter flight movements daily. The airport has space to park as many as 43 aircrafts in its hangars. Charter movement is expected to rise ahead of VGGS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/walkway-to-link-domestic-terminal-to-taxi-parking-stand/articleshow/88441427.cms||---

Hooda had read out the messages while referring to the HPSC scam during the adjournment motion on Tuesday. Khattar had then requested the speaker to investigate the chat document read out in the House by the opposition leader. Taking a jibe at Hooda, the CM said, “Agar kanch par para chadha diya jaye toh darpan ban jata hai, agar vahi darpan dikha diya jaye toh para chadh jata hai (a glass turns into a mirror when coated with mercury, if the same mirror is shown (to somebody) tempers get frayed).” He added, “The state government’s main goal is to bring reforms in the system and there is constant effort to resolve every problem faced by the common man.” The Haryana Law Commission is being constituted to study the laws and to remove any overlap. He said the laws which are outdated would either be deleted or modified. 276 police cases registered during farm stir Khattar said that as per police records, 276 cases have been registered so far during the farmers’ agitation. Out of these, four cases are registered under serious offences while charge sheets have been prepared in 178 cases out of the remaining 272. As many as 158 cases are still untraceable, he said. Cancellation reports of eight cases have been prepared, while the same have been filed in four. The process of cancellation of 29 cases is going on, he informed. The state government will withdraw all the cases registered against farmers, barring those involving heinous crimes such as rape, murder and so on, he added. Responding to a question regarding giving compensation to the farmers, the chief minister replied that talks are going on. According to the CID report, the postmortem of 46 farmers has been done. He said during their interaction with farmers, the latter had put the tally of deceased farmers of Haryana at 73. The investigation in this matter is still going on and decision regarding compensation will be taken only after holding discussions, he added. Committee for university appointments A five-member committee would be set up for taking decisions regarding appointments to different posts in the state universities, Khattar said. This committee will be include the representative of the governor (chancellor), principal secretary of higher education department and vice-chancellors of three universities. Stating that the UGC instructions would be complied with, he said the appointments will be done in a transparent manner and on the basis of merit only. Numbardars to continue Numbardars will not be removed while their monthly honorarium has been increased from Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000, said Khattar. Besides, they will be given Rs 7,000 as mobile expenses, he added. The file to give the benefit of Ayushman Bharat to numbardars has also been cleared and awaiting approval from the Centre, he said. Rs 600cr as direct relief to beneficiaries The CM said more than Rs 600 crore has been spent during pandemic for providing direct relief to the beneficiaries. The Rs 5 crore for development works, which the MLAs have not received for development works in their respective constituencies due to Covid-19, would be released by March 31, 2022, he added. Micro irrigation will be promoted To promote micro-irrigation and crop diversification, the government is giving incentives to farmers at the rate of Rs 7,000 per acre, said Khattar. No satisfactory replies on prominent issues: Hooda Outside the assembly, Hooda said the BJP-JJP alliance has failed to give any satisfactory replies on prominent issues like corruption in two recruitment agencies, sufferings of farmers on Meri Fasal Mera Byora portal and Bhavantar Bharpayee Yojana. He also flayed the government for its failure on the issue of unemployment and law and order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cm-slams-hooda-for-refusing-to-share-chat-message-details/articleshow/88441428.cms||---

Vilas Paigude, a regular commuter on the stretch, said, “The civic administration should keep constant watch on public spaces like roads, bridges and flyovers to keep these facilities encroachment-free. Many spaces under flyovers have been occupied by stalls and illegally parked vehicles.” An official from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), choosing to stay unnamed, said their anti-encroachment squad will visit the location and take the appropriate steps. He told TOI, “Our department conducts regular checks in public areas to initiate action against unauthorised vendors or stalls. Surprise checks are also underway at several locations, especially market places.” The rise of such encroachments so close to the PMC's own headquarters comes months after action against illegal structures had been intensified across the city by the civic body, in the first week of August. At the time, as per the PMC anti-encroachment department, flying squads were set up in 15 ward offices and around 300 people, including civic staff and contractual workers, were pressed into service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/encroachments-off-dengle-bridge-annoy-commuters/articleshow/88440814.cms||---

The Hindu Raksha Maha Agadi now has 265 member organisations. “Let any party form the government, even a coalition government is acceptable, but the chief minister should be a Hindu, as nearly 70% of Goa’s population is Hindu. Additionally, support should go to Hindu candidates in 34 constituencies in the state, which have Hindu population in the majority,” the resolution stated. The Hindu Raksha Maha Agadi was formed recently, under the initiative of former long-time Goa RSS chief Subhash Velingkar. “Across the country as well as in Goa the atmosphere is being vitiated in the name of secularism. There are attempts to appoint non-Hindus on the managing committees of temples, there are attempts of take over of temple properties,” said Velingkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hindu-orgs-seek-cm-from-community/articleshow/88441487.cms||---

Students contended that the NEP 2020 would widen the gap between those from marginalised communities and others. Aishe Ghosh, president of the JNUSU, said, “The admission intake policies do not heed the social conditions in India. It dismisses the struggles of students from deprived backgrounds who do not get a fair start at education. Many first-generation learners and aspirants overcome several odds in pursuing higher education. Central universities should not be gatekeeping education, which is a right of all.” Earlier, the JNUSU had also raised concerns over the viva-voce, which were held for PhD admissions at the varsity. At the protest, the students’ body also demanded that the JNU administration introduce deprivation points for PhD admissions. “The NEP 2020 betrays the very ethos of public-funded education in the country and poses the threat of widening the gap that exists between students from marginalised communities and others.What happened in JNU during the viva-voce was only another instance of a long-standing culture of bias against the disadvantages,” Ghosh said. Students’ organisations like the Students’ Federation of India, All India Students’ Association and Krantikari Yuva Sangathan also joined the demonstration. TNN The JNU administration had earlier dismissed discrimination claims during the PhD admission process. “The members of the PhD selection committee who conduct the viva-voce are not provided with the information regarding the categories of the candidates in order to eliminate any bias and prejudice whatsoever.

Moreover, lack of access to mRNA vaccines has made us decide to wait,” Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil one of the members of NTAGI told TOI on Wednesday. “Children’s vaccination should not be a priority now,” he said. “We have registered deaths among children due to cancer, leukaemia and other diseases, where children tested positive, but those deaths cannot be attributed to Covid-19,” he added. Virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said that until there was high coverage among those in older age groups and those with comorbidities, there was no reason to look at vaccination for children. “Ultimately, we will vaccinate children even though the risk of severe disease in children is low, but we should have access to other vaccine platforms as well, particularly the mRNA vaccines,” she said. “There is also a worry that if we allow vaccination for children, we will lose focus on other age groups, like those who are more vulnerable, the elderly and those with co-morbidities,” she said. “Given the low vaccination numbers in India, and high seropositivity rates in most placesI think we can afford to wait,” Kang added. However state paediatric task force experts and child specialists hope the decision to vaccinate children will be taken soon. Child specialist and task force member Dr Pramod Jog told TOI that there is a need for starting pediatric vaccinations early. "All children (being unvaccinated) are a susceptible cohort for Covid 19 (of whichever variant). While children by and large have only a mild disease themselves, a small number of them can get sick enough to require hospitalization (as has been seen in South Africa of late),''he said. He further added that the protection from Covid 19 by vaccination is not complete, it can still mitigate the severity of disease in children so that they can be managed at home, and this will prevent a load on the health services. "Also, even though children have mild disease, they can act as a reservoir to infect adults who may have worse consequences and increased morbidity and mortality. Although children have shown a sero-prevalence of antibodies around 70 percent even without vaccination, if the new emerging variants have immune escape mechanisms to cause infection in them, it can only be reduced by vaccination. "I feel for all these reasons, children’s vaccination against Covid 19 is highly desirable and not be delayed any further.''he stated. The task force member added that DNA vaccine ZyCov-D is safe for children in the age group of 12-18 while mRNA vaccines have already been used in children abroad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/advisory-group-favours-wait-watch-on-jabs-for-children/articleshow/88440811.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Ahmedabad||Saptak window smaller, you’ll still see the stars||AHMEDABAD: At Saptak-2022, the music of India’s titans will be consecrated by the undertone of homage to Pandit Rajan Mishra. Pandit Mishra, the Banaras Gharana grandee, died of Covid in April this year. But a measure of his imperishable brilliance will be evoked at Saptak in the renditions of his Ahmedabad disciple, Viraj Amar. “It will be a difficult experience because I always sought guruji’s permission and guidance before any performance,” Amar told TOI. India’s longest music conference, held between January 1 and 13, has had its notes modulated by Covid in other ways too. The 2022 edition will feature a truncated daily programme. “Three baithaks will be presented on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays,” said Sandeep Joshi, the Saptak secretary. “On other days, there will be only two.” The exception is January 5, a Wednesday on which Amdavadi sitarist Amita Dalal opens the evening and two other artists follow. Four baithaks per day was the Saptak hallmark in the pre-corona era. Another change for Saptak is reflected in the timings. Usually the first artist took the stage at 8.30pm, but the 2022 event will start at 7.30pm. Corona has sounded a dirge, but India’s greatest artists will perform live at Saptak to affirm the Latin aphorism “Ars longa, vita brevis”. Roughly translated it means: art is eternal, though life is short. Select Amdavadi rasikas will be able to cherish, in person, the expositions of stalwarts such as Shubha Mudgal, Pandit Birju Maharaj, and Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/saptak-window-smaller-youll-still-see-the-stars/articleshow/88441435.cms||Kannan Somasundaram

---||Kochi||Kerala: High-level conspiracy in Alappuzha murders, says ADGP||KOTTAYAM: Days after two back-to-back political murders rocked Alappuzha district, it has now become almost clear that the murders were executed after high-level planning. Speaking to reporters in Alappuzha on Wednesday, ADGP Vijay Sakhare said that a high-level conspiracy was behind both the murders. The arrest of the five SDPI activists, who were taken into custody in connection with the murder of BJP OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan, was recorded on Wednesday. According to Alappuzha district police chief G Jaidev, the five were arrested for destroying evidence and for being part of the conspiracy. The arrested include Arshad Navas, 22, a native of Mannanchery ward seven, Ali Ahmed, 18, Asif Sudheer Achu, 19, Nishad, 36, all three natives of Mannanchery ward 17, and Sudheer, 34, a native of Mannanchery ward two. They were remanded in judicial custody. Among the four bikes taken into custody by police, it was found that two were used by the assailants of Ranjith. A few men were taken into custody from Cherthala in connection with SDPI state secretary K S Shan’s murder on Wednesday evening. They are being interrogated. When asked about the complaint raised by SDPI leaders during the all-party peace meet that the SDPI activists, who were taken into police custody, were made to chant ‘Jai Sri Ram’ slogans, Sakhare said that he is ready to quit his position if the allegation could be proved. He also said that those arrested don’t have direct involvement with the murders. The ones in custody are those who helped the assailants. A statewide raid is being conducted as part of the probe, Sakhare added. Ranjith Sreenivasan, 44, was murdered in Alappuzha town at around 6:30 am on Sunday after around 12 armed men barged into his house and hacked him to death in front of his wife, mother and younger daughter. Ranjith was murdered just a few hours after Shan was murdered. Two RSS men were earlier arrested and remanded in judicial custody in connection with Shan’s murder. The probe team was permitted custody of these two for a period of three days by the court on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/high-level-conspiracy-in-both-murders/articleshow/88440848.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Quality, process of construction under scanner||Ahmedabad: Some crucial questions need to be answered by the state roads and building department, now appointed to look into the three-layered bridge deck collapse incident at Mumatpura near South Bopal late on Wednesday. The bridge was being constructed by Ranjit Buildcon Ltd. An AUDA press release claimed that, during the post-tensioning process, when the pressure gauge released the tension on the steel tendons running through the concrete, the concrete deck broke and collapsed. The questions now being raised are whether the concrete was strong enough or ready to undergo post-tensioning? Did any of the 24 steel tendons running through the hardened concrete snap while the pressure gauge pulled the tendons? What was the quality of various parts of the devices used in the post-tensioning or concrete stressing activity, like the condition of the bearing plate, locker plate, extra collar, tension jack, master/pulling plate, master grip and even quality of the steel strand or tendons used in the girders. “Material samples from the site will be tested in our state roads and building department labs to ascertain whether the quality of the raw material was maintained or not,” said a senior AUDA engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/quality-process-of-construction-under-scanner/articleshow/88441466.cms||---
---||Delhi||Full rollout of Intelligent Traffic System on EPE||New Delhi: The Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) will finally see the complete roll out of the Intelligent Traffic System (ITS) from Thursday. With 143 cameras to monitor the traffic movement and 28 video incident detection cameras, the 135 km expressway has got the system which can detect any incident and receive alerts to ensure that an ambulance reaches the spot within 10-15 minutes. The ITS system has been integrated with the NIC for automatic generation of E-challans for traffic rule violators on this expressway where the maximum speed limit is 120 kmph for cars. Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the ITS system on the 6-lane expressway on Thursday and he will also officially inaugurate the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, which has Asia's heaviest Rail Over Bridge (ROB) having 16 lanes. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had bid out the work of ITS on the expressway connecting Kundli with Palwal via Ghaziabad in 2018, but it was delayed due to several reasons. This project has been taken up with funding and technical assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) as a pilot on any NH network. Sources said for real time monitoring a big video wall has been put at the control centre where 10 operators are deployed to monitor and provide assistance to the emergency response team. The corridor has also got 30 variable message signs that display the real time ambient air quality. NHAI officials said the roll out of ITS on EPE and the official inauguration of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway will bring a new era of travelling experience on NHs in the National Capital Region. They said the work on Asia’s heaviest ROB at Chipiyana Buzurg in Ghaziabad will be completed by March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/full-rollout-of-intelligent-traffic-system-on-epe/articleshow/88441479.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Pune||Daily average vaccination dips again in Maharashtra in December 15-21 period||PUNE: The state’s average vaccination per day dropped by over a lakh in the seven-day period ending on December 21 when about one crore beneficiaries are due for their second dose and Omicron cases are on the rise. The state was vaccinating close to 7.04 lakh people per day till the week ending on December 14. It dropped to 5.34 lakh per day in the December 15-21 week, the public health department’s vaccination data revealed. The department has put in place various measures to boost daily jabs. But officials at the Covid vaccination hubs are now expressing helplessness to convince people to get their pending doses despite starting call centres. “The Omicron fear seems to have waned. We were seeing an average of over 100 people per day at most of our Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) after the reports of Omicron surfaced. This number dropped by half in the last four-five days. Constant phone calls to beneficiaries due for their second shots sometimes do not help in convincing them. Some beneficiaries have surpassed 100 days after their due date, but they still do not want to come forward,” Anjali Tilekar, a medical officer from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s Kothrud ward office, told TOI. A state health department official said, “The drop in the last week may have been due to local issues. Perhaps, the ongoing marriage season could be one. We have fully vaccinated over 7.9 crore of the eligible population with the first dose and expect to inoculate the remaining 1.24 crore by December-end.” The official said the state was doing an average of over seven lakh vaccinations per day if the December 1-20 period was taken into consideration, he added. Tilekar said all medical officers had received the due list of beneficiaries in their jurisdiction and phone calls were being placed to convince them to get their pending shots. Dr Sidram K Raut, director, Noble Hospitals, Pune, told TOI, “Initially, we saw a rise in vaccination numbers at the hospital after reports of Omicron. Other private sites had also seen an increase. But the situation currently has gone back to what it was a few months ago, when the number of jabs administered at private sites had fallen drastically. We have 1,000 unused doses and their expiry date is fast approaching.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/daily-average-vaccination-dips-again-in-maharashtra-in-december-15-21-period/articleshow/88440829.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||FC Goa keen to start a new chapter with Derrick at the helm||Panaji: The Juan Ferrando era has ended at FC Goa, rather abruptly. Just like Sergio Lobera before him, the parting of ways hasn’t been amicable, and just like the summer of 2020, it’s time for the experienced Derrick Pereira to take charge. He’s used to this. The experienced coach turned around Churchill Bros’ fortunes in the I-League in 2017 when they were languishing at the bottom with half the matches already played. When Lobera parted ways, the club’s technical director was a natural choice to fill the void. Now, when Ferrando opted to switch allegiance to ATK Mohun Bagan without notice, the club dialled Derrick’s number. “It was a shocking call for me, never expected that I would be in-charge of FC Goa team, whose aim is to always be on top,” Derrick told reporters on Thursday. “I am putting my thoughts into place, trying to see what we can do to achieve our goal. We have a match (on Friday). We need to focus, and I am sure, with players working hard, we will get the results.” For now, Derrick is speaking with the players and planning strategy from the confines of his hotel room. He is eager to step out and get on the field. “I had discussions with (assistant coach) Clifford (Miranda) who is taking care of the sessions right now and I have made clear my thoughts, which are the areas to improve. I don’t want to make too many changes. Yes, there are areas (of concern) defensively and going forward as well. We are working on organising our team in attack and defence,” said Derrick. Goa will kickstart the new era with a clash against Odisha FC at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Friday and their reaction will be keenly watched. “The players are professionals. There are lot of issues, off the field and on the field, but as professionals, we have to overcome the problems and find solutions. “I spoke with the senior players and they know what they have to do. I am sure, as professionals, we will overcome this situation as quickly as possible. We are working on this, trying to create an atmosphere where we can get back to winning ways, get the belief, mentality, so that we can become one of the best team,” said Derrick. At least till now, Goa have not looked like a champion side, or even one of the better teams in the league this season. They are placed eighth with seven points from their first six matches. Odisha are just a spot above them, pegged back by three defeats in their last four matches. Odisha finished at the bottom last season but with new foreign signings and coach Kiko Ramirez at the helm, they appeared to have turned the corner when they won three of their first four matches this season. Then, it all went south. “I am not focusing on what happened in the previous games. We have to look ahead. We need to pick up points in the first part of the league,” said Ramirez. Odisha have conceded eight goals in their last four games, something that should be a cause for concern, particularly against Goa, known for their attacking style. “Maybe it is good for the neutrals, but as a coaching unit, our main priority is not letting in goals in any game. We need to work hard and implement our strategies in the game," said Ramirez.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fc-goa-keen-to-start-a-new-chapter-with-derrick-at-the-helm/articleshow/88461949.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

The HC bench of Justices P B Varale and S M Modak, while hearing the petition alleging breach of court orders by those who were on protest for the past 55 days, directed MSRTC to “permit those showing willingness to resume duty” and to arrange for their medical tests before taking them in. The HC told MSRTC to report compliance of these directions on January 5 by filing an affidavit. Lead counsel for MSRTC S U Kamdar said only 25-30% of staff had resumed and the only demand yet to be sanctioned is of the merger with the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/striking-msrtc-staff-cant-mourn-indefinitely-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/88441899.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Aurangabad||112 Service: Aurangabad on top for response time||Aurangabad: The Aurangabad city police have emerged on top in the statein terms of response time to the calls received from 112 Emergency Response Support System. The city has clocked an average response time of 28 minute and 41 seconds for closing each of the hundreds of calls. Aurangabad commissioner of police Nikhil Gupta attributed the achievement to the team effort put in by the subordinates. “We are working on to further improve the response time, and set a benchmark for ourselves,” he said. Echoing similar views, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Aparna Gite said the amount of efforts taken in imparting training and rewarding the police personnel responding to each call has gone a long way in achieving the feat. As per the obtained stats, Aurangabad city is is followed by Washim district police with a response time of 30 minutes 20 seconds, Nanded (30 minutes 42 seconds), Latur (35 minutes and 20 minutes, Parbhani (36 minutes and 50 minutes), Buldhana (38 minutes and 27 seconds), Nashik city (41 minutes and 35 sec) and Navi Mumbai (45 minutes and 6 seconds). Several police units including Pune city, Pune rural, Yavatmal, Wardha, Solapur rural have clocked a response time of over one hour. Under the emergency 112 service, every call dialled gets connected either to the command and control centres in Navi Mumbai or Nagpur. The response time is calculated from the time of receiving a call from 112 command and control room to the time of closing the call by following the standard operating procedure. Each of the 17 police stations in the city have been allotted a four-wheeler and one two-wheeler dedicated to the 112 service and have deployed a total of 254 constables for the service team. Citing that out of 1,333 calls dialled on 112 from Aurangabad city, 1250 were taken up by mobile device terminal (MDT) installed in 112 patrolling vehicles, police inspector (wireless) Satish Joshi said Aurangabad city’s record was 94% — third in the state. Here, Solapur rural bagged the top slot in the state with 96% followed by Amravati city at 95%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/112-service-aurangabad-on-top-for-response-time/articleshow/88438552.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Some CBSE schools flout rules, ‘coercing’ parents for offline classes||Nagpur: In a blatant violation of government rules, some CBSE schools in Nagpur are forcing parents to send their children to school. While reopening in physical mode is permissible for Std I-XII in the district, there are clear instructions given that physical attendance is not mandatory. TOI has been informed by parents about at least four well-known CBSE schools, of which three are located within city limits, that are sending written or verbal messages during online classes or parent-teacher meet. Teachers are threatening parents that online classes will be stopped and only offline mode will continue. A parent said, “They say offline classes will stop in January and there will be no other option to study. So now, parents have no choice but to comply with these orders.” Another parent said, “Who will take responsibility if something happens to our children? The school is not bothering about the primary section students’ health. The choice should be left to parents.” Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had given permission to all schools under its jurisdiction to reopen, but only if they adhere to SOPs and guidelines. In NMC’s letter, it was mentioned that both online and offline classes will continue. At least two schools from the above have sent written messages to parents that offline classes will be stopped. Priti Mishrikotkar, education officer (NMC), said, “There is absolute clarity about this clause. Online classes cannot be stopped because physical attendance is the choice of parents. Such schools shall be notified that forcing students back on campus is not allowed.” While it’s true that physical attendance is rising in high school sections across the district, some institutes are going beyond their brief and trying to force middle and primary sections to follow suit. A parent said there’s no problem if parents willingly send their wards and attendance increases. “My priority is the safety of my child. I am not against people attending in physical mode, but against denial of legally mandated online classes. Currently, schools are only threatening but if they implement this, I will definitely approach the court,” the parent said. CBSE too frowns upon its school violating guidelines. Since none of the schools in Nagpur have actually implemented that “threat”, CBSE officials did not want to make a statement. A senior official said, “We always say that schools must comply with whatever guidelines the government is giving. If that says that online classes must continue, then so be it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/some-cbse-schools-flout-rules-coercing-parents-for-offline-classes/articleshow/88440870.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The owner of the unit is accused of committing power theft of over Rs 3 lakh. Authorities said this is the first time that they have detected a case where a needle has been used to alter the functioning of an electricity meter. Authorities said the industrial unit situated in Sisodia Industrial Estate was inspected by the chief inspector of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) in August. Though it appeared that something was amiss, nothing was found on the spot. The only major thing noticed by MSEDCL’s staffer was a non-functional display screen and pin or a needle-like substance used for pricking in the meter’s scroll. The meter was seized and sent for inspection at its technical lab, only to find that a needle was allegedly being used to commit power theft. The probe has revealed that the suspect allegedly stole over 25, 000 units of electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/industrial-unit-owner-booked-for-power-theft/articleshow/88439273.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The RTPCR report of Akhilesh, however, was found to be negative. Giving information about her status, Dimple Yadav tweeted “I am fully vaccinated and asymptomatic, but still I have isolated myself after the covid test report came positive and request people who have met me recently to get themselves tested soon.” Soon after the test report arrived, the health department swung into action and a team was sent to her residence for contact tracing. Dr Milind Vardhan, district surveillance officer (DIO), said that the daughter mother duo have isolated themselves at home and the health department team was monitoring their health. “The test of the daughter was done on December 19 after she developed a fever and the mother's sample was given for the test on Tuesday night. Both the tests were done by a private lab. As of now, the daughter has mild symptoms, whereas the mother is asymptomatic. Their samples have been sent for genome sequencing,” he said. Other three patients who were diagnosed with the disease were residents of Kursi Road, Cantonment area and Alambagh respectively. The Kursi Road resident had recently visited Himachal Pradesh and got himself tested after developing a cough and sore throat. The men from Cantonment and Alambagh were found infected during a random sampling drive. Meanwhile, at least 28,331 people took the jab against Covid-19 in Lucknow on Wednesday. While 22,540 people took the second dose, 5,791 got the first. Among those vaccinated with first or second shots, 56% were men and 44% women.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Police treating SDPI with kid gloves, says BJP||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: BJP has accused the state police again of dealing SDPI with kid gloves. BJP state president K Surendran here on Wednesday claimed that police had set free an ambulance that was taken into custody with armed SDPI cadres on the day OBC Morcha state secretary Ranjith Sreenivasan was murdered in Alappuzha. Surendran said the ambulance that ferried the criminal gang was used as a hearse vehicle to carry the body of the slain SDPI leader KS Shan. The ambulance, he claimed, had come from Thrithala in Palakkad district, whereas SDPI operates a fleet of ambulances in Alappuzha district. “How come an ambulance from Irumbakassery in Thrithala carried the dead body of the SDPI leader, despite the organization having several ambulances in Alappuzha district? A murder attempt, similar to the one carried out against Ranjith had occurred in Irumbakassery two years ago. The limbs of BJP worker Manoj were broken using a hammer. It’s the same way Ranjith was killed,” alleged Surendran. Surendran wanted the police to probe the role of Ambalappuzha MLA H Salam in connection with the murder. “Even CPM leaders say that Salam is an SDPI cadre. In private, SDPI too has concurred with it. Police should probe whether Salam tried to help the culprits. The state leaders of PFI-SDPI are involved in the widespread attacks. The role of SDPI state president in Ranjith’s murder should be probed,” he said. Surendran said police were trying to save the SDPI cadres by publicizing the vehicle checking plans and raids. Police didn’t register a case even after a provocative demonstration was held in the night before Ranjith’s murder. “Only three persons have been arrested in the RSS worker Sanjith murder case. SDPI killed 16 RSS workers in the last six years,” he said.

After initial enrolment, the gang used to charge a payment of Rs 650 online from each person. According to police, over 10,000 people have fallen prey to the fake website till date. The customer data was also being stolen and sold, they said. According to DCP (central) Shweta Chauhan, the arrested men have been identified as Ankit Kumar (26) from Amroha and Manmohan Singh (22) from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. The accused were running a fake website in the name of voteridcard.ebharatseva.in, police said. An FIR was registered after a person filed a complaint that he had to get some alterations done in his Voter ID card for which he searched online. He found a website wherein he was directed to a payment gateway for paying Rs 650 as mandatory charges. After making the payment, he received emails from the ID info@ebharatseva.in stating that the payment was successful and his application was being processed. The victim was told that an executive would contact him shortly, but there was no response after that. The victim became suspicious and starting probing this. He found out that the election commission’s official website was different form the one he had logged on to and approached the cops for help. During investigation, the money trail and the website registration details were obtained and it was established that these activities were being done by a fraudster on a very large scale. It was found that the payment was processed through Razorpay payment gateway, which was further credited to an account registered in the name of Titu Cyber Cafe. As per bank details, the proprietor was identified as Manmohan Singh. A raid was conducted and the accused was arrested. He led the cops to his aide, Amit. The duo disclosed during interrogation that one Kanav Kapoor from Noida had roped them into the scam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gang-charging-fees-for-voter-id-changes-busted/articleshow/88441520.cms||---

NMC’s medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje told TOI that they had conducted the Covid tests randomly at various schools since the re-opening of educational institutes for classes I to VII on December 13. “We will continue to carry out this exercise as a part of our endeavour to monitor the health of the students and teachers, who have started attending classes after over one-and-half year. The random tests will also enable us to isolate those testing positive. It is reassuring that there has been no Covid positive case in any of the city schools,” he added. NMC health authorities added that a student or a teacher did not remain indoors prior to reopening of the schools. “They could have been infected even before the schools reopened and their Covid tests would have been positive even if they were tested in the first week after reopening of the schools,” they added. In the meantime, the Nashik Zilla Parishad has directed the taluka medical officers of all the 15 talukas to conduct random RT-PCR tests at the 79 residential schools spread in rural Nashik.

Addressing media persons at Tenhipalam on Wednesday, he said that while district police chiefs are being controlled by CPM district committees, the inspectors of police were controlled by the party area committees. “The police have become very inactive. During the all-party peace meet in Alappuzha held on Tuesday, even the CPM district secretary had questioned the inaction on the part of the police,” he said. Satheesan said that the control exerted by the CPM on the police was weakening the force. “The party is interfering in all cases. The cell rule has become a reality in its true sense now. Because of this, the police are not able to foresee the situations in advance and take proper action. Police has become a scarecrow when goonda activities, political murders, communal murders and communal conflicts are taking place,” he said. Responding to a question, Satheesan said that the party state unit was planning to complete the organizational reconstitution exercise soon after the completion of Christmas and New Year holiday season. He said that currently there were no issues between senior party leaders over the party’s organizational revamp. Satheesan said that Congress will organize a satyagraha in Alappuzha against the murders that have taken place there. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-ops-freedom-for-cops-due-to-cpm-meddling/articleshow/88440871.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Executive-turned-cyber thug dupes senior doctors in Lucknow, held||LUCKNOW: A medical representative who took to crime became a hardcore cyber thug after losing his job during the pandemic, duping senior doctors in big cities by luring them to visit Dubai, Europe and US for attending conferences and family jaunts. He was arrested in the city on Wednesday. The accused, Vishal Pandey, a native of West Bengal, had worked with top pharmaceutical companies and claims to have travelled to over 35 countries. Pandey revealed that had lost his job after which he contacted the gangs of cyber fraudsters operating from infamous Jamtara town in Jharkhand to procure SIM cards and bank accounts on fake identities and then used them to con doctors. A senior cardiologist in the state capital had lodged a complaint informing police that Vishal Pandey had duped him of over Rs 3 lakh after luring him to attend a paid conference in Dubai and asked for money to buy air tickets for his wife and arrange other facilities during their visit. “After the doctor lodged a case at Mahanagar police station, the accused started threatening him. He even made a video call on WhatsApp and challenged the doctor to get him arrested. The cyber team of Mahanagar police started tracking the accused and arrested him,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, north zone, Prachi Singh. Vishal revealed that since he had worked as a medical representative, he knew several senior doctors and knew how to convince them in conversation and by dropping names. He said he started targeting doctors as they gave him money easily. “After taking money through online bank transfer, he used to send genuine air tickets to a foreign country to the victims to win their trust and then sought more money for arranging additional facilities. He then used to cancel the tickets and switched off his phone,” the ADCP said. The accused told police that he used to lure the doctors with several other facilities in foreign countries during their stay and used to charge for the same in advance, Singh added. Vishal’s hometown is 80km from Jamtara and he easily got in touch with the gangs there. Police said Vishal had earlier been arrested for duping a doctor in Chhattisgarh of Rs 8 lakh by promising to send him to Germany on a high-paying assignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/exec-turned-cyber-thug-dupes-senior-docs-held/articleshow/88441533.cms||---

Over 200 connections have been snapped by the civic body in the current financial year over non-payment of dues, of which, most were in recent weeks. Prashant Pandat, property tax superintendent, said, “We have set a target of Rs 70 crore for the current financial year from water tax. So far, we have recovered Rs 30 crore and have a herculean task to recover the remaining amount in the next three months. Therefore, we are intensifying the drive against the defaulters. We will also make the names of the big defaulters public in coming days. It is difficult to manage the public water supply system as the expenses are increasing with every passing year.” The water supply department has suffered heavy losses during the last two years of Covid pandemic as the consumers did not pay the tax bills stating poor financial condition. But now for the last few months, the pandemic has eased and the officials expect good collection of dues. “The consumers are demanding to allow the payment in installments. Though it is not legally allowed and no such decision has been taken, we are allowing the consumers to pay the dues in three to four installments, but without waiving the late charge and fine,” Pandat said. Last year, the KMC recovered 60% of the water tax target. The recovery of water tax from government offices continues to be poor for last several years and the amount has increased to Rs 25 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kmc-starts-cutting-defaulters-water-supply/articleshow/88438568.cms||---
---||Delhi||SN Mkt revamp: NDMC panel to talk to traders||New Delhi: To get the market associations’ support before initiating upgradation of common areas and other redevelopment work in Sarojini Nagar Market, New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has formed a committee of elected members. They will coordinate with the associations, said NDMC vice-chairman Satish Upadhyay. Redevelopment of Sarojini Nagar was discussed in the council’s meeting on Wednesday. Member Girish Sachdeva said that different meetings were earlier held with National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) and a detailed plan would now be made in consultation with all stakeholders. “We will hold meetings with all stakeholders before taking any decision. Unlike other neighbouring markets owned by NDMC where shops are given on lease, shopkeepers own the shops in Sarojini Nagar. We want to have their consensus either for making the plan for overall redevelopment of the market or for upliftment of common areas to improve the aesthetic of the market,” he said. Sachdeva added that they have plans for improving the parking area, pavements and giving a uniform facade to the market. “Congestion is an issue faced by the visitors here. For their convenience, we can redevelop the pedestrian walkways/corridors and beautify the park/green belt in addition to improving the parking system. There is a pink toilet constructed here for the convenience of visitors and it will become operational soon,” said the NDMC member, adding that the market is visited by thousands of people every day. A group of traders said that they were against any plan for redeveloping the market into a mall. “By doing this, the market will lose its identity. A proposal was discussed with us by the council officials long back, but we disagreed. However, we have no issues with improving common facilities here such as making corridors,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Mini Market Sarojini Nagar. During the meeting, the council members also suggested seeking a detailed plan from NBCC, before initiating the redevelopment project of three markets, including Ring Road, Netaji Nagar and Netaji Nagar Suvidha Market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sn-mkt-revamp-ndmc-panel-to-talk-to-traders/articleshow/88441536.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Nashik||Dist admin seeks nod to study Covid at Malegaon||Nashik: The Nashik district administration has written to additional chief secretary, public health department Dr Pradeep Kumar Vyas, seeking his permission to carry out Covid-related tests in Malegaon town to find out the reason behind the very low number of active cases despite low vaccine and non-compliance of covid appropriate behaviour in the town. “Malegaon is a unique case study. The town is very congested and was the hotspot of covid infection in the initial period of first wave of covid. The number of active cases was very low even during the peak of the second wave and has been in single digits for the last several months,” a senior officer from Nashik district administration said. According to the health officials, Malegaon Municipal Corporation (MMC) has 4.57 lakh population eligible for vaccination but only about 1.9 lakh people or 41% have taken their first shot of vaccine. Only 87,000 or 19% have been vaccinated fully. A sero-survey carried out in the past showed less than 25% immunity in the sample tested. “The vaccination is low when compared to Nashik district, where at least 81% of the eligible population has received first dose. The covid appropriate behaviour is also not followed very well. Despite this, the cases are low and hence it is a study,” the officer said. The Maharashtra University Health Sciences (MUHS) led by vice-chancellor Lt Gen Madhuri Kanitkar (Retd), who had carried out a study - SUTRA: An Approach to Modelling Pandemics with Asymptomatic Patients, and Applications to COVID-19, has also agreed to carry out some tests and studies in Malegaon to draw conclusion for the current situation. The modalities are being worked out by the MUHS and by the next month, the varsity will come up with its plan. Approimately Rs 25 lakh would be required for the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dist-admin-seeks-nod-to-study-covid-at-malegaon/articleshow/88439292.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Charges filed in Rohini court shootout case||NEW DELHI: A chargesheet has been filed by police against five criminals in the Rohini District Courts Complex shootout case in which jailed gangster Jitender Gogi was killed by two armed assailants hired by his rival, Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu. The two hitmen, who were dressed as lawyers, were shot dead in the same courtroom by police. The shootout took place on September 24 around 1.20pm. The charges against the two shooters, Rahul Fafunda and Jagdeep Jagga, were abated due to their death. A probe confirmed that Tajpuria had orchestrated the hit after hatching a plot in Mandoli Jail, where he was lodged. Five people — Vinay Yadav (20), Umang Yadav (26), Sunil Baliyan alias Tillu, Naveen Dabas and Ashish Kumar (30) — were later arrested. The chargesheet was filed on December 17 after police collected all physical, oral, material and technical evidence against the accused. One of the hitmen was so radicalised that he had “Tillu” tattooed on his forehand. Vinay and Umang were arrested from a flat around 3km away from the court. The flat was rented by the shooters a few months ago to conduct a recce of the court premises. The probe also revealed that the shooters were given training by Umang on how to act like lawyers in the court. Umang told police that he was also present in the court wearing a lawyer’s attire to help the two shooters. He said Tajpuria had asked him to help the two shooters, who had come to his flat on September 20. After conducting a recce, they went to a mall in Rohini to change into lawyer’s attire. Umang, being an LLB student, already had the dress. The presence of another shooter was not ruled out by police, but he was sent back by the accused. After getting information about his arch rival’s murder, Tajpuria informed others and started singing. He coordinated the attack from jail through VoIP calls. He destroyed the handset after the incident, police mentioned in the chargesheet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charges-filed-in-rohini-court-shootout-case/articleshow/88441545.cms||---
---||India||Protests an exception, taking part in House is the rule: MPs to Sonia||NEW DELHI: Many Congress MPs cutting across state lines on Wednesday told the party leadership that they should use the Parliament floor to put across their points of view on issues and disruptions should only be in exceptional circumstances, reiterating the point they made on the first day of the winter session at a strategy meeting. As Sonia Gandhi met party MPs state wise to discuss the winter session and seek their views on future, it is learnt that members in the Kerala and Tamil Nadu group said the party should join the proceedings as a rule. Some MPs said protests can be resorted to in important situations, with SIT report on Lakhimpur Kheri and the demand for the resignation of junior home minister Ajay Mishra Teni being one such case. Otherwise, they felt that it was a waste of time, an MP in the meeting said. Some Lok Sabha members have been arguing lately that their views, and not just of the Rajya Sabha wing, should be taken into account on strategy. The leadership had agreed with the views of the members, as a result of which the LS functioned normally despite the pressure of boycott over the suspensions in RS. However, the SIT report on Kheri massacre forced the party to protest. Sources said even the DMK and TMC were in favour of pressing for Teni’s resignation. In RS too, the party joined the debates in the first week till the government refused to relent on suspensions and there was pressure from suspended members to protest. One Tamil Nadu MP told Sonia that the opposition was being sidetracked by multiple provocations being thrown by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/protests-an-exception-taking-part-in-house-is-the-rule-mps-to-sonia/articleshow/88442401.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Delhi||Guest teachers bicker over ‘right’ protest||New Delhi: Two days before the All India Guest Teachers Association (AIGTA) was to protest outside deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's residence, another union of guest teachers — Dilli Atithi Shikshak Sangh — held a press conference on Wednesday in support of the state government and decrying the AIGTA protest in which Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu participated as a baseless politicisation of an issue. In response to the Shikshak Sangh’s press conference at the media centre in Delhi Secretariat, AIGTA questioned how a private association could be allowed to hold a press at a government centre. The government’s media spokesperson did not provide any comment on the matter. Bhanu Priya, Shikshak Sangh office bearer, claimed that the condition of guest teachers in Delhi was far superior to that in other states. “The Kejriwal government has increased the salary of guest teachers from around Rs 15,000 to Rs 35,000. The government also passed a bill on October 4, 2017 to make guest teachers permanent though that file is currently with the lieutenant governor,” said Priya. “There was a time when we had to fill annual forms to save our jobs. We could teach one year, but the very next year find our names missing from the list of guest teachers.” Since Kejriwal has promised guest teachers in poll bound Punjab of regularisation of service, AIGTA has been also agitating for the permanent appointment promised in 2015. There are around 22,000 guest teachers working in Delhi government schools. Anjana Rathi said, “The salary of a Delhi guest teacher is significantly higher than in other states. Protests are being held here by people who are not even employed and are only interested in politics. Politicians from Punjab are flocking to Delhi but back in their state, guest teachers are on the verge of committing suicide.” The Shikshak Singh members also cited the 60-year-policy formulated by Delhi government after guest teachers staged a massive protest in 2019. That matter too is pending at the LG’s office. Anjana alleged, “People claiming to be guest teachers have begun to hold protests, clearly indicating politicisation of our cause. Such people are here to deceive us and our colleagues. I humbly request such people to stop this trickery and not malign the image of a teacher.” In its statement, AIGTA countered, “The group of people calling them guest teachers are volunteers of AAP. This is a planned move of the state government to hide the exploitation of guest teachers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/guest-teachers-bicker-over-right-protest/articleshow/88441583.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

As per the Supreme Court orders, the state government has announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to the kin of each of those who died due to Covid. During the process of filing papers, the relatives have to present information of the deceased, including Covid test and death reports But there are instances in which death has happened later – either due to lung fibrosis or mucormycosis — after the person might have been cured of Covid infection. There are cases when the death happens during the treatment. But there are cases when a patient recovered from Covid but the damage is done to his or her lungs or other organs leading to the person’s death. Such deaths are recorded in the ICMR portal, said the collector. Nashik district has recorded 84 deaths due to mucormycosis and they have been included in the ICMR list. However, there may be some who may have been treated for a similar disease and the person might have succumbed to the disease. “In such cases, the relatives can approach the district disaster management office and seek the help of the officer. If there is no such entry with the portal, the people can present the death certificate and doctor’s ‘inference’ that links the cause of the serious conditions like renal failure, heart attack or mucormycosis to Covid. In such cases, the relatives will be given all the help required so that they get the ex-gratia amount,” said the collector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/covid-linked-mucor-deaths-fit-for-ex-gratia/articleshow/88439309.cms||Abhilash Botekar

But his absence is not something that’s new. Thackeray was not present at Mantralaya either, so this is something which people are used to,” said Danve, who was in the city on Wednesday. He reiterated that this remark must not be seen as a criticism of the CM’s health. “No one in BJP will ever utter anything against Thackeray’s health. We all want him to get better,” said Danve. However, apart from the ‘disclaimer’, Danve did not spare Thackeray from political attack. “Ever since he became the CM, we have hardly seen him on the field — be it election campaigning or party work. The issue is that this government is formed of three political parties and they do not want to take any decision. So in such a situation, it does not matter if the CM comes to office or not,” said Danve. He refuted allegations that the PM too is not ‘visible’ in the Parliament. “Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi is coming to the House. But now opposition must stop creating hurdles in smooth functioning of the House,” said Danve. On a host of other issues, Danve first took up the Aadhaar card and voter ID linking subject. “The central government wants only genuine voters cast their ballot. We want to get rid of bogus voters and ensure an even more transparent election,” said Danve. On a recent statement by a right wing leader which mentioned Hyderabad as Bhagyanagar, Danve said, “We feel that the name given by conquerors from outside should be done away with. That’s why we strongly support that Aurangabad be called Sambhaji Nagar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cms-absence-in-session-is-nothing-new-danve/articleshow/88440886.cms||---

Athiroopatha Samrakshana Samithi, a body of priests in the archdiocese, said in a statement that they will be observing the fast at the major archbishop’s house at Broadway, Ernakulam. “Our biggest happiness and peace is the mass celebrated versus populum (Latin for towards the people). We strongly condemn the efforts of the major archbishop and other synod bishops to cancel the exemption which was granted to us by Pope Francis through metropolitan vicar Mar Antony Kariyil,” the priests said in the statement. It further said that bishops who intend to come to the churches in the archdiocese to celebrate Holy Mass in the new format should drop the plan. “The laity and priests here would only allow the mass in the traditional format,” said Fr Sebastian Thaliyan, the convener of the priests’ organization. In the Syro-Malabar Church, various dioceses had been following different modes of celebrating Holy Mass, an obvious difference being the priest facing the churchgoers during the ceremony in some dioceses and facing the altar in other dioceses. The unified way is a combination of both, and it was set to come into effect from November 28 across the Church. But the metropolitan vicar of Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese formally declared that he was granting an exception from the unified style of mass to the archdiocese as he received permission for it from Rome. His declaration was after a meeting with the Pope at the Vatican. Similar exception was then granted in Irinjalakuda diocese as well. Cardinal George Alencherry, however, on December 10 issued a direction to ‘correct’ the exemptions stating that the Church received a letter from Rome which stated that an entire archdiocese cannot be provided dispensation from implementing the liturgical rules approved by the synod. Irinjalakuda diocese withdrew the exemption after this direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/archdiocese-priests-to-go-on-hunger-strike-on-xmas-day/articleshow/88440893.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Long-drawn struggle, not requests & petitions won India freedom, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said India won Independence after a long-drawn struggle and did not get it through requests and petitions. “To inform the current and future generations about the values of freedom struggle, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the programme, ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’,” the CM said while addressing programme organised as part of the 75th year of India’s independence at KD Singh Babu Stadium. Even the chilling weather could not dampen the enthusiasm and synergy of 18,000 students from 75 schools, who participated in the mega celebrations of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav. Students presented Kathak, Kalaripayattu, and Krishna Raslila as part of ‘Vande Matram Yog Ewam Khel Kaushal Pradarshan’. Students also performed on patriotic stories involving freedom-struggle and formed the map of India as it existed before Independence to commemorate 100 years of Chauri Chaura. Addressing the students, the CM said: “India’s Independence was achieved through struggles and not by mere request. Today’s event has been organised to remember the resolutions taken by freedom-fighters whose sacrifice won us Independence.” “The freedom movement continued in the country at different intervals but collective efforts were seen in the First War of Independence in 1857. It is also important because its focal point was Uttar Pradesh,” he said. “Under the leadership of Mangal Pandey from Ballia, Bandhu Singh from Gorakhpur and Dharam Singh Kotwal from Meerut, the first struggle for freedom was carried out. With the determination of ‘I will not give my Jhansi’, Rani Laxmibai fought against the British with all her might,” Yogi said. The CM also remembered the contributions of Avanti Bai, Jhalkari Bai and Uda Devi. “Chauri Chuara and Kakori actions carried forward the flame of revolution. It is the result of the freedom struggle that today we have got an opportunity to celebrate the Amrit Mahotsav of country’s Independence,” Yogi said. The event was attended by war veterans, families of freedom-fighters and gallantry award winners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/long-drawn-struggle-not-requests-petitions-won-india-freedom-cm/articleshow/88441557.cms||---

The Board (BCCI) will provide a grant of Rs 100 crore for stadium construction,” GCA president Suraj Lotlikar told a gathering of over 80 clubs at the GCA Academy ground in Porvorim. The association has also received the support of chief minister Pramod Sawant. “I urge all of you to come together for cricket. Put an end to politics in sports. I promise to resolve the issue (lease of Porvorim ground) before the beginning of the new year. I also promise to extend all help in matters pertaining to the international cricket stadium,” said Sawant. Sports minister Manohar Ajgaonkar was delighted with the speed of groundwork done by GCA. The stadium comes up in Pernem, a constituency he represents. "When the international stadium is built, we will have job opportunities for locals. Adjoining facilities will also come up and the rural areas will see a lot of development," said Ajgaonkar. Uday Joshi & Associates Architects presented the plan for the 32,000-capacity stadium, to be constructed over an area of 2 lakh square metres. GCA secretary Vipul Phadke emphasised on continued efforts to build on the infrastructure with various MoUs. Phadke also credited the encouraging results in men's and women's cricket in the 2021 season to allround development undertaken by the GCA managing committee. The GCA secretary revealed plans to start 'centres of excellence' to boost preparations of the Under-19s and Ranji Trophy probables, while plans are also in place to revive the residential academy at Porvorim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rs-100-crore-bcci-grant-for-stadium-says-goa-cricket-association/articleshow/88462013.cms||---

Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg sought an explanation from the investigating officer (IO) and the deputy commissioner of police (Crime Branch) under the signatures of the special commissioner of police (Crime Branch) as to why appropriate action as per law be not taken against them for non-compliance of directions of the court. “No acknowledgement regarding supply of copies in terms of order dated 01.11.2021 has been placed on record by the IO, nor the IO as well as the learned special public prosecutor for State have appeared today in court. A perusal of file shows that the present matter is pending before this court since 22.06.2020 and the court is not able to commit the same to sessions court due to lackadaisical attitude of the police officials of PS Crime Branch and due to non-appearance of the SPP,” the court said in an order on December 20.

---||Nashik||Unvaccinated not allowed in govt establishments||Nashik: The district administration on Wednesday said all government and commercial establishments in Nashik will not allow the unvaccinated people in these premises from Thursday. “The district disaster management office has decided to carry out the ‘No vaccination no entry’ mission from December 23 under which no person without even a single dose of Covid vaccine will be allowed to enter these premises and hence would not get any service. The administration has been forced to take such measures because few people are yet to get their first dose. We appeal to them to get the vaccine shots,” said collector Suraj Mandhare. With many awareness campaigns and continuous efforts from the health department, more than 41 lakh people of the 51.75 lakh population in the district had received the first dose, but there are about 10 lakh people who have yet to take any of the doses, he said. “With the Omicron threat looming large across the globe, several countries are being forced to go into lockdown. If we have to prevent the situation here, we will have to fight Covid with our weapons available, including vaccine along with maintaining social distancing, sanitising and wearing masks,” he said. As per the orders, shopkeepers, officers of private and public establishments have to make all arrangements to ensure they only allow the entry of people who have at least taken one dose. The managers of some malls and multiplexes said they would have no problems in implementing the new rule, “Accesses to our mall are controlled and systems are in place to ensure restricting people, who have not taken the vaccine, from entering the premises,” said one of the officers of a mall. In the case of standalone shops, shopkeepers said they had no workforce to ensure the rule is implemented. “We will put up statutory boards outside the shops. Since we do not have any kind of arrangement to verify vaccination status, the administration may devise a way out,” said Prafulla Sancheti, the president of Nashik grain and grocery merchants’ association. “We will wait for a day and see how the administration implements the system. If it turns coercive, then we will meet and decide on our future course of action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/unvaccinated-not-allowed-in-govt-establishments/articleshow/88439319.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Earlier, TOI had reported how DRT had directed that the school’s property be auctioned on January 14. The school, which is located in Chittaranjan Park, had taken a loan of Rs 2 crore from United Bank of India and after failing to repay the money, the principal and the interest now stand at Rs 8 crore. In the writ petition filed, the petitioners—students of Class XII—have sought directions to the Delhi government to inspect and take over the management of the school. They have also sought an inquiry into the financial mismanagement by the governing body as well as the management of the school. They have sought directions to the school to provide details of accounts or records maintained in respect of the loan amount as well as the funds received from various sources by way of grants, including donations from students. "The petitioners are Class XII students and due to appear for their CBSE board exams in the year 2022. They would be rendered remediless in case the school property is auctioned. As the auction is to be conducted on January 14, it would prejudicially affect the future of about 900 students who are yet to complete their school year," the petition stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/school-auction-5-students-move-hc/articleshow/88441574.cms||Shinjini Ghosh

The government has given approval to Yotta Infrastructure to realize the datacentre dreams in the state. This was shared by cofounder and CEO, Sunil Gupta of the Yotta Infrastructure Solutions during The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave held on Monday. “The datacentre park will consist of 6 interconnected datacentre buildings offering 30,000 server racks capacity and 200 megawatt of power. It will be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 7,000 crore. The construction for the first building commenced in December 2020 and is scheduled to begin its operations in July 2022,” Gupta said. He said data centres are the hub of the digital revolution. Foreseeing an increased demand from the state due to digital acceleration, Yotta has decided to commence construction of two new data centre buildings of 30 megawatt IT load each from January 2022. The data centre park shall be the largest one in the state with an option of 100% green renewable energy to customers. Construction of two additional datacentre buildings in the Greater Noida campus will begin in January 2022. “We expect our NCR campus to be operational with the first building before July 2022,” he added.

Yotta was formed to power India’s digital economy, driven by data. It has been powering the digital India mission by providing the highest quality of data centre, colocation services leveraging its tier IV facility which is the largest in Asia, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ups-first-data-centre-park-to-be-set-up-in-gr-noida/articleshow/88441586.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s active cases up 9 per cent in a week, most infections mild||PUNE: A “slight” rise has been recorded in the number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai and Pune, in the week ending December 20, which health experts largely attributed to festive and wedding gatherings. Health authorities said most of the cases were mild and did not require hospitalisation. The active caseload in Maharashtra, which had dropped to 6,481 during the week ending December 14, increased 9 per cent to 7,093 at the end of the December 14-20 period. Maharashtra disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate said: “We have seen a slight rise in cases in the last one week, especially in Mumbai. We are continuously monitoring the situation. The situation is completely under control as there has been no rise in critical patients or those on ventilators or oxygen support.” Intensivist Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state Covid task force, said there were no rise in hospitalisations and most positive cases were mild. “Having said that, hospitalisations do not increase as soon as the cases start rising. Hospitalisations always lag by around two weeks after a rise in Covid cases.,” Dr Pandit said. Data showed that Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Raigad, Solapur and Aurangabad are some of the districts recording a rise in Covid caseload this week. Infectious diseases consultant Vasant Nagvekar, a member of state Covid-19 task force, said: “We have seen a marginal rise in Covid admissions in the last couple of weeks. Most patients are being given antibody cocktail therapy on OPD basis. They go home post-therapy, so the rise has only been marginal. Hence, over 95 per cent new Covid cases coming to the hospitals are mild to asymptomatic.” He said mass gatherings, such as weddings and festive season parties have had a role to play in the rise, as people usually do not follow Covid-appropriate behaviour during such events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-states-active-cases-up-9-in-a-week-most-infections-mild/articleshow/88440898.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Goa||Rush to claim compensation sees spurt in Goa Covid-19 mortality count||PANAJI: If a few months ago some chose to hide a Covid-19 death in the family, several have now changed tack and are hurrying to get such deaths certified chiefly to claim Rs 2 lakh towards compensation declared by the Goa government for each Covid victim’s family. As a result, the health services on Tuesday added 29 deaths that had occurred between May and December 2021 to the state’s cumulative Covid-19 mortalities, while a week ago, 94 Covid deaths that had occurred a few months prior were added. With the latest additions, Goa’s Covid-19 mortality count has touched 3,519. These additions to the mortality count were not hospital deaths, but those that had happened at home and had not been certified as Covid-19 deaths then. The district hospitals have been processing such claims provided that the doctor who treated the patient concerned certifies it as a Covid-19 death, health services director Dr Ira Almeida said. Following directions from the Supreme Court, the Goa government has also begun disbursing an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 to the next of kin of a Covid-19 victim. Hence, such a family is eligible to receive a total compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh if an application is approved. While getting a death certified as Covid-induced entails running from pillar to post, those desirous of claiming the compensation are willing to go to any lengths. Resultantly, there have been disputes over which member of a victim’s family is given the compensation. Almeida said that in one such case of a Covid-19 death that occurred at home, two siblings have been quarrelling over the distribution of the money. Proving a Covid-19 death that occurred at home is not easy either, as an economically backward family has been experiencing. In this instance, the entire family had tested positive for Covid-19, including an 84-year-old man. He was, however, treated at home for want of a hospital bed and died within 10 days of contracting the virus. The cause of his death was attributed to a heart attack. The family has been now trying to obtain documents to prove that the man was indeed a victim of Covid-19. Almeida said it wasn’t clear if they’d be able to prove their case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rush-to-claim-compensation-sees-spurt-in-goa-covid-mortality-count/articleshow/88462044.cms||Bindiya Chari

---||Dehradun||UP and U’khand settle long-pending asset distribution||Dehradun: Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath on Monday settled long-pending asset distributions under various departments of the two states, including irrigation and transport. Asset distribution has been a bone of contention between the two states ever since Uttarakhand was carved out of UP in 2000 and Dhami and Adityanath had started talks on the issue on November 18 with an aim to mutually resolve the issues. Among key orders issued on Monday was the decision to hand over Alaknanda tourist rest house to Uttarakhand once the construction of another rest house in UP is completed by the end of this year. Besides, UP agreed to reconstruct two barrages – Banbasa and Kiccha – which were damaged due to heavy rains. Also, UP state road transport corporation has agreed to clear dues worth Rs 205 crore that it owes the Uttarakhand transport corporation. Both sides have also agreed on a joint survey on lands belonging to the irrigation departments and the UP Awas Vikas Parishad. Meanwhile, opposition Congress slammed the Dhami government, saying it “bowed before UP government”. Former CM and Congress leader Harish Rawat alleged Uttarakhand had given away and important and expensive land in lieu of the Alaknanda Hotel. “Uttarakhand has simply accepted everything suggested by the UP governments and gave up its own rights, which belong to the people of Uttarakhand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/up-and-ukhand-settle-long-pending-asset-distribution/articleshow/88440258.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: Over 1 crore people skipped second dose of vaccine in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: The number of people who have not taken their second shot of the Covid-19 vaccine after completing the prescribed interval between two doses has crossed a crore in Maharashtra. The state has so far administered a single shot to 87% of its eligible population, but the full vaccination coverage is around 55%. Data provided by the public health department on Tuesday showed that 1.05 crore people—nearly 92 lakh who had taken Covishield and 10.6 lakh who had taken Covaxin—have defaulted on their second shots. Mumbai is the only district whose second dose coverage has crossed 80% (83%). However, the city also has more than seven lakh people who haven’t taken the second shot. Despite growing evidence that the Omicron variant can cause breakthrough infections, experts believe that vaccination would be the single-most effective tool in curbing hospitalisations and deaths. Immunologist Dr Vineeta Bal had previously told TOI that vaccination provides very clear protection for the most vulnerable and serious cases. State data showed that Pune (11.6 lakh) followed by Mumbai (6.5 lakh) have the highest number of people who haven’t taken their second shots of Covishield. Nashik (5.5 lakh), Kolhapur (5.4 lakh) and Thane (5.3 lakh) are the next with highest defaulters. In case of Covaxin, Buldhana (1.2 lakh) has the highest number of people due for second shots. Apathy is the primary reason why people are not showing any urgency to get fully vaccinated, said Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of Pune region. “There are ample vaccines yet there is very slow turnout at the centres,” he said, adding that many private centres have completely stopped vaccination. Health officials of Satara said many cite the side-effects suffered after the first dose when they are called and prodded to take the second one. “Since Covid-19 cases are low, there is a general sense of co-mplacency,” a district health official said. The tiny district has nearly 4 lakh people who have skipped the second dose. “Some haven’t come for their second shot even after completing 120 days,” he added. In Mumbai, the ward war rooms have been entrusted with the job of calling such individuals. Dr Jitendra Jadhav, medical officer of health of L ward, said none of their beneficiaries outrightly refuse. “But the common excuses we hear are they will take it soon, or they have a wedding to attend, they are away on a holiday, or the date slipped their mind,” he said, adding that the ward has a sizeable number who have skipped their second shot. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said they have started evening vaccination centres to cater to people who may not have the time during the day to get the jab. “Every ward has a centre now that stays open till 10pm and people should avail of them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-1-crore-people-skipped-2nd-dose-of-vaccine-in-state/articleshow/88440908.cms||Sumitra Debroy

In terms of population, 12.36 crore people have been partially vaccinated while 6.63 crore are now fully vaccinated. This means that over 82% of the people in UP are partially and more than 44% are now fully vaccinated. There are 15.04 crore people in UP who are eligible for vaccination. On the national picture, UP is now home to nearly 13.5% of country’s fully vaccinated population. Maharashtra, is the nearest contender to UP, has administered 12.95 crore doses, followed by West Bengal (10.41 crore), Madhya Pradesh (10.01 crore) and Bihar (9.51 crore). An official statement said aggressive vaccination was an integral part of UP government’s comprehensive strategy to tame the coronavirus. In UP, Lucknow tops in terms of both total doses administered and fully vaccinated population. The state capital is followed by Prayagraj, Azamgarh, Bareilly and Jaunpur in terms of total doses. So far as fully vaccinated population is concerned, Lucknow is followed by Ghaziabad, Agra, Kanpur, Gautam Budh Nagar and Jaunpur. Meanwhile, health officials urged people to adhere to Covid-19 prevention protocol despite getting vaccinated as the risk of pandemic infection remains high. As many as 21 cases and nine recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. This left the state with 216 active cases.

According to a letter from the office of the deputy commissioner of police, Metro, a list of 26 criminals involved in five or more crimes and 43 others with three or more FIRs against them have been sent to the district DCPs and Ghaziabad Police. These criminals have been involved in various crimes, including theft and pickpocketing, an officer said. “The DCPs of all 15 districts have been asked to take preventive action against these criminals,” he said, quoting the letter. The step was taken after the matter was raised by senior officers during a crime review meeting and further directions were issued to the DCPs to take necessary action against all criminals involved in three or more crimes. According to the Delhi Police data, 2,174 cases were reported till November 13 this year, out of which more than 1,380 cases were solved and 564 people were arrested. Of the total cases, 80% involved theft. “About 1,900 cases of theft, mostly bags or mobile phones, were reported and 59% of them were solved,” the data reveals. Cheating cases were another major issue in the Metro. “We have found that cheating incidents by showing fake bundles of notes have increased. Several accused whom we have arrested were illiterate, but successfully cheated doctors, MBBS students, Army and Central Armed Police Forces personnel by their trick and duped them of their money,” an officer said. During analysis, the police team found that 90% of the arrested accused in cheating cases were from Bawana. DCP (Metro) Jitendra Mani had also written to the district DCPs requesting them to take steps and involve youths in the Yuva initiative of Delhi Police to keep them away from crimes. Mani said they always conducted time-to-time inspections of Metro stations and then deploy personnel at strategic locations. “We have found that criminals are mostly active at interchanging stations, so we keep regular tabs to ensure no such incident takes place,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/60-criminals-on-the-radar-for-being-active-in-delhi-metro/articleshow/88441594.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC quashes 8 BMC plaints against Godrej kin, directors||MUMBAI: In a relief for industrialist Jamshyd Godrej and his cousins Adi and Nadir Godrej, the Bombay high court has quashed a Dadar magistrate’s orders issuing process against them and nine other directors. Among the other directors is Vijay Crishna, Jamshyd’s brother-in-law. Justice Sandeep Shinde passed the order on Monday on three petitions filed in 2009-10 to quash eight complaints filed by BMC. The HC had then stayed the proceedings before the magistrate. The first petition was by the 12 directors of Godrej & Boyce Mfg Co Ltd. In 2009, BMC’s licence inspector (N ward) found certain articles were kept for sale and certain processes and operations were on without licences at its Vikhroli factory. The BMC filed seven complaints for violation of Section 394 of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act pertaining to licences. Their advocate, Tejas Deshmukh, argued that since the alleged violations relate to the establishment of the company and when the company is the offender, vicarious liability of directors cannot be imputed automatically in absence of statutory provisions to that effect. He said the co-mplaints do not disclose anythi-ng to indicate complicity of petitioners. De-shmukh said the complaints were not maintainable and the magistrate erred in issuing process against them. Justice Shinde noted that in the seven complaints, the BMC has prosecuted only the directors/vice-presidents. “Since company is an ‘independent entity’...prosecution should have been launched against the company and not against the chairman and managing director or vice-president,” he said. Also, the BMC’s advocate could not show the complicity of petitioners in these cases. “...on this ground alone, these seven complaints must fail,” said Justice Shinde. He referred to the eighth complaint against the company and the directors for keeping wooden furniture on the ground floor of the premises without licence. The company filed two petitions challenging it. Justice Shinde agreed with Deshmukh that provisions of the Act and articles mentioned in the schedule don’t include “wooden furniture”. “...there was no violation...of MMC Act by the company or directors. Thus, this complaint also must fail,” he added. Justice Shinde directed that the eight complaints pending before the magistrate and the orders “issue process” therein be quashed and set aside.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-quashes-8-bmc-plaints-against-godrej-kin-directors/articleshow/88441928.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Shashi Bala Singh, director, NIPER-Hyderabad, said the institution will provide access to its instrument facilities at nominal rates to all start-ups working in biopharma sector. “The instrument facilities include state-of-the-art NABL-accredited analytical testing laboratory with regulatory compliance. To encourage entrepreneurship and innovation in biopharma sector, NIPER Hyderabad has established a biopharma incubation centre as a non-profit organisation named Aishkaran - Foundation for Pharma Innovation,” she said. The incubation centre was established under the prestigious Bio-NEST (Bio-incubators Nurturing Entrepreneurship for Scaling Technologies) scheme sponsored by Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. She said as NIPER is situated in pharma capital of India, the institution aspires to build the spirit of entrepreneurship. The initiative is in sync with the Centre’s ‘Startup India’ scheme, which promotes the cause of entrepreneurship in all aspects. “The nominal prices of using instruments comes as a great advantage as the MSMEs and new start-ups face the problem of high prices from other agencies. The only requirement is that in order to claim the offer the start-ups have to be registered with Startup India,” she added. Dr Shashi Bala Singh said it is the right time for biopharma sector to grow, as the government is determined to assist the sector. NIPER was recently accorded status of Institute of National Importance.

The officer added that rain and snow activity is likely to start from December 26 night and continue till the evening of December 30. Meanwhile, the temperature levels across the state have gone up in the past 24 hours, especially the minimums, which were settling considerably below the normal level causing cold wave conditions in the plains of Uttarakhand. In Dehradun, the maximum temperature on Wednesday increased to 23.5 degree Celsius, three notches above normal while the minimum also rose shot up to 5.2 degree Celsius.

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Covid-19 testing at wedding functions still a non-starter||NAGPUR: Zonal medical teams are yet to start visiting public functions, especially marriage ceremonies, to test for Covid spread as they are busy tracing international travellers and processing the Rs50,000 claims by kin of Covid victims. Currently, a major cultural event is underway and innumerable marriage functions also, where Covid norms are brazenly violated. All 10 zones of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) are preoccupied with the two emergent tasks and unable to form flying squads to prevent crowding. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had told TOI that flying squads would be formed to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) is followed at large public gatherings. He had instructed zone officials to visit marriage venues and ask guests to take Covid tests if violations were found. On Thursday, he didn’t answer TOI’s calls and messages. Activists and NGOs have slammed the civic body and police department for giving clearance to large public gatherings ahead of the New Year celebration period amid the Omicron threat. Activist Kunal Maurya said there is no check on number of people attending public functions or weddings. “We have suffered so much for oxygen and beds in the first and second waves, so we must not take the third wave lightly. Nagpur authorities are not taking any preventive measures despite photographs of all violations at these events being available on social media,” he said. Maurya accused the authorities of adopting different yardsticks. “Recently, we were protesting with 20 people at GMCH but the cops told us it was not allowed in pandemic. We have stopped physical events due to Omicron threat. Mumbai imposed restrictions and other districts also doing same. We need to have preventive measures now. I am not against organizing these events. But they can be held with public participation in online mode,” he said. Activist Joseph George too questioned NMC and police department for giving permission to political and cultural events on such large scale. “The yardstick should be same for public and public representatives. If anything goes wrong, are they going to take responsibility? Even police staff deployed at these events are not following Covid norms. Kids are coming to participate in some events without masks. As a citizen, I will hold the civic chief and police chief responsible if cases rise. Citizens are not understanding seriousness of the issue,” he said. Both George and Maurya had worked with several NGOs and citizens groups to help Covid patients in distress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/testing-at-functions-a-non-starter-zone-officials-busy-with-other-covid-duties/articleshow/88440899.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Hubballi||Section of Lingayats back decision to serve eggs to schoolchildren||Hubballi: Although many Lingayat seers have opposed the state government’s proposal to serve eggs to students in midday meals, a section of the community, including writers, pontiffs and scholars, are supporting the move. The section supporting the proposal to serve eggs is using the same argument as the ones that are opposing it, stating that choice of food must be left to the individual. Furthermore, they pointed out that the Sharana poets had always emphasised plurality in society. Seer of the Sanehalli branch of Sirigere Matha Panditharadhya Shivacharya Swamiji expressed surprise over the issue triggering a controversy. “I do not understand why this is even an issue. Let one eat whatever one wants. If a student does not want to eat an egg, the child can have fruit. It’s very difficult to divide children into vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups. Lingayats have never tried to interfere in the matter of one’s food,” Shivacharya Swami told TOI. Writer and publisher RG Halli Nagaraj, a distinguished member of the Lingayat community, recalled his mother being advised to eat a raw egg daily by doctors when she was admitted to a hospital in Davanagere 45 years ago. “Since my mother performed Shiva Puja daily, we could not bring eggs inside the house. So, we asked those selling eggs to leave it in our backyard. For an entire year, she ate eggs and drank milk, and effected a complete recovery. Soon, all of us started eating eggs, while my mother continued her rituals. I feel there is no correlation between one’s religion and diet. If the children and their parents have no qualms, serving eggs will help combat malnutrition in the state,” he said. Former bureaucrat and scholar SM Jamadar pointed out that, while Sharana poets advocated vegetarianism, none of them, Basavanna and Allamaprabhu included, forbid consumption of non-vegetarian food. “Madar Chennayya, Dohar Kakkayya, Nuliya Chandayya were among those who were welcomed into the fold of the Sharana movement. Basavanna never asked people to give up non-vegetarian food. Such being the case, seeking to impose restrictions on serving eggs in the name of religion is a clear violation of individual rights,” said Jamadar, who is also the general secretary of Jagatika Lingayat Mahasabha. Jamadar said that the Mahasabha was not opposed to the government’s decision to serve eggs in midday meals. Shivakumar Uppin, an activist who has been involved in the movement demanding that Lingayat be identified a religion in itself, said, “People cannot be separated on the basis of caste, gender and food in Basavanna’s religion. Opposing the move to serve eggs is a form of untouchability. Many Lingayats have failed to grasp the true spirit of the religion,” he rued. Murugharajendra Koraneshwar Shivayogi of Koraneshwar Sansthan Math in Khajur said that the tenets of Lingayat community ought not become a hurdle to children consuming eggs. “All we want from the government is to study if eggs are digested easily. I have studied multi-purpose basic health, and scientifically, eggs cannot be classified under ‘non-vegetarian’ food,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/section-of-lingayats-back-decision-to-serve-eggs-to-schoolchildren/articleshow/88440075.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

According to a recent order, teachers were appointed to conduct Village Development Officer (VDO) selection exams on December 27 and 28, which is clashing with their winter break. The teachers will have to return to their workplace for the same. Vice-president of Rajasthan Primary and Secondary School Teachers Association Vipin Sharma said, “All the teachers will leave their workplace on December 24 for winter vacations. However, especially for this examination, we have to return in the middle of the vacation. Why can’t the government consider our problems?” He further said that the Education Department should be consulted in advance to decide the suitable timing for conducting examinations. TOI tried contacting Kana Ram, Director of Secondary School Education, Bikaner for a comment but he did not pick up his phone. Around 15 lakh students have filled forms for the examination that will be conducted for two days. Many candidates have to travel to their exam centre, which is expected to create traffic problems. Secretary of Rajasthan Staff Selection Board Pushkar Sharma, said that it is not their decision to call teachers for exam duty. “Our work is to conduct the examination and not to appoint teachers. We only organize it but it is managed by the district administration,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/exam-duty-spoils-winter-vacation-of-govt-school-teachers/articleshow/88419967.cms||---
---||Lucknow||CM pushes for drone manufacturing units||Lucknow: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has on Wednesday directed the industrial development department to work out a proposal for setting up drone manufacturing units in the state. “Considering the importance of drones in various fields including disaster relief, agriculture, maintenance of law and order, a concrete action plan should be prepared to establish a drone manufacturing unit in the state. Due to their accessibility and ease of use, drones can make a significant contribution to employment and economic development in remote and inaccessible areas. There is also a huge employment potential in the field of drone manufacturing and many companies want to set up their units in UP,” he said. He has suggested that these units can be set up in the upcoming defence corridor. The home department, meanwhile, has been directed by the CM to prepare drone manuals in order to lay out a clear policy for private or commercial use, in conjunction with the civil aviation ministry’s policy. “The CM has said that the manual should have clear provisions regarding issuance of a drone airworthiness certificate, maintenance certificate, acceptance of existing drones, operator permits, student remote pilot licence, remote pilot instructor authorization etc,” said a government spokesperson. The CM has also said that diploma and certificate courses for training in drone technology should be started in ITIs and polytechnic institutes. If needed, the CM added, help of IIT Kanpur can also be sought. Explaining how drones can be utilised in the state, the spokesperson said that they can be used for spraying pesticides in an effective way so that the pesticides will be deposited only on the crops. Manual spraying ends up using more quantity of pesticides which is harmful for both the crops and soil, he said. The officer added that drones can also be used in maintaining law and order and for carrying out surveillance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-pushes-for-drone-manufacturing-units/articleshow/88441612.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||‘Lepakshi Knowledge Hub got land when it wasn’t registered’||HYDERABAD: CBI counsel K Surender on Wednesday informed that Lepakshi Knowledge Hub (LKH) floated by Indu Syam Prasad Reddy was one of the undue beneficiaries of the quid pro quo scam. He said that Indu projects group, one of the accused in the quid pro quo case, invested Rs Rs 50 crore in YS Jagan Mohan Reddy firms after receiving huge allotments of land parcels from the state government headed by Jagan’s father YS Rajasekhar Reddy between 2004 and 2009. It received 9,000 acre in the Anantapur district from AP state in the name of developing the Lepakshi Knowledge Hub through APIIC. It was allocated 1.2 TMC of water from the Somasila project. No hub was developed in the backward area but Indu Syam Prasad Reddy pledged the land and availed huge loans. The land was allotted to the LKH when it was not even registered as a company and officers like APIIC executive director D Muralidhar Reddy played a key role in allowing Syam Prasad Reddy to mortgage the land, the CBI counsel said. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan was hearing the quash plea filed by Muralidhar Reddy. Refuting the claims of Muralidhar that the sanction was not accorded to prosecute him, the CBI counsel said that they do not need permission from the state government. “We did not seek it from the Centre initially because by that time Muralidhar was not conferred IAS status,” he said. The judge reserved his orders in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/lkh-got-land-when-it-wasnt-registered/articleshow/88440911.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

DPSRU has been training and preparing yoga teachers through the diploma programmes. “Just talking about yoga won’t do any good to people. If we want people to bring yoga into their daily lives, then there must be a platform to connect people with trained yoga teachers and “Dilli Ki Yogshala” will serve the same purpose. I am thankful to DPSRU for supporting this vision of CM by taking the responsibility of preparing good yoga teachers through its diploma courses,” said Sisodia. Explaining the scheme, the deputy chief minister stated, “Dilli Ki Yogshala, a flagship programme of Delhi government, aims to help residents who have developed an interest in yoga by reading about its benefits from several resources, but are unable to find a perfect way to learn it. With this initiative, professional yoga teachers will just be a missed call away. Groups of residents willing to learn yoga in any part of Delhi can give a missed call on 9013585858 and yoga teachers will be sent by Delhi government at their place.” He also appreciated the university for continuing its research even during the pandemic. “DPSRU was the first university established by the Kejriwal government and is achieving new heights in academic as well as research in the field of pharmaceuticals,” Sisodia said. More than 500 students were awarded degrees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/yoga-teachers-to-be-just-a-missed-call-away-sisodia/articleshow/88441618.cms||---

---||Thane||Maharashtra: Meet 23-year-old woman fighter pilot from Thane||THANE: Roshni Iyer, a 23-year-old Thane resident, has made her city proud on being commissioned as a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force. She is said to be among 15 women fighter pilots in the force, said sources. Iyer had dreamt of serving the nation since a very young age. She aspired to be a fighter pilot and always focused on her studies to achieve her goal with a good academic record. Iyer said, “Being a part of the Indian Air Force is a way of life. It is not just about being a pilot but the greater motto is to live for and serve the nation.” Her father, Ravi Iyer, told TOI: “We are proud of her and I feel all children should pursue their passion. We have also supported her throughout and want to see her serving the nation.” Iyer was inspired by former President late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, who was an aerospace scientist. Following her graduation in aerospace engineering, she was admitted to the Air Force Academy through AFCAT. She trained for a year and a half at the Air Force Academy at Dundigal, Telangana, said sources. It is learnt that Iyer did her schooling from Lok Puram Public School, Thane, and was a national level athlete, having represented Maharashtra in 400-metre hurdles, and has also won state level gold medals, said sources. Not just athletics, Iyer has pursued other diverse hobbies such as reading, trekking and painting with watercolours and oil pastels on canvas as well. Thane, called a city of lakes, can now proudly be known for having produced pilots for the Indian Air Force, said local residents. Along with Iyer, there are two male pilots from a Thane school this year—flying officers 24-year-old P S Gautam (fighters) and 22-year-old Jordan Sequeira (helicopter), said sources. The first three women to be commissioned as fighter pilots in the Indian Air Force were Flight Lieutenant Avani Chaturvedi, Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kant and Flight Lieutenant Mohana Singh, in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-meet-woman-fighter-pilot-from-thane/articleshow/88440922.cms||Anil Shinde
---||Ahmedabad||AUM of gold ETFs at record-high Rs 318 crore in November||AHMEDABAD: Fuelled by inflows during the festive season, assets under management (AUM) from the state in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) hit record highs in November. The AUM for gold ETFs touched Rs 318 crore in November according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), up 4% against October’s figure of Rs 307.3 crore. Compared to September, the AUM rose by 7.5% in November. Financial analysts say muhurat purchases during the festive season and growing consumer interest in gold ETFs as opposed to physical gold propelled the increase. Mumukshu Desai, director of an Ahmedabad-based financial advisory firm, said, “The price of gold remained stable and sub-Rs 50,000 in November. This came at a time when there was volatility in equity markets and investors shifted to gold, especially due to fresh concerns over the Omicron variant of Covid. The AUM for gold ETFs indicates a shift in preference but it is not a stand-alone barometer, because a large chunk of investments in the yellow metal are in physical gold or sovereign gold bonds.” Due to geopolitical factors, gold prices had plunged in November. Around Dhanteras-Diwali, the price of the yellow metal stood at Rs 49,500 per 10g. “With prices on the lower side, demand for gold remained good. This is true both for physical gold and digital gold. As awareness grew, the number of people investing in gold ETFs and sovereign gold bonds also increased,” said Haresh Acharya, director, India Bullion and Jewellers’ Association (IBJA). It may be noted that gold ETFs make up a small portion of mutual fund investments from Gujarat. Investors in the state are largely investing in equity-linked MFs. In November, the AUM for equity MFs increased marginally, by 0.3%. “Except for systematic investment plans (SIPs), inflows slowed in November due to market volatility. At the same time, there was significant outflow from foreign institutional investors. These factors led to ETFs growth being stagnant,” said an Ahmedabad-based financial consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/aum-of-gold-etfs-at-record-high-rs-318cr-in-nov/articleshow/88440924.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Kochi||‘A man with a golden heart, he was kindness personified’||I first met PT in Maharaja’s College in 1978. I was in my first year BA and PT had joined for an MA. He was far senior to me but we quickly formed a close bond with each other. We contested elections to the students union together. I was elected representative of the first year BA students while PT won as university union counsellor. That was a memorable election not just because of our success but also because of the glimpse we got of PT as a tactician in elections. AK Antony, then chief minister, stepped down in protest against the decision of Devaraj Urs to support Indira Gandhi in the Chikmaglur by-elections. This occurred on the last day of campaigning for our college elections. PT had a brilliant idea. As students started streaming into college, he went to a nearby newspaper stall and purchased copies of the day’s papers. All of them carried the news of Antony’s stepping down on the front page. PT held open the newspapers in his hand and went around the campus pointing out that our leader AK Antony did not believe in clinging to power and was ready to give it up for a matter of principle. This campaign brought us handsome results in the polls. PT and I worked hard to make sure that the students union was amongst the best the college had seen in years. In my second year BA, I was selected for a youth exchange programme to Canada through the NCC. While in Canada, I saw and experienced many things. At the same time, I missed PT and the life of fun in college. I ended up writing PT a 10-page letter recounting my experience in Canada. Little did I know that in my absence, Maharaja’s College was a scene of violent clashes between rival groups of students and PT himself had become a victim. To my great shock and surprise, PT told me on my return that it was my letter which saved his life. He had folded the 10-page letter and kept it in the chest pocket of his shirt. A student attacked him with a javelin and luckily, the thick letter served as a shield blocking the tip of the javelin. After Maharaja’s, I joined JNU in Delhi for my MA. I met my wife, Saroj Thapa, who belongs to Darjeeling in JNU and fell in love with her. PT was one of my first friends from Kerala to visit JNU and meet her. After JNU, I returned to Kerala and joined Ernakulam Law College. I was also recruited by the Indian Express as their Kochi staff correspondent. Saroj and I decided to get married despite opposition of our families. PT, along with another good friend, G Sakthidharan of Deshabhimani played a pivotal role in helping me communicate with Saroj and enable her travel at short notice from Darjeeling to Kochi for the marriage. At a time when there were no direct flights or trains, no mobile phones or even STD, PT helped me for days together to speak to Saroj, by using his contacts with INTUC union members in the Ernakulam telephone exchange. When PT’s contacts would finish duty, Sakthi would step in to mobilize CITU members in to help with trunk calls to Darjeeling. Finally, Saroj reached Kochi and the day after her arrival, we got married in a small and simple ceremony at the Thripunithura temple organized by my close friends, PT sprang a surprise at the wedding by persuading Oommen Chandy, KC Joseph and Benny Behanan who were passing by to stop and greet us. PT was a man with a golden heart. In politics, he was aggressive. He did not hesitate to speak out and expose what he perceived as wrong. His battles for the preservation of the Western Ghats and in defence of the environment are well known. But, for me and for all his contemporaries in Maharaja’s College, he was kindness personified. He was a friend unlike any other. PT was close to all irrespective of their political affiliations. He will live long in the memories of all who knew him and loved him.

An offence has been registered against the accused gram sevak at Yeola City police station. As per information from the ACB, the gram sevak — working with Nimgaon gram panchayat in Yeola — had demanded the bribe from a construction contractor. The contractor concerned had carried out some work for the gram panchayat and the money was being asked after the bill submitted by the complainant was cleared. Further, the gram sevak was also pressing for the bribe as the contractor’s deposit money was still with the gram panchayat. After the demand for bribe was made, the contractor approached the ACB and lodged a complaint. The ACB verified the complaint and found that the gram sevak had demanded Rs 80,000 and subsequently settled for Rs 20,000. After it was proved that the gram sevak had made the demand for bribe, the ACB registered a complaint against him at Yeola city police station under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/gram-sevak-booked-for-demanding-bribe-of-rs-20k/articleshow/88439366.cms||---

---||Delhi||Airport line: High court asks Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to disclose money lying in accounts||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to disclose money lying in its various bank accounts, to gauge how an arbitral award won by Reliance Infrastructure’s subsidiary company against the transport corporation can be enforced. The high court sought details of the Delhi Metro’s bank accounts after taking note of about Rs 1,642.5 crore available with DMRC. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait also agreed with the stand of subsidiary company Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) that since the company does not want to accept the corporation’s offer of taking over its debts to the extent of the award which can be paid directly to the lenders, the court can’t force it to do so. However, at the same time, the court also underlined that the court can’t attach DMRC’s properties as per embargo due to Section 89 (of The Metro Railways (Operation and Maintenance) Act, 2002). “(DAMEPL says) if it has money in hand, in an escrow account, at least it can bargain with banks for restructuring, etc. If your offer is accepted, no issues. But when it is not accepting that, this court can’t force it that you accept in this fashion,” the judge told DMRC. Lawyer Prateek Seksaria, appearing for DAMEPL, said that its lenders have rejected the DMRC’s proposal of taking care of its liabilities and contended that no special treatment can be given to the government in the present execution proceedings. “As per the DMRC’s own details, it has over Rs 5,800 crore, with Rs 1,642 crore being its earning and over Rs 2,400 crore and Rs 1,700 crore being its project allocation fund and deposit fund, respectively. At least, Rs 1,642 crore of admitted earnings of the DMRC should straightaway be appropriated towards execution of the award,” he added. However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for DMRC, termed DAMEPL’s stand “arrogant” saying it is “serious and surprising that banks are saying” that the subsidiary should get the money and not from Delhi Metro. If this is true then something needs to be examined by the banking division, he added. Senior advocate Parag P Tripathi, representing the DMRC, submitted that if the bank accounts are attached and Metro services are stopped, nobody would gain anything. “If Metro is stopped tomorrow, there will be a huge issue of public interest…we don’t have this ready money,” he said. The court will next take up the matter in January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/airport-line-court-asks-dmrc-to-disclose-money-lying-in-accounts/articleshow/88441624.cms||Abhinav Garg

The BMC now plans to hold a test drive for around 50 contacts of these two students on Thursday. The test drive will be held in the mess of hostel 18 as a precautionary measure, said a BMC official. Around 14 cases were found at the Powai campus in the past eight to 10 days, said an official from S Ward’s health department. He added these included around 10 students, three professors and a security guard. The students who tested positive on Wednesday were high-risk contacts of the first few cases. “The test drive is being conducted only to contain the spread of the infection. These are only precautionary measures. The 10 students who have tested positive are from different hostels, including 1, 5 and 18,” said the official. Only one professor who had returned from the US has been admitted to SevenHills Hospital, as a precautionary measure. Most students are being treated at the campus hospital and are stable.

Accusing Yadav of lying about the income tax raids and defending his party members on the pretext of elections and trying to gain sympathy in the name of raids, Singh said that the SP chief should accept that those close to him were tax evaders and that he, too, is their partner. “Undeclared assets of Rs 400 crores were found in the income tax raids. The income of Akhilesh Yadav and his family should also be investigated. The SP had made preparations to fund the elections with this illegal money, but their plans could not be realised. Akhilesh should clarify what relation he has with those who were raided,” Singh said. Singh said that loot, theft and corruption were in the DNA of the SP and this was confirmed by the income tax raids and a recent CAG report on Noida. “Akhilesh made Noida a den of loot. The CAG report has exposed corruption to the tune of over Rs 58,000 crore in allotment of land in Noida during the SP rule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-demands-probe-into-income-of-sp-chief-family/articleshow/88441628.cms||---

He was shifted to AIIMS Nagpur special ward as per norms for Omicron surveillance on December 21. The youth, a resident of Dhantoli, is fully vaccinated and had a negative RT-PCR when he reached Delhi last Saturday.  His S gene dropped out in the RT-PCR test by IGGMCH and it was expected he would be Omicron confirmed. The genome sequencing by CSIR Neeri confirmed him as an Omicron patient on Thursday. This is the second Omicron case of Nagpur after the 40-year old West Africa returned man. He was not asked to take an RT-PCR report at Nagpur airport since he was fully vaccinated. Officials asked him to take a test later and go in home isolation. The youth got himself tested at a private lab on December 18 evening. He had left Dubai on December 17 and landed in Delhi the next day before heading for Nagpur the same day. Dhantoli zone health officials took his travel history and asked him to move into institutional quarantine. Around 17 close contact including two family members have been tested and found negative.

The kin accused police of delaying action against the main accused, a neighbour, who hails from a minority community, even as an FIR was registered on December 18. According to the girl’s parents, “Five people barged into our house in the night and kidnapped our daughter at gunpoint. We had lodged a kidnapping complaint against the accused, following which a case was registered, but police failed to recover their daughter, thus far. We are running from pillar to post, but no avail.” Later, in a video message, the parents allegedly threatened that if police failed to recover their daughter, they would migrate from the village. According to deputy superintendent of police Vijay Kumar Rana, “We have registered a case against five members of a family for kidnapping the Dalit girl. We have formed several teams to recover the girl and arrest the accused, who are still at large.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dalit-girl-kidnapped-in-amroha-kin-threaten-to-migrate-from-village-if-accused-not-arrested/articleshow/88437923.cms||Harveer Dabas

However, the priest of the churches concerned are ensuring that all government-issued Covid-related norms are followed. At the Infant Jesus Shrine in the Nashik Road area, the work on preparing a crib depicting the scene of Jesus Christ’s birth is in the final stages. A priest at the Don Bosco Church, along College Road, said “Our aim is to ensure that prayers on the Christmas Eve and on Christmas are held by following government norms.” Father Vinay Kantela, of the Holy Cross Church at Trimbak Naka, too said, “The number of devotees for the prayer sessions on Christmas Eve and on Christmas would be half the capacity of the church. A few other programmes — like bhajans of Sai Seva Samiti or the meeting of leaders of different religions — would have the participation of even fewer people. Nonetheless, devotees can come for the prayers all through the day.” Wilson Umap and Dinehs Das, who are regular visitors to the St Philip Church Nashik Road, said, “This year, we have been instructed that there should be no overcrowding. During the midnight mass and on Christmas day, we would ensure that devotees coming to the church follow all Covid norms.” In Kolhapur the churches have been illuminated with colourful lights, and shops and bakeries have put on sale the Christmas goodies. Christian households in the city are busy putting up Christmas trees, wreaths, trinkets and lights. The Paan lane area in Kolhapur city, which houses several shops selling Christmas goodies, has come alive. Munna Tamboli, a shopkeeper, said, “Mini-Christmas trees, Santa idols, star lanterns, wreaths, small nativity scenes, etc. are in good demand this year.” Meenakshi Gaikwad, a cake shop owner, said, “I have my hands full with orders of plum cakes, pastries and donuts. Bakery products and cakes are the most in demand and people are also looking for instant cake mixes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/christmas-preparations-on-in-full-swing-with-eye-on-covid-norms/articleshow/88439414.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The delegation of traders was led by MP Hemant Godse and vice president of Deolali Cantonment Board Bhagwan Kataria. There are 153 shops in Deolali Camp’s Levitt Market. As per cantonment rules, the cantonment board has to conduct an auction of shops for renting them out. About two decades ago, the board had prepared a proposal for constructing a shopping complex in Levitt Market. The board had proposed that the 270 shops in the new commercial complex would be leased out through auction. However, the traders of Levitt Market, who had shaped their business for over seven decades, were against the auctioning process, following which they approached the court. Since then the issue has been sub-judice. Kataria told TOI that during the meeting with DGDE Ajay Sharma, it was brought to the latter’s notice that the traders were not against the commercial complex. They want 153 shopkeepers to get their shops as per the rent according to the law and the remaining shops can be auctioned.  The traders are also willing to get the complex constructed through Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis or self-funding. Such complexes have also been set up in the cantonments of Pune and Bhingar in Ahmednagar district. Ajay Sharma told the visiting delegation that though the issue is sub-judice he would speak to the secretary of the Defence Department and other officials to come up with a solution, said Kataria. Currently, the DCB earns annual revenue of Rs 15 lakh from Levitt Market. Once the complex is ready, the annual revenue could increase to Rs 3 to 4 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/traders-meet-dgde-to-resolve-decades-old-issue/articleshow/88439391.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Ahmedabad||High court told about sealing drive||Ahmedabad: The state government and the AMC on Wednesday filed affidavits in the Gujarat high court and informed it about their sealing drive against highrise buildings that don’t have Building-Use (BU) permissions. The authorities apprised the court of the actions taken against buildings for not obtaining valid BU permissions and fire NOCs after the HC on November 29 directed them to start a crackdown. The court had issued strict instructions because two fire accidents were reported in highrises in the city just a day prior. The HC has been hearing a PIL filed by advocate Amit Panchal demanding the proper implementation of fire safety rules and GDCR (General Development Control Regulations). The PIL was spurred by fires at two hospitals last year, which killed 13 Covid-19 patients in Ahmedabad and Rajkot. The state government has submitted that it has found 1,863 errant highrises in municipality areas across the state, of which 28 have been sealed. As for not being able to take action against all, the government said it is short of manpower. It also said that water supply was disconnected in 60 buildings and sewage connections were severed in 78 buildings. The AMC stated that 203 buildings and 3,173 units have been sealed since March 2021 because they did not have BU permissions. The civic body said it launched “all practical, feasible and prompt actions to identity buildings without valid BU permission and initiated actions including sealing”. The state government also stated that in all 104 hospitals and 301 schools were found without valid fire NOCs in municipality areas. The authorities have sealed 52 of the 104 non-compliant hospitals, snapped water connections of 34, and disconnected sewage lines in seven hospitals. Of the 301 schools, 127 have been sealed, water supply has been disconnected in 83 and six have lost their sewage connections. The state government has also stated that its fire departments have recruited 353 employees at different levels over the past six months and 150 more will be recruited in the near future. For the AMC, the in-charge chief fire officer of Ahmedabad Fire & Emergency Services, Rajesh Bhatt, stated that the department has issued 558 new fire NOCs including for 150 highrises over the past 45 days. The survey for unauthorized constructions has been undertaken to identify the buildings where fire tenders cannot approach. The fire department could identify only eight such buildings which are not approachable by fire tenders because of illegal constructions on their premises. Notices have been issued to the chairpersons of such premises. The AMC said it has issued closure notices to 251 schools which do not have fire NOCs. The high court is scheduled to hear this issue on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-court-told-about-sealing-drive/articleshow/88440956.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt presents record additional expenditure totalling Rs 31,000 crore||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Wednesday presented supplementary demands totalling Rs 31,298.26 crore, the highest amount so far under the MVA government. The state government has budgeted Rs 435 crore for the Maharashtra State Backward Classes Commission (MSBCC), which was declared as a dedicated commission for OBC reservation four months ago. The state government released Rs 5 crore from its contingency fund to the commission last week. The data collection exercise is yet to begin though, said officials. The commission has been demanding funds for the work to begin and the state government was dragging its feet on it, until the recent Supreme Court order denotifying OBC seats in the upcoming local elections into the general category. An amount of Rs 1,152 crore has been earmarked for creating health infrastructure during the pandemic. Another Rs 1,000 crore has been earmarked for providing ex-gratia to the families of those who died due to Covid-19. That apart, the government has earmarked Rs 1,410.8 crore to provide relief to the farmers whose crops were damaged by the devastating rains in August and September. Supplementary demands are additional expenditure that are not part of the main budget. A total of Rs 1,150 crore has been budgeted for the loss-making Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), which is reeling under a financial crisis and also the ongoing employee strike. The government recently announced a salary hike for all ST employees. The state government has also budgeted Rs 2,435 crore towards implementation of the seventh pay commission among certain cadres. An additional Rs 2,100 crore has been earmarked for payment of pension and other post-retirement benefits. “The high supplementary demand points to lack of financial planning on part of the government. However, with several natural calamities striking the state in the middle of the year and the pandemic continuing, it was obvious that funds for handling these crises will have to be budgeted for,” said a senior official. Since the MVA government took over in November 2019, it has tabled supplementary demands totalling Rs 16,120 crore in December 2019, Rs 24,273 crore in February 2020, Rs 29,084 crore in September 2020, Rs 21,992 crore in December 2020, Rs 21,076.32 crore in March 2021 and Rs 23,149.75 crore in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-presents-record-addl-expenditure-totalling-rs-31k-cr/articleshow/88441962.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Amit Shah’s week-long whirlwind Uttar Pradesh tour begins tomorrow||LUCKNOW: Union home minister and BJP’s chief strategist Amit Shah is all set to embark on a statewide tour of poll-bound UP beginning Friday to escalate the party’s campaign and ramp up organizational machinery at the grassroots in the runup to the assembly elections. While the programme of the home minister is yet to be announced formally, top BJP sources said Shah is expected to address public meetings at nearly 21 different locations. Each public meeting will be attended by party workers and supporters from the surrounding seven assembly constituencies. This way he will be touching around 140 assembly seats in what marks yet another key move of the BJP to drum up public support. The BJP plans to put Shah on the forefront of organizational strategy comes even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes on a spree to lay foundation stones or launch developmental projects in UP. Sources said the party plans to bring supporters from Dalit and OBC dominated constituencies at the Shah’s public meetings. The step attains political significance in the backdrop of BJP mobilizing the non-Yadav OBC and Dalits to counter an aggressive SP chief Akhilesh Yadav who has been emerging as a most potent opposition against the saffron dispensation to frame up a potential bi-polar electoral contest. BJP sources said Shah is also scheduled to hold special meetings with the party functionaries in different locations to assess the ground level political situation. This comes close on the heels of the recent booth level functions which the party had organised to set its organizational machinery into motion. The BJP has been aggressively pursuing the strategy of weaning away the grass root functionaries of the opposition to reinforce its cadre strength. Political experts said the crowd which Akhilesh is drawing in public meetings during his ongoing Vijay Yatra might help the former UP CM in creating a favourable public perception even as he flexes muscles to arrest the BJP’s march to power in 2022. “Not surprisingly, the BJP leaders have been firing salvos mostly at Akhilesh during their public meetings,” an expert said. The BJP move to rope in Shah comes amid the ongoing Jan Vishwas Yatra which was flagged off by top BJP leaders, including party chief JP Nadda, in six organizational regions three days ago. The yatra is expected to be carried out till the first week of January.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/shahs-wk-long-whirlwind-up-tour-begins-tomorrow/articleshow/88441661.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Kolkata||Kolkata’s south east Asia travel plans go haywire this festive season||KOLKATA: Thailand and Singapore on Wednesday put in place travel curbs to stem the spread of Omicron. Coming ahead of the Christmas-New Year festivity, the new restrictions in these popular destinations have come as a shocker for travellers who are battling the disappointment of a cancelled holiday at the eleventh hour. “This is terrible. I had purchased airline tickets and booked hotels in Bangkok and Pattaya and was just required to apply for the Thai pass when the Thai government issued the notification that it would not issue any more pass for now. I don’t know where to take my family now. Even on the domestic sector, it will be difficult to get flight tickets or hotel bookings,” said businessman Ronit Sengupta. While those who have received the Thai pass that comes in the form of a QR code will be eligible to travel, those who have not will have to wait till at least January 20, after which the Thai government will take a fresh call on whether to resume issue of the passes or keep it suspended for a further period. Air India sources said the two times-a-week flight to Bangkok was booked to the hilt all of December and had good bookings even in January. “Thailand being an affordable destination close to Kolkata, many had booked to travel there during the year-end festivity. This sudden decision by the government has left many in the lurch,” said Travel Agents’ Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi. While Phuket is still open, given that there are no direct flights from Kolkata to the beach destination, only those booked on chartered flights can travel. Singapore has also hit the brakes on Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flights that it operated from Delhi and Mumbai and allowed tourists to travel without the requirement for quarantine. However, there is no change as of now for visiting friends and relatives travelling to Singapore in the non-VTL flight that operates daily from Kolkata and requires quarantine and multiple RT-PCR tests. Dubai, Doha and Dhaka have not rung in any fresh curbs but given the rise in Covid cases across the world, the travel trade community is keeping its fingers crossed, half expecting fresh regulations. “With Europe now recording high number of Omicron cases, every country is exercising caution. If a full-blown third wave can be avoided, these countries should open up late January or February,” said Travel Agents’ Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni. Though international travel is now facing turbulence, it’s still smooth travel on the domestic sector with Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong, Udaipur, Jaipur, Goa and Andamans emerging as hot destinations this winter. Consequently, air fares on these sectors have increased by 200%-300% as have hotel tariffs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citys-se-asia-travel-plans-go-haywire-this-festive-season/articleshow/88440325.cms||Subhro Niyogi

A Nagpur traffic police study has identified 18 new black spots in 2021. The city police have sent a proposal to the office of additional DGP (traffic) and District Road Safety Committee to include these 18 new spots in the existing list of black spots in the city. Once included, the number of accident-prone spots in city would rise to 34. The study was carried out by a special team led by joint CP Aswati Dorje and DCP (traffic) Sarang Awad. “In a bid to reduce road accidents, the traffic police have carried out a survey to identify black spots on city roads, where more than five accidents have taken place in the last three years and introduce remedial measures. The exercise was minutely monitored by the joint CP herself,” said the DCP. These newly identified 18 black spots have witnessed multiple accidents leading to fatalities and critical injuries. An analysis of various accidents revealed that apart from poor road infrastructure, failure to adhere to the speed limits, refusal to use helmets are among the major contributing factors. These new accident-prone spots have been identified on road patches owned by different agencies including seven NHAI roads, two roads of state highways and other agencies like NMC, NIT etc. The trend of the last three years (2019, 2020 and 2021) revealed that road accident emergencies have been witnessed on internal busy roads like Campus Square, Morris College T-point, Rani Jhansi Square, Chikhli Chowk, New Katol Road Naka etc. Of them, Chikhli Chowk and New Katol Naka to toll booth have witnessed 12 deaths each in the last three years, the study revealed. As many as 132 accidents, including fatal and serious, took place on these 18 black spots and claimed 82 lives. Due to constant follow up by Dorje and Awad, the concerned agencies including National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and state public works department (PWD) have carried out corrective steps at these accident-prone spots, which helped reduce seven black spots from the list of 23 black spots identified in 2020. “In last three years, the number of road accidents on these seven black spots has reduced significantly,” said the DCP, adding 15 accidents took place which claimed 9 lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/18-more-accident-prone-spots-in-city-in-2021/articleshow/88440948.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

While netted caps are traditionally worn by Muslims, red caps are associated with Samajwadi Party workers. “But even if he wears a red cap, no criminal goon will be able to escape,” he said. Maurya has been making back-to-back hardline statements in the last one month. Earlier, he had stoked a row through a tweet claiming that while construction of grand temples was underway in Ayodhya and Kashi (Varanasi), preparations were on for Mathura. He then attributed the poor law and order situation in previous regimes to people who wore “lungi” and “skullcap” — an attire which is ostensibly associated with Muslims. He then called SP chief Akhilesh Yadav as “Akhilesh Ali Jinnah” — in an apparent reference to the latter’s recent controversial comment comparing Muslim league leader and Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Mahatma Gandhi and Vallabh Bhai Patel. On Wednesday, he termed Akhilesh as “the last sultan” of Mulayam Singh Yadav sultanat, who would not come to power even in 2027. Launching an acerbic attack on political rivals, Maurya labeled SP, BSP and Congress as “parties of robbers”. He said that the leaders born with a silver spoon “never understood” the pain of the poor. “Such corrupt people and touts need to be taught a lesson,” he said, lauding PM Narendra Modi as a person who had the poor “living in his heart”. The deputy CM said that under the regime of SP, BSP and Congress, there was a “competition” to “loot money of schemes”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/goons-have-started-wearing-red-caps-now-says-maurya/articleshow/88441670.cms||---

Vaghani was asked on Wednesday whether GSSSB chaiman Asit Vora would be axed for the exam paper leak. In reply, he said,“The investigation will be transparent and all those found guilty will be punished. The CM has specifically said that no culprit should be spared in this case, even if he or she is a member or leader of the BJP. But investigation has to be completed first.” The statement came even as GSSSB chairman Asit Vora held a meeting with CM Bhupendra Patel in Gandhinagar on Wednesday. Speaking to mediapersons after the meeting, Vora said, “It was a just a goodwill meeting, nothing more.” Congress spokesman Manish Doshi said, “On one hand, the BJP is saying the investigation is on and on the other hand, its leaders have been giving a clean chit to Asit Vora. The GSSSB chairman must resign or he must be removed from his post. Only then will there be a fair investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/culprits-wont-be-spared-but-let-probe-finish-vaghani/articleshow/88440975.cms||---

The met department had declared yellow alert on account of the mercury dipping on Monday and Tuesday, and three suspected deaths due to cold wave were reported in the city on Tuesday. “We have been living here since years. Our homes were demolished long ago in an anti-encroachment drive,” says a woman on the pavement near RTO, as her seven-year-old daughter sleeps beside her. “I am nine months pregnant and may have to go to the hospital soon,” she said, showing a doctor’s papers with all the details. The family said the cold is not so bitter usually. The husband, who stood nearby, does odd jobs for a living. They have neighbours too. “Right here stays an old man and next to him there is a couple,” he said. Going around the city, TOI came across many persons who have been evicted in anti-encroachment drives years ago, and could never get a roof on their heads again. The blankets donated by do-gooders are not enough to beat the cold, most said. Chhaya, who lives with her family near the district court, said some two days ago her arms had stiffened. She went to a doctor nearby. The prescription she showed just had a pain killer written on it. “It was never like this before,” says Chhaya, who has a small child along. “There is a lot of dew in the night, making it difficult to sleep, we remain awake sitting besides the fire,” said one of them. The group, which includes a sick woman, has been living on the streets since years. The NMC night shelter near railway station only had two beds left on Tuesday. “I found three persons shivering in the cold last night and I brought them in,” said the attendant. One of them is from Bellary in Karnataka. “I have no family. I had gone to Varanasi but lost all my money. There is some amount left in the bank, which I’ll withdraw from the ATM and go back soon,” he said. The other shelter at Sitabuldi, which has more capacity, was only half occupied. Shankar Yadav sat at a bus-stop near Ganesh Tekdi Mandir. Belonging to Jaipur, he had come to Nagpur in search of work. He used work in Gujarat earlier. He says, “The contractor vanished and there was panic again due to Omicron. I came to Nagpur some days ago but could not get any work, and have been living on the streets. The cold is unbearable,” he says. Mohammed Rashid, who lived near Pili Nadi till his home was demolished, said it was warmer on Tuesday but worse a day before. A little ahead, near the station’s entrance sits Lakshmi, well past her 60s. Abandoned by her children, she lives by begging, and hoping it gets a little warmer soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cold-gets-bitter-even-for-weather-hardened-street-dwellers/articleshow/88440973.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Nashik||Kolhapur court dismisses BJP state president’s petition||Kolhapur: The sessions court in Kolhapur on Wednesday dismissed the petition filed by BJP state president Chandrakant Patil to drop his name from the Rs 100 crore defamation suit filed by senior minister and NCP leader Hasan Mushrif. Couple of months ago, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had levelled allegations against Mushrif and his family. Somiya had alleged that Mushrif’s family had siphoned off funds through a benami company. Somaiya had also alleged that Mushrif took undue advantage as minister in the government to benefit his relatives. Disturbed by the allegations, Mushrif had filed defamation suit of Rs 100 crore against Somiya and Patil and even requested the court to stop Somaiya and Patil from making defamatory statements. Prashant Chitnis, Mushrif’s lawyer, said, “The court of judge R V Rane upheld our demand to start trial against Patil. He had applied to drop his name from the case as he did not make any defaming statements against Mushrif. However, we maintained that it was the instigation by Patil that led Somaiya to make defamatory allegations against Mushrif. Patil is the head of the party and without his support the allegations would not have been made. The court upheld our view and said Patil’s name cannot be dropped from the case.” He added, “The Kolhapur court has fixed the hearing of the defamation suit and our demand to prohibit both Somaiya and Patil from making any allegations with an intent of defamation against Mushrif for next month.” Prahlad Paranjape, Patil’s lawyer, said he will file a revision petition in the higher court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kolhapur-court-dismisses-bjp-state-presidents-petition/articleshow/88439449.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Soon, pay a price to drive along congested city roads||Thiruvananthapuram: The draft master plan 2040 for Trivandrum has proposed congestion pricing for busy city stretches during rush hours. Congestion pricing; a concept implemented by Singapore in 1975 in which private vehicle owners will be charged a fee to use a busy road during peak hours, has been enlisted as one of the major sectoral proposals for transportation in the city. The basic objective of congestion pricing is to promote the use of public transport and thereby decongest city stretches from roadside parking and high traffic volume. As per the study and analysis report prepared for the draft master plan 2040, the average travel speed in the city is 25kmph during peak hour and that the slow speed during peak hours indicates that travel conditions in the city were below normal but have not reached the saturation level. The traffic volume study of the city covered volume of traffic plying through selected screen line locations, major outer cordon locations of the city, mid-block locations and important intersections and their capacity utilization in relation to road capacity. Analysis of traffic volume data across various screen lines, mid-block, outer cordon locations and intersections in the city indicate that it has exceeded the design capacity in most of the roads/intersections warranting upgradation of transport infrastructure. As part of the study, traffic movement data during morning/evening peak hours at 52 major intersections were estimated for the year 2020 and the highest volume of peak hour movements was observed at Pattom junction, higher than 10,000PCU ( passenger car units) followed by Kesavadasapuram junction (between 9,000 and 10,000 PCU). Six intersections had traffic volumes between 8000 and 9000 PCU. Congestion pricing has been implemented in cities like London, Singapore, Stockholm, Milan and Rome. A document prepared by Asian Development Bank says that congestion charging has a significant impact on traffic volume, travel times and speeds. The document further notes that it could reduce emissions and create a sustainable transport system. ADB study also says that a major argument against congestion pricing is that low income groups are affected more than others by the charges. For Trivandrum, congestion pricing has been pitched as a proposal to be implemented in the next 20 years; however it would have its set of challenges. In Singapore, the area license system was introduced in 1975 and region passes were issued for all vehicles except bus and high capacity car and charge regions were identified. In 1998 the region pass system was replaced by electronic road pricing as part of which vehicles had an immediate payment smart card and a characteristic encoder, according to a research paper on congestion pricing published in Science Direct. Getting such a system implemented in Trivandrum will have technical and logistic challenges and public resistance will also be a key factor, according to traffic management experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/soon-pay-a-price-to-drive-along-congested-city-roads/articleshow/88419454.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kochi||PT was a true mass leader||P T was a committed fighter who unfortunately got overshadowed by a tribe of professional politicians. He could make an organization from the void. During our student days in Maharaja’s College, he exhibited an astounding skill to control any seemingly unruly mob. He had a rare knack to connect with the masses.  He was more than ready to help anyone who approached him for genuine cause. He was ready to face the consequences of his actions, which he undertook with cent percent conviction. I do remember an incident when one of our college mates got accused in a murder case in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was accused of killing a lawyer and no lawyer in Calcutta high court was ready to appear for him. He immediately contacted me and directed me to go and console the family of that friend. At once he left for Bombay, arranged a lawyer, and rushed to Calcutta to get our friend released on bail. Our friend could later prove his innocence before the court. But during the hour of crisis, there was no one else to help him. And it was quite clear that doing anything for him was not at all beneficial or profitable. But PT is a different person. He took it as his obligation. PT was an uncompromising social personality who never took a political stand for personal benefits. As everyone knows, PT was the staunch supporter of A group in Congress. He opposed K Karunakaran tooth and nail. Once, I advised him to agree to a truce with Karunakaran because he is a great leader, and it would only benefit him. He immediately responded: “I am not a politician of that brand and I don’t want any benefit by making such a compromise,'' he said. But the price he had to pay for such a stand was part of the history of Congress politics. Personally, he was instrumental for my appointment as vice chancellor of Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit. I was not in a mood to assume that role and I told him: “You better spare me. It's a Marxist den. Why should I go there?'' But he wanted me to go there for the very reason cited. Only at that point of time did he ask me about my caste. Despite the fact that we were in the same room in the Maharaja’s College hostel for two years during our PG, he was not aware of my caste. Years later, when he bluntly asked me ''What is your caste?'', we both knew his question was only to satiate the system and give impetus to the selection process.

---||Kolkata||Puja organisers thank Unesco for heritage tag with colourful rally||Kolkata: The sound of dhaak and conch shells filled the air in central Kolkata on Wednesday afternoon as Durga Puja organizers took out a rally to thank the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) for recognising Durga Puja as an “intangible heritage”. Nearly 2,000 puja organizers participated in the rally that covered the stretch between Academy of Fine Arts and Esplanade. Chhau dancers from Purulia and dhaakis led the rally and participants carried posters and banners expressing their thanks to Unesco. There were cut-outs of Durga motifs and a 60ft tall banner that was hoisted at Esplanade. State minister Chandrima Bhattacharya and MLA Debashish Kumar joined the procession at Dorina crossing. “We waited for this recognition for years. It took a lot of persuasion by the Puja organizers and the administration to get the festival recognised as a global event. Earlier, Unesco recognised Chhau as an intangible heritage,” said Saswata Basu, general secretary of the Forum for Durgotsav, a nodal body of the big Durga Puja organizers in Kolkata. “Durga Puja in Kolkata is one of the largest exhibitions of open-air art installation. We already draw foreign visitors. This recognition will boost our presence at international forums,” Basu said. According to Somen Dutta of Kashi Bose Lane puja committee, the economy around the festival will also get a boost now. “It will be easier for us to convince corporate sponsors to increase funds. This recognition is a big leap for us and we can negotiate for better rates,” he said. Behala Nutan Sangha is looking at collaborating with the foreign artists for their Puja theme next year. “The Unesco recognition will make it easier to showcase the art overseas. Our theme-maker, Sanatan Dinda, has been invited to the India Festival in the US next year and will showcase the installation art of Kolkata during Durga Puja,” said Abhishek Bhattacharya of Behala Nutan Sangha. The rally, combined with the large turnout of Christmas shoppers on Lindsay Street, Bertram Street and New Market, led to a traffic snarl for a while near Esplanade. But there were others who enjoyed the performances in the procession.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-organisers-thank-unesco-for-heritage-tag-with-colourful-rally/articleshow/88440353.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Lucknow||More incentives for ASHA workers likely||Lucknow: With elections round the corner, the UP government has decided to plug loopholes which could in turn impact the BJP’s poll prospects. Thus, the Yogi government is working on an idea of increasing incentives to ASHA (accredited social health activist) workers. Besides, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to begin a process to bring contractual and ad-hoc workers in government departments under the ambit of Ayushman scheme. The CM is also believed to have directed the officials to ensure real time monitoring of the ongoing projects to ensure first-hand information at the level of the Chief Minister Office. The UP government in the supplementary budget had announced an honorarium of Rs 500 per month for the unskilled workers. Similarly, the government had also made budgetary provision to increase the honorarium of the shiksha mitras and anudeshaks, etc. A real-time monitor is likely to be installed at the CM office soon which helps the office to know the progress of ongoing projects. The ASHA workers, who are in a good number and can impact the polls, have been demanding an increase in incentives and permanent jobs. On November 11, a delegation of ASHA workers met Congress general secretary and UP in-charge Priyanka Vadra. After the meeting, Priyanka had announced an honorarium of Rs 10,000 per month if Congress comes to power in UP after elections. As of now, ASHA workers get around Rs 3,500 to Rs 3,700 as per activities per month. Sources said how much the increase will be is still not finalised, but the officials have been directed by the CM to draft a proposal to ensure an increase in the incentives of ASHA workers. There are around two lakh ASHA workers in Uttar Pradesh. The directives were given by the CM at a review meeting held on Wednesday morning. Sources said that unlike any other day when Team-9 meetings were held with a few major department heads, officials from other departments concerned also attended the Wednesday meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/more-incentives-for-asha-workers-likely/articleshow/88441671.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Ahmedabad||Atrocity: 2 IPS officers summoned||Ahmedabad: A metropolitan court on Wednesday issued summons against six cops including two IPS officers, Ashok Yadav and Shweta Shrimali, after holding them responsible, prima facie, for atrocities in Chharanagar. The case involves beating, abusing, and criminally intimidating some members of the Chhara community in July 2018. A resident of Chharanagar and theatre activist, Atish Indrekar, had filed a complaint with the court after police refused to register an FIR. He moved court and alleged that a police party led by the then joint commissioner of police, Yadav, DCP Shrimali, and the then Sardarnagar police inspector R N Virani thrashed people and abused and threatened them. Indrekar was also one of the injured during the police raid carried out on the night of July 27. His advocate Jayendra Abhavekar submitted that the cops had gone to Chharanagar and resorted to violence on the pretext of a liquor raid. The court has summoned the cops after taking cognizance of their alleged crime on the basis of the complaint filed by Indrekar. The court said evidence showed that the raid was carried out under the supervision of the top cops. The complainant alleged that some people of the locality were illegally detained and booked in false cases when they had gone to lodge a complaint against police officials. The court summoned the cops with the specific observation that the act committed by them does not fall in the line of duty. Therefore, the court said, prior permission for prosecution under Section 197 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure), which is mandatory to prosecute a public servant, is not required in this case. The court said: “No cop has the right to commit an offence under the garb of official duty.” The court further said that if the action is not performed as part of duty and it appears to be misuse of power, the protection under Section 197 is not available for officials. The court concluded that the action taken by the cops cannot be said to be a part of their duty. Earlier, the metropolitan court took cognizance of police action and had summoned these cops on complaints filed by other residents. But two complaints have been withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/atrocity-2-ips-officers-summoned/articleshow/88440977.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa high court orders night patrolling to crack down on noise pollution||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed continuous night patrolling by the local intelligence bureau, beat staff and sub division night duty officers to curb and control noise pollution. A division bench of Justices Revati Mohite Dere and M S Jawalkar directed the setting up of a dedicated telephone line 112 for receiving noise pollution complaints. It said that the control room operating the helpline should maintain a record of complaints and forward the complaints to the police station. “The police shall immediately carry out inspection if the allegation is found to be correct, appropriate steps are required to be taken to stop such noise pollution, register FIR and investigate and proceed against the violators in accordance with law,” the high court stated while hearing a public interest litigation filed by Sagardeep Sirsaikar seeking implementation of noise pollution rules in Anjuna-Vagator. However, the high court has issued directions for implementation across the state.  The police shall act in case any violations are reported by the local intelligence bureau, beat staff, sub division night duty officers, robot and robin, noise monitoring committees or any NGOs, or any other persons, the court stated. The court said that all cases of violations should be reported to district magistrate, who will then take action against the violators as per the provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 and the Environment Protection Act and Rules. Advocates Nigel da Costa Frias and Gaurish Malik told the court that despite complaints no action has been taken and that loud music in excess of permissible levels was being played till the wee hours of the morning. They submitted videos of parties to support their case. The petition said that noise pollution has been disturbing the peace and tranquillity of Chapora, Anjuna and Vagator residents. The loud music normally commences after sunset around 6pm and goes on up to around 6am, the petitioner stated. One of the shack operators was asked to file an undertaking before the high court that he would comply with rules and regulations with respect to noise pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-orders-night-patrolling-to-crack-down-on-noise-pollution/articleshow/88462092.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Pravin Pande, assistant police inspector of Khandeshwar Police said that Kushal Thakur had left his home, when he was 18 years of age in 2016, due to frequent quarrels between his parents. He was staying with his two elder brothers, mother and father, who is an electrical engineer, when he left his home. Pande said, “Kushal’s case was handed over to me after I took charge at Khandeshwar. I contacted his father and obtained his photograph. From his PAN card that was used to open a bank account, I contacted the HDFC Bank in Santacruz, where he had a savings account. The bank manager provided his mobile number and the address of his residence in a Santacruz slum. But he had shifted his residence from Santacruz. His mobile call data record showed that he had frequently called a specific mobile number, which belonged to the owner of a milk dairy in Goregaon. From the dairy owner, we got his address, as he stayed three buildings away from the dairy.” Pande said Kushal was living with four other youths, who informed his team that he worked as a delivery boy for Swiggy. “Hence, I contacted Swiggy’s nodal manager, who provided details of his delivery places. But we were unable to identify him as we had his photograph that was five years old. We kept tracking his mobile tower location for three days, but could not reach him as he kept changing his location due to his delivery schedule. On Tuesday, our team tracked his location to Khar and reached the customer’s house where he was to deliver the food parcel,” he said. Pande said, “We spotted a youth wearing uniform of Swiggy, standing near the building in Khar, but he had covered his face with a mask and head with a scarf. I identified him only from his eyes and called out his name. He panicked upon seeing the cops and tried to speed away on his bike. We caught him and brought him to Khandeshwar police station, where he was counselled by senior inspector Subhash Kokate in the presence of his parents. Thereafter, he agreed to return to his parents’ house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-cops-reunite-runaway-youth-with-parents-after-5-years/articleshow/88440997.cms||George Mendonca

The patient had returned from Scotland on December 8 and was tested for the virus at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, where her RT-PCR report came negative. And, the same day in the evening, she returned home with her parents by road. On the request of the district Covid-19 team, the woman agreed to get her tests done again. On December 12, she tested positive for the virus and was put under home-isolation for two weeks. The samples of her parents have been sent for genome testing. Director-general, health department, Uttarakhand, Dr Tripti Bahuguna, said, “We urge residents to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and gloves, and get fully-vaccinated as early as possible to prevent the spread.” Incidentally, some senior government doctors had recently shared with TOI their concerns regarding ‘extreme leniency’ with regard to ‘random’ testing at entry points like railway stations, airport and highways, political rallies, weddings and festivals. Meanwhile, the genome sequencing results of four foreign returnees who tested positive for Covid-19 are awaited, as per the state health authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-reports-its-first-case-of-omicron-variant/articleshow/88440358.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Ahmedabad||Experts, foresters oppose road project in Sasan Gir||Ahmedabad: Members of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), Gujarat have objected to a proposal for widening and up-gradation of a road that runs through the area where the core population of Asiatic lions resides. A meeting of SBWL was held in Gandhinagar on Wednesday where chief wildlife warden, Gujarat, and SBWL member secretary Shyamal Tikadar, in a presentation, said that converting the road into ‘tar’ will be detrimental to Gir. “I have recommended cancellation of the proposed road project,” he said. The 13.5km project, passing through the sanctuary, lies in close vicinity of a railway track and is part of state highway 111 that connects Visavadar town of Junagadh to Sasan. The project was proposed by the Roads and Buildings department in April. In a letter dated September 21, Junagadh BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama has made a representation to Union Minister of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) seeking speedy approval for the project. The department sought permission to upgrade the highway which is presently a kuccha road, to a pucca road with bitumen surface. A final decision on this and other proposals taken up in the meeting will be decided under the guidance of CM Bhupendra Patel who is the chairman of the board. Experts have been of the view that the road project could lead to rise in the number of speeding vehicles, causing greater risk of accidents involving wild animals. Many wildlife lovers have in the past written to the state government and the forest department objecting the proposal. Bhushan Pandya, a well-known wildlife photographer and a member of SBWL, said many members have opposed the road project proposal. He said the strength of Gir is in its compactness and increased traffic will not only disturb the lions’ corridors and restrict their movement but also fragment the habitat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/experts-foresters-oppose-road-project-in-sasan-gir/articleshow/88441001.cms||---

---||Kolkata||HMI team unfurls 7,500 sqft flag on highest mountain in Antarctica||Kolkata: Climbers from Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) in Darjeeling who undertook an expedition to Antarctica unfurled the largest Indian flag — measuring 7,500 sqft — atop the continent’s highest mountain, Vinson Massif. After the summit at 4,892 metres on November 30, the three-member HMI team was stuck in a blizzard at the summit camp for three nights and two days before making it safely back to the base camp on December 3. The team also rescued two German climbers who were holed up in the summit camp in the treacherous weather. “We had undertaken the expedition to proudly paint the white continent with the Indian Tricolour on the 75th anniversary of Independence and the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. The 26-day expedition commenced from Bagdogra on November 20, when we took a flight to Delhi. The same day, we flew to Doha, from where we took a connecting flight to Sao Paulo in Brazil and then onward to Santiago in Chile. There, we had to quarantine for a day, undergo RT-PCR tests and then travel to Punta Arenas, the world’s southernmost city. Thereafter, a four-and-a-half-hour flight took us to Blue Union Glacier in Antarctica on November 26,” said group captain Jai Kishan, director of HMI. The other team members were Naik Subedar Mahendra Yadav and Soumendu Mordunya, an instructor at HMI. The next day, the team climbed to the base camp and displayed the flag. They summitted on November 30 at 7pm local time. “Since there is daylight now for 24 hours, there was no issue with light. What proved to be a challenge was the polar storm that forced us to stay put at the summit camp for three nights, braving temperatures of -25°C to -40°C,” said Kishan. On December 3, the team made their way back to the Union Glacier and displayed the 7,500 sqft National flag. They also held a cycle rally before taking off for Chile.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Disciplinary steps against ex-CP initiated by Centre’||Mumbai: The Centre has initiated disciplinary proceedings against suspended IPS officer Param Bir Singh, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil said in the state assembly on Wednesday. Singh was placed under suspension earlier this month after he was named as an accused in multiple cases of extortion in Mumbai and Thane. The former Mumbai police commissioner had earlier accused former state home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption. On Wednesday, Walse Patil submitted a written reply in the Lower House in response to a question asked by Abu Asim Azmi of the Samajwadi Party during question hour on the first day of the state legislature’s winter session. “The Centre has initiated proceedings for disciplinary action under the All India Service Rules against Param Bir Singh,” the minister said. He said the state home department has got a recommendation for suspension of 28 police officials. The home department has got information on serious offences involving 30 police officials, including Singh, he said. The state Director General of Police (DGP) has given a proposal for their suspension to ensure free and fair probe into the charges against them, Walse Patil said. The home department has sought more details into the charges against them. These officials include five deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) and five assistant commissioners of police (ACPs), he said. So far, Param Bir Singh and Parag Manere, who served as DCP, have been suspended, the minister said. Meanwhile, during discussions over a question on illegal sand trafficking, Maharashtra revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat told the House that the state government will “fix the offset price for auction at Rs 600”. There is also a plan to reduce the period to take a decision on the auction and consider invoking Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) after discussing the matter with the law and judiciary department, he said. So far, penalty amounting to Rs 1.21 crore has been recovered for illegal sand trafficking, he added.PTI||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-disciplinary-steps-against-ex-cp-initiated-by-centre/articleshow/88441965.cms||---

The police identified the accused as Haja, 38, and his brother, Rafi, 37, of Karimadom Colony here. Police have also seized nearly 500 grams of ganja from the two men. The police said that the two men were arrested as a result of the vigil maintained by the police against drug and ganja mafia activities in the city. Recently, the city narcotic cell Assistant Commissioner Sheen Tharayil received information regarding the illegal activities of the two brothers. The police had been monitoring their activities ever since. They were arrested after the members of the narcotic cell and Fort police station conducted a joint raid at their house in which they found the ganja. The officials from Fort police station that took part in the raid were led by sub inspectors Chandran, Saju Abraham and Premachandran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/brothers-arrested-in-ganja-peddling-case/articleshow/88419462.cms||---

As per the Annual Crime Report-2021 of Hyderabad police released on Wednesday by commissioner Anjani Kumar, the overall crime (IPC+ Special Local Laws(SLL) + other non-IPC) in the city has come down from 22,641 cases in 2020 to 20,012 cases in 2021. While there were 64 murders in 2020, it rose to 85 in 2021. Attempt to murders also increased from 120 cases in 2020 to 175 in 2021. The commissioner said that an analysis of murder cases in city revealed that sexual jealousy, illicit relationship and property disputes were the prime motives. Crimes against women too went up from 1,908 cases in 2020 to 2,393 cases in 2021. In the year 2019, the category had 2,354 cases. Referring to rape cases, the commissioner pointed out that in 95% of such cases registered in the last few years, the complaint was against a known individual for not keeping his promise to marry. “There are only three cases in which strangers committed rape. In cases of harassment against women, there is an increase of 1%,” he said. When asked about the alleged bias in favour of TRS by Hyderabad police while granting police permission for protests in city, Kumar denied the charge and said that the opposition parties were granted more opportunities to hold protests than the ruling party. The top cop also denied giving any targets to traffic policemen on fines. “Our aim is not collection of fine. Police objective is motorists’ safety. Collection of fines has increased since there has been a revision under the Motor Vehicles Act,” Kumar added. In the backdrop of Telangana high court directing traffic police not to seize vehicles in drunk driving cases, he said the police are complying with the order and the custody of the vehicle is being given to a sober friend or relative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/citys-2021-crime-tally-lowerthan-lockdown-hit-last-year/articleshow/88441025.cms||Srinath Vudali

---||Kochi||‘I enjoyed debates with him, he wasn’t biased’||P T Thomas was a strong and powerful leader even during our college days and his political interventions as a student-leader was a major topic of discussion among students at that time. I was not much familiar with him personally when I was at Maharaja’s College in Ernakulam as he joined the college after we left the campus. But I remember he was a regular visitor to the campus. I don’t want to talk more about students’ politics of those days because of some ‘unfavourite’ things that happened, including violence on the campus. But one thing I can surely say is that he managed to strongly challenge the supremacy of SFI on the campus. It was after he became an MLA that I got an opportunity to build a personal relationship with him. As an MLA of the opposition party, he vehemently criticized the Left government. But there was respect in his criticism against opponents and opposing political parties. He strongly defended UDF’s stand on the assembly floor. I had on many occasions debated with him on KIIFB and treasury bill issues. But he never personally attacked me and our debates never ended up in a clash. That is a quality essential to a politician. And my replies to his allegations also were in the same manner always. Many politicians have attacked me personally, but P T always avoided such unhealthy criticism. I was never unhappy over debates with P T because he was not politically biased in the matters related to developmental projects, including KIIFBI. During the discussions related to the development of various sectors, which were held at Ernakulam, his attitude was very positive and cooperative. I had also cooperated well in implementing various developmental projects in his constituency, during my tenure as finance minister in last LDF government. I think he had also appreciated my efforts in this regard. He was keen to keep friendship with me and always behaved to me like an intimate friend. He was a die-hard congress man unlike many other leaders of his party. When other leaders are selective in defending criticisms against the party, P T Thomas always strongly supported his party. And he was also proud of criticizing the left government. PT’s attitude towards environmental issues was very positive. But unfortunately, there were also some inevitable political compromises from his part, in some issues. Recently, I came to know that he was suffering from cancer. But I was hopeful that he will recover within days. The senior leader’s death is a great loss for his party and also for the society.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||POCSO case: Man gets 30 years RI||Thiruvananthapuram: The Fast Track Special Court here on Tuesday sentenced a 32-year-old man for rigorous imprisonment of 30 years after he was found guilty of raping a minor girl. Sunil Alphonse residing near Valiyathura Hospital is the one who has received the sentence. The judge R Jayakrishnan has also imposed a penalty of Rs 1 lakh on him. Failure to pay the penalty will result in extension of the sentence to one more year. The judge held that the penalty amount must be paid to the survivor. She is also entitled to get appropriate compensation from the government’s victim compensation fund, the judge ruled. According to public prosecutor R S Vijay Mohan, the crime related to this took place on February 26, 2014, when Sunil Alphonse was 24 years old and the survivor was 16 years old. Sunil Alphonse is the second accused in the case. The first accused was also a minor, aged 16, at the time of the crime. He is facing trial before the Juvenile Justice Board. The prosecution case is that the first accused summoned the survivor to his residence following which the second accused raped her with the former’s help. The survivor happened to be a close friend of the sister of the first accused. He tricked her into visiting his house telling her that his sister wanted to meet her. Once she entered the house, the two accused overpowered her, gagged by inserting her mouth and raped her. She was spared when a woman living next door came to the house hearing the survivor’s cry for help. When she knocked at the door, Sunil Alphonse fled through the kitchen door and the juvenile delinquent walked out of the house without uttering a word. Though this woman turned hostile later during the trial, the prosecution could prove the crime with the help of the survivor’s statements as well as scientific evidence provided by the doctor who examined her following the rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pocso-case-man-gets-30-years-ri/articleshow/88419471.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Letting unvaccinated use local trains will spread virus: Maharashtra govt to HC||MUMBAI: The state government on Wednesday told the Bombay high court that allowing everyone, irrespective of their vaccination status, to travel by public transport will not only endanger lives but also negate all its efforts taken so far to prevent Covid-19 transmission. “Allowing unvaccinated persons to mix with people by using public transport will only endanger lives and invite explosive transmission of coronavirus and its subsequent variants, and the government of Maharashtra, as parens patriae (state as protector), cannot afford to take that risk,” it said, in reply to two PILs by Feroze Mithiborwala and Yohan Tengra to allow unvaccinated persons to travel by local trains. On December 15, a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta, directed chief secretary Debashish Chakrabarty, who is also member of State Disaster Management Authority, to explain the rationale for division of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons to travel by local trains. Explaining the “logic”, Chakrabarty said a doubly vaccinated person, even if he or she contracts Covid infection, is expected to have reduced chances of hospital stay or requirement of oxygen. “These are scarce public resources and were stretched in the last wave,” he added. Further, that though in-house oxygen production has increased, demand cannot be contained without getting citizens fully vaccinated. “No citizen can proclaim his or her fundamental right to get reckless to bring pressure on resources like oxygen and hospitals that must be considered scarce public resources,” he added. “Unfortunately, the problem is not over as yet. There is likelihood of a third wave, and there is also likelihood of the spread of new variant of the virus known as Omicron,” he said. The reply said the restriction on unvaccinated persons is applicable not only to local train services but “all types of public transport.” Also, it would be “reasonable restriction” under the Constitution in larger public interest. The reply said before the pandemic the average number of persons traveling by local trains in Central and Western Railway was nearly 80 lakh per day. Compared to that only on December 20, 2021 it was 37.33 lakh on CR and 28.82 lakh on WR. The judges posted the hearing on January 3.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-letting-unvaxxed-use-local-trains-will-spread-virus/articleshow/88441043.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Overall there has been a 55% jump in cyber crime cases in 2021 when compared to the year 2019. During the annual press conference, senior Hyderabad police said that in the last 15 days they received 5 new complaints. As of now, 46 apps have emerged. Officials said a large number of people have been falling prey to the investment frauds. In this year, 162 cases were registered after the concerned victims lost Rs 7.48 crores. “In the pretext of investment in crypto currency, fraudsters have cheated several persons. So far 16 cases have been registered. We appeal to the people to approach only those crypto traders who are reputed in this field to avoid getting cheated,” police said. Similarly, police also appealed to people not to use app based loans to avoid getting harassed. In online financial frauds, after the victims quickly contacted the helpline number 155260, police could freeze Rs 1 crore of victims in the bank accounts, before it reaches fraudsters. Till now, 3,743 complaints have been registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spike-in-loan-app-harassment-seen-this-yr/articleshow/88441034.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dehradun: Temples established by Adi Shankaracharya under threat from hydropower project in Garhwal hills||DEHRADUN: The residents of Nani (Choti) Kashi, a historic village in Chamoli district of Garhwal, that has temples believed to be established by Adi Shankracharya, the 8th century philosopher saint, have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pointing out that the 444 MW Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydroelectric power (HEP) project being executed by Tehri Hydro Development Corporation (THDC) near their village is posing a serious threat to their homes as well as ancient temples in the area. The letter, sent by gram pradhan Rajendra Hatwal, highlights that THDC has set up a muck dumping zone right above the sanctum sanctorum of the Lakshmi Narayan temple established by Adi Shankaracharya. “The wall of the dumping zone can fall anytime and severely damage the temple,” the gram pradhan said in the letter. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), has also come out in support of the villagers and written to THDC as well as World Bank, which is funding the project, to “restore the impacted sites and also conserve the historic village in its entirety.” Divay Gupta, principal director of the architectural heritage division of INTACH, in his letter dated December 21, said, “The ancient complex (including the temple sites and remains) and village settlement must be included in the protected list of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Instead, the hydroelectric power project is in dangerously close vicinity to the ancient settlement and sacred sites. Sadly, they are designated as ‘muck dumping sites’ of the power project, which renders this important heritage site at serious risk of permanent loss.” Gupta, in his letter, also cited the report filed by the ASI in 2009 after a survey of the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti HEP project site. He said, “The ASI report stated that the Lakshmi Narayan Temple, which dates back to 9-10th century AD, is located in project immediate affected area”. On the other hand, the environmental impact assessment by THDC says that the “project does not have any impact on cultural resources within the project influence area and the project immediate affected area”. Meanwhile, the World Bank authorities held an online meeting with around two dozen villagers on Wednesday. The meeting was also attended by those villagers who had refused to relocate for the HEP project in 2009. When asked about the meeting, Hatwal said, “We asked them how could the World Bank sanction a loan if it is not even aware of the project site and its historic importance? Our village has almost 15-20 small temple groups belonging to the ancient era. Recently, an over 1000-year-old copper plate was found at a villager’s house, suggesting the historical significance of our village. Despite the rich legacy, authorities have chosen our village as a muck dumping site for building a 14.5-km-long tunnel from Birayi in Pipalkoti village to Helang.” Hatwal added, “We also highlighted the huge disparity between the ASI report and that of the THDC. To this, the World Bank officials said that they would come to the village again in February or March but we rejected their offer saying that by that time, our village will be in ruins. Later, we were given an assurance that a meeting will be held to discuss the issue with THDC and subsequently, they will meet us in person.” Earlier in the day, the villagers didn’t allow THDC officials to join the meeting. Notably, the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti HEP project has courted controversy since its inception as half of the villagers claimed they were not taken into confidence or not given full information regarding their rehabilitation process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/temples-established-by-adi-shankaracharya-under-threat-from-hydropower-project-in-garhwal-hills/articleshow/88440383.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Govt scraps 2016 housing scheme for mill workers||Mumbai: A housing scheme, whereby rental flats constructed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) were to be given to mill workers, has been scrapped, state housing minister Jitendra Awhad told the legislative council on Wednesday. Awhad was responding to a question raised by Congress MLC Bhai Jagtap during question hour. Awhad said the scheme was to merge 160 sq ft rental flats and give them to the mill workers. “This was in 2016. They were to get 320 sq feet flats with two toilets which made no sense. The workers had even paid Rs 6 lakh for the same to the MMRDA, but the flats have still not been handed over to the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (MHADA) for disbursement,” said Awhad. The housing minister said it is best to return the money to the mill workers. MHADA has been offering flats to the mill workers as and when they are available and to workers who had paid the amount on a priority basis. The BJP-Shiv Sena government was in power in Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019. The Housing department was with the BJP at that time. These houses for mill workers were constructed by the MMRDA. Later, MHADA decided to allot these houses to mill workers. Awhad said MHADA never received any payment made by mill workers to MMRDA. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-scraps-2016-housing-scheme-for-mill-workers/articleshow/88441989.cms||---
