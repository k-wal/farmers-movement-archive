SR general manager John Thomas said the work on two additional platforms at the station has already commenced. “The work of pit line development will be completed by March and new platforms will be ready by September. The additional platforms will help the railways operate more trains to the Mangaluru Central railway station considering the demands of the people from the region,” he told reporters after holding an annual inspection on Tuesday. Paschima Karavali Railway Yatri Abhivridhi Samithi members submitted a memorandum urging the SR Palakkad division to expedite the work on the additional platforms. They also demanded a second entry point to the railway station from the Attavar side. The GM said that a second arrival hall will also be developed along with the additional platforms. In a memorandum, Samithi had urged SR to operate the Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction special express train from Mangaluru Central (using the bay line platform) instead of operating it from Mangaluru Junction railway station. They also urged the railways to run Yeshvantpur-Mangaluru Junction day express (Gomateshwara Express) up to Mangaluru Central railway station with a revised timing and to extend Mangaluru-Puttur passenger train up to Subrahmanya Road. Activist G K Bhat said CSMT Mumbai Express should be extended to Mangaluru Central railway station and a stoppage should be provided for Matsyagandha Express at Mangaluru junction. The tri-weekly Bengaluru-Mangaluru central express via Mysuru should be made a daily train, he added. The GM said the demands for extending the train services to Mangaluru Central railway station will be considered as two more platforms are being constructed. The GM said the Chervathur-Mangaluru passenger train, which helps thousands of students from Kerala studying in Mangaluru, will be re-introduced soon. “We had suspended the train service following the pandemic. The services of several passenger trains have not yet resumed since Kerala has been recording more than 45% of Covid-19 cases in the country. After reviewing Covid-19 situation, especially the threat of the Omicron variant, the railways will resume passenger service trains soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/two-more-platforms-at-mangaluru-central-railway-station-by-september/articleshow/88417331.cms||Vinobha K T

In what could be even more disconcerting for the J&K administration, parties in Jammu cried foul over Kashmir division getting more seats overall as part of the Centre’s alleged “appeasement policy”. "The constitutional framework of delimitation, including taking cognisance of the latest census data, has been ignored in the case of J&K," Gupkar alliance spokesperson Yousuf Tarigami said after the National Conference-led group met at Srinagar MP and party president Farooq Abdullah’s Batindi residence in Jammu. "PAGD leaders have decided to hold a protest on at 11am on the first day of the new year against the delimitation proposals, which are unacceptable to us and all communities of J&K. We see the draft, which envisages creating six new constituencies in Jammu and only one in Kashmir division, as a divisive move," the spokesperson said. Tarigami, who is also a central committee member of the CPM, sought to dispel the notion that Farooq and two other NC colleagues didn't speak out against the proposals when they met the delimitation commission in a Delhi hotel. J&K People's Conference chief Sajad Lone, who walked out of the Gupkar alliance over differences with NC several months ago, had tweeted on Monday that Farooq and his colleagues sitting with the delimitation panel was "a U-turn". In Jammu, J&K National Panthers Party, Apni Party and Shiv Sena (Thackeray) on Tuesday demanded "equal seat share" in the delimitation process. "Allocating 43 seats to the Jammu region against 47 to Kashmir is wholly unjustified against the backdrop of the norms and criteria laid down in Section 60 of the J&K Reorganization Act for delimitation of assembly constituencies," Panthers Party chairperson and former minister Harsh Dev Singh said. Singh pointed out that while the population of Kashmir division was 12% higher than that of Jammu, the latter's geographical span was almost twice that of the Valley. He said the average size of an assembly constituency in Kashmir was 346 sq km against Jammu's 710 sq km. "Gurez constituency in Kashmir dicision was created with approximately 16,000 voters, which is a fraction of the 1.6 lakh-odd voters in Jammu West and Gandhi Nagar constituencies. The BJP government at the Centre has once again chosen to continue with its appeasement policy in J&K, keeping Jammu seats lower than that of Kashmir division," Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pagd-calls-january-1-protest-rally-over-delimitation-draft-jammu-demands-equal-seat-share/articleshow/88419777.cms||M Saleem Pandit

With the signing of the agreement between the top officials and power staff, the indefinite strike was called off and the staff began to restore power in the state with immediate effect. Most of the 20 districts of Jammu and Kashmir had been facing power breakdown amid harsh winter conditions since the strike bagn on Friday, and the Army had been called to help restore essential services. The power staff had been on strike opposing the merger of Jammu and Kashmir Power Transmission Corporation Limited (JKPTC) with the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCI). An official team led by divisional commissioner Raghav Langar and ADGP Mukesh Singh of Jammu held a fresh round of talks late Monday night with the PDD employees’ association led by its general secretary S Tickoo and gave them a written assurance of accepting their demands, the union leaders said. Jammu University had to postponed its offline and online examinations for undergraduate and postgraduate students on Tuesday in view of the strike. The PDD employees had held anti-government protests in Srinagar and Jammu demanding in writing from the Lieutenant Governor that the administration has shelved the proposal of merger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/power-employees-call-off-strike-as-jk-govt-agrees-to-all-demands/articleshow/88419788.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||Goa||After Ferrando’s exit, Derrick enters bio-bubble as FC Goa’s chief coach||Panaji: In the end, the choice was simple. FC Goa drew up a two-man shortlist to replace coach Juan Ferrando and surprised nobody when they handed over the teams’ reins to Derrick Pereira. Until Saturday, Derrick was the club’s technical director, looking after teams from under-16 to reserves. On Sunday, he was elevated as chief coach of the senior team, following the departure of Ferrando to ATK Mohun Bagan. “Derrick is ingrained into the fabric of the club and is well versed with our players and staff with a vast majority of them having worked with him,” said club’s director of football Ravi Puskur. “He will settle into the day to day workings of the team seamlessly and we’re certain he will continue to push our brand of football. “A Goan taking over FC Goa is the perfect representation of what we believe in and we are confident he will make his mark on this team and will continue to push the team towards its objectives.” When the club parted ways with Sergio Lobera in 2020 with three league games still left to be played, besides the playoffs, Derrick had stepped in. This time, Spanish coach Angel Viadero was also on the shortlist, but with bio-bubble requirements – mandatory quarantine of 11 days for foreigners – it made sense to hand charge to someone who could move into the bubble straightway. “Once again, we turn to Derrick to guide us out of a mid-season crisis and graciously, he has accepted. He will fit like a glove, because he pretty much built most of it. I am sure he is going to do a great job as head coach of @FCGoaOfficial,” club president Akshay Tandon said in a tweet. Derrick has been with FC Goa since 2017, serving as the assistant coach in his first year before taking up the role of technical director in 2018. He headed the club’s youth development with three of his teams finishing as champions. Derrick was also in charge of the India U-23 team in 2019, but has been more popular for his coaching roles and success with Vasco SC, Mahindra United, Pune FC, Salgaocar SC and Churchill Bros. "This is a wonderful opportunity, but there is also a lot of work ahead of us. I am eager to get onto the training ground to start working with the players. "I would like to thank the club management for this opportunity and thank the club's supporters for the incredible welcome they have already given me. I am very excited to begin our journey together,” said Derrick. Tandon said Derrick ensures that the club’s style of play is never compromised. “He has ensured that the philosophy of the club, which has always been to produce players for the first team, remains intact. This is why our development team players seem to fit into the first team so easily. “Selfishly, I have not wanted him in the first team role because he is so important to the club. He represents FC Goa’s vision better than anyone and I am grateful to have him and too scared to lose him. But things don't always go according to plan,” said the club president. Interim coach Clifford Miranda, who will be assistant to Derrick, will take charge of Goa’s next clash against Odisha FC on December 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-ferrandos-exit-derrick-enters-bio-bubble-as-fc-goas-chief-coach/articleshow/88419840.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa Chess Association poll: Disqualified candidates get big boost||Panaji: The Appellate Authority of the All India Chess Federation (AICF) has provided a boost to the rival faction within the Goa Chess Association. Mahesh Candolkar (Tiswadi), Ashesh Keni (Salcete), Vishwas Pilankar (Bardez) and Amogh Namshikar (Ponda) who were contesting for the post of president, secretary, treasurer and joint secretary have taken their battle to the AICF after they were disqualified and presiding officer Subhash Shirodkar declared others elected unopposed. According to an order issued by the Appellate Authority of AICF, any two executive members among nine elected members of the executive members of the affiliated taluka chess associations, duly authorised in writing, could be nominated to contest and vote for any posts of the executive committee. There was also was no justification in rejecting the nominations of Candolkar and others by the presiding officer, particularly when on scrutiny their nomination papers were found valid, states the order. The Appellate Authority agreed with the findings of the AICF Ethic Commission, holding that the action of the presiding officer was “contrary to principles of natural justice,” while also stating that no proper opportunity was granted to Candolkar and others. The order is a boost for the G7 group -- Tiswadi, Salcete, Bardez, Sattari, Pednem, Ponda and Bicholim – who have been fighting against the disqualification. All eyes will now be on AICF. The federation will take a final call soon. The GCA election results were marred by controversy when secretary Kishor Bandekar issued a release which said there would be no election on August 22 as all candidates were elected unopposed. BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar (Dharbandora) was elected president, while Sharendra Naik (Canacona) and Bandekar (Mormugao) were named secretary and treasurer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-chess-association-poll-disqualified-candidates-get-big-boost/articleshow/88419893.cms||---

He said it remains to be seen how Omicron would behave in India, where there is widespread “exposure” to Delta variant. “At present, Delta derivatives, descendants of Delta, are main variants in circulation in India. Omicron is fast replacing Delta in other parts of the world, but there is no way to predict how Delta derivatives and Omicron would behave,” he said. Moreover, there is hybrid immunity in India. “Sero surveys in Mumbai and Delhi showed that over 90% of the surveyed population had been exposed to Covid,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/delmicron-not-just-omicron-behind-surge-in-cases-in-uk-us/articleshow/88420020.cms||---

Three cases were reported in J&K and two in Odisha. With this, the number of Omicron-affected states and UTs has risen from 12 to 14. The country’s highest single day Omicron count earlier was on December 18 when 30 cases were reported. Delhi reported the highest number of fresh cases (24), followed by Maharashtra which recorded 11 infections. Maharashtra and Delhi, with 65 and 54 total cases, respectively, alone account for 55% of the Omicron infections in the country. Telangana, which reported four fresh cases on Tuesday, is the third most affected state with 24 infections. With three cases detected in Jammu, Omicron spread further north in the country, days after a case was recorded in Chandigarh. None of the infected persons have a history of foreign travel. The sample of the infected persons were taken from a cluster in Jammu on November 30, as per health officials. In Odisha, two returnees from abroad, one from Nigeria and the other from Qatar, were found to be infected with Omicron. Both patients are showing mild symptoms. In Maharashtra, of the 11 fresh Omicron cases, eight infected persons were detected following screening at Mumbai airport. In Telangana, one of the four cases was a doctor who came in contact with an Omicron patient who was undergoing treatment for cancer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1st-cases-in-odisha-jk-omicron-tally-at-218/articleshow/88420092.cms||---

The Rt value or the effective reproduction value of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gone up in a few states, including Maharashtra. An Rt value of 1 means one patient can spread the disease to one other person. In a tweet, epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu on Tuesday said states with an increase in Rt values on December 19 as compared to December 13 are Bihar, MP, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Odisha, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Manipur and Nagaland. India’s effective Rt is 0.89 as on December 19, he added. In the week ending November 2, the Rt value in Maharashtra was 0.7 and kept steadily increasing — 0.82 (November 14), 0.96 (November 22) — before falling — 0.92 (November 29) and 0.85 (December 6). In the last two weeks, the Rt value in the state has again started rising: 1.08 (December 19). The rising weekly caseload and Rt value are, as per doctors, an indicator of how the Covid graph will turn out in the next month. Rahul Pandit, a member of the state government’s task force on Covid-19, said there is no cause for panic yet. “Any rise in R value is a cause for concern and means the public health machinery should strengthen its surveillance and contact tracing,” he further stated. Read AlsoOmicron spreads wings: Mask up, avoid crowdAccording to Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, the emergence of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has indeed increased the chances of a resurgence in Covid cases. “While we cannot stop infections given the highly transmissible nature of the new variant which infectsShashank Joshi, also a task force member, said: “The third wave seemed remote a few months ago, but the emergence of the Omicron variant that spreads five times more rapidly than Delta has raised the possibility of cluster outbreak and the third wave.” Internal medicine specialist Swapneil Parikh said a third wave is inevitable. “Based on developments in other countries, cases in India too will increase. What remains to be seen is what… sort of load the third wave would put on hospital infrastructure,” he said. However, most doctors said immunity due to vaccine, past infection will blunt the severity of the possible Omicron wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/third-wave-inevitable-but-no-cause-for-panic-yet-experts/articleshow/88420140.cms||---

Introducing the bill, an assertive Smriti Irani, the minister for women and child development, made it clear that the bill seeks to override all existing laws, including “any custom, usage or practice” governing the parties in relation to marriage. The move will involve bringing all related laws, including personal laws, in consonance with amendments. These include the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; and the Foreign Marriage Act. Although Irani said that the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 would be sent to a parliamentary standing committee, strong reaction by some on the opposition benches and her defiance provided an early peek into what might unfold in the deliberations in the committee room, the House and, most importantly, in the public arena. In fact, the introduction of the bill was preceded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking on the opponents of the legislation at a public meeting of women in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday. Protesting opposition members hit out at the government for introducing the bill in a “hurry” and “without any consultation with stakeholders” and demanded that the bill be sent to a standing committee. Even as she said that the government would have sent the bill to the standing committee anyway, Irani strongly justified the bill was a “decisive step” for achieving parity between the ages when men and women can marry which had been 75 years in the making. She scoffed at the allegation that the bill was communal. She asserted that it is a secular measure which will be “uniformly applicable across all religions, castes and creed overriding any custom or any law which seeks to discriminate against women”. Irani buttressed her contention by recalling Supreme Court’s observations in the “Independent Thought versus Union of India” case of 2010. She said that the court had called the Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 2006 a secular law. “... And from the point of view of Muslim Personal Law, Hindu Marriage Act and all other religions, castes and communities, women should get equal rights in terms of age of marriage,” she added. “In a democracy, we are 75 years late in providing equal rights to men and women to enter into matrimony. In the 19th century, the age of marriage for girls was 10 years, till 1940 the age was raised from 12 to 14 years and till 1978, girls were married at the age of 15. Through this amendment, for the first time, men and women will be able to make a decision on marriage at the age of 21, keeping in mind the right to equality,” she added. Making a strong case for the amendments, Irani cited the National Family Health Survey-5 findings to assert that it shows that 7% of the girls aged between 15 and 18 years were found to be pregnant and nearly 23% of the girls in the 20-24 age group were married below the age of 18 years. She cited research to point that from 2015 to 2020, 20 lakh child marriages have been stopped. In the statement of objects and reasons of the bill, it has been highlighted how underage marriage remains a concern. “The Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, was replaced by the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, to prohibit solemnisation of child marriages, but this highly pernicious practice is still not completely eradicated from our society. Hence, there is an urgent need to tackle this societal issue and to bring in reforms,” it stated. There are also imperatives for lowering maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate, as well as improvement of nutrition levels and sex ratio at birth, as these would promote possibilities of responsible parenthood for both father and mother, making them more capable of taking better care of their children, the bill says. “It is also important to bring down the incidence of teenage pregnancies, which are not only harmful for women's overall health, but also result in more miscarriages and stillbirths.” The amendments to the bill will become effective two years from the date it receives the President’s nod so as to provide sufficient opportunity to one and all in the collective efforts and inclusive growth, and to make effective other provisions immediately. The bill, which seeks to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, provides that anyone married before the legal age of marriage (21) will be able to seek annulment of the marriage up to five years instead of the two years currently provided under law from the time of attaining majority (18 years).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bill-to-up-girls-marriage-age-in-lok-sabha-to-be-sent-to-parliament-committee/articleshow/88420251.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||India||Rajya Sabha passes electoral reforms bill by voice vote amid opposition walkout||NEW DELHI: Amid a walkout by opposition and dramatic scenes, a bill to link electoral roll data with the Aadhaar ecosystem was passed by Parliament on Tuesday concluding the parliamentary process involved in the legislation that will now become the law once it receives the President's assent. The Rajya Sabha approved the bill by a voice vote, within a space of an hour, a day after it was passed by Lok Sabha. TMC’s Derek O'Brien flung a rulebook at the reporters’ table after which the TMC MP was suspended from the House for “unruly behaviour”. The hour-long discussion on the bill continued amid protests by opposition members who also stormed into the well shouting slogans. They demanded that the bill be sent to a select committee and, once that was rejected, they staged a walkout. Responding to criticism of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, law minister Kiren Rijiju said in “our democracy, the electoral process should be cleansed and that can happen only if the electoral rolls are clean”. Describing the reform as a “revolutionary step”, Rijiju asserted that linking of electoral rolls to the Aadhaar number is only voluntary and not compulsory. He said this will will help end fake and bogus voting and add to the credibility of the electoral process. The bill has other features like allowing multiple dates for voter registration in a year. The bill seeks to allow electoral registration officers to seek the Aadhaar number of people who want to register as voters with the government arguing that the ID will help control fraud and duplicate registrations. It would also make transfer and deletion of voters’ names easier. Underlining that the linkage is voluntary, the amendment bill also states that “no application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll shall be denied and no entries in the electoral roll shall be deleted for inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed”. Read AlsoLinking of electoral data with Aadhaar: All you need to knowThe bill seeks to link electoral rolls to the Aadhaar number, allowing electoral registration officers to ask for the 12-digit number of applicants who want to register as voters to establish their identity.Rijiju said the opposition members were “misinterpreting” the Supreme Court's judgement on personal liberty. “There is no basis of your opposition to the bill. The Election Commission and government have held many meetings and the EC's biggest concern is that the same person has name in multiple electoral rolls and there is no other system to check this,” he said. He also said every Indian above 18 years can get their name included in the voters list and they will get four occasions in a year to register themselves with the EC. Members of BJP, BJD, AIADMK, JD(U), YSRCP and TDP said it will help in eradicating duplicate and fake voters from electoral rolls. Members of Congress, TMC, DMK, CPI-M, CPI, Samajwadi Party, RJD, AAP and NCP walked out from the House in protest. They earlier opposed the bill saying it infringes on voters' right to privacy and goes against the Supreme Court judgement. Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and CPI-M member John Brittas demanded division on the motion to send the bill to the select committee. They said that not allowing it was against the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajya-sabha-passes-electoral-reforms-bill-by-voice-vote-amid-opposition-walkout/articleshow/88420371.cms||---

In a televised address, Biden formally announced a raft of new measures to combat the winter surge -- including shipping half a billion at home tests -- but denied his administration had failed to adequately prepare for the fresh wave of cases. "We should all be concerned about Omicron but not panicked," he said from the White House. "This is not March of 2020," he continued. "Two hundred million people are fully vaccinated. We're prepared, we know more. We just have to stay focused." Biden stressed the country's immunization campaign would help prevent severe cases among the 62 percent of the population now fully vaccinated -- while scolding the unvaccinated for failing to uphold their "patriotic duty." He also urged everyone to get a booster shot in order to increase their level of protection against the highly-mutated Omicron strain. "Just the other day, former president Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot," said Biden, calling the gesture "maybe one of the few things he and I agree on." Beyond vaccines, the country's stockpile of medical equipment -- including personal protective gear and ventilators -- together with greater knowledge about how to tackle the virus without shutting down schools means America was in a far better position as compared with last year, he added. Biden announced his administration's plan to combat the surge, including deploying military personnel to hospitals, shipping supplies to hard-hit states and getting new free testing sites up and running. The federal government will mobilize 1,000 doctors, nurses and military medical personnel to be deployed across the country as needed in January and February. Washington is already sending additional emergency teams to the states of Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. One of the most eye-catching steps was the announcement that the government will ship 500 million at-home tests to Americans who seek them. This would bring the United States more in line with fellow rich countries where the tests are widely available for free or at low cost -- but the measure would only begin sometime in January. Biden's administration has come under fire for its failure to be ready for the winter surge, America's fifth wave. But getting the virus under control has proved difficult in a country where vaccination and mask-wearing have become divisive political issues, and federal mandates end up in protracted legal battles. Biden has attempted to impose vaccine mandates on private businesses and federal employees but has resorted in recent weeks to little more than publicly beseeching people to get their shots. At-home tests are currently in scarce supply across the nation while there are long lines at free testing sites in major cities -- reminiscent of the pandemic's early days. Biden however said it was impossible to anticipate the rate of Omicron's spread. "What happened was the Omicron virus spread even more rapidly than anybody thought," he told a reporter. Asked about the travel ban that was imposed on several southern African nations soon after the existence of the Omicron variant was first reported, he said: "I'm considering reversing it, and I'm going to talk with my team in the next couple of days." The variant seems to have peaked in South Africa's Gauteng province, its former epicenter, while overall hospitalizations appear to be down compared to the country's previous Covid waves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/were-prepared-to-tackle-omicron-virus-variant-biden/articleshow/88420433.cms||---

The number of CEO/CXOs in the million-dollar salary bracket (over Rs 7.4 crore) dropped to 125 in 2020-21 from 150 a year ago, while the average salary jumped by over 21% to Rs 20.4 crore (Rs 16.8 crore in FY20). According to TOI’s "million-dollar salary" study conducted by EMA Partners, the total compensation earned by 125 top executives increased by just 1.4 per cent to Rs 2,549 crore in 2020-21. The study is based on annual reports of BSE 200 companies. Based on TOI’s previous studies, the growth in total compensation has come down since FY19, when it witnessed a near-14 per cent jump, to around 2 per cent in FY20. However, average salaries have been on the rise. In FY20, average salary growth was muted at 0.4 per cent, while in FY19 it dipped by 3 per cent. One of the reasons for the shrinking of the elite club is the weakening of the rupee against the dollar. The rupee has depreciated nearly 6 per cent against the dollar since a year ago, ending FY21 at just over Rs 73. To calculate the million-dollar salaries, the rupee was taken at 74 to the dollar. This set a Rs 7.4-crore annual compensation as the cutoff to be included in the "million-dollar salary club". In FY20, the rupee was at 70 against the dollar, when the elite club had 150 members. The club of professional CXOs at 68 continues to outpace that led by promoters, which is at 57. The gap between the growth in compensation earned by promoter CXOs and professional CXOs too has widened.  In the year under review, while professional CXOs saw a 6.4 per cent growth in compensation, promoter CXOs took a hit as their total compensation declined by 2.3 per cent in FY21. Among promoter CEOs, Kavery and Kalanithi Maran of Sun TV lead the list this year as well with a compensation of about Rs 88 crore each. Sajjan Jindal is back in the top 10 with a compensation of Rs 73 crore, which includes a profit-linked commission of Rs 60 crore. EMA Partners India MD K Sudarshan said, "Despite the pandemic, which raged through 2020-21, most businesses have bounced back smartly and companies have posted impressive numbers. Companies have also witnessed depressed costs due to various cost-control measures through the year. Consequently, we have not seen any significant change in CEO compensation, which has seen a slight increase when compared to the previous year. As has been the trend, in line with the growing scale of businesses, we continue to see more professionals in the mix who are now earning top-dollar compensation in line with their global peers." Some executives who retired and exited the club are former HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri and former Asian Paints MD & CEO KBS Anand. New entrants to the club include Thierry Delaporte, who took over as the CEO of Wipro in 2020 with a compensation of Rs 64 crore, which takes him straight to the top 10; Pratik Pota of Jubilant FoodWorks (Rs 12 crore); Sunil D’Souza of Tata Consumer Products (Rs 10 crore); and Samina Hamied of Cipla (Rs 8 crore). Some like Salil Parekh of Infosys have made it to the top 10 with a 45 per cent jump in compensation to about Rs 50 crore as it includes Rs 31 crore of stock options exercised during the year. Sudarshan said he expects to see a growing number of professional managers dominating this list even as hands-on business promoter managers continue to feature as their businesses gain scale. "Shareholders and watchdogs are closely watching CEO compensation than ever before. Boards will tread with caution and keep overall shareholder interests in mind and CEO performance in listed businesses will come under increased scrutiny," said Sudarshan. In the million-dollar salary club, 28 CXOs are from the pharmaceuticals sector; 19 are from industrial/manufacturing (down from 33 a year ago); 16 are from diversified conglomerates, 14 are from automotive (down from 17), 13 are from financial services, 10 from consumer/FMCG and 10 from IT/ITEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/million-ceo-club-sees-17-drop-in-membership-in-financial-year-2021/articleshow/88420443.cms||Namrata Singh
---||Business||IPO pipeline expected to swell by over Rs 2 lakh crore in 2022: Report||MUMBAI: After the record-breaking IPO rally with as many as 65 issuers collecting a whopping Rs 1.35 lakh crore so far this year, the market frenzy is set to continue next year with new issues worth over Rs 2 lakh crore ($26 billion) in the pipeline, according to a report. The year 2021 has seen the highest-ever IPO volumes in the country with the volumes surging to $15.3 billion, as against $4.2 billion in 2020. That means the Street saw more IPOs in 2021 than in the year past three years combined, both in the number of listings and amount raised, Kotak Mahindra Capital Company told reporters on Tuesday. And, the IPO frenzy is set to continue next year with $26 billion worth of issues being in the pipeline, the brokerage said. It added that the new issues will be dominated by resilient sectors such as new-age tech, healthcare, consumer, realty and speciality chemicals issues. While IPOs worth $15 billion have already been filed with the Sebi, issues worth $11 billion are likely to be filed near-term by several high-quality companies across large-caps and mid-caps. This means that IPO fundraising will continue to remain buoyant from companies. V Jayasankar, whole-time director at the brokerage, told reporters that overall, 2022 would be good for the capital fundraising market. He added that the brokerage led 19 of the 26 IPOs of over $200 million helping raise $7.96 billion from 18 issuances. The average IPO size also shot up significantly to Rs 2,000 crore with seven of the 65 companies raising between $250 million and $500 million through the primary share sales, as against two in the previous year. The issue Street was dominated by digital companies. S Ramesh, MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Capital, said the year 2021 has been the year of the retail investor revolution wherein they have turned leaders than being followers. "While 2021 was huge for IPOs, we expect 2022 to be another good year, nevertheless investors should be cautious and not assume all IPOs to hit the bull's eye." On the investment banking fees that i-bankers collected from the busiest capital market year, till date, the fee pool for the first time crossed $1 billion, up around 25 per cent growth over 2020. The rise in fees has been on account of a rise in volumes as well as higher margin and led by the massive surge in initial public offerings (IPOs). Total M&As remain upbeat in 2021, rising four per cent to $118 billion in the first 11 months as compared with $114 billion in 2020, the brokerage said. It added that the deal-making was led by inbound transactions, GIC's investment in IRB, financials investing in Encube Ethicals, Byju's, Swiggy, and Paytm, Billdesk being taken over by Prosus and other large buy-outs such as Carlyle-Hexaware, Fullerton-Sumitomo, etc. The year also saw transactions like Tata's acquisition of BigBasket, 1MG and Tejas Networks, Delhivery's acquisition of Spoton, Pharmeasy's acquisition of Thyrocare. The country saw $58.3 billion of the private equity/ venture capital money flowing into 968 domestic companies, which is nearly 10 times the FPI flows of $4 billion. Also, the total amount invested in 2021 exceeds the combined value of the investment in 2019 and 2020, excluding Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio investments. The year saw $58.3 billion being invested into 968 companies as against $37.6 billion into 671 firms, including $16.3 billion in Reliance Retail and Jio. Of the investment, $15.9 billion were buyouts, $27.2 billion were minority investments in digital and $4.2 billion were minority investments in enterprise tech companies. And, buyouts contributed to 25 per cent of the total PE deal value since 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/markets/ipo/ipo-pipeline-expected-to-swell-by-over-rs-2-lakh-crore-in-2022-report/articleshow/88420522.cms||---
---||Business||Air India paid 'avoidable' Rs 43.85 crore penalty for non-compliance with contractual timelines: CAG||NEW DELHI: Air India shelled out an "avoidable" penalty of Rs 43.85 crore to Boeing for non-adherence with the contractually stipulated timelines under the agreement for an aircraft component service programme, according to CAG. The penalty amount was paid in August last year for the July 2016 to December 2019 period. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has mentioned about the penalty in a report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday wherein it said that "avoidable payment of penalty due to delay in return of removed components" was made by Air India. In December 2015, the airline had entered into an agreement with Boeing for Rotable Exchange Programme related to servicing of 787 aircraft component and the pact came into effect from July 2016. As per the agreement, Air India was required to return the removed component along with the component information to Boeing within 10 calendar days after Boeing delivered the serviceable exchange component and in case of failure to do so, then delayed return fee is payable to the aircraft maker. The national carrier defaulted on the concessional late return fees/ penalty for the period from July 2016 to December 2019, following which Boeing served a letter, in July 2020, intimating suspension of the programme if payment was not received by July 31, 2020. Subsequently, Boeing served six months' notice of termination and withdrew the discounts offered earlier. During the July 2016 to December 2019 period, CAG said there were several instances of delayed return of removed component by Air India over and above the stipulated time limit of 10 days. Citing audit analysis, CAG said that during the initial period (July 2016 to December 2017), there were 170 instances of delayed return and in 88 instances, the delay was more than 30 days with a maximum of 214 days. "... due to non-adherence to the timeline for return of removed parts as stipulated in the Agreement, Air India Limited paid penalty of USD 5.87 million (Rs 43.85 crore) to M/s Boeing," the report said. The apex auditor's findings are part of the report 'Union Government (Commercial) (Compliance Audit Observations) for the year ended 31 March, 2020'. According to CAG, Airports Authority of India (AAI) saw a revenue loss of Rs 15.66 crore due to inadequate assessment and delay in arrangement of required electricity load at Goa airport. The top auditor also mentioned about an avoidable extra expenditure of Rs 6.88 crore after unilateral increase of royalty by AAI in violation of terms of an agreement. Further, it flagged that non-pursuance for reimbursement of electricity charges by AAI in connection with Rajahmundry airport led to Rs 6.36 crore pending with Andhra Pradesh. This is despite there being a provision for such reimbursement in the MoU signed between AAI and the state government to facilitate minimisation of losses to AAI in the initial five years of operationalisation of the Rajahmundry airport. In September, AAI entered into a concession agreement with Travel Food Services Pvt Ltd for food and beverage outlets at Goa airport. Initially, Goa airport had sanctioned electricity load of 4,000 KW and the unutilised load of about 1,000 KW was surrendered in June 2015. In November 2018, AAI applied for additional sanctioned load of 1,500 KW and the same was sanctioned by Goa Electricity Department in January 2019. This was subject to the condition that the cost of Rs 5.67 crore for enhancement of contract demand would be borne by AAI, as per the report. "However, till date electrical work has not been completed and AAI is supplying electricity to TFS from available load at Goa Airport through DG set. Due to non-availability of full load, TFS claimed a further rebate of Rs 17.30 crore against the demand raised by AAI in November 2019. "Hence, inadequate assessment and delay in arrangement of required electricity load at Goa Airport resulted into loss of revenue of Rs 15.66 crore," the CAG report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/air-india-paid-avoidable-rs-43-85-crore-penalty-for-non-compliance-with-contractual-timelines-cag/articleshow/88420551.cms||---

District administrations have been asked to keep a close watch on numbers and proactively analyse trends and surges. Highlighting that the Omicron variant is at least three times more transmissible than Delta, the Centre underlined the need for prompt and focused decisions at the local level as cases can spread rapidly in the absence of timely identification and containment. This is considered necessary even though cases of Omicron have been seen to be mostly mild so far. "Based on current scientific evidence, the VOC (variant of concern) Omicron is at least 3 times more transmissible than the Delta VOC. Besides, the Delta VOC is still present in different parts of the country. Hence, even greater foresight, data analysis, dynamic decision-making and strict & prompt containment action is required at the local and district level. The decision-making at the state/UT and district level must be very prompt and focused," health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter on Tuesday. While the infection might prove to be mild, a large number of cases can increase hospitalisation and deaths and also impact a nascent economic recovery. Till Tuesday morning, 200 cases infected with the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2 were detected through genome sequencing of Covid-19 positive samples from across 12 states and UTs. Of these 77 cases have recovered or migrated, health ministry said. The Centre has directed "all cluster samples must be sent to INSACOG Labs for genome sequencing without delay". The Centre is worried over the rising detection of Omicron cases even as the overall numbers continue to be under control. Officials raised concerns as the detected Omicron cases are only a factor of the size of samples and the real numbers are likely to be much higher, particularly because of the transmissibility. Overall, a total of 5,326 new Covid-19 cases — which includes Delta and other variants — were recorded from across the country on Monday. The active caseload stood at 79,097. Maharashtra reported 65 cases of Omicron while Delhi recorded 54 cases, Telangana registered 20 cases, Karnataka 19, Rajasthan 18, Kerala 15 and Gujarat 14 cases. Read AlsoOmicron variant in circulation in Karnataka for a month nowOmicron has been in circulation in the state for a month and 19 people have been infected by the SARS-CoV2 variant of concern till date. Omicron’s trail has been found in six districts of Karnataka: Bengaluru (8 cases), Belagavi (1), Dakshina Kannada (6), Udupi (2), Shivamogga (1) and Dharwad (1).Pressing districts to constantly review emerging data regarding the population affected by Covid-19, in terms of geographical spread and other parameters, Bhushan suggested test positivity of 10% or more in last one week, bed occupancy of 40% or more on oxygen support or ICU beds be the main elements to assess the needs at the district level. Containment measures and restrictions can be implemented by states or district authorities even before these thresholds are reached if the local situation is such. However, evidence should be the basis for effective decision-making at the district level itself to ensure infection is contained before it spreads to other parts of the state, Bhushan added. "ln case of all new clusters of Covid-positive cases, prompt notification of 'containment zones', 'buffer zones' should be done, strict perimeter control of containment zone as per extant guidelines must be ensured," Bhushan wrote. "Regular reviews with field officers and proactive action in this regard will definitely control the spread of infection and flatten the curve," it said. The Centre also stressed the need for testing, door-to-door case search and testing of all severe acute respiratory illnesses (SARI) and influenza-like illnesses (ILI) cases. States were also asked to ensure that the right proportion of RT-PCR tests be ensured along with contact tracing of all Covid-positive persons and monitoring of international passengers. Bhushan also highlighted the need for timely and effective clinical management, including monitoring of hospital infrastructure and trends, expansion of coverage of double-dose vaccination. "Ensure 100% coverage of left-out first and second dose eligible beneficiaries in an accelerated manner. Special focus to be given to those districts where the first & second dose coverage is less than the national average. The door-to-door vaccination campaign need to be strengthened," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/revive-covid-curbs-activate-war-rooms-centre-to-states/articleshow/88420540.cms||Sushmi Dey

Increasing the buoyancy of tax revenue through improved compliance, mobilisation of resources through monetisation of assets, improving efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditure etc. are the important measures directed towards this goal, it said. According to statement on half yearly review of the trends in receipts and expenditure in relation to the budget at the end of the first half of the financial year 2021-22, gross tax revenue (GTR) at the end of September 2021 was Rs 11,83,808 crore. This was 53.4 per cent of BE 2021-22 of Rs 22,17,059 crore and reflects an increase of Rs 4,62,912 crore (64.21 per cent) over GTR for Rs 7,20,896 crore in the corresponding period of previous year. The budget has projected fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for the current fiscal ending in March 2022. Fiscal deficit has been estimated at Rs 15,06,812 crore which is 6.8 per cent of projected GDP (Rs 2,22,87,379 crore). The fiscal deficit of Rs 5,26,851 crore in H1, 2021-22 was about 35 per cent of BE, it said. Lower fiscal deficit during H1 implies that the economy is, slowly but surely, getting back on the rails, it said. Observing that the budget 2021-22 was presented in the backdrop of unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, it said, there has been a definite uptick in tax collections and government's revenues till September of the current financial year even as India emerges from the deleterious impact of two waves of Covid-19 pandemic. "Increased tax collections also implies that the country's economy is, slowly but surely, getting back on the rails," it said. Buoyancy in revenue receipts, particularly under tax receipts, in H1 of the current financial year helped achieve all three mid-year benchmarks (fiscal deficit, revenue deficit and total non-debt receipts) prescribed under the FRBM Rules, it said. Better fiscal results are expected with the increased momentum of the economic recovery in the second half the current financial year, it said. With regard to forex reserve, it said, it has increased to $638.6 billion as on September 24, 2021 from a level of $577.0 billion at end-March 2021. The average exchange rate was Rs 73.93 per dollar during April-September of 2021-22 as compared to Rs 75.13 per dollar in the corresponding period of previous year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cash-support-to-covid-hit-economy-with-fiscal-consolidation-in-focus-finance-ministry-report/articleshow/88420667.cms||---

The fine has been “imposed and collected” from missile-maker MBDA, which is the weapons package supplier for the Rafale jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation, in the mega contract inked by India in September 2016, top defence sources said on Tuesday. India, apart from the inter-governmental agreement with France and supply protocols for the fighters and weapons, had also inked a major offsets contract with Dassault and a smaller one with its partner MBDA. Under the deal, 50% of the contract value (around Rs 30,000 crore) has to be ploughed back to India as offsets or re-investments. The offsets in the Rafale deal are spread over seven years from the date of signing the contract, with no discharge in the first three years. “The fine has been imposed on MBDA after it slipped in discharging its offsets obligations for the first applicable year from September 2019-September 2020,” a source said. A CAG report, incidentally, had criticised the fact that the maximum discharge of offsets in the Rafale deal — 57% by MBDA and 58% by Dassault — is slated only for the seventh year (2023). With 5% of the shortfall in the discharge of offsets in a particular year being collected as penalty, the fine imposed on MBDA is reportedly less than Euro 1 million. “With the shortfall being carried over to the second year, the case will be examined again,” the source added.

India fines European firm for offsets delay in Rafale dealIndia has imposed a penalty on a European missile maker for the delay in fulfilling offsets commitments as part of the Rafale jets deal, Times of India reports. The 2016 deal to purchase 36 Rafale jets from Dassault Aviation in "flyaway" condition, worth 7.8 billion euros, has conditions mandatingThough MBDA has paid the penalty, it has also lodged a protest with the defence ministry (MoD). MBDA, on being contacted, refused to comment on the matter. The Rafale deal has also led to a major political dogfight between the Modi government and the Congress. As was first reported by TOI in August, the MoD is cracking the whip on foreign armament majors for failure to fulfil their offsets obligations, which saw around a dozen American, French, Russian and Israeli firms being put on a watch-list. Since then, four to five of those companies, including MBDA, have paid the penalties to get out of the watch-list. MoD has issued a warning to defaulting companies that their existing performance bank guarantees could be forfeited or deductions made from scheduled payments to them. India, of course, also needs to further fine-tune its offsets policy, with foreign companies often complaining about finding it difficult to discharge their commitments.

The MoD has inked 56 offset contracts till now, with over $13 billion to be discharged from 2008 to 2027. But, as per the latest parliamentary report, only $3.7 billion has been discharged by the vendors till April 2021, of which $2.16 billion has been accepted in audit and the balance claims are under “clarification or examination”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-imposes-penalty-for-offsets-delay-in-rafale-fighter-deal/articleshow/88420692.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||Business||Finance minister moves supplementary demands in Rajya Sabha; seeks approval for Rs 3.73 lakh crore extra spending||NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday moved the second batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for consideration in the Rajya Sabha that authorises the government to spend an additional Rs 3.73 lakh crore during the current fiscal. The Lok Sabha has already approved the demand and the Appropriation (No.5) Bill, 2021 on Monday. The Upper House is likely to clear the Bill on Wednesday. The budget 2021-22 had projected the government's total expenditure at Rs 34.83 lakh crore. But this is expected to overshoot considering the two batches of Supplementary Demands for Grants presented by the government so far. The extra spending includes infusion of over Rs 62,000 crore into the company that holds residual assets and liabilities of Air India; Rs 58,430 crore by way of additional fertiliser subsidy; Rs 53,123 crore towards payment of pending export incentives; and Rs 22,039 crore to the rural development ministry for transfer to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Fund. Besides, the Department of Food and Public Distribution would be given an additional Rs 49,805 crore for meeting expenditure towards various schemes of food storage and warehousing. About Rs 2,400 crore would be given to the Department of Commerce for meeting expenditure towards subsidies under the 'Interest Equalisation Scheme', and investment under the Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) scheme, among others. Over Rs 5,000 crore and more than Rs 4,000 crore have been earmarked for additional spending by the ministries of defence and home, respectively. Participating in the discussion on the Appropriation (No.5) Bill, 2021, Sushil Kumar Modi (BJP) stated that not just India, every major economy like the US, UK, Russia and EU are impacted by inflation in the post-pademic period. Stating that the situation in India has been much better as compared to other regions, Modi said,"If inflation goes up across the globe we cannot remain aloof...we are part of the global supply chain." He also noted that in order to reduce the prices of petroleum products, various BJP-ruled states have reduced VAT after the Centre's excise reduction, but states like Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jharkhand were yet to take similar steps. He also attacked the previous government for the current situation of Air India and noted that the Modi government is doing all it can to bring the company back on its feet. Various parties including AIADMK, TDP, and YSRCP supported the bill while major opposition parties including Congress and TMC walked out from the House demanding division of votes as they had moved a motion to send the electoral reform bill to a Select Committee of Rajya Sabha. Arun Singh (BJP) said the government had initiated timely measures to provide immediate relief to the poor amid disruptions caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. From free ration to strengthening of healthcare infrastructure, a number of initiatives have been taken by the Narendra Modi government for the benefit of common man, which won the people's trust, he said. "Today the world is looking at India. India is seen as an attractive destination for investments. Record FDI inflow is coming to India...because Modi government is transparent, and takes decisions transparently," Singh said. Syed Zafar Islam (BJP) said extraordinary times require extraordinary decisions, and noted that during the pandemic, the government has taken extraordinary measures to help the poor. From providing ration to marginalised sections of the society, to initiatives for improvement of infrastructure and modernisation of Indian Railways, as also policy measures to promote small and large businesses -- the success of the government's decisions have had a visible, positive impact on the Indian economy, he said. All key parameters and benchmarks are highlighting that Indian economy is swiftly back on track, Islam added. Taking part in the discussion, Vinay P Sahasrabuddhe (BJP) condemned the behaviour of the Opposition members in the House during the session. He highlighted various achievements of the government, including reduction in home loan rates, mobile data prices, cost of medical devices like stents and improvement in India's ranking in the ease of doing business index. Shiv Pratap Shukla (BJP) also condemned the throwing of rule book by Derek O'Brien (TMC) and accused the Opposition member of crossing the limit. Besides, he highlighted the steps taken by the government for women empowerment and support provided to the poor during the pandemic such as distribution of free ration but lamented that in Opposition-ruled states like West Bengal the matter was politicised instead of making the poor benefit from the Centre's steps. While praising the government for organising Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, Sonal Mansingh (BJP) asked Sitharaman to allocate funds from the special provision for the initiative "to be able to undertake great programmes of international quality" and also sought better co-ordination between ministries in organising the event. She also drew attention to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on artists, specially the young ones, who have no other alternative mode of sustenance.

Unit-6 is the last of the six reactors of 1,000MW capacity each being built by PSU Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) in collaboration with Russia. “In June this year, the first concrete was laid at the power unit No. 5, and on December 20, the first concreting was launched at the power unit No. 6. The third stage of the Kudankulam NPP relating to the main construction period will provide additional power capacity to ensure industrial and commercial development of businesses in the Tamil Nadu region and India as a whole,” Andrey Lebedev, ASE JSC (Rosatom'S engineering division) vice-president for projects in India and prospective projects, said. Moreover, it will also “promote more confidence in our friendly countries’ prospects to expand peaceful nuclear cooperation by using the most advanced projects of high-capacity nuclear power units of the Russian design”, Lebedev said. The equipment required for the top-priority installation at units 5 & 6 is being supplied now and the construction process is being supported by working documentation. Currently, power units No. 1 and 2 are operating at the capacity established by the operation schedule. Power units 3 & 4 and 5 & 6 are being constructed under AES-92 design with VVER-1000 (V-412) reactor type, and new power units comply with the most up-to-date safety requirements of IAEA, Rosatom said. Union atomic energy minister Jitendra Singh had recently informed Parliament that units 3 & 4 has achieved a physical progress of 54.9% as of November and are expected to be completed by March 2023 and November 2023, respectively. After the general framework agreement for power units 3 & 4 construction was signed on April 10, 2014, negotiations were started with India on the construction of units 5 and 6, following which an agreement was reached for these units to be built in the same design as the units of the second stage. On June 1, 2017, the credit protocol to the intergovernmental agreement of December 5, 2008 and the general framework agreement for units 5 & 6 were signed as a single batch of documents. The present installed nuclear power capacity in India is 6,780MW and the share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation is 3.1% in 2020-21, as per government records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-starts-building-last-unit-of-kudankulam-n-plant-with-russian-help/articleshow/88420804.cms||Surendra Singh

In the Union Budget for financial year 2021-22, the government had announced its intent to take up privatisation of two PSBs in the year and approval of a policy of strategic disinvestment of public sector enterprises, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. She was responding to a question on privatisation of two PSBs. The objectives of the policy include enablement of growth of public sector enterprises through infusion of private capital, technology and best practices, the minister said. "Consideration of various issues related to disinvestment is entrusted to the Cabinet Committee designated for this purpose/ Cabinet. Decision by the Cabinet Committee/Cabinet has not been taken in this regard," Sitharaman said further.

---||India||CAG report flags govt’s land owning agency taking 23 years to reject application for conversion, 13 years for mutation||NEW DELHI: A recent audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has flagged how the Land and Development Office (L&DO) took more than 23 years to reject an application for conversion of government land on lease and over 13 years to reject a substitution and a mutation case. According to the report on “Administration of Nazul land”, which was presented in both Houses of parliament on Tuesday, the pace of disposal of applications by the L&DO under housing and urban affairs ministry has slipped badly in the past 10-12 years even after introduction of technology. While the federal auditor had found in 2009-10 that 51% lease applications took more than the stipulated 90 days for disposal, the recent audit shows that 71% of total applications were disposed of after this set timeline, which has been provided in the Citizen’s Charter. It said nearly 9% of the applications were disposed of after a lapse of 1,500 days. Highlighting how the government’s land owning entity not just took years to dispose off applications, the federal auditor found that 1,199 applications for conversion, substitution and mutation were rejected after taking more than 1,500 days. “Maximum time taken in rejecting a particular application for conversion, substitution and mutation was more than 23 years, 13 years and 13 years respectively. The maximum time taken in approving a particular application for conversion, substitution and mutation was more than 18 years, 14 years and 12 years respectively,” the report said. The audit report mentions that the L&DO informed the CAG that the 90 days time given in the citizens’ charter is indicative in nature and it strives to timely process the cases relating to substitution, mutation and conversion of properties. However, the federal auditor did not accept the submission. The Citizens’ Charter of L&DO stipulates it would ensure good quality of service by disposal of applications on conversion, sale permission, mutation, and substitution within three months from the date of receipt of information and documents from the lessee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-report-flags-govts-land-owning-agency-taking-23-years-to-reject-application-for-conversion-13-years-for-mutation/articleshow/88420815.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||Biden calls on Americans to vaccinate to fight Omicron as Europe braces for 'storm'||LONDON/WASHINGTON: Countries across Europe considered new curbs on movement on Tuesday while US President Joe Biden appealed to all Americans to get vaccinated to fight the Omicron variant sweeping the world days before the second Christmas of the pandemic.  Omicron infections are multiplying across Europe, the United States and Asia, including in Japan, where a single cluster of Covid-19 cases at a military base has grown to at least 180.  "If you're not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned," Biden said at the White House, where he unveiled plans to buy 500 million rapid Covid-19 tests to be distributed for free to Americans who request them starting in January.  Striking a dire tone about the risks to the one in four American adults still unvaccinated, he said: "Your choice can be the difference between life and death."  Biden also activated some 1,000 military medical personnel to support hospitals already being overwhelmed.  Omicron now accounts for 73% of all new cases in the United States, up from less than 1% at the beginning of the month.  Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization's European head, told a news conference in Vienna that within weeks Omicron would dominate in more countries of the region, "pushing already stretched health systems further to the brink."  "We can see another storm coming," Kluge said.  Germany, Scotland, Ireland, the Netherlands and South Korea are among countries to have reimposed partial or full lockdowns or other social distancing measures in recent days.  Portugal ordered nightclubs and bars to close and told people to work from home for at least two weeks from Saturday.  Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of Scotland - part of the United Kingdom but with devolved responsibilities for health - set out plans for further restrictions on big public events, including sports fixtures, for three weeks after Christmas.  "It will also mean unfortunately that large scale Hogmanay celebrations, including that planned here in our capital city (Edinburgh), will not proceed," she said, referring to traditional Scottish New Year parties.  New Zealand Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said his country, which imposed some of the world's toughest Covid-19 measures, was delaying the start of a staggered reopening of its border until the end of February.  "All of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible Covid-19 variant yet," he said.  Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany will introduce new steps including limiting private gatherings for vaccinated people to a maximum of 10 before New Year's Eve. Scholz agreed with the premiers of the 16 federal states that big events, including football matches, would be without spectators.  British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not introduce new Covid-19 curbs in England before Christmas, but the situation remained extremely difficult and the government might need to act afterwards.  Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of extra support for businesses hit hardest by Omicron, which is hammering the hospitality sector and other businesses.  Omicron's rapid spread means many Britons are changing Christmas plans last-minute, despite a lack of formal curbs.  Twenty-four-year-old medical student Rebecca Gilmore, who lost her younger brother to suicide earlier in the year, said being apart from her family was especially hard this year but self-isolating with her partner was the right thing to do.  "It means I'm protecting the most vulnerable people," she said.  Sweden will urge all employees to work from home if possible and impose tighter rules for social distancing.  "I understand that many are tired of this - so am I - but we now have a new virus variant, which means we are in a new situation," said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson.  Omicron has hit financial markets hard in recent days over fears for the global economic recovery, but world shares gained on Tuesday, with the dollar softening as appetite for riskier assets made a cautious return.  Wall Street's main indexes rose, following a steep selloff in the previous session.  The variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong and has been reported in at least 89 countries.  The severity of illness it causes remains unclear, but the WHO warned it is spreading faster than the Delta variant and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from the Covid-19 disease.  Israel recorded its first known death from the Omicron variant, according to Israeli news media which reported that an elderly man died in Beersheba on Monday.  More than 274 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally since the pandemic began nearly two years ago. More than 5.65 million people have died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-calls-on-americans-to-vaccinate-to-fight-omicron-as-europe-braces-for-storm/articleshow/88420856.cms||---

Also, more than six lakh online cybercrime complaints were received via the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal set up by the home ministry, leading to the registration of 12,776 FIRs, home minister Amit Shah told the consultative committee meeting here on Monday. Addressing a meeting of the consultative panel held to discuss ‘Cyber Crime: Threats, Challenges and Response’, Shah said the work of setting up infrastructure to deal with cybercrimes has been going on for the past seven years and was now complete right down to the police post. With the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) having networked 16,347 police stations in the country, 99% of police stations were registering 100% FIRs directly through CCTNS. He added that the work of making analytical tools against cybercrimes is also 40% complete and efforts are being made to train police and lawyers on preventing cybercrimes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/266-apps-blocked-since-jan-2020-over-threat-to-e-security/articleshow/88420861.cms||---

Muslims constitute nearly 96% of Lakshadweep population as per the 2011 Census and Friday has been a holiday in schools there for decades. An order issued by the education department of the UT administration, dated December 17, said the school timings and regular activities are “suggested” to be modified to “ensure optimum utilisation of resources and proper engagement of learners and necessary planning of teaching-learning process”. It also includes a detailed subject-wise allotment of classes for both English-medium and Malayalam-medium schools for the 2021-22 academic year, which says all Fridays will be working days. Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal PP said Friday has been a holiday for schools since they were launched six decades ago. “The decision was taken without any discussion with the district panchayat, elected representatives or PTAs. It is a unilateral and unpopular decision; the people of Lakshadweep will not accept it,” he said. Faizal said the new timings would also clash with the madrassa system in the islands on Friday mornings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lakshadweep-sees-protests-as-friday-school-offs-changed/articleshow/88420897.cms||---

Sodhi, a sitting MLA and Punjab Congress vice president who is considered close to former Punjab CM Amarinder Singh, announced his resignation on Twitter and posted his letter to party president Sonia Gandhi on the microblogging platform. “I cannot accept Punjab’s suffocation and helplessness! Congress party has put state’s security & communal harmony at stake. With deep agony, I put forth my resignation from all posts and primary membership of Congress with immediate effect,” he said. BJP has announced a tie-up with Amarinder Singh’s party, Punjab Lok Congress. Noting that he had been in Congress for over four decades, Sodhi expressed his frustration at the state of affairs in the party, especially in Punjab, alleging that its senior leadership is “hell bent on destroying the border state for their personal gains”. “I was in the Congress for 40 years, starting from the Youth Congress. The party was known for secularism, but not any longer as they are playing divisive politics for votes,” Sodhi, a former international trap shooter, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-mla-sodhi-close-to-amarinder-quits-congress-for-bjp/articleshow/88421231.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka caste boards violate secularism? HC to decide||BENGALURU: Rejecting the preliminary objection raised by the Karnataka government on the maintainability of petitions challenging the setting up of caste-based boards and corporations, the high court on Tuesday posted the matter to February 2 for settling some key questions of the law. The questions before the HC are: Whether setting up caste-based corporations and spending huge public money violates the concept of secularism as envisaged in the Constitution; whether the state has legal sanction under the Constitution to create such corporations and spend public money for the development of a few castes violate Article 27. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said they need to study these questions because of the contentions raised by petitioners. "We reject the preliminary objections at this stage," it said. Advocate general Prabhuling K Navadgi questioned the premise of the petitioners of choosing to implead only a few corporations set up for Lingayat-Veerashaiva, Maratha, Brahmin and Aryavysya community members. The second objection was that these corporations are only agencies implementing budgetary allocations and unless the Karnataka Appropriation Act is called into question, there cannot be a separate challenge to the creation of these corporations. In addition, the AG raised the issue of delay in filing the petitions and questioned the bona fide of the petitioners. Citing the Supreme Court judgment in the Bhim Singh vs Union of India case, the AG argued that question of allocation of budget and the withdrawal of funds from consolidated funds on the basis of Appropriation Act cannot be questioned and it is in the domain of the government. He claimed that these corporations are for the development of backward classes for which the Constitution envisages reservation. On the other hand, senior advocate Ravivarma Kumar, appearing for the petitioners, said creation of caste-based corporations is arbitrary and discriminatory. According to him, when the state has notified more than 500 backward classes, 101 SC castes and 50 ST castes, creating corporations only for a few goes on to show discrimination and violates Article 14 of the Constitution. Citing the Supreme Court's order in the case of Indian Young Lawyers Association, Kumar argued that the top court had held that the caste community and social status do not bring into being a religious denomination. He clarified that petitioners have not challenged the Karnataka Appropriation Act as it does not allocate any fund for these corporations and added that they are ready to implead all the corporations created on the caste basis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/state-caste-boards-violate-secularism-hc-to-decide/articleshow/88421224.cms||Vasantha Kumar
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Flyer held with gold rods worth 45.8 lakh hidden in juicer||BENGALURU: A passenger was nabbed at Kempegowda International Airport with two gold rods worth over Rs 45.8 lakh hidden inside a manual juicer machine, which he brought with him from Sharjah, UAE, early Tuesday. Customs sleuths arrested him and seized the gold rods weighing 930 grams. According to sources with the Air Intelligence Unit (AIU) of Bengaluru Customs, the smuggling attempt unfolded at 2.50am after Air Arabia flight G9 496 from Sharjah touched down in Bengaluru. Following passenger profiling, the Customs team intercepted a 33-year-old man, who disembarked from the flight. He was from Uttar Pradesh. Upon questioning, it wasn’t clear why he chose to land in Bengaluru instead of airports in his home-state. The man was found to be carrying a blue-coloured compact manual juicer, which he had brought from the UAE. Suspicious, Customs sleuths dismantled the juicer to find two gold rods, one small and one big, hidden inside the machine’s silver pipes. According to sources, the smuggled gold is worth Rs 45,81,180. The suspect was arrested and booked for gold smuggling and Customs duty evasion. Further probe is on to establish if he was acting alone or as part of a global smuggling syndicate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/flyer-held-with-gold-rods-worth-45-8l-hidden-in-juicer/articleshow/88421234.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Drunk youths target bar, torch adjacent shop||BENGALURU: Two youths, who wanted to avenge the staff of a bar in south Bengaluru after a brawl, ended up setting on fire an adjacent condiment store as they were too drunk to recognise their target. KS Layout police on Monday arrested Mounesh Karihole, 27, of Nagarbhavi and Mounesh Sannagoudar, 26, of Yelachenahalli, both from Raichur, for the December 16 arson in Konanakunte. Karihole, a cab driver and Sannagoudar, a construction worker, had damaged the washroom of the bar on the night December 14 in an inebriated condition, leading to a clash between them and the staff. Revanna Siddappa H, owner of Parameshwara Condiments, near Kubera Bar in Konanakunte filed a complaint against unknown miscreants. According to him, at 1.30am on December 16, two unidentified persons poured petrol on the door of his shop and set it on fire. A supplier of the bar saw the fire and immediately rushed to the spot and poured water. Though there was no major damage to valuables, Siddappa wanted to know who had set the fire. KS Layout police swung into action and learnt about the brawl at the bar. The duo had broken the toilet washbasin and paid a fine for that. Probe revealed that the arson was the handiwork of the duo. “They wanted to take revenge on the bar staff, so they went to torch the bar after getting fully drunk. Instead of the bar, they wrongly set fire to the shop located next to that and fled,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/drunk-youths-target-bar-torch-adjacent-shop/articleshow/88421235.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Retd IAF officer’s wife buries bullets ‘bringing misfortune’||BENGALURU: The wife of a retired IAF group captain sent police into a tizzy by burying two live bullets outside a hotel in the belief that they were bringing misfortune upon her family. Trouble began on Saturday afternoon when the housekeeping staff of the private hotel, opposite Jakkur aerodrome on Ballari Road, discovered a live bullet near the parking lot while cleaning the muddy surface. Immediately, the hotel staff filed a complaint with Yelahanka police. An FIR was registered against unidentified persons under the Arms Act. Deputy commissioner of police (northeast) CK Baba said as the live bullet was recovered opposite the aerodrome, police decided to check all the hotels in the jurisdiction as well as other hotels in and around Kempegowda International Airport. “First, we ensured it was not a security threat,” he said. Staff from the armoury and forensic sciences laboratory too joined the investigation. Preliminary findings showed that the bullet belonged to a single-barrel rifle and was of Belgium make, usually used in wildlife hunting. “On day two of probe, an anti-sabotage team arrived at the hotel and scoured the area for more than five hours. We recovered a second bullet, also buried in the parking lot, about 10ft from the first one. CCTV footage showed a woman burying something near the lot on Friday night. Tracking her with the help of her car, we reached a house in Yelahanka but the woman had shifted elsewhere. We finally traced her to a new house in Kodigehalli. She confessed to having buried the bullets thinking they were the reason behind her family problems,” Baba said. According to the woman’s confession, her husband had bought 15 rounds of live bullets for the rifle he had purchased from the central ordnance depot, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, when he was in service. “Last year, the retired captain sold the rifle to someone else. However, he could not find the bullets at the time. Later, when he found the live bullets, he decided to showcase them. Meanwhile, his son, a private firm employee, had problems in his personal life. Announcing that the bullets had brought ill fortune to the family, the mother decided to dispose them of on her own,” an investigating officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/retd-iaf-officers-wife-buries-bullets-bringing-misfortune/articleshow/88421236.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

While experts say the Covid antibody levels analysed through such a survey — after the second wave — would help the state in pandemic management, the government has not acted on the suggestion even after six months. Some of the metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai have completed five rounds of sero survey so far. TAC members TOI spoke with said: “It’s high time the state conducted the third round. Now, we need to analyse the prevalence of IgG antibodies among vaccinated individuals and children. This will be unique compared to the previous surveys. It has been delayed by more than six months.” Health department authorities said the government was in the process of procuring antibody kits for the same. “We would be using more than 40,000 antibody testing kits. Permission for direct purchase of kits at base price has been sought,” health commissioner Randeep D said. Officials said as per the plan, all 30 districts and eight zones of the BBMP are to be considered as individual units. A total of 1,050 people in each of 38 units will be covered under the sero survey. The government has zeroed in on three categories. In the low-risk category, pregnant women who come to antenatal check to clinics are to be covered along with children in the age group of 6-11 and 12-18. In the moderate category, the state aims to cover persons with high contact in the community such as vendors in markets, autorickshaw and bus drivers, healthcare workers, waste handlers, those working in markets, malls, retail stores, hotel staff, and workers near bus stops and railway stations. The high-risk category includes elderly persons and those with comorbidities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/3rd-round-of-sero-survey-delayed-by-six-months-kits-being-procured-now/articleshow/88421241.cms||---

As on December 21 morning, the state government had a total stock of 66.5 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines, of which nearly 19 lakh doses were Covaxin. Private hospitals have stocked up another 5.5 lakh doses of Covaxin. A majority of these doses are in Bengaluru’s private hospitals. Each Covaxin dose in the private sector costs Rs 1,410. Dr Arundhathi Chandrasekhar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, said the state government will continue to follow the current guidelines and there won’t be any changes. “As of now, we are sticking to the current guidelines,” she said. Covaxin vials of 10 and 20 doses are in the state government’s stock. The new open vial policy has elicited a mixed response from private hospitals. “The vaccinators have followed the written instructions provided with the product,” said a member of the Private Hospital and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA).Dr Yateesh Govindaiah, unit head, Jayanagar Apollo Hospitals, said the hospital will continue with the existing usage policy. “There are various factors to be considered. So far, we would open a vial only when there are sufficient persons to take it so as to ensure there is no wastage. This led to some people being asked to wait or come the next day. Public also understood the same. Now, if we can put the vial back in the refrigerator, there will be a risk of its contamination and needs to be safely guarded,” he explained.The hospital’s internal committee will take a call about following the open vial policy only after due deliberations, he added.According to Dr HM Prasanna, PHANA president, the new announcement by the Covaxin manufacturer has to be taken with a pinch of salt. “This is opposite to what was told to us so far in the training. But if the manufacturer has backed its announcement based on its research and development, we must go by it. It would be easier for the private hospitals to use the doses without wastage and the public can be given the vaccine as and when they come,” said Dr Prasanna. Wastage of Covaxin doses was high compared to that of Covishield as the former was available only in 20-dose vials earlier. A majority of the vaccine wastage was linked to Covaxin across the country owing to its 20-dose vials.Waiting for guidelines“We will have to wait for the government of India guidelines as the states have got supplies through the central government. Till such time whatever comes from the manufacturer will not be binding on the user. This is a rare situation. The drugs have to be used based on what has been approved by the DCGI, based on government notification. Now, nothing has been changed on the label attached to the drug distributed at present,” said an expert from the field, adding that only a government notification on this can resolve the issue. Prior to this, in the first week of November, Bharat Biotech had extended the shelf life of Covaxin doses to 12 months from the date of manufacturing. The vials that had an expiry date between September 2021 and June 2022 will now expire between March 2022 and September 2022. The communication also had mentioned that the shelf life extension had been approved by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, a wing of the Drugs Controller General of India.Dr MK Sudarshan, chairperson, Covid technical advisory committee, said the government of India guidelines are required to comply with the new announcement by the manufacturer. The company’s move has raised concerns among experts in the pharma sector. “It is surprising that the company has come up with an announcement despite WHO not yet approving the open vial policy for Covaxin. However, the claims exist in the product insert since it was revised in August. Currently, the WHO guidelines mention use from the time of opening for a maximum of six hours. It is shocking that the 28-day recommendation has been put without providing any regulatory clearances for the same,” said Malini Aisola, co-convenor, All India Drug Action Forum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/covaxin-open-vial-policy-state-govt-and-private-hospitals-to-stick-to-6-hour-usage/articleshow/88421242.cms||Sunitha Rao R

---||Bengaluru||200 scene of crime officers to strengthen evidence gathering||Bengaluru: A new cadre is being created in Karnataka police to steer criminal investigations in the right direction and ensure speedy justice. Over 200 Scene Of Crime Officers (SOCOs) will be joining the Forensic Sciences Laboratory of Karnataka police in January 2022.SOCOs will be experts guiding police in handling evidence at the scene of crime. They will identify, collect, handle and most importantly preserve evidence from the spot. Attached with the Forensic Science Laboratory, these experts will be scientific officers and specially trained to handle sensitive evidence like DNA. The move to appoint SOCOs comes in the backdrop of setbacks faced by police in evidence gathering. Last year, hair follicle samples of several accused, including two Sandalwood actresses, in a high-profile drug-peddling case had been sent to the Hyderabad forensic laboratory to test for consumption of narcotics. The Hyderabad laboratory sent back the samples, taking exception to their unprofessional packing in an evening newspaper.R Hitendra, additional director general of police (ADGP), crime and technical services, said: “As of now, 206 SOCOs will be appointed after January 2022 and they will join Karnataka state police force after completing the training. Karnataka will be the first state in the country to assign SOCOs. With their inclusion, chances of errors in collecting and handling evidence from the crime scene will become less.” According to Hitendra, three to four SOCOs will be sent to districts and two to three will be deployed in each commissionerate. The number will increase in the future, he added. “We have 13 different divisions in FSL. Of them, Questioned Documents, DNA and Computer Forensics are being strengthened by filling them up with 150 other posts of scientific officers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/200-scene-of-crime-officers-to-strengthen-evidence-gathering/articleshow/88421244.cms||Rajiv Kalkod

Sources said a SpiceJet flight from Hyderabad to Bengaluru was diverted to Chennai for safe landing. An Air India flight from Abu Dhabi to Bengaluru via Kannur was also diverted to Chennai, making it the lone international flight diverted on the day. This apart, 39 departures were delayed between 6am and 8am as vision was blurred even for 100m. However, normalcy returned towards noon. With the weather conditions expected to remain the same or turn worse in the coming days, KIA is bracing for more delayed departures/arrivals and possible cancellations, sources said. Bengaluru airport is compliant with CAT IIIB (Category 3 Instrument Landing Systems) condition, which reduces fog-induced delays as the runway instruments can facilitate aircraft landing at a visual range of as low as 50m and takeoff at 125m. The new automated technology had substantially reduced weather delays earlier this year. On January 21, the first flight landed under CAT IIIB conditions at 7.41am, marking the start of what airport sources described as cutting-egde technology to make flying a seamless experience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/morning-fog-causes-flight-delays-diversions-at-kia/articleshow/88421245.cms||---

However, he ended up injuring a friend who tried to save him. Salman KS, 25, son of former BBMP corporator KS Sameeulla, was arrested, while his friend Fizal Ahmad, 22, an AC mechanic, sustained bullet injuries to his right hand. Police said the incident took place around 9.30 pm, when Salman and Ahmad came to the former’s BTM Layout I Stage residence. Salman’s elder brother Suna Miandad Salman, a realtor, scolded him for returning home late. Upset, Salman took Miandad’s licensed pistol that was kept in the living room and pointed it at his own head. Miandad and Ahmad tried to stop him from pulling the trigger, but Salman opened three rounds of fire and one of the bullets hit Ahmad’s hand. Ahmad was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Suddagunte Palya police have taken up a case of attempt to commit culpable homicide.

The bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, proposes to raise the legal age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 years, on a par with men.In a press release, KCRO called the Centre’s decision to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA) and designate as child any ‘person below 21 years’, a knee-jerk reaction. KCRO said instead of this, the government could introduce bills to amend RTE Act, 2009 to define a child as a person up to 21 years and guarantee free and compulsory education along with vocational education, hostel facility and related services. It urged parliamentarians across party lines to look at the ground realities and take a stand against the proposed bill. “The bill would allow boys and girls to get into the labour market, as they are not guaranteed education up to age of 21,” Vasudeva Sharma, state convenor, KCRO said.There are loopholes in the proposal to increase the punishment for child marriages as part of the amendment, Sharma added. The organisation said the bill will cause extra stress to police, department of women and child development, child protection units and courts. They fear it will also endanger young girls aged below 21, who may have to endure unwanted pregnancies or resort to abortions. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/child-rights-groups-oppose-marriage-bill-feel-it-may-endanger-girls-below-21/articleshow/88421247.cms||---

The commission took suo motu cognizance of a news report in a Tamil daily on November 27, 2011, about a petition by K Lakshmi of T Mandapam village near Thirukovilur to the Villupuram ADSP (Additional superintendent of police). According to her petition, her husband Kasi along with seven other members of her family were picked up by the police late in the night. She further alleged that she along with three other women were gangraped by the cops. The commission directed the investigative wing of the SHRC to conduct an inquiry into the allegations and submit a report.According to the commission report, the Government Medical College doctors in Villupuram and the Director of Institute of Forensic Medicine at Madras Medical College, who examined the women, opined that there were no signs of forceful sexual assault on them. The report stated that though the police had not humiliated the women as alleged, it was illegal on their part to have detained them at night. The police personnel have denied all the allegations and contended that they had been falsely implicated in the case to gain monetary benefits from the government by invoking the provisions of the SC/ST Act.The commission held that there was no sexual assault by the police as claimed in the complaint but noted that there was clear human rights violation as women who were picked up in the absence of female police personnel. Apart from the compensation, the commission also sought the final report on the departmental action against the police personnel within three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-excesses-pay-75l-to-irula-family-shrc-tells-govt/articleshow/88421256.cms||---

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Doctors urge ICMR to check testing kits||CHENNAI: Days after the US-FDA warned that some testing kits in their country were throwing “false” negatives, particularly among those carrying the omicron variant, infectious diseases experts here have asked the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to review all testing kits, including indigenously manufactured products for its accuracy. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has mutated over time, resulting in genetic variations. “We don’t know much about the new variant Omicron, except that it spreads rapidly, increases hospitalisations and deaths. Now, we are learning that tests including gold standard ones are affected by viral mutations,” said infectious disease expert Dr Subramanian Swaminathan of Gleneagles Global Hospitals. “The ICMR should check all the testing kits and permit only the ones that are accurate. With false negatives, isolation norms will be relaxed, and risk of transmission will increase,” he said. The new variant is already straining the testing capacity of several countries. With people queuing up for pre-travel tests, the spike in Covid-19 cases in several European countries has increased the number of daily tests. States like Tamil Nadu haven’t allowed home tests or antigen tests too. The strain here will be much more when cases increase. The state conducts around one lakh RTPCR tests a day across 317 labs.  “Molecular tests that use multiple genetic targets to determine a result are less likely to be impacted by increased prevalence of genetic variants,” said virologist Dr T Jacob John. “The ICMR and The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium should check kits, antigen, PCR and home tests used across India. Until then clinicians should consider results in combination with clinical observations, patient history, and epidemiological information,” he said. The state public health laboratory says it uses the TrueNat system, which is now a comprehensive assay for screening and confirmation of COVID-19 cases. The RT-PCR tests are conducted in whole for all the genes - N’, ‘S’, ‘E’ and ‘ORF'. The S gene is absent in Omicron. "Since S-gene is not detected during the test, it is called S-gene dropout,” said state DPH laboratory head Dr S Raju. S-dropout is considered as a proxy indicator for the new variant. “And it also shows that the tests are effective,” he said. Nevertheless, public health officials admit not all labs in the state use the same kind of kits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/docs-urge-icmr-to-check-testing-kits/articleshow/88421261.cms||Pushpa Narayan

The ratio for written examination and interview has been revised to 95:5 from the previous 85:15 to cap the maximum marks that can be awarded.The Computer Based Test (CBT), an end-to-end online exam, will be held to recruit 30 posts of assistant planner and planning assistant grade I. A vendor identified by the TNeGA, which functions under the state government, will hold the exam across the state. CMDA sources said this is to ensure there is no human intervention from the planning authority in the entire process. This is for the first time the CBT is introduced in CMDA for recruiting employees. The maximum marks that can be awarded by the interview panel has been reduced to just five to cripple the influence of the panel members during the selection process, sources added. The move follows a controversy after written examinations and personal interview for five posts including Junior Assistant, Typist Fieldman and Messenger in February when 18 newly recruited employees were found unqualified during a probe in September. Following this, two CMDA officials were charged-sheeted for irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cmda-to-hold-online-recruitment-of-planners/articleshow/88421265.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Speed detecting cameras remain on paper||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu Transport Department has once again cancelled the tenders floated to install vehicle speed monitoring cameras along the Chengalpattu-Trichy national highway. The state government in February 2018, had announced that speed violation detection systems (SVDS) will be installed along NH-45, in between the two TN cities, at an estimated cost of 45 crore. The 270-kilometre-long stretch reports around 100 road accidents every year and the majority were attributed to over-speeding, according to official data. The project was supposed to launch last May, but the bids for the same were cancelled in June due to 'administrative reasons' and the pandemic. Now that the Covid-19 infection rate is on a decline, several road infrastructure projects have resumed. However, the SVDS project continues to remain on paper. SVDS has three major components -- speed sensors, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras and a control centre. A total of 56 speed sensors, installed at various locations on the stretch, will detect vehicles, which exceed the upper speed limit of 100 km per hour. These sensors will trigger an image capture command to the nearest ANPR camera. The control centre, with the help of a software, will extract vehicle registration number details of the speeding vehicles using images captured by ANPR cameras and generate traffic fine challans automatically. These challans will later be sent to the vehicle owner's registered mailing address. Under this project, as many as 168 cameras were supposed to be installed. S Kamal, a transportation activist, said that since ANPR installation is costly and time-consuming, the government should consider installing regulation CCTV cameras so that the police can track down violations and manually send e-challans. G Ganesh from TN Lorry Owners' Association said, "Keep aside speed monitoring systems, the government has failed to provide even basic facilities like adequate street lighting and storm water drains. This has led to frequent accidents of late." A National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) official said that they are spending 105 crore to reduce accidents along this stretch by constructing bridges, vehicular underpasses, providing additional lighting and improving road alignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/speed-detecting-cameras-remain-on-paper/articleshow/88421267.cms||Ram Sundaram
---||Chennai||Chennai: Weekend holidayers ditch costly Dubai for Colombo||CHENNAI: As Dubai continues to be expensive, people who want to experience an international holiday are heading to Sri Lanka from Chennai for the Christmas, New Year and Pongal weekends. The restrictions on revelry imposed by the state government in Chennai are also encouraging those who can afford a holiday abroad to try out Colombo. The island nation is the cheapest destination from Chennai with return airfare in the range of 20,000 to 26,000 in the current season. In comparison, a return ticket to Dubai is in the range of 40,000 to 2 lakh for holiday weekends due to the high demand from transit travellers headed to Europe and the US. Though Singapore has begun issuing tourist visas, people do not prefer to travel for leisure if they do not have a friend or a relative in that south-east Asian country. The testing for Covid-19 and requirement to stay in a hotel till results are ready is a hassle. Flights to Singapore are also full and are expensive because a large number of people who have permanent residency and those headed for work are travelling there. Southeast Asia and the Middle East have traditionally been among the most popular destinations for tourists from Chennai but these destinations are now ruled out due to restrictions and high cost. Sriharan Balan of Madura Travels said several people had started exploring Sri Lanka for this holiday season as Dubai is expensive. “The fares are affordable compared to other foreign destinations,” he said. In pre-Covid times too, people used to travel to Sri Lanka instead of domestic destinations in Jammu and Kashmir or other places in the north. “The return fare to Colombo used to be 10,000 while the fare to Srinagar was as much as 20,000,” he said. Now, J&K is less expensive, but Colombo is nearer and there are direct flights from Chennai. Basheer Ahemed of Chennai Metro Travels said the UAE was a hassle-free destination to travel but is expensive. “People are booking tickets to Colombo because its nearby and is cheaper and we are getting many enquiries for New Year weekend too,” he said. This gives some hope though airfare and hotel tariff are higher for international travel amidst the restricted number of flights, he added. “People have the option of travelling to Malaysia for the Pongal holidays as Malaysia Tourism is planning to open Langkawi in January,” said Ahmed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/weekend-holidayers-ditch-costly-dubai-for-colombo/articleshow/88421269.cms||---

A special team of the Royapuram police sifted through footage from more than 50 CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood before nabbing the accused, Padmavathi. A court later sent her to Puzhal prison. A police officer said Padmavathi, a resident of Royapuram, first met Kanagavalli at her home on PV Koil Street in New Washermenpet on December 3 when the 85-year-old was alone. Three days later, the younger woman came visiting again. Claiming that it was her wedding anniversary, Padmavathi told Kanagavalli that she had gone to a nearby Goddess Amman temple and came straight to her house (Kanagavalli’s) with the ‘payasam’ (sweet porridge) given there. The woman then offered Kanagavalli the payasam. Soon, Padmavathi watched as the older woman fell unconscious after consuming the porridge. Padmavathi then removed her gold bangles and chain, together weighing about five sovereigns and worth about 1.50 lakh, and escaped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/woman-53-who-stole-gold-worth-1-5-lakh-arrested/articleshow/88421272.cms||---

---||Chennai||Chennai: 14m-wide pedestrian subway linking central station and GH to open soon||CHENNAI: A 14-metre-wide pedestrian subway linking MGR central railway station with Rajiv Gandhi government general Hospital(RGGGH) is nearing completion. Work on repairing the old subway will also be completed in January 2022. More than 70,000 people cross the road in front of the railway station during peak hours. Passengers with luggage and senior citizens can take advantage of the escalators and elevators of the new subway. As one end of the subway will be closer to RGGGH, those visiting the hospital and taking the train or an MTC bus could also have easy access to the facilities. The old subway linking Central Railway station and the MTC bus stop near RGGGH, which is partly open, will also further help pedestrians cross the road easily when it is fully ready. “The new subway is ready without elevators. Escalators on both sides have been installed. Refurbishment of the old subway is in progress. It will be ready by the end of January 2022,” a metro rail official said. At present, except for a few who use the pedestrian subway opened in 2018 linking Park Station with Moore Market complex and the underground Central metro, an average 300 people cross the Poonamallee High Road every hour in front of Central Railway station. This is causing traffic congestion.  According to CMRL, in the pre-covid times, more than 70,000 people used to cross Poonamallee High Road around central railway station during peak hours. More than four lakh commuters take suburban, MRTS and long-distance trains from the surrounding stations. In addition, metro rail estimates that nearly 15,000 passengers will board trains at central metro by 2026, so the number of pedestrians will only rise. To take the pedestrians completely underground and ensure smooth traffic flow on Poonamallee High Road, CMRL planned four pedestrian subways on the stretch between Evening Bazaar Road and Moore Market Complex. They include a nine-metre-wide subway linking Evening Bazaar Road and RGGGH, a nine-metre-wide subway linking southern railway building with RGGGH, a 14-metre-wide subway linking central railway station with RGGGH and a nine-metre-wide subway to link Park station with Moore Market Complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/14m-wide-pedestrian-subway-linking-central-station-and-gh-to-open-soon/articleshow/88421275.cms||---

---||India||How delimitation panel worked out allocation of seats in J&K||NEW DELHI: The Delimitation Commission worked out the proposed district-wise entitlement of assembly seats in Jammu & Kashmir after taking into account not just 2011 population census but factors such as geographical features, public convenience and communication facilities, difficult terrain, hardship faced by persons living in areas adjoining international border, areas that get cut-off due to severe climatic conditions and density of population. For allocation of constituencies across the 20 districts of J&K, the delimitation panel — headed by Justice (Retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai and comprising chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and the J&K state election panel chief — divided the districts into three broad categories. ‘A’ category comprised districts with predominantly hill and difficult areas; ‘B’ category comprising districts with hill and flat areas; and ‘C’ category districts having predominantly flat areas. ‘A’ category districts include Bandipora, Kishtwar, Doda, Reasi and Kathua; ‘B’ category has Kupwara, Baramulla, Ganderbal, Kulgam, Ramban, Udhampur, Rajouri and Poonch; and ‘C’ category comprises the districts of Srinagar, Budgam, Pulwama, Shopian, Anantnag, Samba and Jammu. The population density of J&K districts, as per 2011 Census, ranges from 29 in Kishtwar and 151 in Bandipora to 3,436 in Srinagar and 846 in Anantnag. To work out a fair allocation, the average population per assembly constituency (AC) in Category B districts was taken as 1,36,304; in A category districts as 1,22, 674 which is 10% less than average population per AC in B category; and in C category districts as 1,49,934, which is 10% more than average population per AC in B category districts. Accordingly, Kupwara is proposed to be allotted 6 seats, Baramulla 7, Bandipora 3, Ganderbal 2, Srinagar 8, Budgam 5, Pulwama 4, Shopian 2, Kulgam 3, Anantnag 7, Kishtwar 3, Doda 3, Ramban 2, Reasi 3, Udhampur 4, Kathua 6, Samba 3, Jammu 11, Rajouri 5 and Poonch 3. While constituencies like Gurez and Karnah, despite having less population density and remote areas, were allocated in Kashmir region as part of 1995 delimitation exercise, the same formula was not applied to districts with similar attributes in Jammu region, like Kishtwar. The delimitation panel seeks to correct this wrong. Also, it has proposed additional seats in districts like Samba and Kathua where border residents live in difficult conditions in bunkers. As per the proposed delimitation draft shared with the associate members or the five J&K MPs on Monday, among the seven new seats to be added in J&K, six comprising one each are proposed in the districts of Kishtwar, Samba, Kathua, Doda, Rajouri and Udhampur/Reasi in Jammu division, while Kupwara gets an extra seat in the Kashmir division .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/how-delimitation-panel-worked-out-allocation-of-seats-in-jk/articleshow/88421288.cms||Bharti Jain

More than 3.4 lakh tonnes of e-waste was processed across India in 2020-21 compared to 69,414 in 2017-18. The amount of e-waste generated has been increasing over the years and India, according to the data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), it has around 468 authorised recyclers in 22 states and 2,808 collections centres/points. The cumulative capacity of the 468 recyclers is more than 13 lakh tonnes — which itself is not sufficient for processing the waste generated — while inefficiency in collecting the waste to be sent for processing or recycling adds to the woes.According to CPCB, in 2017-18, India generated around 7 lakh tonnes of e-waste compared to more than 10 lakh tonnes in 2019-20. While the CPCB doesn’t have data for 2020-21, a UN report estimates it to be around 32 lakh tonnes.One e-waste recycler, requesting anonymity said that most of the listed recyclers are not actually operational and that in 2020-21, a lot of recycling work had been halted due to Covid-19. BK Soni, CMD, Eco Recycling, says: “The concern should be pollution not the quantity of waste generated because the moment our e-waste is higher our economy gets better. Let that increase. But the things to address is how do you address the concern of unscientific processing, why is processing happening in a polluting matter, and why is the rest not even getting processed. This is a major concern. The pollution level must come down and the government should look at what measures must be taken and what the regulator is doing about this.”To reduce pollution during processing e-waste, he said, there has to be proper technology and stricter implementation of regulations must be in place. “For both of these, the government must enhance its machinery and support recyclers because even if we do 100% processing, but in a polluted manner is as good as zero per cent,” he said. Of the total e-waste collected and processed in 2020-21, Gujarat processed the most, followed by Karnataka, while Uttarakhand, Telangana and Tamil Nadu occupy the third, fourth and fifth places, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/e-waste-processing-up-by-4-times-but-90-still-remains-unprocessed/articleshow/88421335.cms||---

The raid was conducted at 30 places across the state including in Neyveli, Chennai, Coimbatore, Nilgiris and other places, where the company also runs a few educational institutions through its trusts.

---||Patna||Expect slight respite from cold wave in Patna by Thursday: Met||PATNA: Sub-10 chill continued to prevail at most places in the state for the third consecutive day on Tuesday with Gaya recording the lowest minimum temperature at 5.2 degrees C. The minimum temperature in Patna stood at 7.6 degrees C. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said average minimum temperature in the state was in the range of 8-9 degrees C and maximum in the range of 22-23 degrees C on Tuesday. As the icy north-westerly winds continue to blow in the region, Patna Meteorological Centre has issued forecast for cold wave at a few places in south Bihar and cold day at a few places in northern parts of the state on Wednesday. “Cold wave conditions are expected at one or two places in Buxar, Bhabhua, Aurangabad, Nawada and Gaya districts over the next 24 hours. Also, cold day conditions are expected at one or two places in Purnia, Kishanganj, Darbhanga and Madhubani districts,” said Zeeshan Ansari, an official at Patna Meteorological Centre. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), cold wave condition is declared at a place when the actual minimum temperature is 10 degrees C or lower along with departure of 4.5 to 6.4 degrees C from normal. Cold day condition, on the other hand, is declared when minimum temperature touches 10 degrees C or low and there is a departure of 4.5-6.4 degrees C in maximum temperature on two consecutive days. Though the weathermen have forecast cold wave and cold day conditions at a few places on Wednesday, the IMD has predicted abatement of such cold weather conditions from Thursday. The IMD, in its all India weather bulletin issued on Tuesday, said cold wave and cold day conditions are very likely at isolated pockets in Bihar over the next 24 hours and abatement thereafter. It further stated that no significant change is expected in minimum temperature in east India during the next two days and it would rise by 2-3 notches thereafter. The weathermen attributed the slight respite from extreme cold conditions to two back-to-back western disturbances. The IMD stated in its bulletin that the two western disturbances – first on December 24 and another on December 26 – are very likely to influence weather conditions in northwest India and abatement of cold wave conditions over most parts of northwest and central India. The western disturbances around this time of the year bring rainfall or snowfall in the Himalayan region and cloudy conditions, followed by sharp temperature drop in northern plains, including Bihar. The IMD has predicted light to moderate rainfall or snowfall in western Himalayan region, including Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, between December 24 and 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/expect-slight-respite-from-cold-wave-by-thursday-met/articleshow/88418791.cms||Piyush Tripathi
---||Ahmedabad||Really long shot: Parents in Gujarat taking kids abroad for Covid vax-cation||AHMEDABAD/SURAT: Rajdeep Brahmbhatt and wife Siddhi recently returned from the US to Ahmedabad. The couple did not go to America on any business or social trip – the purpose of their 19-day-travel was to ensure that their five-year-old twin boys Sarva and Sattva get vaccinated against Covid-19. “The kids are natural-born citizens of the US and were eligible for the vaccine. As a vaccine for children is still awaited in India, we thought it was worth the trouble to safeguard the twins against Covid,” said Siddhi, a resident of Naranpura. Rajdeep said they were motivated especially as schools are reopening. “As we lost a family member during the second wave, we wanted kids to start offline schooling after vaccination. This way, we can be assured of their safety,” he said, adding that he and his wife have also got booster dose after consulting their physician. The Brahmbhatt couple is not the only one. With Indian government not yet beginning vaccination of minors, there are some parents in Gujarat who are not shying away from going the extra mile to safeguard their children in the pandemic. For example, Abhishek Patel, a diamond manufacturing unit owner in Surat, got his son Hridhaan, 6, both the doses of Covid vaccine in Tel Aviv, Israel. The bizman spent Rs 2.28 lakh for the trip along with his wife Shivani. Read AlsoVaccination of under-12s starts in handful of EU countriesATHENS: Greece and a handful of other European Union members began vaccinating children ages 5-11 against Covid-19 on Wednesday as governments braced for the holiday season and the spread of the omicron variant. An Athens children's hospital administered its first shots to younger children hours“We will return to Israel again for the booster dose after seven months. Hridhaan got his second dose and I feel that he is safe now. He will now attend school offline,” Abhishek told TOI over phone from Israel. “While we spent about $1000 for each family member in airfare, the money is worth for my son’s safety.” Patel family also owns a house in Tel Aviv as Abhishek was based in Israel before he shifted to Surat before the pandemic. “There was no vaccine available in India for children and it may take a few more months for the vaccine for children to come. Hence, we planned to go to Israel. He will attend school now,” said Shivani. There are also reports of people going to Dubai to get their children vaccinated. Experts said many people are taking vaccine-vacation to get their children protection against Covid. Read AlsoRajasthan: Booster shots can increase antibodies, say doctorsWith the state reporting 17 cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, the health experts have suggested that the government should come up with a policy to make booster doses available for people who got vaccinated against the virus a few months ago. They also claimed that six months afterDr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that he has come across cases where people on vacation abroad got an opportunity to get their kids vaccinated if their stay allowed it. “Getting booster doses in countries that allow it even for the adult population is also common,” he said. Dr Chetan Trivedi, member of executive board of Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), said that after Omicron and the opening of schools, they have recorded a rise in inquiries for vaccination of children.

---||Patna||1,300MT fertilizer stored in Vaishali godown sold illegally||PATNA: More than 1,300 metric tonne (MT) of potash-based fertilizer worth Rs 2.27 crore, stored in a private facility at Kataru Chak-Mohammadpur village under Belsar police outpost in Vaishali district, was allegedly sold on black market. The fertilizers were manufactured by Mosaic, a US-based firm. The fertilizers were meant for supply to farmers across the state at subsidised rates and the government was supposed to pay the US firm for it. The storage facility is owned by a local private firm. As per the US firm’s complaint, a copy of which is with TOI, they first got hint about foul play in August this year. The representatives of the firm complained that fertilizers were stolen from the godown and sold on black market. Altogether 2,761MT fertilizer was sent to the godown by train in December 2020 from a seaport in India. The representatives of the US firm met Vaishali SP (incharge) Ashok Kumar Singh at his office on Saturday evening to lodge an FIR after their complaint was allegedly not accepted at Belsar police outpost. The SP then directed the sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal to investigate the matter and take necessary action. Dayal told TOI over phone on Tuesday that the representatives of the US firm have been asked to submit a written complaint by Wednesday at Belsar. “Since they had submitted the photocopy of the complaint letter to the SP, the FIR could not be registered,” Dayal said. Vaishali DAO A K Jha said one Pankaj Singh and his wife own the godown in which the US firm keeps its fertilizers for supply among farmers through wholesalers and retailers. “The US firm has complained that more than 1,300MT potash-based fertiliser was sold on the black market. I served notices on Pankaj twice and asked him to inspect the stock. Replying to the first notice, Pankaj said he had tested positive for Covid. He has so far not replied to the second notice,” Jha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/1300mt-fertilizer-stored-in-vaishali-godown-sold-illegally/articleshow/88418819.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Business||SBI invests Rs 100cr in JSW Cement||MUMBAI: SBI, the country’s largest lender, has invested Rs 100 crore for a minority stake in JSW Cement, which is controlled by billionaire industrialist Sajjan Jindal. The public sector bank has put the money through compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS). These CCPS will be converted into equity shares of JSW Cement at a later stage. The conversion will be linked to the company’s future business performance and valuation determined at the time of its initial public offering (IPO), expected to take place in 12 months or later, JSW Cement said.The company will use the money to almost double its current annual manufacturing capacity of 14 million tonnes. The SBI deal comes close on the heels of the Rs 1,500-crore investment made by private equity funds Apollo Global of US and Synergy of Dubai in JSW Cement. The two funds invested Rs 750 crore each in the company. In August, India’s anti-trust regulator CCI had approved the two transactions. “Financing our growth and expansion strategy with investment from a banking partner such as SBI sets us up very well for our planned IPO in the next 12-18 months,” said JSW Cement director (finance) Narinder Singh Kahlon. Jindal ventured into this segment in 2009 by converting industrial by-products such as slag from his steel-making operations into cement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-invests-rs-100cr-in-jsw-cement/articleshow/88419918.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Business||Godrej Consumer aims for double-digit volume growth||MUMBAI: Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL) is aiming at a double-digit volume growth in the medium term, mainly on the back of category development, Sudhir Sitapati said at an analyst meet, his first major interaction after taking over as MD & CEO of GCPL. According to a Motilal Oswal research report, 50 per cent of this would come from penetration gains in half of the portfolio. The rest would be made of 15 per cent from moderate market share gains in half of the portfolio, 25 per cent from consumption-led market growth, and 10 per cent from disruptive innovation. “The single-most important highlight of Sudhir’s presentation was to increase focus and ability on category development, which (we believe) to some extent, was missing in Godrej (till now),” said a report by ICICI Securities. It is cognisant that increasing penetration and category development — something that Sitapati’s former organisation Hindustan Unilever has implemented in a focused manner — will require resources. The ICICI Securities report added, “The headroom for increased investments has to be created in an inflationary raw material environment.” Sitapati highlighted multiple measures for driving cost savings, including improving gross margins (through a better mix), lower discounts, reducing overheads, and eliminating non-media ATL (above-the-line). In an indication that the innovation process, which GCPL stepped up over the last decade, could be streamlined, Sitapati said the focus will be more on the core, with fewer, bigger innovations.In its report, Emkay Global Financial Services said, “Apart from highlighting GCPL’s strengths, including innovation culture, cost-saving mindset and obsession with product quality, Sudhir pointed out several weaknesses, including low category development, too much innovation with less focus on core, lack of global collaboration and lack of a frugal cost structure with low investments in automation.” High complexity can lead to lack of focus on the core. For instance, GCPL’s inventory, said the Motilal Oswal report, is 1.7x higher than ideal levels and hence reduction of stock keeping units (SKUs) will be a key focus area. The India business, the report added, has 500 SKUs, but most stores maintain only 12 SKUs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/godrej-consumer-aims-for-double-digit-volume-growth/articleshow/88419909.cms||---

The bank had said that it will now seek approval from shareholders. If the move is cleared, it would in effect be an extension on the current shareholder approval that expires on February 8, 2022. The private bank had said that it would aim to reduce its non-performing assets to zero by the end of the current financial year. In an analyst call in October, the bank MD & CEO Prashant Kumar had said that it would be investing 20 per cent in a new asset reconstruction company that will acquire the bank’s bad loans. Kumar told analysts that there is adequate capital in terms of common equity tier-1 (CET) at 11.5 per cent and the overall capital ratio of 17.6 per cent. Kumar had said that a lot of management bandwidth was getting utilised for recovery and transferring the bad loans would free the management to focus on growth. While raising capital strengthens the bank’s fundamentals, a bloated equity base makes it difficult for it to service the equity and generate returns for shareholders, particularly when credit growth is sluggish.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-gets-nod-to-raise-rs-10k-cr-equity/articleshow/88419937.cms||---

The EOU sleuths unearthed DA worth Rs 10 crore amassed by Mrityunjay and Rs 63.14 lakh by Vakeel. The two are among the 41 officers, including suspended Bhojpur SP Rakesh Kumar Dubey and suspended Aurangabad SP Sudhir Kumar Porika, who were earlier charged with conniving with sand smugglers in the state. Mrityunjay was transferred to Gaya by the time he was removed from service. So far, DA cases against 13 of 41 officers found involved in allowing illegal sand mining have been registered by the EOU. The raids against Mrityunjay were conducted at his flat in R K Sadan apartment on Gola Road in Patna, his parental residence at Golapar village in Goh, Aurangabad and two flats on Ratu Road at Ranchi in Jharkhand. Sources said Mrityunjay also amassed assets in the names of his wife Neelam Kumar, and two brother-in-laws Srikant Kumar and Pankaj Kumar. Sources said Rs 1 crore deposits were found in the name of Mrityunjay’s brother-in-laws. The EOU also unearthed two SUVs worth Rs 70 lakh and Rs 39 lakh fixed deposit in the name of Mrityunjay’s wife. Sources said Mrityunjay had joined service in 2012 and was found in possession of total movable and immovable assets worth Rs 3.11 crore against total income of Rs 71.6 lakh. The suspended CO, on the other hand, owns a flat worth Rs 12.01 lakh deed value in Surya Chadra Vihar apartment on Gola Road in Patna and 10 decimal plot with house built on it worth Rs 24.5 lakh in Namkum, Ranchi. Sources said raids were conducted at his Gola Road flat and parental residence at Majhui village in Rohtas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-mvis-da-worth-rs-10crore-unearthed/articleshow/88419346.cms||Debashish Karmakar
---||Patna||Bihar: Jitan Ram Manjhi apologises for ‘slip of tongue’||PATNA: Facing sharp outcry from people at large and also the political class, former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Tuesday apologised for using an expletive against the Brahmins, describing it as a “slip of tongue”. Manjhi, however, maintained that he would continue to protest against “Brahminism”. “My words that went against ‘pandits’ might have been due to the slip of tongue for which I apologise. In any case, my stand is not against Brahmins, but Brahminism,” Manjhi tweeted. “Brahmins hate Dalits, treat and describe them as untouchables. They hang bones by their necks, brooms by their waists and also tie ‘ghunghroo’ to their ankles. I will continue to protest against that,” he further tweeted. The apology from Manjhi, however, failed to mollify the BJP functionaries. Gajendra Jha, a BJP functionary, went public with his equally shocking public announcement through a video clip, in which he claimed that he would give anyone Rs 11 lakh if he or she chops tongue of Manjhi and brings it to him. This did not go down well with the state BJP which immediately went into a damage control mode. “I must make it clear that Jha is a member of the BJP, but he does not hold any post,” party’s state spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said. “Manjhi must apologise for what he has said against the Brahmins. His attitude is reprehensible and his words should be condemned. It is equally true that the stance of Jha is also condemnable,” Patel added. BJP MPs Ashok Kumar Yadav and Pradip Kumar Singh said Manjhi’s stance was divisive and he should apologise before the “people of the country” for using an expletive against Brahmins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/manjhi-apologises-for-slip-of-tongue/articleshow/88418969.cms||Abhay Singh

The post fell vacant in early 2021 as incumbent and TDP member Reddy Subrahmanyam retired. The election will be held on December 26 in the council hall. AP legislature secretary P Balakrishnamacharyulu issued the notification on Tuesday on behalf of the governor. The ruling YSR Congress has already named its candidate, Zakia Khanam, for the post. The legislative council recently elected its chairman Koyye Moshen Raju. While the chairman post was given to an SC leader, the deputy chairperson post was given to a Muslim woman by the ruling party. The YSR Congress has secured a full majority in the 58-member House, after two years of its victory to the legislative assembly. The YSR Congress has 32 members in the House followed by 15 for the TDP, four for the Progressive Democratic Front, two for the BJP and three independents. Initially in 2019 and 2020, the YSR Congress had a tough time in the legislative council with the opposition TDP having a clear majority and the YSR Congress having a single digit total of nine members. However, after two-and-a-half years in power, the YSR Congress could secure a majority in the House as several TDP members have retired. Having secured a clear majority in the Upper House, the chief minister had the legislative assembly pass another resolution, withdrawing the earlier resolution for dissolution of the legislative council.

Defeated candidates proved to be sour losers in Singvad taluka even as the police had to use force in Limkheda to control unruly crowd. Dahod district has had a history of poll-related violence, particularly during local body elections. While most parts of the district did not witness any untoward incident, Singvad taluka was an exception where two incidents of violence took place in two different villages. In Pisoi village of the Singvad taluka, supporters of a winning candidate were targeted by a mob of supporters of a defeated candidate. One person was injured on the head during stone pelting. The second incident was reported in the Kesharpur village of the same taluka. Here supporters of a losing candidate went on a rampage and targeted the winner’s house. Vehicles parked near the house too were damaged by the mob. In Limkheda, an unruly crowd that had gathered at the counting centre was trying to move towards the counting centre.

The initiative is part of Operation Parivartan, under which the police and excise departments and the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) intensify the destruction and seizure of ganja. Statistics available point out that ganja crop has been destroyed on an extent of over 2,000 acres in the vicinity of 92 villages in the Visakhapatnam tribal belt. The report on alternatives to ganja cultivation is now with the commissioner of horticulture and agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu. Some of the crops are: strawberry, dragon fruit, avocado, ‘jaji’, mace, holy basil, roselle tea flower, ‘dulagondi’, bird’s eye chilli, citrodora, palmarosa and cuscus grass, Kannababu told TOI. “All these are rainfed crops, apart from regular crops such as ginger and turmeric, which are commercial crops whose extent in the Agency would be enhanced. If we can supply good seeds for these crops, farmers would get Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh per acre,” assistant director of the horticulture department V Prabhakara Rao said. Apart from these crops, coffee and black pepper will also be promoted to generate higher income. Earlier, 100 plants of black pepper on one acre were cultivated; now, 800 plants can be accommodated for a higher yield, he said. At present, the field staff of various departments led by ITDA Paderu is conducting village-level surveys in the area. “Field staff will discuss high remunerative crops with farmers. Visakha Agency is suitable for the cultivation of high-value vegetables. So far in the survey, some farmers have expressed an interest in cultivating vegetables,” project horticulture officer in-charge Chetti Bindu said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/high-income-crops-to-take-place-of-ganja/articleshow/88418793.cms||Siva G
---||Visakhapatnam||AP: Social change campaigns aided Vizianagaram’s vaccine drive||VISAKHAPATNAM: Social and behavioural change communication played a crucial role in Vizianagaram attaining 100% coverage of the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Vizianagaram is the second district in the state after Nellore to achieve the feat. According to Vizianagaram officials, only 2.9 lakh people had received the vaccination by July. The same district administered the vaccine to nearly 19 lakh beneficiaries to hit the 100% mark by December 17. Vaccine hesitancy, fear and misinformation had affected the progress of the drive in the initial months, particularly in rural and tribal areas of the district. The distinct physical division between the plains and hilly terrain of the district and low literacy rates made it further difficult for officials to inoculate all eligible beneficiaries. District officials embraced social and behavioural change communication to create awareness and instil confidence among the public. They visited hundreds of educational institutions and public places to explain the advantages of vaccination. Rallies were conducted in villages to improve the overall vaccine acceptance rates. Vizianagaram district collector A Surya Kumari said the combined efforts of officials and field-level staff helped the district to cover all eligible beneficiaries. “The door-to-door vaccination drives also helped the district achieve 100% vaccination coverage,” said Surya Kumari. Joint collector Dr Mahesh Kumar said the district is well prepared for any eventuality or even the third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/social-change-campaigns-aided-vzms-vaccine-drive/articleshow/88418782.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

A combination of three drugs — Ivermectin, Diethylcarbamazine and Albendazole (IDA) — is being administered to everyone except children below 5 years of age, pregnant women and seriously ill people in the affected areas. According to Dr Bipin Sinha, a senior official of the filaria control programme, MDA is a critical pillar of the LF elimination strategy. “Several teams have been formed for MDA of anti-filarial medications using triple-drug treatment regimen (IDA). Rapid response teams have also been formed at the block level to deal with any adverse situation,” Sinha said. Dr Rajesh Pandey, the state NTD (Neglected Tropical Diseases) coordinator, pointed out, “LF, which spreads through infected mosquitoes, is one of the biggest causes of long-term disability in the world. A person is usually infected in his childhood, but remains asymptomatic for several years before developing lymphedema (swelling in an arm or leg) or hydrocele (swelling in scrotum). Some people also develop tropical pulmonary eosinophilia and show symptoms like the passage of milky urine (chyluria).” He added, “Severe lymphedema, which is debilitating and incurable, requires lifelong treatment. It can be easily prevented with the consumption of anti-filarial drugs administered once a year.” The launch event for triple-drug treatment regimen against LF in the three districts was organized by the State Health Society and supported by World Health Organization, Global Health Strategies, Project Concern International and Centre for Advocacy and Research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-districts-launch-triple-drug-treatment-regimen-to-end-lymphatic-filariasis/articleshow/88418839.cms||---

It has been developed under the state government’s ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali Abhiyan’. After inaugurating the facility for tourists, the CM and some of his cabinet colleagues inspected the Triveni canal while enjoying boating. Nitish asked the officials to maintain normal flow of water in the old canal in view of the boat safari facility. He also told them to link the end point of the dead canal with the Done canal and the start point with the Gandak river to maintain normal flow of water. Nitish inspected the land earmarked for the proposed Valmiki Sabhagar on the bank of the Gandak in Valmikinagar. He reviewed the master plan, location map, guest house and floor plan of the sabhagar and inquired from the officials about its link road, parking arrangement, security barrack and entry and exit gates. After the inspection, the CM asked the officials to raise the height of the boundary wall of the sabhagar keeping in mind the forest areas in its neighbourhood. He said, “The proposed Valmiki Sabhagar will be named after Maharshi Valmiki just like the state government built a Mahabodhi Sanskritik Kendra in Gaya in the name of Lord Buddha. The sabhagar will have 102 rooms.” The CM later visited Valmiki Tiger Reserve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-inaugurates-boat-safari-in-valmikinagar/articleshow/88418920.cms||Madan Kumar

According to officials, the proposed galleries will surprise the visitors with the fascinating world of science and technology. Executive engineer of state building construction department, Ram Babu, said Canada-based GSM Project has been given the task to design the models, which is based on the themes of the five galleries – ‘be a scientist’, ‘basic sciences’, ‘space and astronomy’, ‘sustainable environment’ and ‘body and mind’. “For instance, in space and astronomy, different concept-based models will be designed, including celestial bodies, weightlessness and its effect so that visitors can understand the subject in broader way,” he said. The official added most models in the galleries will be of experimental nature and technology-based. “The concept of the design has been approved by the committee and the selected company has been preparing the detailed report of the 246 models,” he said. The G+1 building with state-of-the-art technology is being constructed in an area of 30,000 sq metre on 15 acres of land. Besides the five galleries, the building will have four learning suites – maker space, big data centre, kitchen and gym. The science city will promote and popularise science among the people as well as inspire the younger generation to grow a scientific temperament. Kumar Ravi, secretary of the state building construction department, said civil work on the ambitious science museum has reached the advanced stage. “More than 75% work has been completed and the civil work is likely to be completed by June next year. The models will be ready for display by December 2022. The civil work in the main galleries, auditorium and the entrance hall has been completed. Kids and other visitors will understand the scientific concept in an easy way with the help of modern technology,” Ravi said. A dormitory will also be constructed on the first floor, especially for schoolchildren who want to stay during the study tour or excursion. “Once completed, the dormitory will accommodate more than 250 kids at a time and it will be connected with learning suites,” he said. The foundation stone for this project worth Rs 400 crore was laid by CM Nitish Kumar in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/246-models-selected-for-display-at-science-city-in-patna/articleshow/88418951.cms||Faryal Rumi

Extreme cold conditions may impact their health in many ways, say doctors. Dr A K Ashu of Indira Gandhi Institute of Cardiology told this newspaper that elderly people and children were more vulnerable to viral ailments during extreme weather conditions. “A cold wave means that the atmospheric pressure drops with decreasing temperature. This often leads to hypertension and headache and ultimately to stroke. Hence, hypertensive and cardiac patients should take safety precautions and preferably stay indoors,” he said. Dr Sanjeev Kumar, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, claimed that prolonged exposure to cold weather affected the upper respiratory tract of people. He added, “Whenever a person catches cold, cough and fever, he should rest and get tested for Covid as its new variant, Omicron, is spreading its tentacles across the country.” Dr Satish Kumar of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital pointed out, “Hypertension, viral fever, influenza, paralytic and heart attacks are more pronounced in extreme cold conditions. As viruses grow rapidly in such conditions, people are prone to viral infections if they fail to protect themselves.” The principal of Madhubani Medical College and Hospital, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said exposure to cold winds and moisture could lead to bronchitis and lung infections. He continued, “Once the chill sets into one’s body, it is bound to affect the respiratory tract and lead to fever. Cold winds can also affect people’s skin. Chapped lips and cracked skin may not seem to be a big problem, but they can be very painful if left untreated.” Dr Gangadhar Singh of Government Ayurvedic College and Hospital observed that cold waves could lead to viral fever and aggravate the diseases related to joints and muscles. He advised people to put on clothes with protective layers and practise yoga indoors. “One must consume healthy food items and drink plenty of water to stay safe,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/practise-yoga-to-beat-winter-blues-doctor/articleshow/88418887.cms||B K Mishra

On Monday, the SVU had arrested MU registrar Pushpendra Prasad Verma, proctor Jainandan Prasad Singh, library incharge Vinod Kumar and VC’s personal assistant Subodh Kumar for their alleged involvement in the Rs30-crore scam. They were forwarded to judicial custody on Tuesday. Sources said files related to at least 12 illegal appointments, including the appointment of an assistant professor, have been submitted to SVU. All the appointees are from Uttar Pradesh, the home state of the VC. The SVU sleuths had raided the VC’s residence at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on November 17. “Some of the new recruits stayed in the varsity guesthouse for more than a year for free,” sources said. Besides purchase of books worth Rs 1.16 and e-books worth Rs 2.5 crore without any tender, at least 15 lakh answer booklets were also purchased from a private firm sans tender at Rs 75 lakh, the sources added. A senior bureaucrat said after SVU raids against the VC, a person sent documents, including official letters and RTI replies from five varsities in the state and one from Jharkhand, to a large number of officers and ministers in Bihar, Jharkhand and Centre, alleging that a Delhi-based publishing house owned by two brothers is also involved in the scam. The SVU had conducted raids against Prasad on November 16 and unearthed Rs 3 crore disproportionate assets amassed by him. Several files, Rs 90 lakh in cash, foreign currencies and jewellery worth Rs 15 lakh were seized from his residence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vigilance-tightens-noose-around-tainted-mu-vc/articleshow/88418990.cms||Debashish Karmakar

In Bihar, the RJD is vocal about the caste census. Its alliance partners, like the CPI(ML), CPI, CPM and the Congress have also supported the demand. From the NDA side, the JD(U) has also been demanding it. “Caste census is necessary for the country and is also in the interest of all. This is not against any caste/class. On the contrary, it will benefit all and also help in the country’s integrated all-round development,” Lalu tweeted. “Those who don’t want caste census are against principles of equal justice and opportunities,” he wrote in another tweet. Elaborating it further through the video clip, Lalu said in the absence of caste-based data, both the central and state governments have been making “directionless budgets” and “the back benchers are further pushed back”. “Once the caste-based data are available, every social group will come to know about its population. In proportion with the increase in the population of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe sections, they will have an increase in their reservation quota,” Lalu said, adding those from the backward caste (BC) and OBC sections will also get fruits of development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/lalu-reiterates-demand-for-caste-based-census/articleshow/88419294.cms||Abhay Singh

According to ACMA (Automotive Component Manufacturers Association) president Sunjay Kapur, the chip shortage is not likely to get resolved “in the foreseeable future” and OEMs are already tweaking their production strategy to best use the supplies they are getting. ICRA had earlier said that the chip shortage will cost Indian car and SUV companies around 5 lakh units in production and sales this financial year. The financial cost of this loss of production for companies, said ICRA, is around Rs 1,800-2,000 crore. The chip shortage, added Kapur, is the biggest headwind for the auto component industry along with rising raw material costs and shipping container shortage. But unlike the chip problem, the pinch from the other two won't hurt that badly. "The raw material costs like steel are passed through by the OEM so the hit on operating margins will come from those that are not passed through," said Kapur. Auto consultants have predicted that the chip shortage will start easing up only towards the end of calendar year 2022. The chip shortage hit festival sales this year and popular new launches now have a waiting period of 6-8 months. Dealership stocks are now down 10-15 days from the usual 30-35 days. Wholesale dispatches lagged last financial year for three consecutive months – 186,000 units in September 2021 compared to 294,000 units in the year-ago month, 259,000 units in October 2021 compared to 334,000 units in September 2020 and 246,000 units in November 2021 compared to 287,000 units last November. Globally auto makers will cumulatively take a hit of 7.7 million cars and a sales hit of over $200 billion due to the chip crisis in 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/chip-shortage-rs-3kcr-pinch-for-car-makers/articleshow/88419736.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

The fact that the industry has witnessed a steady rise of women in technology is a great one. While there has been tremendous progress in this regard, we also need to acknowledge the efforts that have been made to get to where we are at. Today, conversations around diversity, equality, and inclusion have become important boardroom discussion points. Organisations have recognised the reality that having a diverse workforce does lead to better performance, with many companies having taken positive steps towards bridging the diversity gap — gender being one among those. There is still a long way to go through before we can confidently say that women are fairly represented within the technology industry. In a recent report by Kaspersky, titled ‘Women in tech, where are we now? Understanding the evolution of women in technology’, it was found that around 76% respondents felt that the effects of the Covid pandemic delayed their career progression. The report also stated that more than half (54%) felt that for gender equality to become a reality, remote working structures were the way to go. Drawing on these insights, there is a clear indication that for women to thrive, there needs to be change driven at the grassroots level within organisations. Backed by strong data as well as voiced sentiments, now is the time for organisations to walk the talk, rethink, and redefine roles which were traditionally driven by gender. Walk the talk: Proactive measures to increase women representationAt a foundation level, organisations may take active measures to increase the hiring of women and encourage them to join the workforce. By getting the message out in the public domain, organisations stand to earn tremendous goodwill which will, in turn, translate into interest from women to explore newer opportunities. The buck does not stop with merely hiring of women as a means of bridging existing gender gaps. At present, the percentage of women in leadership roles across the technology sector is fairly low. Invite women to the decision-making table, and give them a chance to make a difference to the rapidly booming industry. Their voices would lend a unique perspective to ongoing conversations, and can open doors to newer ideas and unexplored avenues. Leading from the front for a gender-redefined organisation With this, women have the potential to become the face of the organisation, putting the latter in a novel situation where peers sit up and take notice. Within the Indian technology space, we have several women leaders the world looks up to. As we, as a sector, progress towards creating a new generation of women leaders in technology, gender-redefined organisations will fast become the new normal. With this, what we can expect is greater representation of voice, more opportunities for growth, a level playing field, and a shattered glass ceiling. We also need to be cognisant of the fact that this is easier said than done. As a result of decades of societal conditioning, gender will have a role to play in workplace dynamics. Amid clarion calls for change, we need to move towards a gender-blind workplace — one which evaluates resumes without names to minimise chances of bias seeping in. By promoting such practices, we can create workplaces that are fair, and have a well-balanced representation of both the sexes. At the end of the day, for gender-redefined workplaces to become a reality, change needs to begin at the top. Leaders could look at holding themselves accountable for driving change, and triggering a positive trickle-down effect within the company through proactive measures that support women. As the saying goes, “Actions speak louder than words.” This holds particularly true when pledging and working towards a technology sector that is driven by women, which I hope to see become a reality in the near future.

Over 63% of those graduating this year are women. Speaking at the ceremony, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that while two new campuses would be added under AUD, the College of Arts will also be attached to the university soon and that a few formalities pertaining to the latter were pending. Urging the graduates to become ambassadors of social justice and equality, Sisodia said, “Wherever Babasaheb is mentioned across India, equality and social justice permeate the atmosphere. Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of every student who graduates to use their knowledge and skills towards bringing equality and social justice.” Sisodia also urged students to join the “Desh Ke Mentor” programme and guide students of Delhi government schools who are unable to turn to their families for guidance. AUD vice-chancellor Anu Singh Lather stated that in the current academic year, the university saw an increase in the student intake. LG Anil Baijal presided over the ceremony and Dr K Kasturirangan, former ISRO chairman, was the chief guest.

He was addressing the National Conference of All India Tribal Development Council at the Birla auditorium here on Tuesday. The union minister also demanded a law for reservation in the private sector. He said the leaders and political parties will listen only if people agitate. If the reservation was over, there will be no point fighting for it collectively, he said. Kulaste said at present one should worry about promotion, and filling up the backlog. He said indigenous leaders had expressed concern before the parliamentary committee by objecting to the recruitment of other categories on the backlog of the STs. Raising the issue of land rights of the tribal people in the forest area, he said, "The people of the tribal community need to be active and work. If any PIL is filed against us in the court, we should become a party in it and fight the case." Kulaste, urging the tribal communities to unite, said, "It is necessary to show your strength in the elections, which will send a message to the political parties that without our support the government will not be formed. Show strength by uniting the MPs and MLAs. Efforts are needed in elections so that good people get elected to raise the issues of the community," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/union-minister-seeks-st-quota-in-pvt-sector/articleshow/88420098.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The proposal values the project at Rs 5,200 crore — Rs 1,300 crore more than the valuation under the Cube deal and envisages an immediate payout of Rs 300 crore of back interest dues from April 2021. The restructuring will turn the company into a ‘green entity’ with cash flows capable of servicing all creditors. Under the Cube deal, secured lenders would have got 97% recovery and unsecured lenders and operational creditors would get only 36%. According to the proposal sent by IL&FS to lenders, CNTL debt will be restructured effective April 1, 2021, and the interest will start from this date. The recovery for secured and unsecured lenders would be 100% and 90% respectively. “We confirm CNTL is proposing a restructuring of debt, subject to applicable approvals (including NCLT decision on ongoing legal proceedings). This is in keeping with the new board’s continuing effort to ensure higher and faster resolution/recovery for all classes of stakeholders and lenders,” said IL&FS spokesperson Sharad Goel. According to sources, there is large cash in the CNTL SPV, of more than Rs 1,400 crore. So, it is now in a position to make large cash payouts. Lenders have declared the project a non-performing asset and, given the moratorium imposed as part of restructuring, are not receiving any payouts. The major financial creditors include SBI, Canara Bank, IndusInd Bank and Standard Chartered Bank Singapore. After the CNTL valuation was revised to Rs 5,226 crore, Cube wrote to the new board offering to marginally revise its earlier offer of Rs 3,900 crore and requested an extension of share purchase timelines. Cube had also submitted its revised proposal to NCLT for approval, which was declined. If the lenders accept the restructuring proposal, the SPV will become a profitable company and can be monetised through the InvIT route. The Chenani-Nashri project — a single-tube bi-directional tunnel — cuts the travel distance between Jammu and Srinagar by about 40km and saves over two hours of travel time as it bypasses snow and landslide-prone areas. The tunnel was renamed after Shyama Prasad Mukherjee in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/recast-plan-by-ilfs-for-jk-tunnel-values-it-at-rs-5200cr/articleshow/88419950.cms||Mayur Shetty

As a result, the sensex ended with a gain of 497 points at 56,319 points. On the NSE, the Nifty too witnessed high volatility, gyrating between 16,936 points and 16,688 points, and finally settled at 16,771 — up 157 points. Dealers said that traders resorted to short covering after having speculated on a fall in the market, only to later rush in to cut their losses by buying stocks at higher prices. This, in turn, led to a further rally in the market till mid-session. However, profit-taking at the day’s high pulled the leading indices into the negative territory before a late-session recovery helped to close with gains. Market players are, however, not sure if Tuesday’s gains could be sustained in the next few sessions. One of the main reasons is that the day’s recovery came despite a Rs 1,210-crore net selling by foreign funds, BSE data showed. So far in the month, foreign funds have net sold stocks worth over Rs 21,000 crore, data from BSE and CDSL showed. Second, how the Omicron variant of the Covid virus would impact the markets and the economies is still unknown and remains a risk. Weakness of the rupee against the dollar could also affect market sentiment, they said. In Tuesday’s market, while Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank contributed the most to the index, selling in Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance and HDFC limited the gains, BSE data showed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-up-497-pts-amid-volatility/articleshow/88419964.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Contempt plea in Supreme Court against Gujarat high court judges||AHMEDABAD: In a seemingly audacious move, a petitioner from Yavatmal district in Maharashtra on Monday approached the Supreme Court seeking contempt of court proceedings and criminal action against two judges of Gujarat high court — Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta — who last week rejected a PIL against the Ahmedabad civic body’s decision restricting the entry of people unvaccinated for Covid on its premises, and for their appeal to citizens to get inoculated and even go for booster doses. Rashid Khan Pathan’s ire has been provoked by an order by Justices Pardiwala and Mehta passed on Friday which turned down a PIL filed by five persons taking exception to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) circular issued on September 17, by which the municipal body had barred unvaccinated people on its premises, in a bid to nudge people to go for Covid vaccination. The petitioners contended that the Centre has made it clear that vaccination is not mandatory. The judges did not comment on whether vaccination should be mandatory or not, but had hailed the AMC’s campaign and appealed to citizens to go for vaccination. This did not go down well with Pathan who introduced himself as national secretary of an NGO, Human Rights Council. He filed a petition in the apex court demanding that Justices Pardiwala and Mehta be held in contempt of the Supreme Court for acting “in utter disregard, deliberate defiance and wilful contempt” of SC directions. He also demanded criminal action against the judges for hatching a conspiracy “to give wrongful profit to vaccine companies” by upholding the AMC circular, which would cause loss and misappropriation of crores of rupees of public money. “The accused also violated fundamental rights of many citizens. The order is instigating the state authorities concerned to put the life of citizens in danger and there will even be deaths of common people, whose body( sic) is allergic to the vaccines,” the petitioner claimed. Demanding a CBI investigation and that the justices be withdrawn from judicial work, Pathan also dragged in the government lawyers assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas and additional government pleader K M Antani, in his angry petition for allegedly abetting the conspiracy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/contempt-plea-in-sc-against-guj-hc-judges/articleshow/88419719.cms||---

Terming the MVA government as being “non-existent” for the last two years, opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said his party will focus on discussion of various issues and not disruption. “We have received the invite, but this government is out to suppress democracy, and our MLAs have been suspended. What do we do going for the tea party?” he asked. He said election to the assembly speaker’s post has always been through secret ballot. “The government does not trust its own MLAs and has suspended our MLAs to reduce our strength in the House. It is the only government to hold such a short session. Even the Centre and other state governments have held longer sessions. MVA is out to stifle democratic norms. We shall use every instrument available to us to raise people’s issues in the House,” he said. Addressing a press meet at Women Economic Development Centre in Mumbai, Fadnavis accused MVA of failing to defend electoral reservation for OBCs in Supreme Court. “It failed to collect empirical data in two years and now has informed SC it will do so in three months. It is because of MVA’s incompetence that OBCs have lost their poll reservation,” he said. He reiterated his demand for a CBI inquiry into scams in recruitment exams. “The trail leads straight to Mantralaya,” he said. The BJP would highlight government’s failure to compensate farmers for crop losses on account of natural calamities, he said. On desecration of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Bengaluru, Fadnavis said the party condemns it and added the Karnataka CM had clarified his statement had been twisted. “No one in this government protested when one of their own climbed onto the back of Maharaj’s statue. Wasn’t this insulting?” he asked. CM Uddhav Thackeray, who had a spinal surgery last month, did not attend the customary tea party. He was virtually present and attended the cabinet meeting through video conferencing, said Dy CM Ajit Pawar, who said he will attend House proceedings as per his convenience.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-skips-tea-cups-promises-stormy-winter-session/articleshow/88421071.cms||---

A special operations group (SOG) intercepted them while they were on their way home. Rs 3.5 lakh in cash, 17 kg silver and 22 gm of gold jewellery were recovered from them. The robbery was reported on December 12 in Bihar's Sheikhpura. The accused were unidentified in Bihar but had been under the scanner of Shahjahanpur police because of past criminal records. They have been identified as Satyapal Singh, Dhaniram (first name only), Shobharam (first name only), Gayadeen (first name only) and Om Pal. All were residents of Isapur village, under the jurisdiction of Nigohi police station in Shahjahanpur. All the accused were habitual offenders and had been missing from the village for the past few days, said police. On Monday evening, Shahjahanpur police received a tip-off from a villager that the five men were returning home with stolen jewellery and cash. Thereafter, Shahjahanpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand contacted his counterpart in Sheikhpur and collected information about the items stolen from the showroom of one Ajeet Kumar. SSP Anand then deployed the SOG to monitor the accused. SSP Anand told TOI, “The accused settled themselves in tents near the showroom a week before committing the crime. After conducting a recce, they realised that would be to break into the showroom through a back wall. On December 12, they managed to break into the showroom and decamped with cash and jewellery.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: New drainage pumping station at Kestopur||KOLKATA: A new 200 cusec per hour capacity drainage pumping station will be set up at Kestopur off Cantonment canal which will help prevent waterlogging in the areas surrounding the airport under Bidhannagar and South Dum Dum municipality during heavy rains. State irrigation and waterways minister Soumen Mahapatra laid the foundation stone of the project on Tuesday in the presence of Bidhannagar MLA and fire services minister Sujit Bose and other senior officials. Irrigation department officials said the pump house, to be set up near the existing BST plant at Kestopur’s Harichand Palli before the next monsoon, will help to drain out excess stormwater from Cantonment canal to upper Bagjola canal and will help in preventing waterlogging in the areas surrounding the airport under Bidhannagar and South Dum Dum municipality. “Once the pump house starts operating, the waterlogging woes of a large area of Bidhannagar and South Dum Dum municipality is expected to be resolved to a large extent. There are plans to set up more such new drainage pumping stations,” said Mahapatra. A large area of Bidhannagar, Rajarhat and New Town was flooded following heavy rains in September due to the overflowing Bagjola, Kestopur and other linking canals. Civic officials said a masterplan was also being prepared for the Rajarhat drainage system. The irrigation department, meanwhile, is taking up major work of excavation, desilting and embankment rising work of the Bagjola canal stretch from January. Also funded by Hidco, the state public health engineering (PHE) department is setting up a 12 lakh litre per hour water discharge capacity drainage pumping station at New Town opposite City Centre II mall that will solve the recurring waterlogging problem of a huge area from Haldiram junction on VIP Road, Chinar Park, and a huge part of Rajarhat falling under Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) to a large extent. In the last administrative review meeting of North 24 Parganas district held last month, Rajarhat Gopalpur MLA Aditi Munshi had raised the waterlogging problem issue in her constituency. There were three canals, lower, upper Bagjola and Dum Dum canal into which the stormwater from the airport runway gets drained out, causing waterlogging during heavy rains. According to the CM’s instructions, a proposal was sent to the irrigation department for dredging and desilting the canals and to increase its capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-drainage-pumping-station-at-kestopur/articleshow/88419563.cms||Suman Chakraborti

On Tuesday, Raje paid a visit to martyr squadron leader Kuldeep Singh Rao at his native village Ghardana who was killed in a chopper crash along with CDS General Bipin Rawat.

The action sows Kolhapur jaggery that had received geographical indication (GI) tag in 2014 is not immune to adulteration and if it continues rampantly then the Made-in-Kolhapur jaggery may loose it sheen in near future. Mohan Kembalkar, assistant commissioner FDA Kolhapur, said, “We have seized adulterated jaggery from Padali, Vandur and Chikali during random inspection. Around 5,000 kg of adulterated jaggery along with 11,384 kg of sugar has been seized. The total worth of produce seized is around Rs 5.25 lakh. We have sent the samples for further chemical analysis. The jaggery must be produced from cane juice only and no use of sugar is permitted as per food safety standards.” The FDA officials claimed that while use of sugar in making jaggery is prohibited, the sugar used increases the sulphur content beyond the permissible limit of 70 parts per million (ppm). “Sugar is made by excess sulphitation, the process of adding sulphur dioxide gas to purify cane juice. When it is used in jaggery making, the final produce will definitely have more sulphur content which is another violation of food safety standards,” said Kembalkar. The jaggery makers from Kolhapur district have welcomed the action. The farmers making jaggery tend to use sugar to make a profitable margin and speed up the process of jaggery making. The sugar is sold at Rs 30 per kg while jaggery fetches more than Rs 40 per kg. Vikram Patil, a jaggery expert, said, “Most of the times, the cane does not mature to produce enough sugar and such cane is used to make jaggery. To increase its sweetness sugar is added.Producing genuine Kolhapuri Jaggery is a tedious task.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/fda-seizes-5000-kg-of-adulterated-jaggery/articleshow/88418780.cms||Abhijeet Patil

The OR is the amount of money the railways spends to earn every Rs 100. A higher ratio indicates poorer ability to generate surplus. The report that was tabled in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday said against the target of 95% OR in the budget estimate, it was 98.36% in 2019-20. “The OR deteriorated from 97.29% in 2018-19 to 98.36% in 2019-20. Further, the OR of the Indian Railways would have been 114.35% instead of 98.36%, if the actual expenditure on pension payments was taken into account. Thus, the OR of 98.36% shown by the Railways does not reflect the true financial performance of the Railways,” the report said. The latest CAG report said the net surplus of Indian Railways was Rs 1,589.60 crore in 2019-20, as compared to nearly Rs 3,774 crore in 2018-19. It said the national transporter would in fact, have ended up with a negative balance of Rs 26,328 crore instead of surplus of Rs 1,589.60, had the actual amount of Rs 48,626 crore required to meet the expenditure on pension payments of zonal railways been appropriated to the Pension Fund instead of Rs 20,708 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cag-exposes-railways-effort-to-jive-report-on-financial-health/articleshow/88421365.cms||Dipak K Dash

Referring to a notification issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which extended the last date of submission for MPhil dissertation and PhD thesis to June 30 next year, the JNU administration said, “The UGC circular has no mention of extension of hostel facilities to these MPhil, MTech or PhD students.” It added that the present vacancies at the hostels were not sufficient to accommodate students of BA programmes who took admission in the year 2020 and all those students, across programmes, for the academic year 2021-22. “…Only need-based extension of hostel accommodation duly approved by the supervisor and chairperson of the concerned special centre or dean of the concerned school, may be considered for these students for the limited time, as a special case,” the notification read. “The extension for hostel accommodation will be granted by the dean of students for a limited period on a case to case basis,” the notification added. JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU), however, termed the circular as “anti-students.” Aishe Ghosh, president of JNUSU, said, “The hostel crisis in the university can’t be linked and blamed on research scholars availing extension. Secondly, why has the construction of new hostels been delayed by the JNU administration?” “The administration should prioritise its responsibility of calling back students and addressing the hostel crisis,” Ghosh added. A senior official of the university administration said that there was a shortfall of around 1,500 seats in the hostels due to which the varsity was unable to accommodate new students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/not-sufficient-hostels-for-all-students-jnu/articleshow/88420125.cms||---

Tiwari said that after finding out about the minor girl from the dance teacher, he questioned her with the assistance of a female constable. “Then the teenage girl apprised them that her dance teacher had misbehaved with her and made her obscene videos and photos. He used to ask for money from her and was threatening to defame her by making her videos and pictures viral if she did not give him the money. Out of fear, she transferred money from her father’s mobile through UPI,” he said and added, “We have arrested the dance teacher and sent him to jail on Monday.

With Christmas around the corner, decorative lamps, lanterns and Christmas trees have been put up in houses, churches and shops. The members of the Christian community are gearing up for the festivities. Christmas merchandise, including artificial Christmas trees, decorative lamps, soft toys of Santa Claus, Santa caps, bells, Christmas baubles and other Christmas ornaments has flooded the shops, as shopkeepers are hoping for a better season of sale.  “Last year due to Covid outbreak, the shopkeepers kept only selected items for the season as many were not spending on these items due to Covid related illness, unfortunate deaths of family members and also financial problems. But now the situation has improved,” said Aniket Sathe, a shopkeeper in Nashik Road. With almost no restrictions, few Covid cases and better vaccination coverage in the district, people have become confident of celebrating the festivals safely and hence more people are going to the markets to buy goods, even as public gatherings are not allowed. “This year’s celebration will be with family, specifically because public events are still not allowed. We will not miss a chance to celebrate Christmas this year. We have our relatives coming down from Dubai for the season,” said Sophia Augustine, a resident of Nashik Road. “The Christian community will be celebrating the festival this year on a large scale. The business is almost the same as it was during pre-Covid times. The sale is much higher than the last year when people hardly came out and there were strict restrictions on the movement of the people,” Hitesh Patel, a cloth merchant, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rush-in-city-markets-ahead-of-christmas/articleshow/88418790.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Court to look into legality of trading in cryptocurrency||NEW DELHI: In a first-of-its-kind case, a court has agreed to examine the legality of “derivative trading” in cryptocurrency. It was hearing a complaint filed against an overseas entity for allegedly carrying out business activities in derivative trading in cryptocurrency in India illegally through its website and mobile application. Trading in derivatives such as stocks, shares and currencies is legal in India, provided it is carried out on a recognised stock exchange or a recognised market association by an entity registered and incorporated in India, and there is actual physical delivery of goods. The court has issued notice to the company on the complaint, filed through advocate Nipun Saxena, that said the petitioner had transferred money into the digital wallet maintained with the company’s website to trade in cryptocurrencies. The petitioner carried out various transactions for different cryptocurrencies only to realise that the trading was based on speculation and that no actual delivery was made to him. “There was a huge disparity in the value of a cryptocurrency that was reflected on the website and the actual value of the same cryptocurrency on reliable platforms/official websites,” the complaint claimed. The complaint has sought a declaration that such a business activity without obtaining necessary statutory approvals in India is illegal and that various transactions and agreements dealing with derivative trading are barred under Indian Contract Law. The company argued that no registration or regulatory licence was required to offer services in India. The petitioner also sought that the company be restrained from hosting or offering or broadcasting its website in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-to-look-into-legality-of-trading-in-cryptocurrency/articleshow/88420134.cms||---

The hero of the match was Himachal’s opener PS Chopra who scored 99 runs and played a significant role in the victory. It was his bad luck that he missed his century by just one run. UP, putting into bat, scored 207 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in 50 overs. They were in a precarious state losing 4 wickets for just 39 runs. Akshadeep Nath and Rinku Singh stemmed the rot.

Their partnership broke when Akshadeep Nath fell prey to Sidharth Sharma for 32. Rinku Singh once again pulled the UP’s innings and he scored 76 runs in 102 balls before handing over a catch to AP Vashisht of PP Jaiswal. He sent the ball six times to the fence. Bhuwaneshwar Kumar also played a fine knock of 46 runs in 52 balls plundering one six and 3 boundaries. RR Dhawan claimed his wicket when he holed his defence and uprooted his stump. Galetia picked 3 wickets for 19 runs. Sidharth Sharma and PP Jaiswal scalped 2 wickets each. SG Arora and PS Chopra gave a moderate start to Himachal adding 54 runs in their partnership. Thereafter Chopra and NR Gangta executed a 122 runs partnership for the second wicket. Ankit Rajpoot claimed Gangta for 58 and broke their partnership but by that time Himachal needed just 33 runs.

The audit report based on a sample study of 29 premium properties in Delhi including some five star hotels and schools, which was presented to the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, found that the L&DO had sent demand letters to them seeking payment of Rs 326.5 crore between June 1977 and December 2019, but it received a meagre Rs 1.4 crore. The audit also found that in 19 of these 29 sample cases, dues towards damage, misuse and interest amounting to Rs 444 crore were outstanding. The CAG audit also found that in four cases the lessee had sold the properties. It observed that the L&DO has so far not issued any specific instructions to sub-registrar offices that the properties under the control of L&DO should not be registered without its permission. In the absence of such instructions, the sub-registrar offices would not be in a position to identify the properties belonging to L&DO for registration purposes. According to the report, as per lease agreements, after every transfer of the lease rights, lessee has to intimate the same to the lessor. But the audit observed that in five out of 29 sampled properties, lessee sold/ transferred the lease rights to other person without prior permission of L&DO. The landowning authority neither took any action to get the property vacated from the unauthorized occupants nor initiated action for re-entry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-failed-to-recover-99-6-of-dues-from-leaseholders-of-land/articleshow/88420138.cms||Dipak K Dash

The drive caught limelight on Tuesday with the sealing of the prominent National Plaza in the posh Alkapuri area. Officials of the fire department had earlier sealed buildings in the old city and Sayajigunj areas. On Saturday, Profit Center complex located in Sayajigunj was sealed. This was followed by the Citadel Complex near Gandhi Nagargruh as well as Navrang Complex in Raopura.  Tuesday’s drive, however, focussed on much bigger complexes. The department sealed National Plaza in Alkapuri and the Silverline Complex in Sayajigunj. While other complexes did not have prominent establishments, National Plaza has several famous showrooms. In the festive and marriage season, the complex remains busy with hundreds visiting it for shopping. In-charge chief fire officer Parth Brahmbatt said that around 3,500 complexes and individual units in the city had been issued notices by the department. Several of these had complied with the notice and taken care of the shortfalls in the fire safety sytems there.  Brahmbhatt said that the focus was currently on 11 large commercial buildings and 23 such buildings having mixed use. Many of these buildings have been violating norms since years now and have not paid heed to repeated notices. The civic body too is not in a position to take any drastic steps in this regard. These buildings also have full or high occupation.  In all the five buildings sealed so far have 325 units in them. The VMC has swung into action after the intervention of Gujarat high court that is hearing a public interest litigation on fire safety.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/five-complexes-sans-fire-safety-sealed-in-vadodara/articleshow/88418948.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh tops e-transaction list of 8 years in country, Gujarat second||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has topped the chart in the country in terms of volume of e-transactions. As per the data obtained from the Union ministry of electronics and information technology’s ‘eTaal’ platform, Andhra Pradesh recorded 710 crore e-transactions since 2013, the highest among all the states in the country.  Gujarat occupies the second place with 509 crore transactions and Telangana stands in the third place with about 470 crore transactions. These three are followed by Kerala (440 crore) and Uttar Pradesh (332 crore)  These transactions include online tax payments, services delivered under the public distribution system, utility bill payments, banking transactions, commercial taxes, scholarship distribution, police services, etc.  The ministry of electronics and information technology launched the platform in 2014 to aggregate the number of e-services being delivered across different states and levels of government.  The unprecedented growth in the e-transactions in the country can be gauged from the fact the volume has increased to 8,583 crore transactions in 2021 from just 241 crore in 2013. Likewise, Andhra Pradesh recorded a manifold growth from 43 crore transactions in 2013 to 188 crore in 2018. But it has been on a downward spiral in the last three years with it recording only 92 crore transactions in 2019, 74 crore in 2020 and 48 crore in 2021. However, the state still commands the top place among all the states in the country in terms of transactions since 2013. The top-10 e-services that have propelled the e-transaction growth in Andhra Pradesh include utility payments, rural development, public distribution system, land revenue, commercial taxes, health, education, etc. According to the officials, Andhra Pradesh is providing a huge number of online services to its people, thereby contributing to the increase in the number of online transactions. The ‘eTaal’ has been in nation-wide operation since January 2013 and 4,013 eServices from tens of Central ministries, and all the states and Union Territories have been linked to the dashboard. It has so far recorded over 8,583 crore e-transactions in 2021. This reflects the government-wide acceptability of the initiative in terms of its utility and importance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-tops-e-transaction-list-of-8-yrs-in-country/articleshow/88418843.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Looking at the parents’ panic, especially among the ones having school-going children, of sending their wards to school, or getting them tested for Covid, paediatricians are assuring them that children are most likely not to suffer from severe complications owing to Covid, as far as the Delta variant is concerned. Even for Omicron, they say it may be the same though cases of Omicron infection among children at present are nil. Children below 18 years of age in India have not been inoculated with Covid vaccine so far. According to doctors, children who got infected in the first and second wave too had mild symptoms. Senior paediatrician Dr Jay Dhirwani told TOI, “Like adults, those children having co-morbid conditions like obesity or other health problems, need to be more careful. Looking at the experiences of the first and second wave of coronavirus, very few children suffered from severe conditions. Kids also suffered from MIS-C post-Covid, but now doctors have been sensitized about it and they will diagnose this disease at an early stage.” According to doctors, with many children suffering from seasonal cold, cough and fever owing to the winter now, the parents are sceptical about sending them for Covid testing. It becomes difficult for doctors to convince such parents to get their children tested, especially in cases where the children do not have any travel history. Associate professor of paediatrics at M P Shah medical college, Jamnagar, Dr Maulik Shah said, “Parents do not need to fear from school kids getting infected with Covid. Going by data, healthy children have not shown serious symptoms or complications till date. Most of them remain asymptomatic or just have mild symptoms.” Dr Shah further said that even in the case of Omicron variant, deaths among children will be uncommon except in high risk cases and advises against closing down schools out of fear. Dr Divynag Bhimani, Rajkot-based paediatrician said, “The Delta variant was mild for children, and we did not come across many critical cases among paediatric patients in the second wave. However, we do not have enough information about the new Omicron variant. We should be careful, especially when schools have reopened and this population (school-going children) is unvaccinated.” Dr Praful Kamani, president of Indian Medical Association, Rajkot said, “Those children suffering from allergic asthma, type 1 diabetes, thalassaemia major, malnutrition, obesity or genetic diseases need to be extra careful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/covid-recovery-in-children-faster/articleshow/88418875.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Lucknow||Irani asks Scindia to sort out RGNAU’s anomalies||Lucknow: Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani, who is the BJP MP from Amethi, has written to Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia seeking his intervention in sorting out issues at the Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University in Amethi. Taking cognizance of a letter written by employees’ union of the aviation university to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Irani has sought action as per rules against defaulters. The employees have pointed out anomalies that have put the university in turmoil. The seven-page letter by the union highlights how the university is running without permanent administrators. As per the university’s Act, the first chancellor and vice-chancellor of RGNAU will be appointed by the President of India for a five-year term each. Though the university was established in 2013, the first VC Air Vice-Marshal (Retd) Nalin Tandon took over on July 1, 1016. Tandon resigned in November 2019 and the charge was given to joint secretary, civil aviation ministry, Amber Dubey. Dubey continues to be the acting VC and a RTI document issued in August (a copy of which is with TOI) states that the process of selection of a full-time VC is underway and that the approval of the visitor (President in case of RGNAU) is awaited. University’s first registrar Jitendra Singh joined RGNAU in April 2019 and was sacked on January 8, 2020. The HC after a special appeal from the government cited his termination as illegal and remitted his matter to the university asking authorities to pass a fresh order within two months. Later, civil aviation ministry’s director Garima Singh was given the charge of registrar. With her recent transfer from the department, there is no acting registrar, too. Besides, no replacement is finalised for finance officer Santosh Kumar who passed away this year. Further, the university has till now not recruited any teacher and those taking classes are being outsourced from certain agencies. Head of employees’ union at RGNAU Nagesh Singh said, “We are thankful to our MP for raising our problems with the civil aviation minister.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/irani-asks-scindia-to-sort-out-rgnaus-anomalies/articleshow/88420666.cms||Isha Jain
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SSC, HSC exam 30-minutes longer as writing habit lost in e-class||MUMBAI: As students are struggling to return to their normal writing speed in the pandemic, the Maharashtra State Board of Education has decided to give extra time for SSC and HSC theory exams. Students will get an extra half hour for the 70-80-100-mark question paper and 15 minutes more for the 40-50-60-mark paper in the board exams. Instead of the usual 11am schedule, exams will start at 10.30am this year. A detailed exam schedule was released by the board on Tuesday. “Since students have been attending online classes, they have lost the practice of speed writing. Based on feedback from schools, the board has decided to give extra time for attempting papers,” said Sharad Gosavi, state board chairman, adding they had relaxed the duration even in March 2021, but exams were never conducted on account of the second wave of the pandemic. After schools started reopening, many students faced difficulties in writing with an adequate speed and with accuracy. “The exams were also conducted online for almost two years and most times in the MCQ (multiple choice questions) format. Many are unable to hold the pen for a longer time. This trend, though, could prove detrimental to students appearing for the board exams,” said a teacher. Saba Patel, principal, Anjuman-I-Islam School at Bandra, said in a written physical test conducted recently at her school, several SSC students got single-digit scores. “Students are taking longer to write a handful of sentences and even then, they are making mistakes,” she said. Parent representative Sudha Shenoy said students have not used pen and paper for almost two years. “The state government’s initiative to give extra time will definitely help students to some extent,” she said. Meanwhile, after the schedule was released, teachers have raised concerns about the exam dates clashing with the corporation and zilla parishad elections. “Teachers are deputed on election duty. How are they expected to conduct the exams if they are simultaneously deputed for training and other election-related work?” asked Rajesh Pandya from the Teachers’ Democratic Front.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ssc-hsc-exam-30-min-longer-as-writing-habit-lost-in-e-class/articleshow/88421100.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Delhi||How Delhi is prepping for 1,000 plus daily Covid cases||NEW DELHI: With the number of Covid-19 cases and positivity rate rising inexorably and with the Omicron variant a menacing threat, Delhi government has started strengthening its home isolation programme for individual who may only have mild symptoms or who remain asymptomatic even after testing positive for the infection. A private service provider will be engaged to deal with a possible 1,200 new cases a day for the next three months. On Monday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that after discussion with experts, the government had concluded that there was no need to panic about the Omicron variant but that home isolation would be required in substantial measure in the probable third wave of Covid infections. large. “We have decided to enhance and bolster our home isolation programme,” Kejriwal said after attending a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Monday. The CM is going to review the home isolation programme on December 23. Delhi government will focus on stepping up enforcement drives in public places though it has made arrangements for an adequate number of hospital beds equipped with oxygen supply. The department of health and family welfare has started the process of engaging service providers for Covid patient management. According to the notice inviting the tender, the estimated cost of the project is approximately Rs 2.5 crore for three months at an average of 1,200 new positive patients every day with approximately two-third of them in home isolation during the contract period. The agency will facilitate the management of symptomatic but mild Covid patients at home after obtaining valid consent by calling them first. The service provider will complement Delhi government in its measures to manage health outcomes of an increasingly large number of low-risk Covid patients at home. The contracted agency’s medical tele-callers will contact patients in home isolation once daily and record their vitals and health parameters. A separate list of patients reporting more than 100-degree Fahrenheit temperature or oxygen saturation level below 94% will be maintained. If some patients do not cooperate, the agency will provide their details and they will be shifted to Covid care centres. If a patient develops symptoms that require hospitalisation, the case will be immediately reported to the designated authority for immediate action. From less than 20 new additions per day, the number of fresh home isolation patients crossed 30 in mid-December and reached a high of 64 on Sunday. On Tuesday, 62 home isolation patients were added and the number of active patients reached 557, up from 286 on December 1. Delhi government provides free oximeters to patients recovering from Covid at home isolation. On average, 2.6 oximeters provided to patients by district authorities between December 1 and 17, December 18 onwards, nearly 10 oximeters are being distributed every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-delhi-is-prepping-for-1k-daily-cases/articleshow/88420213.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic polls: 100% success rate, all in the family||KOLKATA: For three families in Kolkata, it was a moment of collective joy as the results of the civic polls were announced on Tuesday. For Tarak Singh, the Trinamool candidate of ward 118, his victory turned sweeter with the news of his son Amit getting elected from ward 117 and his daughter from ward 116. Earlier, Singh was the councillor of ward 116 and when it got reserved for women, his daughter Krishna was nominated in the ward. Singh, for whom this was the third victory in a row, said: “We three are KMC councillors since 2018. We got elected not only because we are from the same family, but all three have been serving people amid the pandemic and that is our USP,” he said. “Amit, an MBA, is proactive in politics and social work. He was selected as the candidate in the bypoll in 2018 from ward 117. However, my eldest son Abhishek is not keen on politics though he helps me,” he said. Amit and Krishna said they try to follow their father’s advice. For busy advocate Baiswanor Chatterjee, managing politics, household and profession is a tough balancing act and this time, both he and his wife Chaitali have won the elections. They now have a new councillor couple status, which earlier, in 2010, his party colleagues Ram Pyare Ram and his wife Hema Ram had enjoyed. Chatterjee, who was a popular student union leader and had reached the top of Chattra Parishad, became the councillor for the first time in 2005 and again won in 2015. This time, he was elected from ward 91 and his wife from ward 90 in south Kolkata. Married in 1994, the Chatterjees had been active in politics for long and Chaitali too had followed her husband in the political circles. She is now the South Kolkata Trinamool Congress Women’s Wing head and had won a civic poll for the first time in 2010. However, it was a different scene in the Metiabruz area where Shamsuzzamman Ansari, who has won for the seventh time in a row since 1990 from ward 136, was not keen to click a picture with her daughter-in-law Rubina Naaz, who won from ward 135 as an independent. “She should join Trinamool first, before clicking a picture with me.” Rubina was not in two minds as she said that she was going to join Trinamool any moment. “My husband Tabrez Ansari had held talks with our ex-mayor Firhad Hakim on this issue and I will join Trinamool soon. I won as a Trinamool candidate in 2010 from ward 135, but I lost in 2015. This time, as I was not given the ticket, local people urged me to contest as an independent and it proved successful. My father-in-law guided me when I had joined politics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/100-success-rate-all-in-the-family/articleshow/88419626.cms||Debashis Konar

Addressing a gathering during Jan Vishwas Yatra in Mau, Pradhan said, “The previous governments in UP only liked middlemen, terrorists, goons, and mafia but none of these is important for our double engine government. The Yogi government has been working for the poor, backward, Dalits and underprivileged.” The BJP government started transferring funds directly into the Jan Dhan accounts of the beneficiaries of various schemes, besides providing electricity and cooking gas connections and free food grains, the Union minister added. Pradhan also lauded the Yogi government for empowering women in the state and taking care of their safety. “People of the state understand what would have happened if there was no BJP government in the state. During the peak of the pandemic, when the poor and deprived were in trouble, ‘some powerful people’ of Delhi and UP living in palaces for generations did not come out,” he said. He said some leaders who do politics in the name of poor and backward did nothing for them, built their own palaces instead and nurtured their near and dear ones. “Similar system would have continued in the state if BJP had not come to power in 2017,” he said, adding that the double ration being provided to the poor would have been robbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pradhan-sp-upset-with-mafia-in-jail-finds-yogi-unupyogi/articleshow/88420673.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The high court had earlier directed the SP to file a report on the entire incident. As the report submitted by the SP did not contain the details as asked for, the high court summoned him for personal appearance. On Tuesday, Fakeerappa appeared before the high court. Justice D Ramesh posed a series of questions. He expressed displeasure over the SP for filing the report by simply attaching the report given by the investigation officer. . Justice Ramesh asked Fakeerappa to explain what was the case registered against the petitioners and why the police conducted searches in their homes including in the kitchens. He went on to say whether the SP saw the report he sent to the high court or not. He directed him to conduct a fresh enquiry and file a report within two weeks. Anantapur police had booked four women TDP workers for allegedly making abusive comments against the chief minister and his family members. Later, the police searched the houses of TDP workers who moved the high court seeking anticipatory bail. The high court expressed anger over the police for searching the houses in the case registered and granted bail to the party workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-pulls-up-sp-grants-bail-to-tdp-workers/articleshow/88418881.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The high court had earlier directed the State Election Commission to allow Srinivas to cast his vote as ex-officio member but not to declare the result pending disposal of the petition. Srinivas moved the high court contending that the returning officer of Kondapalli municipality was not accepting his representation to recognise him as ex-officio member. He said that though multiple representations were made to the commissioner but availed no reply from him. He said that the commissioner was restricting him from casting his vote to elect chairman and vice-chairmans to the municipality. Considering his arguments, the high court passed interim orders allowing him to vote but directed the SEC not to declare the result pending disposal of the petition to decide whether his vote was valid or not. Arguing on behalf of municipality and the election officer, G Shivaji told the high court that Srinivas has already opted Vijayawada municipal corporation to be an ex-officio member and he cannot become ex-officio member in other civic body. He said though being a member of parliament, he can participate in any meeting of the civic body within his constituency. He does not have voting rights in those civic bodies other than the one he opted to be an ex-officio member, he said. As the counsel for Srinivas and additional advocate general for the state government were not available on Tuesday, the high court posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/suspense-over-kondapalli-on/articleshow/88418893.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Rajkot||Junagadh firm loses Rs Rs 49L in cyber fraud||Rajkot: Junagadh police busted a gang involved in committing cyber fraud with big companies and siphoning off huge amounts from the firms’ bank accounts. The gang from West Bengal had recently transferred Rs 49 lakh from the bank account of a Junagadh-based company. The cyber crime cell of Junagadh police received a complaint from the owner of a ball bearing company in GIDC about the fraud on December 5. In his complaint, Hitesh Solanki said that the company was maintaining a current account in a private bank. The accused gang secured the net banking ID and password of this company and also used the owner’s fake Aadhaar card to buy a duplicate SIM card to get the OTP (one time password) during transaction. The gang, thereafter, transferred Rs 49 lakh in three different bank accounts initiating eight RTGS transactions using the netbanking credentials. This amount was later transferred in 12 other bank accounts and withdrawn by using ATM cards and self withdrawal cheques from the banks’ branches in West Bengal. Junagadh SP, Ravi Teja Vasamsetty told TOI, “They sent a person of similar appearance to the store of a telecom company to issue a duplicate SIM card on fake Aadhaar details. They transferred the amount to the bank accounts at different locations; most of them being in West Bengal and some in Delhi.” A team of Junagadh police went to West Bengal and arrested Suklal Talukdar and Basudeb Bacchar in whose accounts a portion of the fraud amount had been transferred. They used to get a commission of Rs 2,000 per one lakh rupees to allow their accounts to be used. However, the mastermind of the fraud is still at large, said cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/junagadh-firm-loses-rs-rs-49l-in-cyber-fraud/articleshow/88418903.cms||---

---||Surat||Experts warn against letting guard down against Omicron||Surat: “There are two theories on the Omicron variant — one stating that it may not be as fatal as Delta and the second one is that it may prove otherwise as infection spreads. I believe that though it is more like a common cold at present, people need to be more alert and cautious at this stage itself,” Dr Samir Gami, a pulmonologist told TOI. Experts, who are monitoring the Covid situation closely, recalled the deceptive calm of the pre-second wave period, and fear that the current Omicron variant situation can prove to be just an illusion. Doctors claim that even in the killer second wave, the overall scenario was calm before the Delta variant spread its lethal tentacles. “Initial patients of Delta variant did not have severe infection or showed symptoms. There were no deaths as well, but as infected persons increased the entire scenario turned out to be horrible,” said a health official in Surat Municipal Corporation. Teams of SMC’s health department are closely monitoring the situation and at present tracking each positive patient aggressively. “It is required that people take it seriously though the severity of the infection is not much. We need to be alert to prevent the spread of infection,” said the official. Meanwhile, government hospitals have prepared for the possible rise in the number of infected persons. Currently only four Covid-19 patients are admitted in New Civil Hospital (NCH) but two floors with a total 60 beds are kept ready. “The major reason for concern is fully vaccinated persons are also getting infected with the variant. The situation was similar before the second wave when first cases of Delta variant were reported,” associate professor in the medicine department at NCH, Dr Ashvin Vasava, told TOI. With the start of the spread of the Delta variant many patients recovered at home without medication. However, the spread of the infection was quick. “We have better hospital facilities and are fully prepared. But persons with co-morbidity are required to be careful. People need to act responsibly to prevent a second wave-like situation,” added Vasava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/experts-warn-against-letting-guard-down-against-omicron/articleshow/88419102.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Lucknow||Mulayam Singh Yadav-RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat photo-op sparks twitter war||LUCKNOW: A high-voltage war of words erupted between Congress and Samajwadi Party on Tuesday, a day after the photograph of a ‘meeting’ between SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat went viral. The photograph shared by Union minister of state, Arjuna Ram Meghwal, shows Bhagwat and Mulayam in a huddle, purportedly at an event organised in the official residence of Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu. The UP Congress was quick to take to twitter, saying — “Nayi Sapa mein ‘Sa’ ka matlab Sanghwaad hai (The S in new SP means Sanghwaad)”. On Tuesday, SP shot back saying Congress has forgotten political decency. “In the same programme, leaders of NCP, an ally of Congress, also took ‘aashirwad’ (blessings) from Netaji. What will Congress say on this,” the party tweeted. UP Congress too returned the favour, tweeting: “Thank You @samajwadiparty! We just wanted to know this. SP has accepted that Respected Mulayam Singh Yadav has taken blessings from RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.” BJP swiftly gathered ammo to flare up the row with a tweet — “Tasveer bahut kuch bolti hai” (The photograph says it all). Experts said, Mulayam’s meeting with Bhagwat could potentially trigger mistrust among SP’s core voters, ostensibly Muslims, who have been siding with SP after 1990 firing on karsewaks in Ayodhya, which earned the then UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav the sobriquet of ‘Mullah Mulayam’. Experts said, Mulayam’s picture with Bhagwat may cloud loyalty of Muslims, who might seek an alternate political abode, essentially Mayawati-led BSP or Congress, which desperately needs a resurrection in poll-bound UP. This could also trigger a multi-corner electoral battle, in what may eventually dent Akhliesh Yadav-led SP which has managed to position itself against the BJP to stall it from returning to office in 2022. Sources said, SP ranks were quick to grasp the situation. The party, unsurprisingly, shot back at BJP: “Tasveer Kuch Bolti hai aur ye raaz kholti hai ki koi batane aaye they...anupyogi jaane wale hain aur bicyclewale aane wale hain” (The picture means someone is telling that “useless” (SP’s remark at CM Yogi Adityanath) will be ousted and SP will be storming to power).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mulayam-bhagwat-photo-op-sparks-twitter-war/articleshow/88420679.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Upper caste students refuse midday meal cooked by Dalit woman; authorities term appointment 'illegal'||PITHORAGARH: The appointment of a Dalit woman as a bhojanmata (cook) at Government Inter College in Sukhidhang, Champawat district created such a furore that upper caste students boycotted the midday meal. On learning about the issue, the chief education officer reached the school and termed the appointment 'illegal'. The school has 230 students. Forty out of 66 students studying in classes XI-XII belong to the upper caste. The woman joined on December 13. The very next day, students refused to eat the meal. The school has two posts of bhojanmata. The one who worked earlier, Shakuntala Devi, retired a few months ago. On the row sparked by the issue, the parent teachers’ association alleged that the principal and management violated rules while making the appointment. At first, the association selected one Pushpa Bhatt but later the school management committee and principal appointed the Dalit woman. RC Purohit, chief education officer, Champawat, said, “On Tuesday, a meeting was held, which was attended by members of the parent teachers’ association, gram pradhan, block development committee member, and the school management committee. The case was scrutinised.” He added that the administration gave a job advertisement and six women applied for the post. Rules say that after the selection of a bhojanmata, approval from a sub-education officer is a must. However, in Sunita Devi’s case, no such approval was sought, which is in violation of rules. The appointment was therefore cancelled, said Purohit. An advertisement will be published soon and all women can apply, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/upper-caste-students-refuse-midday-meal-cooked-by-dalit-woman-authorities-term-appointment-illegal/articleshow/88418908.cms||Prem Punetha

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Film producer held by police SIT in Rs 13.7 cr cheating case||MUMBAI: The Special Investigation team (SIT) of Mumbai police, formed to probe all cheating-related offences against the construction firm Kamla Landmarc, on Monday arrested film producer Parag Sanghvi in a case of cheating an investor of Rs 13.74 crore. Sanghvi is one of the partners in a construction firm with Jitendra Jain, who is director of Kamla Landmarc. Sanghvi is a film producer who has made home productions such as ‘Partner,’ ‘Bhoot Returns,’ ‘Ab Tak Chappan’ and ‘The attacks of 26/11.’ In September, he was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. Sanghvi, who is chief executive officer (CEO) of Alumbra Entertainment Pvt Ltd, has been booked for cheating, forgery, breach of criminal trust and criminal conspiracy. Jitendra Jain was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in 2016 for allegedly cheating home buyers and later there were multiple FIRs registered against him and his company; since then, he has been languishing in jail. In the fresh FIR, the complainant, Sujal Developers, has alleged that Sanghvi, Jain, and their other partners conspired with each other and duped him of his three commercial properties to the tune of Rs 13.74 crore. In 2013, the complainant had purchased three commercial units from Jain’s two construction companies, Kamla Landmarc Infra and Kamla Landmarc Properties – in the latter’s commercial building on 36 Turner Road, Bandra, for Rs 10.49 crore, with registered agreements. While one unit was in A wing 502, the two other units, 501 and 505, were in B wing. “At the time of purchase, Jain had offered the complainant handsome rent for these units. An 11-month leave and license agreement for three units was signed between the complainant and Jain’s own sister companies, Alumbra Enterprises and Media Limited and Metallica Industries,” said an officer. Unit 501 and 505 was given on lease to Metalica Industries in which Jain, Ketan Shah, Saurabh Vashist are directors, and 501 in A wing was given to Alumbra Entertainment and Media, in which Jain, Sanghvi and Gopal Dalvi are directors. Initially the complainant received rentals for around one year, but later it stopped. He then approached Jain, who gave him vague reasons.

---||India||Rajiv ‘father of lynching’: BJP hits back at Rahul||NEW DELHI: BJP on Tuesday said Congress has no moral right to talk about mob lynching as the biggest incident of lynching in the history of independent India happened during Rajiv Gandhi’s era when thousands of Sikhs were killed. BJP’s reaction came hours after Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Before 2014, the word ‘lynching’ was practically unheard of. #ThankYouModiJi.” 2014 से पहले ‘लिंचिंग’ शब्द सुनने में भी नहीं आता था।Before 2014, the word ‘lynching’ was practically unheard of. #ThankYouModiJi— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1640064669000“I feel Congress has no right to raise questions over lynching. The biggest such incident in the history of independent India under any government occurred during the era of Rajiv Gandhi,” Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat told reporters after Punjab Congress leader Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi joined BJP in Delhi. BJP national spokesperson R P Singh said, “Rahul Gandhi forgets that his father Rajiv Gandhi supported mob lynching of more than 3,000 Sikhs by Congress MPs and workers.” Referring to Rajiv Gandhi’s comment ‘Jab bhi bada ped girta hai, dharti hilti hai, BJP leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa said, “It is true that Rahul Gandhi didn’t hear about lynching before 2014, because they equated the killings of thousands of innocent Sikhs with fall of a big tree.” Quoting Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya said, “Meet Rajiv Gandhi, father of mob lynching, justifying blood curdling genocide of Sikhs.” Don’t act as govt’s agents, Rahul snaps at journalist Asked about the lynching jibe at a media briefing later in the day, Rahul Gandhi snapped at the reporter for asking the question. He said, “Sarkar ki dalali mat karo (Don’t act as agents of the government).” Gandhi apparently lost his cool over posers about BJP’s rebuttal to his claims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajiv-father-of-lynching-bjp-hits-back-at-rahul/articleshow/88421407.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: RTOs record highest bike registrations in November||PUNE: The monthly registration of two-wheelers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad regional transport offices in November was the highest this year. If one looks at the figures (see graphic), a total of 12,751 two-wheelers were registered with the Pune RTO in November — around 14% higher than the registrations in October and January. Similarly, the Pimpri Chinchwad RTO office saw 8,563 registrations in November and they were around 45% more than the registrations in October and around 21% more than that in January. “The registrations of two wheelers have been dismal when it comes to RTO standards for two years now (2020 and 2021). The pandemic has been the main reason for the same as it resulted in multiple lockdowns, which resulted in the closure of all institutions including school, colleges and offices. While it will take more time for the registrations to pick up and reach the pre-pandemic levels, the increase in November has been encouraging. The increase started from October as many relaxations were in place, which resulted in people finding the need to buy two-wheelers,” an official with the Pune RTO said. An official holding a managerial position with a two-wheeler showroom in Pune said the opening of institutions had helped the registrations to pick up. “Many offices and educational institutions have opened up. The major segment of two-wheeler buyers come from this segment. The relaxations have also resulted in many people coming back to Pune again. All these factors contribute in the registrations,” the official said. Another manager of a two-wheeler showroom said that e-bikes were more in demand than the petrol variants. “They are selling at least 20% more than the normal two-wheelers,” the manager said. Amar J Sheth, the chairperson of Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations in Maharashtra, agreed with the dealers. “The opening of many institutions has helped as for the common office going people, two-wheelers are the preferred mode of daily transportation. We expect the same to rise more,” he said. However, dealers said the registrations in December would be low as a majority of buyers wait for the New Year. “With just days left for the New Year, anyone intending to buy a vehicle, will wait till January. This will ensure that they get a 2022 registration. The second-hand sale for such vehicles gets better. Hence, registrations are always low in December,” another dealer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rtos-record-highest-bike-registrations-in-november/articleshow/88419642.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Goa||HC: Speed up Panaji cop station attack case trial||PANAJI: Thirteen years after the attack on the Panaji police station, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the special court of the CBI to expedite the trial where Panaji MLA Atanasio (Babush) Monserrate, his wife and revenue minister Jennifer and former mayors Tony Rodrigues and Uday Madkaikar are among the accused. The high court dismissed the applications of 29 of the 37 accused, including Rodrigues and Madkaikar seeking discharge of the case. Atanasio Monserrate was among the few who didn’t file the application seeking discharge in the high court. “Considering the directions of the Supreme Court to expedite trials involving members of parliament/members of legislative assemblies, the special court in the present case, is directed to expedite the trial,” Justice Manish Pitale said. The court held that the material on record indicates that the applicants-accused don’t deserve to be discharged at this stage itself and that the material on record is enough to indicate that they need to face trial. “It is a different matter that after the trial is concluded and the prosecution has led its evidence, which is tested on cross-examination and also in the light of defence evidence, if any, the applicants-accused persons would be convicted or not,” he said The court held that the CBI’s special court’s order in September 2014 shows that material on record was considered and by applying the position of law concerning the aspects to be taken into consideration at this stage, the special court “correctly held that there was sufficient prima facie material on record to frame charges against the applicants-accused persons for the aforesaid offences”. Additional public prosecutor Mahesh Amonkar appeared for the state (CBI), senior advocate Nitin Sardessai with Vibhav Amonkar, L Raghunandan and senior advocate S G Desai with Pavithran AV appeared for the applicants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-speed-up-panaji-cop-station-attack-case-trial/articleshow/88441239.cms||Lisa Monteiro

Also, another 15 bogus contracts worth Rs68 lakh have come to fore, this time in solid waste management department. The bounced cheques are a shocker for Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC, which was hoping to recover the amount embezzled from it in the Bogus Contracts Scam. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Sakode had submitted cheque of Rs67 lakh when similar amount of bogus contracts were unearthed from health department. NMC recovered the amount as cheque was encashed. Later, bogus contracts of Rs74 lakh and Rs60 lakh came to fore in library, and birth and death registration department respectively.” Sakode had prepared bogus contracts in the name of Shree Ganesh Sai Services, which was owned by another person. Following the expose, the person recovered Rs50 lakh from Sakode and submitted a cheque which was encashed a day ago. At the same time, on December 16, Sakode had submitted four cheques of Rs13 lakh each in the name of his four agencies. These four cheques bounced yesterday, said Joshi. He said Sakode stopped payment from two accounts and there was insufficient money in the other two accounts. “Appropriate action will also be taken for bounce of cheques,” he said. An NMC official said, “Difference between provision given by solid waste management department in its heads, and payment disbursed by accounts and finance department came to fore along the lines of fraud in health, library, and birth and death registration departments. Detailed inquiry revealed solid waste management did not approve 15 contracts of Rs68 lakh to Sakode’s firms.” Sakode had prepared 15 bogus contracts by forging signatures of health department officials and submitted them for release of payment with accounts and finance department. Clerks, Mohan Padwanshi from general administration department, and Sanis Gokhe from projects department, generated bills and approved online on payment module. “Files have been handed over to chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar for confirmation,” he said. This is the first case in the scam where Sakode allegedly prepared bogus contracts under heads of one department but forged signatures of officials of another department. Now, the scam has swelled to Rs4.09 crore. Earlier, bogus contracts of Rs2.07 crore were confirmed from health department, Rs74 lakh from library, and Rs60 lakh from birth and death registration department. Till now, NMC has recovered Rs1.17 crore from the contractor. On Tuesday, a team from Sadar police station again visited the storeroom of NMC situated at Mahal for investigations.

---||Dehradun||Genome sequencing results of 4 suspected Omicron cases awaited||Dehradun: The health authorities of Uttarakhand -- where no Omicron cases have been reported so far -- are awaiting the genome sequencing results of four people who are suspected to be infected with Covid's new highly-transmissible variant. The four suspected patients include -- a national of the United Kingdom, a Yemen national, and an elderly couple from Dehradun. The UK national who arrived in Uttarakhand is suspected to be infected with the Omicron variant. His samples have been sent to Delhi to confirm the diagnosis. Similarly, a citizen of Yemen has also tested positive for Covid-19. His genome sequencing results will ascertain if he has the Omicron variant. Besides, an elderly couple who lives in an apartment in Rajpur Road of Dehradun is suspected to be carrying the variant. The couple likely contracted the infection from their son and his family when they were in Delhi to attend a function from December 9 to 13. The couple's son, his wife and their grandson had come to attend the Delhi event from Qatar. Their samples have also been sent to Delhi for genome sequencing. In the wake of the Omicron threat, testing has been ramped up at the Dehradun's Jolly Grant Airport. However, senior health authorities have expressed concern saying those arriving at the airport are not cooperating and posing problems for the frontline staff members. On Monday, a senior doctor, practicing at a private facility, created a ruckus at the airport when asked to show his RT-PCR report. The doctor didn't cooperate with officials when asked for sampling as well. “We urge everyone who is returning from abroad or any other state of the country to kindly get themselves quarantined voluntarily for at least seven days. On the eighth day, such returnees should get themselves tested for Covid-19 at the nearest health center or simply call the health department's Covid support line and we will provide assistance immediately,” said Dr Rajiv Dixit, Dehradun district’s nodal officer of Covid-19. Meanwhile, 29 fresh cases of Covid-19 and related death surfaced in Uttarakhand on Tuesday. So far, Uttarakhand has recorded a cumulative of 3,44,631 Covid-19 cases 7,415 related deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/genome-sequencing-results-of-4-suspected-omicron-cases-awaited/articleshow/88418930.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Lucknow||Centre should avoid fixing marriage age: AIMPLB||LUCKNOW: The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Tuesday said the Centre should avoid fixing the age of marriage and termed it as interference in personal freedom of an adult. The Board said the government should “refrain” from making such “useless and harmful laws”. The AIMPLB statement comes on the Union Cabinet nod to raise the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years. Marriage is a very important requirement for human life but no age of marriage can be fixed as it is also an issue related to the protection of moral values, said the statement issued by Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, general secretary of AIMPLB. He said it was because of this that no age has been fixed for marriage in many religions, including Islam. “It completely depends on the discretion of the parents. If the guardians of a girl feel their daughter is fit for marriage before the age of 21 and she can fulfill all her responsibilities after marriage, then preventing her from marriage is cruel and also interferes with the personal liberty of an adult,” the statement read. Increasing the age limit for marriage can lead to a possibility where crime many increase in society, it said. The Board said raising the minimum age of marriage of girls and declaring marriage before the prescribed age as illegal is neither in the interest of girls nor the society. Rather it can cause damage to moral values instead. The practice of marrying girls at early age is slowly disappearing but sometimes a situation arises when marrying off a girl before the prescribed age is in her interest, said Rahmani in the statement, which was also tweeted by the Board from its official handle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/centre-should-avoid-fixing-marriage-age/articleshow/88420695.cms||---

The 16-year-old girl allegedly slipped while trying to escape from the gap in the wall meant for a window AC as she feared her mother and sister would scold her since they had discovered she was speaking to a boy on her mobile phone, said the Versova police. “After learning that her family had caught her talking to a boy on the phone, she knotted some sarees for support to run away with a bag filled with clothes through the gap meant for a window AC. But she lost her grip on the sarees and fell,” said the police. “The teen survived as she first fell on an air-conditioning unit on the fourth floor. The AC took the impact of the fall and the teen did not land directly on the ground. This saved her life,” said Versova police senior inspector Siraj Inamdar. Police said they have filed a case of accidental fall and will conduct a probe into it after the girl is medically fit to give her statement to know what exactly led to the incident. The girl, her mother, her elder sister and two cousins live in the flat rented for them by an aunt. “At the time of the incident, the teen’s family members were in another room,” said the police. They learnt about it only when the residents from the lower floors rushed outside on hearing a loud thud and noticed the severely injured girl lying in the duct area. The incident occurred around 9am. Building residents informed her family and rushed her to Cooper Hospital where she is getting treated for the multiple injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-fleeing-teen-falls-from-6th-flr-home-suffers-fractures/articleshow/88421122.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Earlier, 3,371 projects were listed in October, of which 210 received extension, and 200 more projects were added to the list, stated the authorities. The MahaRERA has listed the projects with completion deadlines in 2017, 2018 and 2019 as expired or lapsed. Most of these projects are in Mumbai, Pune, Thane and Raigad. According to the rules, the developers of these projects have been prohibited from selling and marketing the projects before seeking extension of the respective completion date, which will require consent from 51% percent buyers. As per the data, nearly 95 projects exceeded the deadline in 2017, 509 in 2018, 1,107 in 2019 and 994 projects in 2020. Many of these have even failed to meet the extension deadline of one year as per Section 6 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). In November, the developers were told to submit necessary documents to seek extension and continue with the projects. The Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) had put out a list of “expired” projects as the promoters had not applied for extension and not uploaded Form 4 from the architects on the website on completion of the projects. Developers of 99 projects submitted documents after a new circular was issued last month laying out conditions for regulating expired projects. Altogether 286 projects have been directed to seek extension. “As many as 99 projects will be deleted in the next two days from the earlier list of 3,371. Others have been told to apply for extension till their date of occupancy certificate (OC). The names of the projects will be deleted from the ‘expired’ list only if the builders seek extension,” said MahaRERA officials. Representatives from welfare association said that it is good that the authority has flagged such projects as lapsed. This will help flat purchasers to make an effort to complete the project through promoters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharera-lists-3425-projects-as-lapsed-across-state/articleshow/88419653.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He was speaking at The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave on Monday. He is the director general of society of Indian Defence manufacturers (SIDM), which includes 514 private defence manufactures members such as Adani defence system, Tata advance system, Mahindra & Mahindra, Lucknow-based PTC industries which manufactures metal components for critical and super-critical applications for advance world’s fastest supersonic cruise missile Brahmos and also ISRO rockets. "There was opportunity knocking at the door for manufacturing of defence equipment, which was not encouraged in yesteryears for private sectors. UP is very lucky to have defence corridor along with Tamil Nadu. UP has historically industrial eco-system and mindset, therefore it has skilled manpower and academicians for research who would provide technical expertise and feed defence manufacturing industries," he said. Speaking to TOI, he said, "Since 209 items identified by government of India for defence services cannot be imported, six nodes of UP defence corridor such as Aligarh and Lucknow which traditionally have expertise in metallurgy and forging will act as ancillary and feeder industries to make metal components for critical and super-critical applications of missile system and aerospace." "Similarly, Agra and Kanpur have industries for leather, parachute, bullet proof jackets while Jhansi and Chitrakoot would be used for development and testing of ammunition and other equipment because it has a large open area," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/def-manufacturing-holds-key-to-future/articleshow/88420702.cms||---

Until afternoon hours, around 20 employees came back willingly, and more are expected to rejoin by late evening hours on Tuesday. The strike is still going on. But with a major union pulling back, there are chances that it may end soon now,” said an official with the MSRTC Pune division. The strike, which has left MSRTC almost paralyzed, entered its 43rd day in Pune on Tuesday, while it was the 55th day of this protest statewide. On Monday, the Kanishth Sherni ST Karmchari Sangh withdrew from the strike. However, this had little effect on many workers, who said they would continue protesting till their demand is met for a merger of the transport body with the state government. “Altogether, there are 4,275 employees in the Pune division, of which 981 have rejoined work. This number will surely rise in coming days. Currently, the total number of MSRTC buses which have started to function from Pune is 130. With more employees joining, the number of buses will be increased. However, at this moment, it is difficult to make any more comments,” said another official, adding that this strike is the longest to take place in the history of the MSRTC. The state-appointed committee formed to look into grievances of 28 unions had presented its interim report to the Bombay High Court on Monday. While the court expressed concern over the problems students in rural areas were facing, the committee in its interim report said that it had not yet formed any opinion on the merger issue. The state government has been taking strict action in the form of suspensions and dismissal of staffers. “The strike is on in Pune and will continue. As said earlier, until the demand is met, it will not end. Some people might be joining back, but a majority are still on strike,” an employee on strike said. Pune division alone has faced losses of more than Rs51 crore until now. In an earlier talk, Shekhar Channe, vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC, had said show cause notices regarding dismissals would continue to be issued and action will get stricter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/key-union-is-out-but-msrtc-strike-still-on/articleshow/88419660.cms||Joy Sengupta

At a meeting with state leaders in Delhi on Tuesday, Shah reportedly told them that Telangana party unit should work in such a manner that would lead to people of the state demanding an investigation into the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government’s corruption. “Governments and parties are different, but you do whatever it takes to expose the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government and we will do what we can,” he is believed to have told them. The home minister also told them that the state unit should vigorously counter the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s allegations in all aspects. Shah assured them that he would tour the state more frequently and that many central ministers would also be sent to the state on a regular basis. According to sources, the paddy procurement issue in the state will become a hot topic in the coming days as a result of the direction given by Shah and statements made by Union food minister Piyush Goyal. Interestingly, Shah had a 15-minute meeting with Bharatiya Janata Party state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar. Applauding Sanjay’s efforts in ensuring the party’s win in the bypolls in the state, he said more programmes along the lines of Praja Sangrama Yatra should be planned. “We explained the prevailing situation in the state to Shah, who asked us to resume the walkathon immediately. He also asked us to tour the districts two days in a week to expose the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government’s misdeeds,” Sanjay said.

The city, which is implementing door-to-door segregated garbage collection, is now focusing on training the public to compost wet waste at their home.  Citizens’ participation is a significant element in Swacch ranking and VMC lagged behind Vishakapatnam on this front. In a bid to improve this, the VMC is planning to involve the public in initiatives related to cleanliness. Handling the garbage is a major challenge for the civic body. Plastic waste generated in the city is recycled at the unit and wet waste collected through door-to-door service is sent to vermicompost plants and composting unit established at Excel plant. Shifting the garbage to these plants is adding a huge financial burden on the civic body.  In a bid to overcome this, the civic body started training the denizens to compost the garbage generated at their own houses. The civic body is taking the help of TANA, NGOs and local corporates to conduct workshops and training camps in on-site composting.  Venkata Subba Rao Maddukuri. advisor to the vermicompost plants at VMC, conducted a workshop for the denizens at Labbipet in the city. “Everyone today is concerned about their health and giving top priority to organic food.

Addressing poll rallies in the city on Tuesday, he said that the only expertise the saffron party had displayed was in dividing people on the lines of religion and other grounds to divert their attention from the real issues facing the country. He alleged that the “pro rich” policies of the NDA government were harming the poor. He also blamed the policies of the BJP for high rate of inflation, which, he said, had shot up to more than 14%. Such a high rate of inflation was not seen in the country in the last 30 years, he said.

She said that the Congress bestowed ownership rights to people living in slum areas, because of which they could have safe and beautiful houses in Chandigarh. Castigating the BJP over the high inflation rate, she said that the “pro-rich policies of the central government” had ruined the economy. She accused the BJP of trying to sell the country to big business houses and said that the Congress would keep fighting for the rights of people.

Answering a query by AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi, as to whether the government has defined ‘anti-national’ under any legislation or rules or any other legal enactment enforced in the country, MoS (home) Nityanand Rai conceded that the term was indeed not defined by the statute.

---||Lucknow||‘Past govts, cinema ignored heroes of the east, real UP now on screen’||Lucknow: Accusing previous governments of “suppressing and omitting” stories of Uttar Pradesh, especially of Purvanchal heroes and freedom-fighters, actor and Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan said things have changed and people are getting to see the real UP on silver screen. Speaking at the ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organised by the Times of India on Monday, the actor, who claims to have worked in over 650 movies, said: “A well planned conspiracy was hatched by the previous governments to omit the stories of Purvanchal heroes and freedom-fighters who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for the country. Their stories were not mentioned anywhere.” “It was an attempt to demoralize us. We were projected as bhaiyas (musclemen), bhaaji wala (vegetable seller) dhoodh wala (milkmen), thela wala (street cart puller) or kela wala (fruitseller),” he said. The BJP MP said that cinema was immensely popular in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, but nothing concrete was made on Kakori Train Action, Chauri Chaura and other such struggles. “But after Modi regime, things have changed,” he said. Supporting the argument, Ramendra Vashishth, the writer and lyricist of Priyanka Chopra starrer sports drama ‘Mary Kom’, said: “Param Vir Chakra awardee Abdul Hamid (born in Ghazipur district) was the biggest hero of 1965 War. He is in books but his story never found space in cinema. We need to revisit stories and talent.” Film producer Rahul Mittra, known for movies like ‘Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster’, ‘Bullet Raja’ and ‘Revolver Rani’, said it would be ‘gharwapsi’ if homegrown talent was supported. Additional chief secretary, information and chairperson of Uttar Pradesh Film Bandhu, Navneet Sehgal, said: “The upcoming Film City in Noida will definitely provide opportunities for homegrown talent. Currently, nearly 100 movies are being shot in Uttar Pradesh and we have provided incentives to 47 filmmakers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/past-govts-cinema-ignored-heroes-of-the-east-real-up-now-on-screen/articleshow/88420730.cms||Arvind Chauhan

The ED petition has challenged the decision of the ED special court in Hyderabad which set at naught its arrest of Srinivas Rao by refusing to send him in judicial remand. Appearing for the ED, additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy said that they were aggrieved with the action of the trial court. “Metropolitan sessions judge of Hyderabad, who is also the special judge for the ED cases, refused to send Rao in remand. Special agencies like ED and customs and their officials too work like regular cops but they are not bound by the CrPC,” he said. ASG urged the HC to set aside the trial court order and remand the accused. ED’s standing counsel Gadi Praveen Kumar said that Srinivas Rao is accused of embezzlement of funds in Jharkhand. The company is located in Hyderabad and the arrest was effected here.. The case relates to 4-lane road expansion work on National Highway-33 from Ranchi to Jamshedpur entrusted in December 2012 to Madhucon Projects Ltd of TRS MP Nama Nageswara Rao. Madhucon floated a special purpose vehicle REL for completing this work. It availed huge loans from banks but did not show any work progress till 2017. Following a report from Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) which concluded that Madhucon and REL diverted Rs 264 crore NHAI funds without doing any work, the Jharkhand HC ordered a CBI probe into the scam. When Srinivas Rao was asked by the ED about diversion of funds, he claimed that money was paid to sub-contractors and evaded reply when quizzed on why these subcontractors re-deposited the money into Madhucon. The case will come up again on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/madhucon-case-ed-challenges-relief/articleshow/88419671.cms||---

He made the observation while countering the Aam Aadmi Party manifesto, which promised free water and reduced electricity bills. Hardeep said, “Residents from my ward are clear in their thoughts and want the MC to provide facilities 24x7 instead of giving water or electricity free of cost or at subsidised rates. They also want provision of proper civic infrastructure and uninterrupted power and water supply.” Talking about his daily routine, Buterla said that his day starts at 5am, with prayers, after which he takes his mother’s blessings and has breakfast. He said he leaves the house by 7am, pays obeisance at a local gurdwara and goes for door-to-door campaigning. “We conduct one-to-one meeting with residents during the day to motivate them to vote for SAD. Thereafter, we go to campaign for other SAD candidates,” he said. The routine is such that he has often had to skip lunch to keep the campaign going. After campaigning for the day is done, we sit down at around 6pm to plan for the next day. “In the evening, we again hold meetings with RWAs and conduct house-to-house campaign before ending the day at around 10pm.

GMCH authorities said the proposal for setting up the desired lab would be routed to ICMR through the state government. “The District Task Force for Covid-19 has assured us that it will pitch in for getting all necessary clearances for raising the facility at the earliest,” authorities said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/gmch-to-get-rs-18-crore-for-new-lab/articleshow/88418242.cms||---

According to the case details, Pithava, 19 years old then, was riding a motorcycle with a friend sitting pillion on the evening of December 26, 1999. The motorcycle slipped near the Naranpura AEC office and he suffered a grievous injury to his right leg. On February 18, 2000, he lodged an FIR at Naranpura police station, accusing an autorickshaw driver of rash and negligent driving saying he had hit his motorcycle from behind. Pithava also claimed compensation for the injury caused in the accident from the National Insurance Co Ltd, which had insured the auto. More than two decades later, the court concluded that the claim was false. After perusing the evidence, the court concluded that Pithava’s father did not lodge FIR immediately after the incident thinking that the injury was not serious. When the hospital informed them about possible amputation of the right leg, the FIR and claim were lodged to extract money from the insurance company. The insurer also alleged collusion of the auto driver and owner with the complainant in this accident claim filed in the court. The court said the evidence suggested that the motorcycle had slipped when Pithava was trying to overtake the auto and he suffered the injury. It also said that the FIR was filed against the auto driver with false and frivolous allegations, and therefore the claim is not tenable in the eye of the law. The court thought it fit to dismiss the claim with a fine and ordered Pithava on December 16 to pay Rs 10,000 to the National Insurance Co Ltd within one month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/21-yr-insurance-wait-fine-for-false-claim/articleshow/88419702.cms||---

Leading the team of debutantes is a homemaker and Mamata Banerjee’s sister-in-law Kajari Banerjee who won by 6,493 votes from Ward 73 — an all-time record for the ward — even scoring better than what Mamata Banerjee herself had secured in the recently concluded Bhowanipore bypoll. “I will continue to work under the guidance of Mamata Banerjee just like I have done so far without being into active politics,” said Banerjee. A consultant with a telecom giant and TMC councillor of Ward 86, Sourav Basu, was elated having won the election in first attempt. “I am extremely happy with the result as we snatched the ward from BJP. But there is no scope to relax as we have the task of developing this ward at par with the rest of the city,” said Basu, who is also the son of cabinet minister Chandrima Bhattacharya. Puja Panja, a teacher and daughter of minister Sashi Panja, also has her plans ready. Kakali Sen, wife of MLA Santanu Sen, who has also won the election by 24,335 votes in the first attempt from Ward 2 said she will start work from Wednesday itself. Ratna Chatterjee, wife of ex-mayor Sovan Chatterhee and the Behala East MLA, was also ecstatic after her victory from Ward 131. “When Sovan Chatterjee left this house, he told my daughter that I cannot do anything on my own. Today I proved him wrong,” she said. Former CAB administrator Biswarup Dey, who also won convincingly from W48 with a TMC ticket, said: “I already have certain developmental plans.” Basundhara Goswamy, a psychologist and daughter of former cabinet minister in the Left regime Kshiti Goswami, said: “I won’t term it the end of the battle. It’s just the beginning.” Equally upbeat was Congress turncoat and filmmaker Monalisa Banerjee who also won the election in the first attempt. “I always wanted to work for the people but none could trust Congress. Hence, I shifted to TMC,” said Banerjee. BJP leader Sajal Ghosh, who is the son of former councillor of Ward 50 Pradip Ghosh and was arrested in a case of criminal intimidation and theft four months ago, has also won the election. A young graduate and private tutor Purbasha Naskar, who defeated the ruling TMC candidate at Ward 141 and won the poll as an independent, also promised to work for development.

According to him, on October 4, 2021, the state government committed to not supplying parboiled rice. “Before levelling charges against the Centre, the Telangana government should supply agreed upon quantities of rice from this season. There is no problem with taking fine variety at any time,” he said. The Centre has repeatedly extended the supply of rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and is still willing to do so, he said. “I have been busy with state tours, and TRS ministers and MPs speak as if the Centre forcibly took a letter from them on parboiled rice.

---||Nagpur||‘Release RTE money to save budget schools’||Nagpur: Private unaided schools that admit RTE (Right to Education) quota students say the pending reimbursement amount has piled up to a very high level and must be paid immediately to save budget schools from financial peril. Various school associations that are spearheading the campaign to ensure the reimbursements come on time, and in full, say the government is in fact harming children’s academic future by delaying the payment. Sanjay Tayde-Patil, founder-president of Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA), said, “There are small budget schools which rely on RTE reimbursements to survive. With dues of many schools pending, either partial or full, these may shut down and that will leave many students stranded. Schools are not asking for something out of the blue. It was the government which told us to admit students for free and we will reimburse you.” Sachin Kalbande, founder-president of RTE Foundation, said, “The problem lies with the state government’s method of handling the issue. Through Right To Information (RTI), I have accessed details that central government is transferring its share of funds and that too at a much higher rate. Money is coming in separately for uniforms and books under RTE, but in Maharashtra we are not getting that at all.” While the schools’ animosity with the state over pending RTE funds is not new, it reached its peak earlier this year due to a decision by the state government. TOI had reported how RTE reimbursement has been slashed by 50% this year due to what authorities cited as “Covid-induced financial strain.” At that time, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad had told TOI that she would discuss the matter with the finance department and see if anything could be done. Till date, no good news for schools. Tayde-Patil said, “Schools are operating as a social service. You visit our budget schools in rural areas and see how they are helping kids from poor economic background get education. Even in urban areas, there are slum pockets where such budget schools operate with fees being negligible for the non-RTE students. So, the least we can expect is the state government to do its part.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/release-rte-money-to-save-budget-schools/articleshow/88420279.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Exploring Muniya exposed plight of tiger land||On a mission to tiger land Muniya (don’t mistake it with the sparrow-sized, attractive, seed-eating bird), encompassing Umred and Butibori, last month to ascertain whether it can be declared a sanctuary, the trip to this offbeat land of forest led to unearthing how the green wealth was being plundered by thugs. Around 35-40km from the city, the purpose of the visit to Muniya with its pioneer Vijay Ghuge, a retired lecturer working to conserve the forest with community participation for the last two decades, was to examine the potential of the 96sqkm that has been declared a conservation reserve (CR). The unexplored mixed forest, which was a shooting block during British times, was bestowed with rich flora and fauna and wetlands. As we dug deep into the woods, exploring the last vestiges of the old forest, we found that the hidden treasure trove was being plundered by trespassers — with the permission of the forest department at some spots — and by locals and Kathiyawadis who were seen illegally moving their flock of hundreds of cattle heads and sheep for pasture grazing in sensitive places. Perennial water bodies and lakes inside the ancient forest had become fisherfolk’s dens, and there were makeshift camps of Kathiyawadi pasture community deep inside the forest with their cattle and sheep competing for food with herbivores in the latter’s den. The forest also had a dargah and a temple and machans that had become party spots for revellers, who used these natural spots for drinking and cooking by collecting wind-fallen trees and chopping dry branches from the same forest. Pushing along the dense forest and rugged terrain was bone-jarring. At many patches, we had to get down from the four-wheel vehicle to look for pathways to move forward. We were lucky to have with us van majoor Wasudeo Waghade, who knew every inch of the Muniya land, but he too lost way several times due to thick vegetation. After catching a glimpse of the illegal activities rampant in Muniya, Ghuge, who first initiated the CR proposal in 2007 and stuck to his guns till it was declared a reserve in May 2021, was a disillusioned man after the 76km whirlwind tour of the forest. “Considering the major threats to the tiger land, there is an urgent need to declare Muniya a wildlife sanctuary to increase the protection level. A CR status would mean a lack of law and order, funds and clearly stated goals,” feels Ghuge. This diarist’s visit to Muniya generated good feed for the sub-committee of the state board for wildlife, which is examining the tiger land’s case to be notified as a sanctuary. Ghuge himself is an invitee to the committee, which has strong arguments for the sanctuary. “As the human population grows and resources become scarce, CRs may not yield results. Muniya sanctuary will be a stepping stone between Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni Wildlife Sanctuary,” says Ghuge.

After laying the foundation stone for the phase II of the joggers’ park, Godinho said, “While the cost of the first phase of the park was Rs 6 crore, the second phase is estimated to be Rs 10 crore. Phase II will have better facilities. It will have a creche for children so that the parents can enjoy the park while the children will be taken care of by professional caretakers.” The present track is narrow and as more people come for walks and jogs, the track will be made broader and of rubber, he said.

Sharma said he and his party have been getting tremendous support from people of the ward, who would definitely vote for change this time. During his door to door campaign on the last day of campaigning, he said that people were fed up with both the BJP and Congress. Ward number 13 includes sectors 11, 12 and 14 (Panjab University) and south campus of PU in Sector 25. On his daily routuie these days, Sharma said he starts the day at around 6am and leaves for campaigning at around 9am. After finishing the campaign, public meetings and finalising plans with party workers, he has been reaching home at around 11pm for the last two weeks, he said. He wanted to focus on reaching out to every ward resident on Tuesday but at around 8.30 am when he was about to leave, he received a message asking him to reach Government College for Men, Sector 11, where officials from the elections department had come to inspect EVMs. Sharma rushed to the college, where he remained till 11am. Thereafter, he reached his party office in Sector 11 and started the door to door campaign with his wife, son and party workers soon after. He had only managed to meet people in five to six houses when he received a call saying that a small gathering of people was waiting for him at PU. At this, he left for the university, leaving his family and party workers to continue the campaign. The gathering of about 30 people welcomed him in the university. Addressing them, Sharma requested them to give a chance to AAP in the city this time to bring about a change. He said that there was not a single allegation of corruption against him in his 40-year-old political career and other candidates of his party also had a good record. Sharma also said he is known in the area and has been working for the people for several years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/on-last-day-of-campaign-aap-leader-pitches-need-for-change/articleshow/88419708.cms||---

Addressing media persons in Kannur on Tuesday, he said that the UDF will announce the second phase of statewide protests against the project soon. Satheesan said that the project lacked transparency and the unnecessary haste shown by the state government in moving ahead with the project was suspicious. “There is widespread protest among the people against the move by the state government to take steps to acquire private lands by force. Yesterday, we saw the situation taking a serious turn when some people raised suicide threats at Kottiyam in Kollam. Taking the intense protests across the state into account, the state government should immediately put an end to going ahead with land acquisition using force. Does the government think that it can do anything just because it has power?” he asked. On the divergent stand taken by Shashi Tharoor regarding the project, he said that the Thiruvananthapuram MP has not supported the project but has only said that he will have to examine the project more closely. Satheesan, however, said that UDF had taken the stand against the project after careful study. “The government is not ready to agree to our demand to discuss the project even for just two hours in the assembly. We think that the government is not ready for a discussion because it has something to hide,” he added. Earlier in the day, Kasaragod MP Rajmohan Unnithan came down heavily on Tharoor for not signing the letter prepared by UDF MPs against the K-Rail project and said that if Congress makes Tharoor a candidate in the next Parliament elections, no Congress worker or UDF activist will work for him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/stop-land-acquisition-by-force-satheesan/articleshow/88419724.cms||---

When Justice Ujjal Bhuyan commenced hearing in the case, senior counsel Sivaraju Srinivas appearing for the petitioner said that the CBI was insisting on continuing the case against him despite failing to secure permission from the state to prosecute him. Muralidhar was charged with several omissions while performing his duty as executive director of APIIC that allotted 9,000 acres to LKH in Anantapur district. LKH was floated by businessman Indu Syam Prasad Reddy who is also an accused in the case. Srinivas said that Muralidhar was only acting in his official capacity as directed by then MD of APIIC. “Omissions attributed to him are the ones which he performed as part of discharging his official duties. Had he ignored them and refrained from doing anything, probably he would have been charged with dereliction of duties,” Srinivas said.  The judge posted the case to Wednesday for hearing the CBI version.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sans-govt-nod-cbi-cant-try-ias-officer-in-lepakshi-quid-pro-quo/articleshow/88419713.cms||---

Now they are contemplating joining TMC immediately after their victory. At Ward 141, humanities graduate Purbasha Naskar defeated her primary opponent — TMC candidate Shinath Gayen — by 409 votes in a late-hour counting drama that reduced her lead by over 700 votes in the last round. “I am no one. But still people in the area voted for me as they were unhappy with the TMC candidate. I hope TMC will recognise that and induct me into their party. I will love to work for Mamata Banerjee,” said Naskar. The newly elected councillor of Ward 135 Rubina Naaz, wife of the local TMC area president and veteran TMC councillor Shamsuzzaman Ansari’s daughter-in-law, is also planning to follow the same path after victory. “People were unhappy with the TMC candidate, so I contested the election as an independent candidate and won it. I will do whatever my husband and father-in-law say now,” said Naaz. Hours later Naaz’s husband Tabrez Ansari was seen alongside minister and Port MLA Firhad Hakim on a bus as he toured around the city after his win. “We were always in the TMC family and will be there forever,” Ansari said. The Ward 43 (woman-reserved ward) independent candidate Ayesha Kaniz is the wife of Irfan Ali Taj, a prominent social worker in the area who had steered the anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests in central Kolkata. “Despite the fact that we did not hold any political post or harboured such ambitions, we worked relentlessly for the people of the ward during CAA and NRC agitation, lockdown, Amphan and the pandemic. People of the ward have appreciated the work by electing me as the councillor,” said Kaniz (31). She added that she is with Mamata Banerjee. Firhad said the party would consider the inclusion of the independent candidates if they apply for membership. Two other independent candidates — Sachidananda Banerjee and Subrata Mukherjee’s sister Tanima Chatterjee — lost in the wards 72 and 68, respectively.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Marathwada saw 805 farmer suicides in 11 months this year||AURANGABAD: Despite two consecutive state governments waiving farm loans, farmer suicides continue, with the eight districts of Marathwada alone reporting 805 farmer suicides in the first 11 months of 2021. Of these, 605 cases were considered to be eligible for ex-gratia, while 84 cases were considered ineligible. Inquiry is pending in 115 cases to confirm if the suicides can be considered farmer suicides. In comparison, in 2020, 773 farmer suicides were reported in the region. Of those, 617 were considered eligible cases, 110 ineligible, and in the rest, inquiries were pending. In 2019, 937 farmer suicides were reported in Marathwada region — 761 eligible and 176 ineligible. Activists have pointed out that after the first loan waiver in 2017, there was excess rainfall for two consecutive years. This was followed by the Covid outbreak. As a result, several lakh tonnes of crops, fruits and vegetables ended up rotting in the farms for four consecutive years. Activists alleged micro-finance companies are also playing a role in fuelling farmer suicides in the state. On February 25, 2020, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government announced waiver of farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. This was for loans availed between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2020. Implementation of the waiver was carried out under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule crop loan waiver scheme. It eventually benefitted 19 lakh farmers. In 2017, as the CM, Devendra Fadnavis had announced a farm loan waiver scheme. Under this scheme, the state exchequer spent Rs 24,000 crore on the waiver and the state government claimed it had covered 85% farmers in the state. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna’s Raju Shetti told TOI, “Loan waiver is not a solution to the problem, it is just a superficial remedy. Farmers end up in debt and get returns lower than what they have invested.” He said making minimum support price (MSP) statutory should address the issue. Farm activist Jayajirao Suryawanshi said, “The only way to stop farmer suicides in Maharashtra is to implement the Telangana pattern, where the state gives Rs 10,000 per acre for purchase of seeds and fertilizers.” He said excessive rainfall followed by outbreak of pandemic have ruined crops for four years, due to which waivers given have proved ineffective. Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Shetkari Mandal’s Deepak Joshi said, “Consecutive governments have waived off thousands of crores of farm and crop loans, but they never took steps to encourage repayment of loans. The system is flawed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-marathwada-saw-805-farmer-suicides-in-11-months-this-yr/articleshow/88421151.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Surat||Surat: Rs 19 lakh siphoned off from provident fund accounts of 155||SURAT: Owners of three mills located on Ashwini Kumar Road have been booked for embezzling Rs 19.42 lakh from the provident fund accounts of at least 155 employees over the past three years. A complaint in this regard was filed on Monday by Shashank Dalal, an officer at the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Surat, with the detection of crime branch (DCB). Economic offence wing will probe the case. According to the complaint, before 2016-17, bank account details and KYC verification was not required to open a provident fund (PF) account and only bank details were needed only if the employee wanted to withdraw money from the PF account. Taking an advantage of these rules, owners of three mill — S R Silk Mills, Shree Saibaba Silk Mills and Shree Sai Santa Silk Mills — allegedly embezzled money from their employees’ PF accounts. The money was withdrawn without the knowledge of the employees between 2018 and 2020. EPFO officer Shashank Dalal in his complaint mentioned that the owners of the three mills themselves applied to withdraw money from their employees' PF account and gave bank account number which they had opened especially for this purpose. Dalal stated that the owners siphoned off Rs 19.42 lakh of around 155 employees over three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/rs-19l-siphoned-off-from-pf-a/c-of-155/articleshow/88419123.cms||---

Insisting that Lucknow is truly a transformed city, he said, “This year, we had more weddings than those held in 2019 despite Covid protocols and restricted entry in our hotel. I think what worked for us as a hospitality industry was three R’s – Re-structure, Re-engineering and Re-imagining.” Sarvesh Goel, founder of The Centrum, a lifestyle venture, said, a traveller’s experience of the city of nawabs can be made more authentic by offering local culture, products and cuisine. “We are different in a way that we boycotted foreign products and promoted indigenous ones. I feel hospitality can definitely be a revenue generator provided we reinvent ourselves because the experience of a traveller is very important,” Goel said. He shared how the use of modern products including elements of heritage led to an out-of-box rejuvenating point for people of Lucknow, UP and India. “We revived two factories for Chinhat pottery giving employment to 22 artisans. A traveller needs to be offered something different as they carry memories and culture with them,” he said. Culinary expert Pankaj Bhadouria said it is a huge responsibility of the hospitality industry to ensure that local cuisines make a traveller’s experience memorable. “When one talks of local cuisine, it is only about kebabs and biryanis. There is a lot of local vegetarian cuisine such as ghugni matar, saag mixed with daal, or nimona that needs to be promoted because 70% of the travellers are vegetarian. We never popularise Bundelkhandi food or Braj ka khaana. If we do, we will definitely make the experience better for those coming here.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/promote-citys-rich-culture-cuisine-to-make-travellers-experience-authentic/articleshow/88420765.cms||Isha Jain

With the eve falling on Friday, it will be a long weekend and people have planned their break accordingly to their favourite watering holes and party destinations. Despite the worries about the Omicron variant of Covid-19, plans for long weekend getaways are intact and consequently airfares have surged by a whopping 120% to certain destinations. Anuj Pathak, the president of Tour Operators & Travel Agents Association of Gujarat (TAG), said: “Bookings are good this time despite concerns over the Omicron variant.” He added: “Those looking for driveable destinations are headed to Udaipur, Mount Abu, Kumbhalgarh, and Jodhpur.” He went on to say: “Whereas many other travellers are booking tickets to Goa, Jaisalmer, Jaipur, and even Jammu & Kashmir, owing to which airfares have surged.” In fact, some travellers have picked international destinations. “Places such as Dubai and Maldives are hot favourites and people are booking a three-night-four-day package to these destinations,” said Manish Sharma, chairman, Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI), Gujarat. “Travellers are more confident this time around and are shelling out Rs 60,000 to Rs 1 lakh per person.” With more professionals working from home and the long weekend in perfect sync, people from across the city have chosen to travel out. Airfares have spiked 50-120% depending on the destination, even when booked about ten days in advance. “With the dynamic pricing policy in place and limited connectivity to certain destinations, airfares have shot up,” Pathak said. In fact, even hotel tariffs have surged across all these destinations. Ankit Bajaj, secretary, TAFI Gujarat, said: “People want to travel as many could not due to the Covid-19 outbreak last year.” Bajaj added: “With more demand, hotel tariffs across popular resorts as well as four-star and five-star properties have increased by at least 40%.” Industry sources said that road trips are increasingly being preferred for travel. “Road trips are usually a hit for the New Year eve getaways. However, this year, there is a dearth of cars,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), Gujarat. “With the wedding season kicking in and the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit around the corner, the availability of cars is a concern and cab fares have surged.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/yearend-trips-airfares-shoot-up/articleshow/88419722.cms||---

The milestone was achieved three weeks after the reintroduction of tokens. The North-South corridor — the city’s transport lifeline — had crossed 3.5lakh footfalls in two days after Metro Railway started issuing tokens from November 26. Till then, only smart card holders were allowed to board trains. The ridership graph has been rising sharply since November 26, even with the same number of services (272). In fact, the authorities have been readying themselves to get more commuters while they are adding four more daily trips from next Monday.  From 27 December, Metro will run 276 daily services on weekdays along the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar line and thus, it will be 12 short of the pre-pandemic 288 daily trips along the North-South corridor. Even as it should take some time to reach its pre-pandemic daily passenger count of 6 lakh to 6.2 lakh, officials said that more services are being offered to maintain physical distancing. On October 1, Metro had breached the 3 lakh mark, registering 3,27,515 footfalls. On November 26, the ridership jumped to 3,47,313 from 3,31,908 along the Kavi Subhas-Dakshineswar corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/metro-crosses-4l-daily-ridership/articleshow/88419718.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Promotions stuck in grant-in-aid colleges||AHMEDABAD: Faculty members of grant-in-aid colleges on Tuesday sought government intervention in the issue of promotions being stuck for the last few years. In a meeting with Kuberbhai Dindor, minister of state for higher and technical education and finance minister Kanubhai Desai, members of Gujarat Rajya Adhyapak Mahamandal discussed the issue about faculties in colleges not given promotion under the Career Advance Scheme (CAS) for more than three years now, said Rajendra Jhadav, general secretary of the Mahamandal. They claimed that the delays in promotions have led to flouting of norms set by the University Grants Commission. “Out of nowhere the state government recently come out with a new rule that professors need to clear Hindi triple C to be eligible for seventh pay commission benefits. No other state follows such a rule,” said a member of the association. Few years ago, the state education department passed a general resolution clearing payment of Seventh Pay Commission benefits to the teaching staff at college under University Grants Commission (UGC) from January 1, 2019. Beneficiaries were also be paid arrears from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018, according to the GR. The decision was likely to benefit about 7,500 colleges across 550 colleges under UGC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/promotions-stuck-in-grant-in-aid-colleges/articleshow/88419729.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: DMK worker hurls slipper at MLA Pollachi V Jayaraman||COIMBATORE: Tension prevailed at Kothavadi lake in Kinathukadavu taluk here after a DMK cadre hurled a sandal at AIADMK MLA Pollachi V Jayaraman on Tuesday at a function that the opposition party organized to thank the mother nature for replenishing the waterbody after a gap of almost two decades. The sandal, however, didn’t hit the MLA. Former chief minister and opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami (EPS) was quick to issue a statement, condemning the attack on the former assembly deputy speaker. The incident took place around 11am when Pollachi Jayaraman and AIADMK functionaries gathered at Kothavadi lake, which hadn’t received water from Parambikulam-Aliyar Project (PAP) canal for more than two decades, to offer floral tributes and thank the mother nature for revitalizing the waterbody. They had erected a shamiana at the lake for the event. It is to be noted that the main water source of Kothavadi lake is PAP canal. Following the heavy rain in the past two months, water was released to the lake from PAP canal last month. When AIADMK women members were planning to prepare sweet pongal as part of the event, a group of DMK functionaries turned up at the lake, stating only the ruling party could take credit for releasing water to the lake from PAP canal and raising slogans against Pollachi Jayaraman. They said Jayaraman hadn’t taken any steps to bring water to the lake from PAP canal during the AIADMK tenure and asked him to leave the place immediately. AIADMK cadres, meanwhile, entered into an altercation with DMK cadres. When Jayaraman was returning to his car, one of the DMK cadres hurled the sandal at him. While it missed the target, it hit one of the AIADMK cadres on his eyes. AIADMK cadres soon started raising slogans against the DMK. The Kinathukadavu police intervened and escorted Jayaraman to his car and sent him away safely. They also removed the shamiana and did not allow AIADMK cadres to cook sweet pongal. DMK leader Dr K Varadharajan, who lost Pollachi constituency to Jayaraman in the recent assembly election, said the AIADMK had set up the shamiana and arranged the event without obtaining permission from police. “Jayaraman and AIADMK functionaries Vinayagamurthy and Babu was planning to disturb the law & order situation in the locality by conducting such an event. Police should take necessary action against them.” Pointing out that Jayaraman had been an MLA for the past 15 years, he said the AIADMK leader hadn’t taken any steps to bring water to the lake from PAP canal. “As soon as the DMK came to power, we brought water to the lake from PAP canal and the lake is overflowing now.” EPS, however, said the lake, which is sprawled across 300 acres, was not maintained for the past 50 years. “During our regime, we had allocated Rs25 lakh to desilt the lake, which overflowed on Monday. Pollachi Jayaraman visited the lake to attend the thanksgiving event. DMK functionaries assaulted him and other party cadres, while police remained mute spectators. I condemn the ruling party cadres’ atrocities against Pollachi Jayaraman and other partymen.” He demanded the chief minister to take action against the DMK cadres and deputy superintendent of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/dmk-man-hurls-sandal-at-pollachi-jayaraman-stirs-up-hornets-nest/articleshow/88419723.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Red sanders smuggler arrested after hrs of questioning, gets ED custody||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday arrested red sanders smuggler Badshah Malik in a money laundering case of Rs 48 crore after several hours of questioning and produced him before the court. The court remanded him in ED custody till December 24. On Monday, ED had raised seven premises related to Badshah Malik and his associates in Mumbai. Badshah routed ill-gotten wealth through shell companies into his account, ED officials said, and ED believes that the money was proceeds of smuggling, and he failed to provide a proper explanation. ED also searched the residences of his accomplices, Harshavardhan Hegde and Vijay Poojary, in Mumbai in connection with the case. The agency recorded Hegde’s statement, whereas Poojary was untraceable. It is alleged Poojary, along with Badshah, was smuggling red sanders to Middle East countries for the last many years. Exports of red sanders are banned. The ED is based on a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) 2015 case where it had arrested Hegde along with Badshah for smuggling red sanders worth crores. ED believed Badshah had invested money he earned through illegal activities in properties. Officials are examining Badshah’s companies and properties he owned in Mumbai and adjoining districts. ED is also investigating the ‘suspicious’ money received by Badshah’s company before the DRI case. Badshah has been involved in red sanders smuggling for many years and had faced arrest in similar cases on earlier occasions. According to the DRI’s case, in 2015, they arrested Harshavardhan Hegde, director of Mumbai-based Emirates Shipping Agencies India Pvt Ltd, after intercepting a container at Nhava Sheva and recovered 7,800 metric tons of red sanders worth several crores. Later, Malik was arrested. The DRI also investigated Vijay Poojary, who had a home in Mumbai but would operate from Andhra Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-red-sanders-smuggler-arrested-after-hrs-of-questioning-gets-ed-custody/articleshow/88421154.cms||Vijay V Singh

The local bodies department has approved the agenda. The MC will be buying six buses in the first phase — routes for them have already been finalised. The agenda was approved the MC house meeting held on November 2. Mayor Amarjit Singh Sidhu alias Jeeti Sidhu said, “The previous Mayor failed to get the local bus service for residents of Mohali, but we have successfully made it a reality. During Congress tenure, Mohali will see immense development.” The plan for own local bus service was mooted in 2008 after which many house meetings were held in 2017. In June 2017, Regional Transport Authority (RTA) had approved 14 bus routes but they failed to materialise. In February 2018, the MC had scrapped the project on the ground it “was not viable as the MC would have to shell out over Rs 20 crore, whereas it could tie up with Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) to extend its services to Mohali and surrounding villages. The mayor said, “This service will be especially for poor people and the fare of these buses will not exceed Rs 10 per passenger in Mohali jurisdiction.” MC Commissioner Kamal Kumal Garg said for the first phase, the MC has approved eight bus routes. Garg said, “For the first phase, we have got eight bus routes approved. Six buses will be pressed into action by January 1. We have already called for tenders on BOO (build-own-operate) basis to operate the buses. Passenger tickets will be provided by the MC but distributed by private operator.” Garg added the MC will also allow space for advertisements on the buses to get more revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mohali-mcs-low-floor-cng-bus-project-gets-nod/articleshow/88419725.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

While the Indira Gandhi Hospital is located in Panchavati, the Mico Hospital is located in Satpur and Morwadi Hospital is in the Cidco area. “The first round-the-clock vaccination centre was started at Nashik Road and has been receiving good response. We have, therefore, started three more and expect the same response here,” said Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the NMC medical superintendent. The first round-the-clock vaccination centre has been vaccinating close to 115 beneficiaries every day. “We get more than 40% of the beneficiaries in the evening hours or early in the morning. Very few people come in at night,” an official said. The round-the-clock vaccination is aimed at providing the service to the people who are not able to get the shots during the day as they have work to attend. They usually come in the evening. The three new locations to get 24x7 vaccination facilities have been opened keeping in mind the workers who can take the shots in the evening or morning. “The Satpur and Cidco (Ambad) centres will cater to the workers employed in the respective areas, while the Panchavati hospital will cater to the workers in the business hub,” the officer added. The officer also pointed out that the efforts were being taken to spread awareness among the masses for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-starts-3-more-24x7-vaccination-centres/articleshow/88418287.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||India||Reforms to make 18 voting age in true sense: Experts||NEW DELHI: Electoral law experts have welcomed passing of the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, by the Rajya Sabha, a day after it was cleared by the Lok Sabha, saying that it will make the voting age of 18 years a reality in the true sense. As per the law so far, a voter needed to be 18 years on the first day of the calendar year to be able to vote in an election happening anytime in that year. This essentially meant that if a voter turned 18 anytime between January 2 and December 31 in a given year, he could vote only in the following year. With the amendment now providing for four qualifying dates, any young voter can vote in an election scheduled between April and June if he is 18 years as on April 1, or in an election scheduled between July and September if he is 18 as on July 1, or in an election election timed between October and December, if he had attained 18 years of age as on October 1. “On an average, 1.5 crore youths turn 18 in a given year. The amendment shall cut the nearly year-long wait for them to be able to vote,” said a senior EC official. The official added: “This is the real change that has happened. Most voters who turned 18 could, until now, only vote when they were almost 19. Now they can vote within days and weeks of turning 18”. An electoral law expert also sought to dismiss any concerns regarding linking of Aadhaar and voter ID, stating that furnishing one’s Aadhaar number will be voluntary and that the Aadhaar will only be taken as a proof of identity. “Sometimes, a voter is on the electoral roll in his native place as also another place where he is a usual resident, where he enrols subsequently without having his name deleted. By linking the Aadhaar number with the voter’s consent, we will be able to detect if his name exists on the rolls of another constituency and have it deleted, thus weeding out duplicate entries. Since Aadhaar is the only identity database with biometrics, duplication will be ruled out once voter identity is authenticated with Aadhaar number,” said an EC official. The official said even the provision allowing husband of a woman service voter to register as voter in the same constituency as her, seeks to bring the law in sync with the changing times as women are now part of the armed forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/reforms-to-make-18-voting-age-in-true-sense-experts/articleshow/88421493.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Coimbatore||Scoot to resume flight to Singapore soon||COIMBATORE: Low-cost airline Scoot is all set to resume flight services to and from Singapore from December 29. The aircraft had operated daily flights to Singapore before the Covid-19 outbreak. The services were suspended in April last year. Now, the flight will be operated three days a week - Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Scoot has resumed flight services from most of the other cities in the country. Recently, the airlines had introduced Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for fully vaccinated travellers, offering quarantine-free entry to Singapore, from a select set of cities in the country. However, the flights to be operated from the city would be non-VTL. The airlines has made it clear that the service is meant to travel to Singapore alone and transit would not be allowed. Ticketing agents said the service would mainly be used by business people, guest workers and people who want to meet their friends and family. “With the Omicron threat looming large, people would think twice about travelling for leisure activities.” The service would also help encourage cargo movement. Perishable items such as vegetables and finished goods could easily be shipped to Singapore now. While welcoming the flight service, people said it was important for the SriLankan Airlines to resume services to Colombo. N Muguntha Kumar, an aviation enthusiast, said the city had three international connections before the pandemic. While flight operations to Sharjah have already resumed, services to Singapore would restart soon. “SriLankan Airlines has resumed flight services from other cities such as Chennai, Trichy and Madurai. We want the airlines to resume services from the city at the earliest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/scoot-to-resume-flight-to-singapore-soon/articleshow/88419733.cms||V Devanathan
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav promises caste census within 3 months if voted to power||AGRA: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday promised to conduct a caste census, to give people their rights in accordance to their share in the population, in UP within three months if his party is voted in power in the state. Addressing a public rally in party’s stronghold of Mainpuri during Samajwadi Vikas Rath Yatra, the former chief minister said, “We all are accused of snatching someone’s else’s rights, but things will become clear once the caste census is done,” he said, adding the party will fulfill all its promises as it had done earlier. “Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav) is known for mincing no words; his actions speak,” said Akhilesh. Attacking Yogi Adityanath, he said the CM is useful only for changing colours of institutions or names of cities and roads, for laying foundation stones and inaugurating already inaugurated projects. “Do you need Yogi or yogya (deserving) government?” Akhilish asked the public. Referring to the recent poll alliance with his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav of Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), Akhilesh said, “Since I took ‘chacha wali’ (uncle’s) party along, BJP’s I-T, CBI and ED cells have become active from Delhi. As elections near, these agencies will become more active, as the fear of defeat haunts BJP.” Referring to the recent income tax department’s searches at the premises of some SP leaders, he said, “Samajwadis are not scared of anything… jo dar gaya who mar gaya (one who’s afraid is dead)”. Interestingly, while Shivpal’s pictures were back on the hoarding and banners with his nephew at the rally site, the ‘chacha’ was conspicuous by his absence, but a large number of PSP(L) workers attended the rally. The four-year bitter family feud ended after the SP chief announced an alliance with his uncle’s PSP(L) recently. Akhilesh also took a swipe at BJP for starting “Jan Vishwas Yatra” from multiple locations in the state. “BJP is nervous, which is evident from their yatras from six different locations in the state against one SP Rath,” he said, adding BJP had panicked after seeing the groundswell of support for SP. Referring to SP’s red colour, he said the CM is scared of it as it symbolises “revolution and emotions”. Akhilesh said Yogi Adityanath is the first CM who himself had withdrawn cases lodged against him. “BJP is the only party giving protection to criminals, and the majority of criminals are in this party,” he said, appealing to the people to vote for his party, as this election will decide the future of the state and the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/akhilesh-promises-caste-census-within-3-months-if-voted-to-power/articleshow/88419119.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Interestingly, he has only flayed the Centre over this project. “I have been trying to get the Centre’s perspective on Kerala’s SilverLine project, but GoI seems to think ignorance is bliss. Concerns expressed on a project of such immense importance need to be addressed thru transparent & consultative deliberations w/[with] all stakeholders,” he tweeted on Tuesday evening. He was referring to his unstarred question given to the Union ministry of railways in the Lok Sabha on December 15. Tharoor had asked whether the railways had recorded the area of forest that is going to be cleared for the construction of the SilverLine project in Kerala. He had sought the details of the area of the land acquired for the development of the project, whether the land acquisition for the SilverLine project shall lead to the displacement of local residents in the path of the project, and if so, the details thereof along with the housing and monetary compensation awarded to them. To this, Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw had replied that “consideration of the project depends upon techno-economic viability of the project. At this stage details of area of land, rehabilitation along with compensation cannot be ascertained”. Tharoor, who was upset with the Union railway minister’s reply, said the concerns expressed over this project should be discussed with the stakeholders and there should be transparency. A government cannot show ignorance about such a project, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tharoor-flays-centres-lax-attitude-over-silverline/articleshow/88419734.cms||---

She was scratched and bitten by the pack but she pushed and kicked the dogs till they retreated and disappeared. Her children, aged between 10 and three years, also sustained injuries. Her daughter is in a critical condition. This incident took place at Barha village on the outskirts of Pilibhit city under Sungadi police station. Farmer Danveer Singh had gone out for work while his wife, Seema Devi, was cooking. Their three children, Anuj, 10, Pallavi, 5, and Monu, 3, were playing outside the house. Suddenly, she heard Pallavi screaming. She rushed out and to her horror, saw a pack of some six dogs dragging away Pallavi while two dogs were mauling her sons, Anuj and Monu. Seema ran towards the dogs to rescue her children. After a struggle of nearly 10 minutes, she managed to rescue her children, pulling them out from the canine jaws. The pack fled, leaving the bleeding woman and children. The dogs had ripped off flesh from Pallavi’s head and arms and severely bitten Seema on her hands.

I’m glad to note that the number of daughters who have received degrees is nearly thrice the number of boys. I have been observing this growing empowerment of daughters through education in other parts of the country also. In this empowerment-through-education of our daughters, I see the India of the future which will become a knowledge power with rich contribution from our daughters,” Kovind said. He also lauded Kerala for being a leading state in the area of learning and education and pointed out that of the three cities from the entire country recommended recently by the Centre for being listed in Unesco’s Global Network of Learning, two were from Kerala. “These two cities are Thrissur and Nilambur. Being part of this global network supports the achievement of sustainable development goals, especially the goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting life-long learning opportunities for everyone,” he said. The President commended Kerala on gender equity front saying that the state not only has a favourable sex ratio, but was also at the forefront of women empowerment. Stating that the National Education Policy (NEP, 2020) was a well-planned roadmap to develop an ecosystem that will nurture the talents of the young generation, he said that it has the potential to turn India into a hub of knowledge. “I believe that the most outstanding feature of NEP is that it aims to promote both inclusion and excellence,” he added. The President said NEP aims to prepare students for the world of tomorrow, while also equipping them with the best of our own traditions. “India is, after all, the land of Nalanda and Takshashila, of Aryabhata, Bhaskaracharya and Panini. Gandhi compared indigenous educational system to a beautiful tree that perished under colonialism. An effort is being made to rediscover its best aspects so that India makes a contribution to the world that it alone is destined to make,” he said. As many as 742 students of the 2018-20 batch graduated at the event. Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, LSG minister M V Govindan and top varsity authorities attended the event.

It consists of responsible and sensitive tourism, said Sunil Chaudhary, nodal officer for ecotourism and additional managing director of UP Forest Corporation (UPFC). He was speaking at a session on ecotourism at The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave on Monday. UPFC is the nodal agency for ecotourism promotion and development. The state has a policy for ecotourism since 2014. UP is home to one national park, 12 wildlife sanctuaries and 14 bird sanctuaries. The state’s recorded forest area is 16,582 sq km. Chaudhary added that the state government has identified nine ecotourism circuits for development and promotion. An MoU has been signed with the tourism department and a conclave was held in Agra in July on developing ecotourism. Within days of that, dry runs of tourist visits were launched on the Agra-Etawah circuit to get first-hand experience and information about the state of infrastructure and requirements. Dry runs were launched on two more circuits: Sohagibarwa-Gorakhpur and Varanasi-Chandauli. UP is home to diverse wildlife that includes tigers, rhinos and several species of birds. The government has taken steps to facilitate ecotourists. These include online booking, renovated accommodation and better approach roads. Naturalist and author IAS officer Sanjay Kumar said, “When it comes to ecotourism, UP has tremendous potential which needs to be realized.” He added that there is a need to provide homestays so that locals benefit from ecotourism. Anjuna Dhir, president of Responsible Tourism Society of India, said, “Tourism should not only be the best experience for tourists but also locals. We should not forget that it’s a destination for us but also somebody’s home.” It is the collective responsibility of each one of us to make the business of tourism sustainable, she said. She also suggested some measures tourists could take such as travelling light and being sensitive towards animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/responsible-behaviour-homestays-with-locals-will-boost-ecotourism-experts/articleshow/88420787.cms||Neha Shukla

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra State govt eases minimum age criteria for nursery admissions||Pune: The Maharashtra education department has relaxed the minimum age criteria for admission to classes from the nursery to class 1 for the academic year 2022-23, officials said on Tuesday.  As per the government resolution (GR) dated September 18, 2020, the cut-off date for the minimum age for school admission was December 31. Due to this cut-off date, children born in October, November and December faced issues while securing admission in schools. Considering this issue, the education department has changed the minimum age criteria for admission for the academic year 2022-23, a government circular stated on Monday. As per the new rule, children born between October 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019, and having completed the minimum age of three years as of December 31, 2022, can take admission in nursery.  The children born between October 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018, and who have completed the minimum age of four years as of December 31, 2022, can take admission in junior KG (kindergarten).

---||Pune||Death rate in Pune city during second wave less than in first: Study||PUNE: An epidemiological analysis of Covid cases in the city by the Pune Knowledge Cluster (PKC) and the collaborating researchers at IISER, Johns Hopkins India has revealed that the death rate in the second wave of the pandemic was two to five times less than during the first wave. The overall Covid mortality numbers also fell drastically during the second wave despite the caseload being over 1.5 times that of the first wave (nearly 1.62 lakh). The caseload during the second wave study period was nearly 2.75 lakh.  Nearly 16,287 elderly (65-85 years) contracted the infection during the first wave in Pune, of whom 2,026 (12%) succumbed to the infection. In contrast, 28,345 from the age group contracted Covid in the second wave and 1,429 (5%) died. The analysis found that nearly 28 children had succumbed to the infection in the first wave, but this number dropped to eight in the second wave study period. The absolute caseload among the 0-17 age group was higher during the second wave at 24,177. Nearly 17,577 children had contracted the infection in the first wave. The study team divided the pandemic into three phases based on the trend of incident cases and test positivity rates in Pune: the first phase representing the first wave of the pandemic from March 9, 2020, until October 31, 2020, followed by the interim phase from November 1,2020 until February 15, 2021. The last phase started from February 16, 2021, till May 31, representing part of the second wave. Of the 7,920 who died during all the three periods in Pune, 4,146 (52%) died in the first wave, 590 (8%) in the interim phase and 3,184 (40%) in the second wave. Prasad Bogam, lead author of the analysis from Johns Hopkins India, told TOI, “The number of months used in the analysis for the first wave is higher than that used for the second wave. The absolute caseload during the second wave was 1.5 times higher than the first. Yet, the absolute number of deaths was lower in the second wave, than the first.” Vidya Mave, senior author collaborating with PKC from Johns Hopkins India, said, “The case fatality rate (CFR) rapidly declined from 3.91 per 1,000 person-days (PD) to 1.66 per 1,000 PD during the first wave. During the same period, the clinical management guidelines were introduced recommending the use of intravenous steroids use for Covid-19. The CFR further declined to 0.77 per 1,000 PD in the second wave. The case fatality rate was 3.53 times greater before the new guidelines for intravenous steroid use for severe illness was introduced.” Joy Merwin Monteiro, researcher from Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), told TOI, “The sharpest decline in CFR was for the oldest age groups, underlining that the demographic most vulnerable to severe disease and death benefited most as our understanding and management of the pandemic improved. A sharp reduction in CFR happened around the time better clinical interventions were prescribed during the first wave.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/death-rate-in-city-during-2nd-wave-less-than-in-1st-study/articleshow/88419751.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||BJP down to 3 seats, all in central Kolkata||KOLKATA: With Meena Devi Purohit spending the civic poll result day at her Posta home with her family, her party workers speculated about the chances of her win. But all the doubts were put to rest when the Posta matriarch walked out of the counting centre with a broad smile and a victory sign. “Main Ward 22 ki beti hoon aur woh mera parivar hai. Ek parivar apni beti ko harata nahi, balke jeetata hai,” she said. Apart from her win from Posta, BJP’s Sajal Ghosh won from Sealdah (Ward 50) Vijay Ojha from Burrabazar (Ward 23), all in the trading hub of central Kolkata. Ward 21 BJP candidate Purnima Chakraborty polled substantial votes but she trailed behind Trinamool and Left. “The entire pandemic, I was out on the streets, working for people. I made sure food reached homes and none faced problem,” said Ojha. BJP veteran Suneeta Jhawar lost from Ward 42. Ghosh, the new BJP winner from Ward 50, was happy people appreciated his work. “I will dedicate myself to the services of residents,” he said. While Trinamool swept most Kolkata wards, this central trading pocket remained out of reach. Campaigining by senior leaders, like Abhishek Banerjee, in the area paid off partially with Trinamool wresting Ward 42. “The myth that BJP is unbeatable in Burrabazar was smashed with Trinamool winning Ward 42,” said Vivek Gupta, Trinamool MLA from Jorasanko. BJP said the poll result was a design to create confusion among people about the main opposition force. “The number of seats or percentage does not mean anything. Trinamool is ahead of us in Kolkata and they wanted to showcase that by holding civic polls only in the city,” said Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar. He blamed it on a “tacit understanding between Trinamool and Left”. “People’s participation was low but polling percentage was high. It showed it was rigged,” said BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-down-to-3-seats-all-in-central-kol/articleshow/88419772.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The protest was symbolic as the health centre falls under the chief minister’s constituency. The workers raised slogans and lodged their protest against the manner in which their services had been terminated by the AMC. About 35 health workers were detained by Ghatlodia police. “We were effusively praised for being corona warriors and flowers were showered from a helicopter,” said Jagdish Shah, a health worker who was part of the protesting group. “All that was a farce. The trust is broken.” He said now there is another health emergency and advertisements are being placed for health workers. “But how many will risk their lives for an 11-month employment opportunity given by a government which ruthlessly plays with the trust of health workers,” he said. Shah added, “The multipurpose health workers should be hired for vacant posts”. As of now 1,400 positions for health workers are vacant in the AMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sacked-health-workers-stage-protest-in-ghatlodia-35-held/articleshow/88419764.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uncertainty over work resumption at Parade ground||Dehradun: Uncertainty shrouds the development work at the Parade ground halted ahead of the PM’s visit earlier this month in light of VIP movement ahead of the polls. The work is part of the smart city project. Dehradun was first included in the list of smart cities in 2017 and the initial plan was to finish off the development work by the end of 2021. However, multiple delays have prevented that from happening. Among the various projects, development work at the Parade ground was a major undertaking. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his rally of December 4, which he was going to address from the Parade ground, infrastructural work at the site had was stopped. Instead, officials had immediately started work on levelling the area and preparing it for the rally. Later in the month, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also addressed his rally at the same venue. District administration believes that the ground has become a political hub. Also, VIP movement ahead of the upcoming polls will keep the space engaged. “It is pointless to restart the work and then halt it again. The election commission will visit here on December 23-24. Once we have all necessary election-related information, we will plan on how to resume the work,” said district magistrate, Dr R Rajesh Kumar, who is also the chief executive officer of the smart city project. He said that smart toilets and the levelling work of the ground had been finished last month itself. “Laying down multi-utility ducts, a cycle track, a green belt and a water duct for a sprinkling system are the smaller projects that are left and will be finished as soon as possible. We also have an issue of debris in the drains which will be looked at,” said Kumar. Meanwhile, the area continues to witness traffic chaos. “During rush hour, traffic often chokes the area. All the construction work has also caused a lot of dust pollution here,” said Mannu Singh, a fruit vendor near the ground. In a separate incident, Dehradun police has nabbed six people in connection with the theft of equipment being used in the smart city work on EC road. Electric cable worth Rs 28 lakh had allegedly been stolen on the night of December 15 from the work site. City police traced it to first Baghpat and then Delhi, from where the stolen goods were recovered and five people nabbed. The sixth person was arrested in Dehradun on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uncertainty-over-work-resumption-at-parade-ground/articleshow/88417641.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

---||Lucknow||Kant lauds Yogi govt for corona pandemic mgmt||Lucknow: Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant has praised the Uttar Pradesh government for its Covid-19 management, crediting it with having provided free treatment in hospitals, medicines, using tele medicine, providing home based care and ensuring sufficient oxygen. He said the state had also administered the highest number of vaccine doses, higher than the population of some states, at over 18 crore. Kant, speaking at The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave on Monday, congratulated CM Yogi Adityanath for inclusive growth in the state and gave the example of UP’s performance in aspirational districts to prove his point. “The Centre identified 112 most backward districts in the country and called them aspirational districts. In UP, there are eight such districts. The state has been a No. 1 performer in improving amenities and its performance on parameters like health, education, sanitation. UP has achieved growth by taking along all people,” he said. Five of UP’s eight aspirational districts, he added, had been among the top 10 districts in terms of performance and UP had been the best performer on 48 indicators including health, nutrition, immunisation, drinking water supply. “UP government on its own has selected 20% of the blocks to be developed on the same lines as the aspirational districts. What is also impressive is that other than infrastructure, the government is also focussing on making UP green,” he said. On infrastructure, especially improvement in connectivity, Kant said a state like Kerala, where there are only three functional airports, has become a tourism hub because of access to places like the Gulf and Europe. “Imagine what this will do for UP, where there are around eight functional airports and many more on the way,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kant-lauds-yogi-govt-for-corona-pandemic-mgmt/articleshow/88420812.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Agra||Monitor steps taken to curb Yamuna pollution in Vrindavan: NGT to chief secy||Agra: In a significant order, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the UP chief secretary and the Oversight Committee to monitor the measures taken by the state agencies in curbing pollution in river Yamuna in Vrindavan. The green tribunal was displeased with the inadequate steps taken to clean the holy river. The order was issued after the committee, constituted by the tribunal for monitoring compliance of environmental norms in UP, headed by Justice SVS Rathore, former judge of the Allahabad High Court’s Lucknow Bench, had filed its report on December 15. The committee had recommended further action to prevent discharge of untreated sewage and effluents into the drains connected to the river as it is a major cause for the deteriorating water quality. The committee also said the state authorities must ensure availability of necessary funds. The Mathura Vrindavan Development Authority (MVDA) must undertake plantation drives and take steps to clear encroachments on the riverbed and banks. The grievance of the applicant about discharge into Akroor drain also needs to be looked into. Akash Vashishtha, counsel for the petitioners, Acharya Damodar Shastri and Vijay Kishore Goswami, argued that the situation of the Kosi drain that carries the entire industrial discharge of Kosi town into the Yamuna in Vrindavan had not been correctly reflected in the Oversight Committee report. "The report observes that there was no water in the drain at the time of inspection. The correct position is that it remains perpetually filled with untreated effluents and sewage,” the petitioners claimed. The committee found that the quality of water downstream was poorer than that of upstream, indicating clearly that the drains falling in river Yamuna in the Vrindavan stretch were causing water pollution. It recommended that the authority concerned must be directed to ensure that the bio/phyto remediation works are done properly to maintain the water quality within the limits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/monitor-steps-taken-to-curb-yamuna-pollution-in-vrindavan-ngt-to-chief-secy/articleshow/88419153.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

---||Hyderabad||T bucks the trend, IPS promoted and ‘detained’ in same post||Hyderabad: Usually, when an IPS officer gets promoted, he or she moves up the ladder to the next level to an appropriate posting. Telangana, however, bucks the norm. The latest example is that of Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar, who has been promoted to the rank of director-general (DG) and retained in the same post, while some officers working in the city commissionerates have been promoted years ago, but still continue to work in the same position with a change of designation. In April 2019, the state government had promoted superintendents of police (SPs) of the 2004 and 2005 batches, VB Kamalasan Reddy, V Siva Kumar, S Chandrasekhar Reddy, AR Srinivas, P Viswa Prasad, Avinash Mohanty and M Ramesh to the rank of deputy inspector general (DIG). After the promotion, before his transfer in July 2021, Kamalasan Reddy continued as Karimnagar commissioner and recently he was given in-charge Hyderabad DIG post. Siva Kumar is continuing in intelligence as DIG, Chandrasekhar Reddy continued as district head of police for Sangareddy in DIG rank till he was transferred to Ramagundam commissioner in July, AR Srinivas, M Ramesh, P Viswa Prasad and Avinash Mohanty have been continuing as joint commissioners in their respective deputy commissioner of police (DCP) posts in the Hyderabad commissionerate. The 2006 batch officers, Nizamabad commissioner Kartikeya and Nalgonda SP AV Ranganath, who were promoted to the rank of DIG in the first half of 2020, are still continuing in the same posts. Hyderabad additional commissioner of police, (Crimes) Shikha Goel, who has been promoted to the rank of additional director general in April 2019, is continuing in the same post. The 1995 batch IPS officer, Mahesh Bhagwat, who became the first police commissioner of Rachakonda in July 2016, was promoted to the rank of of ADG in June 2020 and retained in the same post. While talking about the ‘promoted and retained in the same post’ phenomenon in the state, an affected officer, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Promotion is an acknowledgement of performance and experience of an officer in a particular role.” “The new role means new challenge and new experience. If an officer is promoted and retained in the same role, he or she misses out the opportunity to experience and serve in the new role. People retained in commissioner posts in the state capital after the promotion may feel differently, but it is just an exception,” a DIG-rank officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-bucks-the-trend-ips-promoted-and-detained-in-same-post/articleshow/88419784.cms||---

The stretch near the community hall, Khalla road was in a pathetic condition for almost a week. The uneven surface was making it difficult for many motorists to commute along the road. Despite multiple complaints, the issue was unresolved by GHMC authorities. “Due to the dug up road, traveling via the road was very difficult. For a week, the repair work was not taken up by the GHMC officials,” said Mubbesher Mehdi, the citizen reporter. After the grievance was aired in the TOI columns on December 11, the GHMC authorities swung into action and resolved the issue. “The GHMC authorities laid down the road and it is now in excellent condition. It is now up to the satisfaction of local residents. The entire credit goes to TOI and the GHMC authorities who acted upon the complaint after it was published in these columns,” said Mehdi. The GHMC laid a cemented road on the stretch which is used by hundreds of residents from the neighboring colony. “We have acted upon the issue as soon as it was brought to our notice,” said G Rajnikanth Reddy, deputy commissioner of Malakpet circle in Charminar zone, GHMC. The Chanchalguda area falls under his jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/chanchalguda-road-gets-a-makeover/articleshow/88419776.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||HC hears ST caste certificate issue||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the petitioners to reply to the state government’s affidavit on the contentious subject of scrutiny of tribal caste certificates for the pastoralists living in Gir, Alech and Barda forests in Saurashtra. The petitioners, belonging to Rabari and Charan communities, have questioned the state government’s decision to appoint a committee for scrutiny of caste certificates in February 2020. They submitted that this decision has been hurting the communities because they would lose prospects of getting admission in education institutes and government jobs in reserved category. They have contended that the government has stopped accepting caste certificates since then, though the caste certificates were issued to them on the basis of the Vigat Darshak Card, which was suggested by the Malkan Committee, which had in 1980s assessed the issue by surveying only 23% of over 15,000 families of these communities. The petitioners have insisted that since the communities living in the wilderness of Gir and two other forests have been included in the ST category through a Presidential order in 1956, it is not proper on part of the government to put the arrangement under scrutiny once again. They have expressed apprehension that such a scrutiny would deprive the community of the quota benefits. In response, the state government has made it clear that the appointment of the committee if purely for the purpose of scrutiny and its report would bring clarity on the issue, and there is no likelihood that the members of these communities would lose their reservation status. The advocate general also submitted that there was an unrest and demand from the tribal areas in the eastern part of the state that the reservation benefits under ST category are wrongly given to the communities in Saurashtra.  Members of these communities get away with major chunk of reserved posts and seats in education institutes. They claimed that only 480 families have been living in forest areas, whose family and descendants are entitled to the benefit of ST category. Most of those who have availed the quota benefit have moved out of forests for a couple of generations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-hears-st-caste-certificate-issue/articleshow/88419783.cms||---

The accused, Md Farook Ahmed, 44, is a real estate agent from Gagan Pahad area of Shamshabad. Farook, a native of Mahbubnagar, had gone to Saudi Arabia for work in 2005. After returning from Saudi Arabia in 2011, Farook married a woman from Kalwakurthy. “From 2011 onwards, Farook started dabbling in real estate business and borrowed money from several people. As pressure started mounting from the people who gave him money, Farook procured a country-made weapon in 2016 and killed two persons at Kalwakurthy and Mahbubnagar,” DCP Shamshabad N Prakash Reddy said.

---||Lucknow||‘ODOP goods now form 80% of our exports’||Lucknow: Crediting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the state’s One District, One Product (ODOP) Scheme, a programme which the central government has asked the other states to replicate, additional chief secretary (MSME) Navneet Sehgal said ODOP products now account for 80% of UP’s total exports. Speaking at the ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organised by the Times Group on Monday, Sehgal explained why the state required a scheme like ODOP and elaborated on the hard and soft interventions made under it to promote traditional handicraft across the state. “We have seen that wherever the MSME industry has come up, it has grown in clusters which gives benefits of turnover and economy of scale. There are several products across the state which are being made for centuries. While normal MSME activity was going on, thought was never given to how these traditional crafts could be encouraged. ODOP was an experiment to promote already existing clusters,” he said. Sehgal said a diagnostic study was done on one product from each district, to identify their strength, weakness, opportunity and threat. “On the basis of the study, the government looked at how to help small industries which had the basis but not the scale, by improving availability of raw material, technology, financial help, skill, packaging and marketing. Common facility centres are also being set up across districts, with disbursal of margin money to small artisans, training for skill improvement and market assistance scheme,” he said. Giving the example of animal bone buttons being made in Sambhal, Sehgal said the product was sent to China for finishing. “The diagnostic study found that if workers had access to suitable machines, they would be able to complete product finishing in Sambhal directly and export the product,” he added. “The government arranged for machines worth Rs 13 crore from Italy for finishing the product,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/odop-goods-now-form-80-of-our-exports/articleshow/88420820.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He said, "The campaign is gathering steam through media, door-to-door pamphlets and street plays. Since the matter is pending in the Supreme Court, an account is yet to be made to collect the bill amount.

Four months later, on December 20, police have registered an offence against him for causing his own death due to negligent driving. The Dewulkar couple was driving on the road between Kanji House Chowk and Rani Durgawati Chowk, while returning from a birthday party at Ramai Nagar in Jaripatka on August 3. They met with an accident at around 10pm. Jagdish, who was driving on the wrong side, had failed to balance his scooter while taking a turn, and they both fell. Though Sewantabai escaped unhurt, Jagdish had suffered substantial injuries. He was rushed to a private hospital near Rani Durgawati Chowk but later shifted to Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH). Doctors declared him dead on August 7. The police booth at the hospital alerted Yashodhara Nagar police about Jagdish’s death. Yashodhara Nagar police registered a case of accidental death under Criminal Procedure Code 174. The post-mortem was also conducted at IGGMCH. After prolonged investigations, along with the post-mortem and other reports, the cops wanted to file a summary of the death case before ACP Jaripatka division Roshan Pandit. However, the ACP decided that as per the norms a case needs to be registered against the senior citizen, holding him responsible for negligent driving leading to the accident. Senior inspector Sanjay Jadhav of Yashodhara Nagar police station said the senior citizen was technically held responsible because he had driven the two-wheeler on the wrong side and taken a turn which caused him to lose balance and sustain an injury from the fall. “We will now send an abated summary of the case to the court, informing about the death of the accused in the case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/80-yr-old-booked-for-causing-scooter-accident-that-claimed-his-life/articleshow/88419786.cms||Soumitra Bose

When TOI visited the spot next to Umadevi Hospital, only half a foot of the tree was left on the ground. People living in the area stated that this was not the first time trees were cut down without the knowledge of the national highways authorities or the revenue officials. In September last year more than five trees were cut. Following this, residents urged highways officials to check the illegal felling of trees and take measures to protect them. A resident said that the highway department had earlier removed the trees to expand roads, however, saplings were planted again. “Those saplings have now grown into trees and are under threat,” he said. Another resident G Selvavel said, “Miscreants should have cut the trees at night.” Secretary of the Coimbatore district roads protection association M Devendran said seven trees were felled illegally last year. “The highway officials should act immediately and lodge a police complaint. They should ensure that strict action is taken against such practices,” he said. An official from the national highways department, when contacted, said that they had not received any complaint earlier. He assured that the spot will be inspected soon and suitable action would be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/two-more-trees-illegally-cut-down-on-mettupalayam-road/articleshow/88419789.cms||V Devanathan
---||Ahmedabad||High court asks Gujarat, Centre to say how they will fund acid attack victim’s surgery||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the state government to come up with a reply on Wednesday on how they can fund the surgery on the badly damaged esophagus of an acid attack victim, who has been under treatment since 2012. The state government and the Centre conceded before the court that the victim is entitled to compensation under its schemes. The question was which government should compensate the victim and under which scheme. Justice Sangeeta Vishen told the Centre that it would be too technical for it to say no to the victim for compensation. The state of Rajasthan has paid Rs 3 lakh compensation to her and the state of Gujarat has born the expenditure of her initial treatment. The 29-year-old woman is now seeking medical aid for a surgery that she needs to undergo in a private hospital for her damaged esophagus because she was forced to ingest acid allegedly by her husband and in-laws on August 13, 2012 in Alwar, Rajasthan. Her parents, who live in Gujarat, brought her to Ahmedabad. In 2017, she moved the high court for compensation. Now, the victim is seeking Rs 5 lakh financial assistance from the state government under the Central Victim Compensation Fund, and compensation of Rs 1 lakh under the Prime Minister National Relief Fund (PMNRF). Her advocate Nisarg Sanjay Shah submitted to the court that the victim has got some funds from voluntary organisation, but since the surgery would cost around Rs 8 lakh, she still falls short of Rs 5 lakh. After doctors in government hospitals expressed their inability to carry out surgery on the victim, she obtained opinions from other hospitals across the country. Two private hospitals including one in Ahmedabad showed their willingness to perform the surgery on her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-asks-state-centre-to-say-how-they-will-fund-acid-attack-victims-surgery/articleshow/88420369.cms||---

The state now has one crore vaccine doses in reserve, while the additional 80 lakh doses are expected to reach within 10 days. This would help the government scale up its inoculation programme and increase the first dose coverage of the benefeciaries to above 90%, health officials stated. “We are receiving vaccines evenry three to four days to ensure that state carries out 8-9 lakh inoculations a day,” a health official said. Till date, 12.84 crore anto-Covid vaccine doses have been administered in the state. This includes both the frst and second doses. The official said another 6 crore doses will have to be administered to cover the 9.14 crore beneficiaries in the state with both the shots. The number of vaccination in the state is expected to surpass the 2 crore mark in December with 10 more days left in the month.  “All districts have planned intensified vaccination programme. The number of vaccination in December is likely to surpass the incoluation figure for September (2.28 crore),” the official said. All districts in Maharashtra have recorded an increase in the daily inoculation with the state setting December 31 as the deadline to complete the first dose of all pending Covid vaccine beneficiaries. As on December 19, the state’s average of first dose coverage is 86.19%. Around 53.56% of the beneficiaries have received their second dose till the date. As many as 22 districts continued to be below the state average of vaccination. Thirteen districts were above the state’s average. “All the districts in the state have managed to push the first dose coverage to over 70% of the eligible adult population. “With ample stock of vaccines for December, we should achieve the 100% first dose target by the month-end,” another health official said. The beginning of November had registered a lull in vaccination. The inoculation rate gathered pace following the emergence of the Omicron variant of Covid in November-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharashtra-utilizes-1-4cr-vaccine-doses-this-month/articleshow/88419791.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Triple blasts accused can shift to Taloja to meet kin’||MUMBAI: Observing that the right of an undertrial prisoner to meet his family members, friends and legal advisors is to be protected, a special court on Monday allowed 2011 triple blasts accused Haroon Naik’s plea to move from Arthur Road jail to Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai.Naik, who has been lodged in jail for eight years so far, told the court his family and friends lived in Mumbra and were unable to spend an entire day to travel and meet him at Arthur Road jail in South Mumbai. Allowing his plea, the special judge said, “The applicant under trial prisoner Haroon be transferred from Mumbai Central Prison to Taloja Central Prison. The superintendent of Taloja Central Prison, after accepting custody of undertrial prisoner Haroon, report to the court.” Naik cited a Supreme Court judgement which said if an undertrial prisoner is lodged in a distant jail, it may adversely affect his right to defend himself and isolate him from “society of his friends and relations”. On July 13, 2011, bombs exploded at Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar and a bus stop near Dadar Kabutarkhana, leaving 27 dead and 130 injured. In January 2012, Naik, Naqi Ahmed, Nadeem Akhtar and Kanwarnain Pathreja were arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy. The police said Yasin Bhatkal, the alleged mastermind, had sent explosives from Delhi and Naqi received them. They added Naqi stole one of the scooters in which a bomb was planted. Naik’s plea said Taloja jail is at a much shorter travelling distance from his residence, hence, his family and relatives could meet him regularly if he is transferred there. The Arthur Road jail superintendent did not object to his plea. “The applicant has been facing custody for last 8 years, during which on very few occasions he had to meet his family members due to his long distance stay at Mumbai Central Prison... his trial will take time further,” the court noted while allowing Naik’s plea. While charges are framed against the accused, the trial is yet to commence. Meanwhile, accused Nadeem Akhtar moved a plea urging the court to expedite the trial. He also moved a plea for English translation of all the investigation papers that are in another language. The court directed the prosecution to submit a reply. It allowed his plea to speak to his sister over phone after he submitted that she had become a mother for the first time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-triple-blasts-accused-can-shift-to-taloja-to-meet-kin/articleshow/88421176.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Lucknow||‘UP third biggest economy, offers positive ecosystem for growth, entrepreneurship’||Lucknow: At least 24% of Uttar Pradesh is now urbanized due to the initiatives taken by the state government, according to additional chief secretary (ACS), urban development, urban employment and poverty alleviation, Rajneesh Dube. “Uttar Pradesh is the third biggest economy at Rs 17.06 lakh crore. It has 17 nagar nigams, out of which seven look after cities, most of them in west UP, with over one million population. At least four more cities are on the cusp of having population of over one million,” said the ACS while speaking at the ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organised by the Times Group. “This makes it a good market place and a positive ecosystem for entrepreneurship,” said Dube, who is also the state mission director for Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). The state has 734 urban local bodies (ULBs). The ACS based his presentation on sustainable development goals, the roadmap of which was laid in the Rio Summit, 2012. It focused on how economies and countries will move towards various goals in terms of welfare and technological advancement. The most important goal for urban transformation is sustainable cites and communities. “Uttar Pradesh, with the score of 77 on urban transformation, is one of the frontrunners in the country. In the last five years, UP has won several recognitions. It was the first in the implementation of smart city mission, first in the implementation of PM Awas Yojana (Urban), one of the best performing states in the implementation of PM Svanidhi Yojana, Light House Project. UP is also a high performing state under RERA, one of the top five states in SBM (Urban) and Metro and RRTS projects and has witnessed the largest number of green buildings coming up in the last five years,” he said. “Indian Green Building Council, Hyderabad, presented UP with the Green Champion Award this year for encouraging construction of largest number of green buildings,” the ACS said. The presentation by the ACS on sustainability or city resilience had four parts – environmental considerations, economic growth, inclusive growth, and reforms & key intiatives. “The first aspect of clean and green cities is operation of electric buses. Currently, all major cities either have electric buses or will have them by December-end. There are SPVs in 14 cities for operation of electric buses. At least 400 buses are on the road. There will be total 700 buses covering 126000 km every day. The buses have CCTV cameras, panic buttons, and passenger information system. “This has changed the experience of travelling and reduced air pollution,” he said. An 82km stretch of Delhi-Meerut RRTS corridor is under construction with an investment of Rs 35,000 crore. It is a first of its kind in India and being constructed by NCRTC. An express line of 33.64 km from Jewar airport to Noida/Delhi is being constructed. Work on metro projects is being carried out in Agra and Kanpur and DPR for Gorakhpur Metro has been passed,” he said. “On Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), UP has won 15 awards in different categories. UP ranked 18th on SBM rankings in 2018 and climbed to 6th spot in 2020. At least 35 processing plants for solid waste management have been sanctioned,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-third-biggest-economy-offers-positive-ecosystem-for-growth-entrepreneurship/articleshow/88420826.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Hyderabad||‘Parking Mafia Still At Play’||I recently visited a mall in Kukatpally and was shocked when the lady manning the parking area forced me to cough up Rs 30 towards parking fee. And this despite me showing her bills to prove that I had shopped in the mall. I argued with her for a while, but when she refused to let me go, I had no choice but to cough up the money. Immediately after that I raised the issue with the directorate of enforcement vigilance & disaster management (EVDM), who came and collected the parking receipt from me. While the officials assured that the mall will be fined for this, I am not sure if that has been collected. But I strongly feel this menace needs to stop. This is sheer harassment. -- P Priyanka I recently visited the government hospital in Koti with a friend, who was suffering from an ear infection. Not only is finding parking space in the area a hassle there is also the problem of parking fee. Worse, those collecting the fee are not even issuing receipts, at least for two-wheelers. As a result, there is no way that people can even lodge a complaint against them. When I spoke to some people about it, they said that they have repeatedly informed the hospital administration about it, but no action has been taken so far. I request the Telangana government to take legal action against such parking mafia so that people visiting such establishments are not constantly harassed and inconvenienced. -- Syed Shamsuddin Maghrabi Going to the Marredpally playground in Secunderabad has become a problem for players because vehicles are being constantly fined for parking. On November 10 we were charged Rs 250. When we sent an email to the concerned officials about it, we were told that our vehicle was on the carriageway and therefore, we needed to pay a fine. I fail to understand how this has become an issue all of a sudden. Every day, around 100 to 150 players come to the ground for practice and park their vehicles in front of the ground. Never was there a parking fee issue before. I don’t know what has changed now. In fact, because of this many parents have stopped getting their children for to play at the ground. I think the authorities must sincerely look into it and resolve it. -- L Rajender I am a customer of a bank that is situated on the ground floor of Navakaten Complex, in S D Road, Secunderabad. Each time I visit the bank there is a team of people collecting parking fees for two and four-wheelers. No matter how many times you tell them that it is illegal to collect parking fees, it falls on deaf ears. As a common citizen, I request you to please highlight this issue. -- Arun Kumar I took my father to a private hospital in Nanakramguda last month. Shockingly, while existing the premises, I was asked to pay Rs 40 for my four-wheeler that was parked there for about two hours. How can a hospital charge a parking fee? Is that even allowed? Also, if I have to go by the rule that is applicable to commercial establishments, as long as I have a bill to show that I made a purchase in the building (in this case, hospital bill), I should be allowed to park for free, right? How is this even justified? Hope the government cracks down on such illegalities soon. – Keya Chatterjee I am a resident of Meerpet area and once a while I visit a place of worship in Karmanghat with friends and family. While there is a large area for vehicles in front of it, I am always charged a parking fee for my vehicle. As far as I know, there should not be any money charged for people going to a religious place. And even if there is one, shouldn’t that be altered? How can you charge people going to a place to pray? – Ajay K Charging of parking fee is a regular occurrence at the Musheerabad fish market, especially on Sundays. Though many people have raised their voice against it, nothing has been done about it so far. I am highlighting it here again to see if officials finally take cognisance of the matter. – Chalapathi Rao ………………………… QUOTE This problem is widespread in the city. Right from several top corporate hospitals to popular malls, many establishments are found either illegally leasing out their parking spaces or levying predefined parking charges (anywhere between `25 and `40), which is also prohibited under law. And this has been happening despite multiple escalations by residents. —Vijay Gopal | activist He has been championing this cause of illegal parking fee for a long time. WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY? In March 2018, the Telangana government issued an order – GO No 83 – to rationalise and regulate the parking fee collected by multiplexes/commercial establishments/malls for the interest of public and avoid misuse of the space by outsiders. It stated that the commissioner, GHMC will take necessary penal action against anybody found deviating from the order. According to the order it was decided: - No parking fee will be collected from any person for the first 30 minutes - For those parked between 30 minutes and one hour, there will be no fee if the person who has parked the vehicle can produce a bill – proof of having shopped in the mall/multiplex. For the rest, prescribed parking fee will be collected - For those parked over an hour, no fee will be levied if the person can produce a bill/movie ticket for an amount that is more than the parking fee, being charged for the said duration. Others will have to pay a fee, as prescribed. Soon after this, the government issued a clarification stating that GO 83 was not only applicable to malls and multiplexes but all commercial establishments, institutional buildings including standalone cinema theatres, hospitals etc, wherever parking is part of the building permission. It stated that an individual must be exempt from paying a parking fee if he/she can produce a relevant receipt – theatre ticket/hospital/OPD/in house receipt and/or other such document to prove he/she used the premises for intended purpose. In July 2021, the Telangana government issued fresh orders allowing standalone theatres to collect parking charges -- Rs 20 for two-wheelers and Rs 30 for four-wheelers. This was done, following an appeal from the pandemic-hit film industry, to help them recover their losses. The order, however, categorically stated that the previous parking fee rule was still binding on the rest. ...................................... How can you register a complaint? Aggrieved residents can either complain through the GHMC app, Twitter or via post — addressing it to EVDM. The purchase bill and parking fee receipt must be attached to the complaint. The same procedure must be followed by commercial establishments wishing to appeal against a complaint, said a GHMC official. ................................ Tweets @jayaram1144:  Parking fee collecting from movie goers @IndiaCinepolis. Charging parking fee @ mantra mall Hyderabad. @thrinadh2·  @KTRTRS Sir we all know that paid parking is ruled out in theatres and malls in Hyderabad …came to know today that they started again charging parking fee @Yashashwi007:  Care hospitals (banjara hills) management collected parking fee of Rs50.I went to hospital on a purpose of blood donation. Is this legal to collect parking fee?... and this is happening in whole Hyderabad, in all hospitals and shopping malls.

The firemen controlled it in time else it would have spread to the adjoining shops, most of which were stocked up with hosiery goods.Around 9am, the neighbouring shopkeepers called up the fire department, which first sent small fire tenders to the spot, followed by the bigger ones. “It was a struggle to reach the site due to the rush in the market. We had to work carefully as high-tension wires were passing over the shop,” said a fireman.“The flames had engulfed the shop and there was very less space to reach its two floors as the stock was kept everywhere and the stairs were quite narrow. Its stock has been gutted. The shopkeepers, who had called us up, said they heard a blast, after which plumes of smoke started rising,” added another fireman.The blaze was brought under control in two hours. Leading fireman Rajinder Singh said, “Four fire tenders were put on the job. The congestion in the market created hurdles. Even the shop is constructed on a small area. Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident.”BJP leader Deepak Sharma, whose mother is the area councillor, said, “The fire was controlled in time, preventing it from reaching other shops.”Traders blame hanging wiresThe market shopkeepers said, “A short circuit triggered a blast and a fire in the overhead dangling wires. The flames soon caught the shop. We controlled the wire fire. We have complained about the hanging wires several times, but no action was taken.”Rules floutedThe three-storey shop is constructed in a small area against the building bylaws and lacks fire safety arrangements. The building branch had earlier served notices on the market shopkeepers for getting change of land use done from the municipal corporation to get it declared a commercial area. Political pressure, however, forced them to rollback the notices. According to rules, construction cannot take place at a site over which high-tension wires are passing, Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/fire-destroys-garment-shop-in-congested-gandhi-nagar-mkt/articleshow/88419170.cms||---

Patel reprimanded the administration for the delay in providing mark sheets and degree certificates to students. She raised questions about the case related to fake degree certificates issued by the university. She highlighted the fact that very few colleges affiliated with the university have been graded by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council. "The university administration developed five buildings but didn’t spell out the steps taken to provide quality education," Patel said. She expressed discontent over the lack of research activities at the university. Warning officials, the governor said those found involved in malpractices will be punished. The governor said, “Lakhs of degrees are pending. Fake degrees were found. The case of 5,000 fake degrees went to the high court. Isn’t it our responsibility? Officers should now take a vow that not a single degree issued should be fake.” "Teachers have been here for as long as 30 years but they could not bring any change. Nothing was done for the good of the university. Colleges are lagging in the National Institutional Ranking Framework ranking. There are 800-900 colleges associated with the university but only 2-3 colleges have the NAAC grade,” Patel said. The governor added that she has 300 files related to various malpractices in her office. In her speech, Patel directed the university administration to ensure that students indulge in research work. She proposed that the university adopt five villages to promote development. "Women self-help groups in rural areas must also be supported," she said. She added, “The Yamuna river is being neglected. The university must make efforts to preserve the river. It should encourage students to conduct cleanliness and plantation drives on its banks. Such activities must be conducted every month.” She said every university must have a happiness center where positive discussions on various subjects concerning students can take place. "Teachers should regularly go to these centres and guide students beyond the academic sphere," she added. The governor handed eight DLitt, 45 PhD and 93 MPhil degree certificates at the convocation ceremony. A total of 109 medals were provided to 69 meritorious students of different courses. Out of these, 74 medals were provided to females and 35 to males. Shivani Singh, an MBBS student of S N Medical College, received the maximum number of medals at 12. Meanwhile, a dozen student leaders trying to stage protests outside the varsity premises were detained by the police. Student leaders associated with the National Student Union of India and Samajwadi Chatra Sabha raised slogans against the state government and university administration. The main objective of the protest was the university administration not conducting student union elections for the past four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-guv-slams-agra-university-officials-at-convocation-ceremony/articleshow/88419189.cms||Deepak Lavania

Gujarat in 24 hours recorded 88 new Covid-19 positive cases, up from 70 on Monday. Ahmedabad city recorded 33 cases, up from 13 on Monday. It’s 174-day high daily cases for Gujarat and 183-day high daily cases for Ahmedabad. At 589, the state’s active cases are already five-month high.

Rajkot city and Valsad recorded deaths of two active patients, taking the state’s official death toll to 10,104. “Analysis of the cases reveal that 74% of the daily cases were from municipal corporation areas. The reason could be higher population, higher testing and higher movement of citizens. Need of the hour is to ensure that all the persons with symptoms for Covid-19 are tested, isolated and treated in time to reduce chances of community spread,” said a city-based critical care specialist. Gujarat in 24 hours vaccinated 2.16 lakh persons, taking the total to 8.75 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/citys-daily-cases-up-by-154/articleshow/88420370.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata civic polls: Left loses wards but gains vote percentage||KOLKATA: For the Left, the KMC election results turned out to be a mixed bag, with the Front registering a higher vote percentage than that in the 2021 Bengal assembly polls but losing more number of wards than that in 2015 civic elections. This time, the Left won two wards, while the figure was 15 in 2015. CPI candidate Madhuchhanda Deb won from Dhakuria (Ward 92) by 2,178 votes, while CPM’s Nandita Ray won from Santoshpur (Ward 103) by 86 votes, allowing Left to retain its presence in the KMC, especially after the Left-Congress whitewash in the Bengal assembly polls. The Left vote percentage increased from 10.5% to 11.9% in the civic polls, while that of BJP decreased to 9% from 20%. The phenomenon indicates that the Left for once could break the Mamata-Modi binary that had become a trend in Bengal politics after the 2019 LS polls. The Left outpaced the BJP in 65 out of 144 wards. But the Left couldn’t retain its traditional strongholds in the Garia-Bijoygarh-Tollygunge-Jadavpur belt. For the first time, CPM candidate Mrityunjoy Chakrabarty from Ward 98 lost a KMC poll. He lost by a margin of 294 votes. CPM candidate Chayan Bhattacharya lost from Ward 111 by 584 votes, while party veteran Ratna Ray Majumdar lost from Ward 128 by 1,019 votes. CPI veteran Karuna Sengupta lost from Ward 10 and CPM candidate Sujata Saha from Ward 21 by 44 votes. In most of these wards, Left could make up the difference it had with Trinamool in the Bengal assembly polls to a large extent. The losing margin of Left varied between 46 and 1,019 when Trinamool had an average win of above 5,000 votes in most wards. One reason for the Left failing to make the kill in these wards was the sharp drop in the BJP vote percentage, followed by a substantial surge in the Trinamool vote percentage. Another important feature in the Kolkata civic polls was the visibility of the Left compared to the minimal presence of the BJP, except in select wards in central Kolkata. The Left and Congress had put up at least a fight in the civic polls, sending out an impression they were yet to be written off. The increase in Left vote percentage, though marginal, would be a boost for the Left ranks, otherwise pushed to the wall in the Mamata-Modi binary. CPM leader Rabin Deb thanked the 3 lakh citizens who voted for the Left despite “the Trinamool intimidation” in civic polls. The CPM leader alleged the Trinamool was taking the same route in Ward 98 and other wards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/left-loses-wards-but-gains-vote-percentage/articleshow/88419805.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The Cowin data suggested that around 94 lakh doses (first and second) were administered in the 18-44 age group. Over 20 lakh doses have been administered in the above-60 age group so far. The public health department officials claimed that the district had ample doses to continue with smooth vaccination drive for the second dose beneficiaries. An official said the Har Ghar Dastak campaign started in November was proving to be one of the important highlights of the vaccination drive. “Many unvaccinated people and those due for the second dose were identified through it,” said the official. The district health officials are focusing on Pune rural areas currently on the vaccination front. Around two lakh unvaccinated people are there in these pockets, while about five lakh people are due for their second dose. A total of 52,929 beneficiaries were vaccinated across the district’s 658 government and private vaccination sites till 8pm on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-60-lakh-residents-fully-vaxxed-in-district/articleshow/88419797.cms||---

There are nine functional airports, of which three are international, he said. Addressing The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave, Goyal said in addition to existing airports, two international airports were under construction, one in Noida which would be the largest airport in the region and the other in Ayodhya. “We have already provided land to Airports Authority of India and they will be starting construction very soon. In 2017, there were 25 destinations in UP which were connected to airports. Now, this number is 74. Areas around airports are also evoking a lot of interest among investors, particularly the Noida International Airport. Investors are making a beeline in this region,” he said. The development agency under which the airport is coming up had taken out a scheme for residential plots which were over-subscribed by 80-100 times, he added. He said there were many small airports and airstrips which the government was trying to put to use as training academies or flying clubs.  Director, civil aviation, Kumar Harsh said smaller airports were being developed in Aligarh, Shrawasti, Moradabad, Chitrakoot and Azamgarh. “Azamgarh is going to take off in a big way as there is demand for flights to west India. The project is at the final stage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govts-focus-is-on-infra-connectivity/articleshow/88420831.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: GSSSB head clerk exam scrapped, re-test in March||GANDHINAGAR: The state government announced on Tuesday that it has decided to cancel the written test for recruitment of head clerks in government departments after the exam paper was leaked. Minister of state for home Harsh Sanghavi said the re-test will be conducted in March. Meanwhile, Gandhinagar police on Monday night arrested Jayesh Patel, 39, allegedly the prime accused in the conspiracy behind the question paper leak. The paper leak case will be tried in a fast track court to “set an example”, Sanghavi told reporters in Gandhinagar after a meeting with chief minister Bhupendra Patel. He said the CM decided to cancel the exam in the interest of the nearly 88,000 candidates who taken it. “A fresh exam will be conducted in March 2022 in a more transparent manner and using a different method. All candidates who had filled forms for the previous test will be considered eligible for the new test,” the minister said. So far, 14 people have been arrested from various parts of the state in connection with the case. The FIR concerning the leak was lodged at Prantij police station a week ago, under Indian Penal Code Sections 420 (cheating), 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy), he said. Meanwhile, opposition parties raised the tempo against the government, with Congress seeking an investigation by a a sitting HC judge and AAP seeking a special investigation team (SIT).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gsssb-head-clerk-exam-scrapped-re-test-in-march/articleshow/88420373.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Sim reissued: Sweet shop in Ahmedabad loses Rs 75 lakh||AHMEDABAD: A leading sweetmeat shop chain in the city lost Rs 75 lakh to cybercrooks through an elaborate sim card hacking and cloning swindle. In this case, the mobile phone of an employee which was linked to the business’s online banking accounts was suddenly disconnected on November 27. When it got re-activated on November 29, the employee learned that money had been transferred to five accounts. Anish Trivedi, 52, who has worked for the Kandoi Bhogilal Mulchand sweetmeat chain for 20 years, said the company has six current accounts, with which his and his employer’s mobile numbers have been linked. Trivedi said that for any online transaction, only he gets the one-time password (OTP) on his mobile phone. On November 27 at around 8.15pm, his phone suddenly got disconnected after which he called a friend who works for a telecom company. His friend suggested that he put the sim card in a 2G phone, but he still did not get a signal. He later approached his telecom service provider, and was told to submit his KYC (know your customer) documents, which he did, but even two days later, his sim card was not re-activated. Two days later, on November 29 at around 8pm, it started working and he began receiving messages about banking transactions. He learned that Rs 50 lakh had been debited from one account and Rs 25 lakh from another in12 different transactions. Trivedi called his banker and found that the money had gone to five different accounts between November 27 and November 29. A cyber crime expert, on this modus operandi, said cybercriminals, after securing their victim’s data such details of their bank account, credit card, PAN number, address, date of birth and mobile phone numbers, get a fake PAN card made, and then get a new sim card issued in the victim’s name. Once the new sim card is issued, the victim’s mobile phone with the old sim card gets deactivated. This ensures the victim doesn’t get messages about the use of their bank account while the the money is being transferred. In such cases, the mobile phones of the victims get disconnected because the cybercriminals apply for a new SIM card. Only after they check their bank accounts, do the victims realize they have been swindled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cybercrooks-get-sim-card-issued-sweetmeat-chain-loses-rs-75l/articleshow/88419808.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Govt’s aim is to make Uttar Pradesh No. 1 economy in the country: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Earlier, development was for family, and not keeping the state in mind. Development meant person, family and if at all, was limited to caste. This cannot be the basis of sustainable development. We considered UP as one big family and will take it ahead as a USD 1 trillion economy, said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath The Times of India Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave on Monday. “Our task force is working on some sectors and our aim is to make UP into the number one economy in the country. We have moved from the sixth to the second position but we have to be number one. For this, some more work is needed and we need the blessings of the public for it. I am sure, if that happens then there will be no delay in establishing UP as a USD 1 trillion economy,” the Chief Minister added. Yogi said that the previous government had left the state with no funds and no bank was willing to lend to them. As a result, he had to ensure that there were sufficient resources with the state to be able to fulfil this election promise. “Humare vipaksh ke dost khazana kuchh aise noch ke gaye thhe ki humare paas kuch nahin thha. In such a situation, how could we fulfil our promise to the farmers. I was not calling the cabinet but waiving off the debt was to be our first decision and we did not have the money. The principal secretary (finance) came to me and asked to be transferred to some other department,” the CM said. He added that when he sat with the official and discussed the expenditure under various heads, he was told that the previous government had set aside Rs 5,000 crore as pension for its cadre. “I cancelled this. Then I was told that Rs 15,800 crore was for Purvanchal Expressway and I said not more than Rs 11,000 crore should be allocated for it. We went through several more projects and managed to free up Rs 25,000 crore like this. Then I called for the cabinet the next day and without any additional burden on the people, without taking loans or stopping any existing scheme, we cleared the most successful scheme of this government,” he said. He revealed that after this, bankers who were earlier not even taking his calls came up and said they wanted to invest in the Bundelkhand project. However, by then, the CM had decided that only budgetary funds would be used for projects and the government would not take loans. Another problem he faced when he came to power, the CM said, was that of UP’s image. When he decided to host an investors’ summit in Lucknow in 2018, he claimed that officers told him that nobody wanted to invest in the state. Even PM Narendra Modi, he said, sounded amused. He asked Yogi how he was planning to host a successful summit with not even a year in power. “I asked my team to do road shows. In the first, they got proposals of Rs 2,000 crore, in the second, Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore in the third. By the fourth one, even they were tired and I said I will go for the fifth. In this way, I attended the road show in Mumbai and we received proposals for Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Investors told me that they did not want to invest in UP but in the past six months, they had heard such good things about the state that they wanted to come and invest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govts-aim-is-to-make-up-no-1-economy-in-the-country-yogi/articleshow/88420837.cms||Neha Lalchandani

While eight of these cases came to fore via the Mumbai airport surveillance, one person each tested positive for the strain in Osmanabad and Navi Mumbai. With this, the state’s tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases linked to the Omicron variant has shot up to 65, while that of the district now stands at 22. The Pimpri Chinchwad case is a 29-year-old woman with travel history to Dubai. She had arrived in the PCMC limits on December 12 and tested positive for Covid-19 on December 17, after which her swab sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) for genome sequencing, which confirmed the presence of Omicron variant on December 21. An official from the PCMC health department said the patient was vaccinated and asymptomatic. She is being treated at New Bhosari hospital. “We also traced and tested five close contacts of the patient. All of them have been found negative for the contagion. They will be tested again after a week,” said the official. Laxman Gophane, assistant medical officer, PCMC, told TOI, “ With the Tuesday’s result, the tally of Omicron patients in Pimpri Chinchwad has reached 12, of which 10 have recovered, while only two patients are active.” A press statement from the state health department stated, “Out of the eight patients who tested positive in Mumbai Airport surveillance, one each is from Kerala, Gujarat and Thane, while other patients are resident of Mumbai. There are two kids under the age of 18 among these patients. Among these, two patients have travel history to Uganda via Dubai, four have travel history to England and two to Dubai. Barring kids, all patients are vaccinated.” The 13-year-old daughter of an Omicron-infected patient from Osmanabad has also been found infected with Omicron, while a 19-year-old man from Navi Mumbai, who arrived from Kenya via Hyderabad, also tested positive for Omicron on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/1-pimpri-chinchwad-resident-among-11-new-omicron-cases/articleshow/88419806.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Fadnavis wants to suppress the on-going probe,” he claimed. Malik pointed out that the recruitment exams are conducted by companies selected by the erstwhile BJP government led by Fadnavis. “All these companies had the patronage of Kaustubh Dhawase, officer on special duty to the then CM. We have blacklisted some of the companies after detecting certain irregularities in the exams conducted in 2018,” he said. Dhawase did not respond to TOI’s message, while BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye alleged that Malik himself is linked to the irregularities in the recruitment exams. “BJP legislators will expose Malik during the winter session of state legislature,” he said. “The firms were empaneled on March 4, 2021, and not during Fadnavis’s tenure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fadnavis-wants-to-stifle-hiring-exam-scam-probe-in-mumbai-malik/articleshow/88421181.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Nashik||Full vaccination, RT-PCR must for guests at resorts in Igatpuri||Nashik: Anticipating a heavy rush of visitors for Christmas and New Year’s Eve celebrations in the many hotels and resorts at Igatpuri, the health department has planned some stringent measures. Full vaccination as well as a negative report of an RT-PCR test conducted not more than 72 hours ago is mandatory for all guests at these hotels and resorts. The Igatpuri health administration has also created a group of informers to keep a tab on the health of tourists who come to the famous hill station during Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Igatpuri witnesses footfall of around 6,000 tourists during these celebrations and a bulk of them are from Mumbai. The hill station is located around 120-km from the state capital. An official from the Igatpuri taluka health department said the informers comprise staff of over 54 resorts and security guards of over 200 weekend homes spread across the hill station. The owners of these weekend homes stay in other cities and visit Igatpuri during weekends. Such properties are taken care of by watchmen. “Our informers will inform the taluka health department if any guest is showing symptoms like cold, cough, fever etc. Once we get the information, our health team would visit that resort/weekend home. They would take a call on the next course of action after medically examining the patients,” the health official said. According to the officials, with the Omicron threat looming large, they have come up with this measure to prevent Covid spread. “It will be impossible for our teams to visit each resort and weekend home on a daily basis to keep a tab on tourists. But the staff and watchmen would be at these properties round-the-clock. They can share information with us on the health status of the tourists,” he added. Igatpuri taluka health officer Dr Mohemmed B Deshmukh told TOI that the department had some time back carried out a training programme for the resort managers to identify symptoms of Covid-19 so that they can find out if any of their guests has the symptoms. “All resorts have been directed to allow only fully vaccinated guests and whose RT-PCR tests were done within 72 hours before reaching Igatpuri. We have to take strict measures,” he said. Igatpuri had around 1,750 Covid cases and 42 deaths during the first wave of the pandemic and during the second wave, there were over 4,300 cases and 105 deaths. Currently, there are 38 active cases in Igatpuri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/full-vaccination-rt-pcr-must-for-guests-at-resorts-in-igatpuri/articleshow/88418374.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Meerut||Cane harvesting halted after leopardess, 2 cubs spotted in Bijnor village||Bijnor: Cane harvesting came to a halt on Tuesday i near Narayanpur in Bijnor after a leopardess and two cubs were spotted in the area. The forest department staff confirmed the presence of a big cat in the area after examining the pugmarks. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer of Bijnor, has issued an alert for the villagers. “We have appealed to the villagers to not go alone into the fields and take necessary precautions. We will conduct a survey of the sugarcane fields with drones to find the leopardess and prevent a man-wildlife conflict,” said the DFO. With cane harvesting on, leopard sightings are not uncommon as the big cats lurking amid the tall cane stalks are exposed and are forced to come out into the open. There have been several reports of leopards venturing near human habitats, causing a man-animal conflict situation. This time of the year coincides with the breeding season of the leopards and once the cubs are born, the protective mother leopardess turns aggressive and is a threat to humans. On December 10, all activities in the cane purchasing centre at Tapraula village in Bijnor’s Nahtaur region had been stopped for a couple of hours after a leopard was spotted there. Some farmers captured the big cat on camera looking about for a place to hide. Foresters estimate that there are around 100 leopards, including cubs, living in the cane fields, where they find ample prey like rabbits, deer, pigs, nilgai calves and other herbivores. Once considered a friend of the farmer in preventing the herbivores from destroying crops, the leopard population has increased manifold, proving to be a danger to the farmer himself. Last year, at least two villagers had died in leopard attacks while four leopards lost their lives. In 2019-20, the leopards killed six people. Now, farmers have started demanding that the leopards living in the cane fields be captured and shifted back to the forest. On their part, forest authorities have appealed to people to inform them if they find any big cat in their fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/cane-harvesting-halted-after-leopardess-2-cubs-spotted-in-bijnor-village/articleshow/88419199.cms||Harveer Dabas

The villagers, who have been protesting in front of the Guleli panchayat since Monday, did not rule out the possibility of reigniting the anti-IIT movement. It may be recalled that the government had decided to set up an IIT project at Shel-Melauli. However, after a six-month long massive agitation against the project, the government had to reverse its decision and scrapped the project in January earlier this year. Shubham Shivolkar, a villager of Melauli, said that during the agitation, the government had filed criminal cases against 40 protesters. “The villagers had made repeated demands to withdraw these cases. However, the government has not yet conceded to this demand,” Shivolkar said. Melauli locals had demanded that the government should take back possession of 1.5 lakh sqm of land that was transferred for the IIT project. The villagers had submitted a memorandum to the Guleli panchayat on December 9 demanding detailed information on the criminal cases filed against the protesters as well as the land issue. The panchayat had stated that it would provide the information at the gram sabha on December 12, but failed to do so. At the subsequent gram sabha on December 19, all the panch members, except Arjun Melekar, were absent. The villagers demanded another gram sabha on December 20, and a notice was issued in this regard. While the gram sabha was held again, all panch members, except Melekar, failed to attend the meeting. The livid villagers later held a day-long protest in front of the panchayat. On Tuesday, the villagers again gathered at the panchayat, where all panch members were absent, except Melekar. Shashikant Sawardekar, convener of Melauli Panchkroshi Gram Bachav Andolan, accused the panch members of hiding from the villagers. “Only a peon and panch member Melekar were present in the panchayat office. We don’t know where the rest of panch members are hiding,” Sawardekar said. Sawardekar said that the Melauli protest has restarted and will continue till the demands are met.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/melauli-locals-restart-protest-demand-withdrawal-of-cases/articleshow/88420404.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The mishap occurred on Monday night when two trucks collided and one of them crashed into an auto-rickshaw. According to police, the deceased were Sk Shakeel, 27, a welder, his wife Reshma Begum, 24, and their seven-month-old daughter Fathima from Mubarak Nagar in Ramagundam. The accident occurred on Monday night when Shakeel, along with seven of his family members, was travelling in an auto from Ramagundam to Indaram in Mancherial to attend a wedding. Near Ganga Nagar flyover on Rajiv Rahadari, the auto stopped as a lorry carrying a load of coal was taking a U-turn. “A truck carrying ash was coming down the flyover and it rammed into the coal truck taking the U-turn and fell on the auto that had stopped near the U-turn,” Godavarikhani II town police said. Alerted by locals, police immediately rushed to the spot and shifted the injured to the police. Shakeel, his wife and their daughter were declared brought dead. Their four family members and the auto driver escaped with injuries, police said. Based on the complaint lodged by the victims, a case was registered under sections 304-a (causing death due to rash or negligent act) and 337 (causing injuries due to rash or negligent act) of the IPC against the accused truck driver.

The Aam Aadmi Party demanded that the matter be investigated by a special investigation team (SIT). Congress MLA and leader of the opposition in the assembly, Sukhram Rathwa, said, “We asked the CM to appoint a sitting judge to investigate the matter. The fees paid by students for the exam should be refunded and office-bearers of the Gujarat Subordinate Services Selection Board (GSSSB) should be removed.” AAP member Yuvarajsinh Jadeja welcomed the decision to cancel the examination but said there were several questions that were still unanswered. “The papers of the examination ought to have been printed at a government press. Why was this printed at a private press? The role of the office-bearers of GSSSB also needs to be probed thoroughly. We want the formation of an SIT to investigate the matter,” said Jadeja, who claimed that 81 persons had prior knowledge of the exam paper leak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-seeks-probe-by-hc-judge-aap-an-sit/articleshow/88420401.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||For Secunderabad locals, it’s a long way home||HYDERABAD: Closure of roads in the Secunderabad Cantonment area has forced residents of civilian colonies to take major detours. At a time when voices to open all roads in the area grow louder, TOI takes a look at five routes where closure of roads has forced detours of at least of 5km to 7km amid heavy traffic for many commuters. For example, the distance between Generals Road, Yapral to Lakadwala Colony, Alwal, is barely 1.7 km. A drive on the stretch usually doesn’t take more than five minutes. However, due to closure of road by the local military authorities, the drive through an alternate route via Sree Ayyappa Devasthanam, Ayyappa temple compound, Cariappa Road, Bolarum now takes almost 30 minutes (for 7.6km) amid heavy traffic. The Ammuguda-Lakdawala Gate road was the standard route taken by people from Sainikpuri or Vayupuri who wanted to go to Bolarum, St Anns School, Nagpur highway, Loyola Academy, among other places. “The straight route from Ammuguda to Lakdawala is 2.5km as per Google maps. Today, a wall has been erected across this public road at Ammuguda due to which the traffic now has to go via Lothkunta, Alwal, a distance of 5.3 km to Lakdawala,” said CS Chandrasekhar, secretary of Federation of North-Eastern Colonies of Secunderabad. Other stretches that have been restricted include the Hislop road, Yapral, to Bison Environmental Park; Kowkoor to Cavalry Barracks Defence Officer’s Colony, Bolarum; RK Puram flyover underpass to Asha Officers Colony; to name a few. Residents rue that due to closure of these key roads, Yapral has lost direct connectivity to the rest of the city. “Since the road from Lakdawala towards Yapral, Risala Bazar are closed, those travelling from Alwal, Lothakunta, Bolarum have to take a much longer route. It is very inconvenient as traffic on other alternate routes is much higher,” said Vinod Anand, a resident of Yapral.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/for-secbad-locals-its-a-long-way-home/articleshow/88420068.cms||Preeti Biswas

In the Intermediate first year examination, 49% students had managed to clear the exam. Ever since the results were released, students and their parents, student leaders have been blaming the board and education minister, demanding that they be sacked for their failure in conducting online classes and conducting exams without a proper plan. Keeping in mind the Inter result fiasco of 2019, when 23 students had committed suicide because of technical errors in processing the results, the board has said to have sent this proposal. “The issue has been brought to the notice of the state and is being discussed since Monday,” an official said. Meanwhile, in the wake of the bandh call given by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, most junior colleges in the state remained shut on Tuesday. “During the pandemic, the government had left students high and dry without online classes. By conducting exams without classes, it has pushed lakhs of Inter students to uncertainty...,” ABVP Telangana general secretary Praveen Kumar said, adding at least now the state should respond and address the issue. SFI, AISF, PDSU, meanwhile, approached the State Human Rights Commission on Tuesday over the issue and submitted a representation seeking justice for the students. They asked the commission to intervene and ensure that all students get awarded at least pass marks. The board had announced that as there was no time to conduct supplementary examinations, students, who failed in the first year exams, would have to appear for these papers along with second year examinations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jr-colleges-shut-for-second-day-bie-submits-pass-plan/articleshow/88420137.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana keeping resources ready to battle Omicron spike||HYDERABAD: Even as the number of Omicron variant cases in the state is rising, the administration is quietly preparing for the next Covid-19 wave, including preparing doctors on usage of oxygen and maintaining oxygen audits. At a high-level meet recently, authorities said measures such as keeping the doctor on oxygen treatment stewardship were being initiated to prepare them for any eventuality as a single day’s highest peak caseload could touch 20,000 (during Delta variant outbreak, it was 10,000 cases). During the second wave, the state received approximately 10 oxygen tankers from the Centre, while a private company provided another eight oxygen tankers to the state. However, after the second wave receded, the tankers were returned. Officials are now considering taking them back for the next wave of preparation. At the moment, officials believe there is no cause for concern for children because there has been no increase in cases among children anywhere in the globe. “As part of preparation, oxygen treatment and supply are given highest priority in all districts. Doctors are trained in the administration and use of oxygen. Three doctors will be trained in each district on the best use of oxygen, reducing waste and maintaining hospital oxygen audits. They are on oxygen stewardship,” officials said. The authorities said all outstanding bills for medicine and other health-related supplies in hospitals should be cleared in order to avoid any disruption in oxygen supplies during a possible spike in Omicron cases. Officials also intend to conduct a reality check on beds and other facilities in hospitals. “Stringent checks will be conducted on the numbers depicted and the actual availability of beds in hospitals,” an official said. A group of officials is constantly monitoring the global trend of Omicron and taking into account Indian Council of Medical Research and World Health Organisation guidelines on a regular basis. Furthermore, district medical health officers and collectors were given the authority to declare district hospitals for Covid- 19 treatment if the number of cases increase by more than 10 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-keeping-resources-ready-to-battle-omicron-spike/articleshow/88420124.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Of these, nearly 86lakh are Covishield beneficiaries and 13lakh are Covaxin beneficiaries. They have not taken their second dose on the due date according to the data from the cowin app, stated officials. With deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar stating that those deliberately delaying the second dose will have to face grave consequences, local authorities have been told to list these individuals via the Har Ghar Dastak programme to ensure that they are given reminders to take the doses on time. In the wake of the Omicron variant, the state public health officials are urging people not to delay their second dose. Pawar said the administration will first persuade those skipping their second dose to take the second shot through the door-to-door campaign. “If people still refuse and do not cooperate, we shall have to decide on taking stern action,” he said. The action will be in terms of certain restrictions on people avoiding the second vaccine dose. He had said that people are not turning up for vaccination even though enough vials are available. As per the state government data, over 4.94 crore people have taken both the doses of vaccines, while over 7.89 crore people have taken only the first dose. In population aged above 45, about 85 per cent of people have taken at least one Covid-19 dose. Collectors in some districts lagging behind in terms of vaccination have imposed restrictions on people who have not taken the first and second vaccine. In Aurangabad district, the administration issued a notification in November that people who have not received the first dose of vaccine will not get petrol, LPG, or foodgrains in ration shop. The same has been done in Hingoli district, too. As on Tuesday, there are 7,111 active Covid-19 cases in the state, and a total of 65 cases of Omicron variant, of whom 34 cases have been discharged following negative reports. Districts lagging behind in the first dose are Thane, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon and Nanded. Doctors in the (state) task force (on Covid-19) have stressed on administering second dose at the earliest to ensure complete vaccination. ‘Vaccines are known to decrease severity and prevent deaths and citizens should get themselves vaccinated. Almost 81% of those detected with Omicron have been vaccinated,” stated officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/nearly-98l-people-delayed-or-skipped-second-jab-say-public-health-officials/articleshow/88419816.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Meerut||In a first, Muzaffarnagar police to deploy blockchain-based tech for 'smart policing'||Muzaffarnagar: In a first for the country, Muzaffarnagar police has entered into a 'smart policing' technological collaboration with 5IRE, a high-performance computing network that is based on blockchain technology. "Muzaffarnagar Police and 5IRE would be working together to leverage blockchain technology to build solutions for a smart and robust policing system that enhances accountability, transparency, citizen access, and interaction with law enforcement agencies," the senior superintendent of police (SSP) of Muzaffarnagar, Abhishek Yadav, said. Police would be running test pilot projects to examine the potential and compatibility of 5IRE’s technological solutions with its existing work processes. This will be in a "safe" and testnet environment during the initial stage, the police said. Some of the areas where blockchain-based technology will be used are traffic control, evidence-based intelligent solutions, the use of artificial intelligence in investigation procedures, and tamperproof maintenance of ledgers. "Blockchain is a futuristic technology that's going to change the work environment, making it robust, transparent, and intelligent. I am sure the Muzaffarnagar police's initiative will go a long way in providing smart solutions for smart policing in the state. Once the pilot project delivers, we'll replicate the same in the entire state," said Prashant Kumar, additional director general of police (law & order), Uttar Pradesh. Pratik Gauri, founder and CEO of 5IRE Network, said, "Trust is the foundation of a healthy relationship and this becomes especially important if the relationship in question is between the public and the police. The smart policing solution will focus on areas where more help from the police is needed. At the same time, this will ensure that the law enforcement agency is accountable, by making their actions more transparent to all stakeholders." According to Gauri, the project will work on the lines of how countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom search for the criminal record of individuals. Government departments will also have access to the police department's database and can check the background of any person. In the future, Gauri says private companies may be able to have limited access so candidates can get verified by the police before getting an offer to work. The technology may also make it easier for people to get passports, arms licences, character certificates, etc, said the company. It added that using the technology, the government can deny visas to foreigners with a criminal history during their past visit to India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-a-first-muzaffarnagar-police-to-deploy-blockchain-based-tech-for-smart-policing/articleshow/88419217.cms||Mohd Dilshad

Soon after the positive Covid test report, the students were shifted to the Nashik civil hospital for treatment. Kishor Shriwas, an additional civil surgeon at the Nashik civil hospital said that the treatment was given as per the government guidelines. Since all the students were asymptomatic, there was no special medication given to them. The concerned students continued to remain asymptomatic till the time of their discharge. The children performed yoga and appeared happy all through their stay in the hospital. While 11 children were discharged a couple of days back, three students were discharged on Tuesday. The medical officials said they were monitoring the health of the students round the clock. The students performed yoga daily and also sang religious songs. The medical officials said that since the students have been discharged, they would be quarantined at their respective homes. With the reports of a possible third wave of Covid-19 that could affect the children, the district health administration has made all the preparations at major government hospitals to provide treatment to the admitted children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/14-covid-ve-students-discharged-from-hosp/articleshow/88418386.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Since none of them have symptoms, they want to go home. The ones who had been eagerly looking forward to going home had been craving for biryani, sweets and speciality dishes. “While they have been put in isolation as per the centre’s guidelines, the fact that there is hardly any treatment given to them, is irking them,” said an attending doctor. “Some have even expressed concerns over the fact that their Omicron positive status will be known to others and they will have to be at the receiving end of discrimination,” another source added. While samples of passengers returning from at-risk nations, if tested positive in the RT-PCR test at the airport are immediately sent for genome sequencing, for the ones testing negative, home quarantine and a repeat test is done. If they test positive for the new variant, they are picked up from their homes. However, once shifted to TIMS, they are under strict observation. The effort to keep over 45 contacts of the patients in isolation at the hospital has also become a problem. “They are constantly looking for excuses to go out of the ward and interact with others. They are arguing with doctors on why they are kept at TIMS when there is no treatment being given,” added the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/omicron-patients-at-tims-get-testy/articleshow/88420108.cms||Amrita Didyala

Bouldering is a form of rock climbing stripped down to its raw essentials. Leaving behind ropes and harnesses and just using climbing shoes, your challenge is to climb short but tricky bouldering rocks using balance, technique, strength, and your brain. The higher you climb the more extreme everything becomes. It's the parallels between climbing and life that fascinates you. Why did I get drawn into it? Because it gave me the chance to explore inwardly, to understand who I am, where my limits lie and how I can live more and become more. Every day is a school day, and I learn something new with each adventure. The good news is that the fears are beatable. As I explain it in management language, bouldering is all about problem solving. This makes it good not just for the body but also for the mind. The complex decision making, combined with physical exertion, has helped me improve my memory function, concentration, creativity and at the same time decreases stress. I suggest everybody struggling with self-esteem and mental well-being, must give climbing a chance as it can go a long way to help with this. Not only does it help with proving one’s strength to oneself every time you climb but also help experience the endorphin rush of overcoming a problem that one thought was impossible to resolve. This can do wonders for a person’s self-image and make him/her keep coming back to get stronger every time. Hyderabad is known for its beautiful landscapes surrounded by a plethora of rustic boulders accessible by little trekking and passing through adorable green bushes. So, what are you waiting for? Try it out. (The writer is the HR professional) ...................................... Passionately created art from scrap By Usha Nagaraj Everyone’s perspective on the lockdown may vary, but a universal truth common to them all is that the status quo of daily routines was disrupted. This has led to large-scale transformation of people’s recreational and occupational endeavours. As for me, I delved neck-deep into art and craft. This has given me not only an opportunity to express myself freely but also to have a creative outlet that ultimately leaves me feeling rejuvenated with the passion of youthfulness. Not being able to step out, I decided to explore my capabilities in organisational artwork and frame building using every old scrap I could lay my hands on. Though the end result wasn’t very traditional in fashion, to my delight, it was eye catchy and brightened up the walls of my room. Another avenue I explored was cloth rangoli using old cloth. It was a fusion of south Indian ‘Kolams’ and Rajasthani patch work using old fabric. These experiences gave me a healthy exercise in recycling and sustainable resource management, unencumbered creative freedom, led me to beautify my home, and lastly taught me to be content in a post-apocalyptic lockdown situation. I am glad I used my time to explore artwork with what was available to me and I hope my story inspires others to do the same. It has given me great pleasure and I know it’ll do the same for you.

Led by M Krishank, chairman of Telangana Mineral Development Corporation, the protesters demanded the local military authorities (LMA) must open closed roads immediately for convenience of civilians. The protest was held following virtual jabs on Twitter between municipal administration and urban development minister K Taraka Rama Rao and MP for Secunderabad Kishan Reddy on the road closure issue. “Total 21 roads in the Secunderabad Cantonment area have remained shut for many years. Due to this, students, people going to the neighbouring churches among others have faced massive inconvenience as they were forced to take a detour,” said Krishank. Demanding reopening of all closed roads, the TRS leaders raised slogans and stood with banners saying “Open closed roads”. They demanded that the areas falling under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board must be merged with the GHMC for better facilities. “We would be intensifying our struggle by bringing together various resident welfare associations. Our struggle would continue to have a clear agenda on the issue,” added Krishank.

The bench of Chief Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Ashutosh Shastri had ordered two lawyers to inspect the building constructed by J K Infrastructure, which allegedly has an involvement of ex-mayor Ritaben Patel, and submit their report. This was after an ex-councillor, Pinkyben Patel, filed a petition through advocate Hardik Pandit complaining that the multi-storeyed building was built without development permission and was being utilised without any occupancy certificate. The court commissioners reported about the occupancy and usage of building. When the court questioned GMC’s lawyer whether it should direct the government to take action against the municipal commissioner for inaction against the building, the lawyer said that the building would be sealed within no time. The court questioned why the corporation was silent when shops are operating from the building without occupancy certificate. The judges pulled up GMC’s counsel for his arguments, which the court felt was in defence of the developer. The high court ordered the developer to file an affidavit clarifying which permissions he has received to put up the construction and permitting occupation and use. The court clarified that the “pendency of the petition would not come in the way of GMC from taking any coercive step including the sealing of the building, if it has withdrawn development permission and no occupancy certificate is issued”. When the developer’s advocate submitted that the developer has rectified all issues once it would brought to his notice, the court said that it hoped that nobody dies in fire accident. The court has posted further hearing on January 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-pulls-up-gmc-over-gandhinagars-tallest-building/articleshow/88420400.cms||---

Kumar, who released a report on National Level Survey on Learning Loss in School Education During the Pandemic, said that the next four to five months should be effectively used to bring every child to the pre-pandemic level so that learning can continue from next academic year. “Parents and teachers should observe changes in the behaviour of the children and try to correct them. It is also important that steps are taken to make them confident as many children are not confident in excelling in studies because of the gap of about one and a half years due to the pandemic,” said Kumar. In the survey conducted by National Independent Schools Alliance (NISA), it was revealed that despite attending online classes, about 45% students expressed difficulty in coping up with the present class in 2020-21 and 32.8% said that they were not feeling confident of pursuing the present class.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teachers-parents-must-help-boost-confidence/articleshow/88420168.cms||---

The process to hand over the cases to NCB was initiated after the Centre decided that the investigative agency should check for nationwide links in the cases. The two seizures include the 120kg heroin seized from a Morbi village on November 15 and 57kg of heroin and 6 kg of methamphetamine seized from Salaya town in Devbhoomi-Dwarka between November 10 and November 20. DGP Ashish Bhatia confirmed that the NCB will take up the probe soon. A senior officer of Gujarat police said, “After it was decided that the NCB would handle the big drug seizures, the NCB DG wrote a letter to the Gujarat DGP regarding the investigation. Later, the Gujarat home department officers and the DG decided to hand over the Morbi and Dwarka cases to the NCB.” Sources in the NCB confirmed the development, saying they will soon get the documents of the case and start probe. In the Morbi case, the Gujarat ATS had on November 15 found 120kg of heroin from Jinjuvada village in Morbi district. Investigation revealed that it had been brought from Pakistani drug mafia and the delivery was made mid-sea in the last week of October. The haul was meant to be transported to Punjab. The Morbi drugs case also involved names of drug mafia in Maharashtra, Punjab and Delhi. A Nigerian national and six others were arrested in this regard. During investigation, ATS seized 146 kg of drugs worth Rs 730 crore. In the same month, the Devbhoomi-Dwarka police arrested five persons, including two from Nigeria, following the seizure of heroin and methamphetamine worth Rs 315 crore. The case came to light after one Sajjad Ghosi, a resident of Thane in Maharashtra, was nabbed from a guest house in Khambhaliya town on November 10 with 11.48kg of heroin and 6.16kg of methamphetamine, collectively worth Rs 88.25 crore in the illicit market. This led to the seizure of 45kg heroin from a house in Salaya and the arrest of Salim Kara and Ali Kara, from whom Ghosi had taken delivery of the drugs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ncb-to-probe-recent-drug-hauls-in-gujarat/articleshow/88419821.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Last scream considered dying declaration||AHMEDABAD: The scream of a 75-year-old man, directed at the driver of a car that had knocked him down, has been considered the dying declaration. The victim, who was from Nadiad Kheda, was going to his son’s shop when he met with the accident while crossing the road.  His hipbone was broken. His last scream was channeled at the car’s driver who had at the time stopped his vehicle. According to Nadiad police officers, Manu Shah, a resident of Piplata village in Nadiad, was hit by the speeding car early on December 18 morning. Shah fell on the road. The car driver believed that the elderly man was unconscious and that nobody had seen the accident. So, he stopped his car about 10 metres from the accident spot and observed the victim. Meanwhile, Shah’s son Prajesh, who was cleaning his shop, rushed out and saw his father lying near a road divider. Shah then yelled at the car driver saying that he was responsible for the accident. Shah soon fell unconscious. The driver looked at Shah and Prajesh and sped away. Shah was taken to a nearby hospital where he underwent a surgery for hipbone fracture but his health condition worsened and he died on Monday afternoon. Nadiad rural police had earlier registered a case of rash driving causing injuries against the unknown driver. Now with the last scream, the driver has been charged with causing death by negligence. Police officers said that if the victim had not screamed at the car driver no one would have known about the accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/last-scream-considered-dying-declaration/articleshow/88419828.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||UK Hindus to get first purpose-built crematorium||The proposal to create the first purpose-built crematorium for Hindus in the UK has been approved, fulfilling the community’s long-standing wish to be able to bid a dignified farewell to the departed with traditional rites. The Planning Inspectorate on December 16 gave Anoopam Mission UK the planning permission for the crematorium on its 15-acre site near Denham in the southeast of England. The council of Buckinghamshire, under which Denham falls, had refused planning permission on September 4, 2020. The council deemed the plan “an inappropriate development in the green belt”. But now Anoopam Mission can establish the structure on the campus of Shree Swaminarayan Spiritual Cultural and Community Centre. “We welcome this important decision and the opportunity for Anoopam Mission to serve the Hindu population of the UK,” said Param Pujya Sahebji, the spiritual leader of Anoopam Mission, in a statement. “Observing ‘antim sanskar’ or last rites in accordance with our Hindu customs and rituals provides liberation for the departed soul and peace of mind for families during a sensitive time.” The crematorium will have a large ceremony hall, two private ritual rooms, shower facilities, a crematory hall, and a separate canteen building. The facility will accommodate up to 500 attendees and will have a dedicated parking space. Planning inspector Katie McDonald noted that the Hindu community in this area was “disadvantaged by being denied the opportunity to fully observe cultural and religious beliefs and traditions”. The inspector stated that the Hindu community particularly in North and West London and the surrounding counties had limitations in observing cultural and religious beliefs. “Our large and tranquil grounds in Denham, with our newly built mandir facilities, provide an ideal location for this ‘manav sewa’, or service to humanity,” Sahebji further said in the statement. “We look forward to working with all Hindu organizations to deliver this vision for the whole community.” Over 2,000 signatures of support were received for the proposals, with Lord Jitesh Gadhia and Bob Blackman MP speaking in favour of the application during the appeal process. The existing crematoria in the area are not adequate for all Hindu rites. The waiting time for availing of the facilities can be long and deepen the grief of the bereaved. “The design of the crematorium and associated facilities have been specifically tailored and architecturally designed to meet the needs of the Hindu community,” according to a media statement issued by Anoopam Mission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/uk-hindus-to-get-1st-purpose-built-crematorium/articleshow/88420394.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 'Public meet' held for Powai cycle track, say activists; BMC denies it||MUMBAI: Activists and citizen groups have complained to municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal about a “public meeting” on the controversial Powai cycle track project. In a letter to Chahal, residents have complained that a meeting on “rejuvenation and reinvigoration of Powai lake” was held on November 27 but only a handful of residents and activists were called and officials could not give satisfactory answers to their queries. The BMC, on its part, said it had not held any public meeting and the one on November 27 may have been held by architect Pankaj Joshi in his capacity as the architect of the project. “A meeting was held on November 27, at Gopal Sharma International School, Powai. The meeting focused on the construction of the cycle track at Powai lake and was supposed to be a ‘public meeting’. However, if it was actually a public meeting there should have been notices about the meeting on an issue of such importance to the city. The meeting was sparsely attended and the replies given by architect Pankaj Joshi were extremely unsatisfactory and at times, demeaning,” said activist Pamela Cheema in her letter to Chahal. “A public meeting should be organised in the real sense. Detailed plans of the project should be revealed and discussed extensively. I attended the so-called meeting but those hosting the meeting did not reply to the queries satisfactorily,” said activist Nishant Bangera who attended the meeting. Joshi said the meeting was for an invited group. “The matter is sub judice in the high court and the National Green Tribunal. The BMC has not instructed us to hold public meetings, hence the question of holding a public meeting doesn’t arise. There was a meeting at the school with an invited group. No one from the BMC was there, we were invited by a few concerned residents for a discussion,” Joshi said. “We are not aware of any public meetings. The matter is sub judice before HC. Pankaj Joshi is the architect for this project and he can interact with people in that capacity. But I don’t think he held any public meeting. If no public notice is given, it cannot be a public meeting,” said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). The Bombay high court bench headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta last month had continued a November 1 stay on activity of putting up proposed cycling and jogging tracks at Powai lake next to IIT Bombay till January 31. Two PhD students from IIT had filed a public interest litigation to ensure no damage is caused to the lake due to the reclamation for the cycle track, which they claimed is in violation of wetland rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-public-meet-held-for-powai-cycle-track-say-activists-bmc-denies-it/articleshow/88421195.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

In the audio clip, the ASI was scolded by the state counsel for repeatedly calling him up.The incident is of last week when ASI Raj Kumar had made phone calls to the lawyer to discuss with him an issue related to a writ petition filed in the high court.As per the conversation in the audio clip, which is with the TOI too, the assistant AG objected to the ASI calling him up repeatedly and asked him to appear before the court along with the SHO as physical appearance was needed. However, when the ASI again insisted to discuss the issue of petition over the phone call, the state counsel got annoyed. On December 19, the ASI posted the audio on social media and it reached the senior officers and also the lawyer concerned. He objected to it and filed a written complaint against the ASI, following which the city police were asked to check the matter and take action.Joint commissioner of police (city) J Elanchezhian’s inquiry recommended action against the ASI and stated that the cop, who is in a disciplined force, made the telephonic conversation viral on the social media, which affected the image of the assistant AG. The act of the ASI was condemnable and punishable, thus, it is recommended to suspend him and initiate a departmental inquiry against him, the probe said.Elanchezhian said the ASI has been suspended with immediate effect and transferred to the police lines and the departmental probe would be conducted by the ADCP-II Balwinder Singh Randhawa.The instructions After this incident, the AG office circulated a message among the cops saying, “On the day of physical hearing, no instructions will be taken on phone or WhatsApp. All investigating officers have to reach the high court by 9am with a complete file. Pro forma would be typed and handwritten will not be accepted. Hand over printouts of typed and filled pro forma by way of affidavit to clerk assigned by the AG office to court and wait outside till the matter is taken up. In case of any query, call will be made from court to the number given on pro forma and you may be called to the courtroom to assist.” No calls or messages were allowed else action would be recommended against the investigating officer to the SSP or CP concerned, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/asi-suspended-for-posting-call-with-asst-ag-on-social-media/articleshow/88419221.cms||Payal Dhawan
---||Kochi||Kerala: Guruvayur Devaswom approves SUV auction to NRI bizman||THRISSUR: Guruvayur Devaswom managing committee on Tuesday decided to approve the recent auction of the SUV Mahindra Thar at the temple to Amal Mohammed, the NRI businessman based in Bahrain. Amal, who quoted Rs 15,10,000 for the vehicle, was the only participant in the auction. The managing committee meeting decided to submit the auction results to the devaswom commissioner for final approval, said administrator KP Vinayan . The administrator said that as per law any transaction of the devaswom above Rs 5 lakh should get the commissioner’s approval. Hence the auction result was submitted for his approval, he said. The meeting was attended by five members, including the chairman KB Mohandas, the permanent member Mallissery Namboothirippad, and members KV Mohanakrishnan, AV Prasant and EP Vesala. However, the temple thanthri Brahmasri PC Dineshan Namboothiripad was among those absent. “I’m extremely happy with the decision of the managing committee,” said Amal, while speaking to TOI from Bahrain over the phone. He said that the devaswom authorities had informed his auction representative about the details of GST and other additional payments to be made by him on Tuesday. “I’m ready to make the payments any time. The devaswom authorities are also very supportive,” he added. The devaswom had fixed Rs 15 lakh as base price for the vehicle donated to the temple by the Mahindra Group. Amal’s representative Subhash Panikker quoted Rs 15,10,000 for the vehicle and won the auction as he was the only participant. However, Subhash reportedly told the media that he was prepared to go up to Rs 25 lakh to buy the vehicle in the auction. Subsequently, the devaswom chairman said that they might face allegations that the vehicle was auctioned when the participant himself was prepared to bid a higher price, pushing the SUV auction into controversies. There were doubts among devaswom officials whether an auction participated by just one bidder can be approved. However, the devaswom authorities have now decided to approve the auction, apparently after realizing that it would be difficult for them to go back on an auction finalized earlier. The approval of the commissioner is likely to be an official formality, as the auction notice mentions only the need for the committee’s approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/devaswom-approves-suv-auction-to-nri-bizman/articleshow/88419834.cms||T Ramavarman

The petitioners complained that in the oral interview that lasted for five days, the strength of the panellists never remained constant and kept changing on all days. Petitioner’s advocate, Anand Yagnik, submitted that the changing numbers of interview panellists resulted in gross injustice for candidates because on one day each of the panel members had 20 marks to give to a candidate, whereas on the other day this weightage varied with depleted numbers of panellists. He also submitted that the appointments have not been made till date. The HC posed various questions on these lines and asked the government to come with facts on January 18. The state government’s lawyer submitted that GAD chairman, due to his busy schedule, could not remain present in the interviews. To this, Justice Nikhil Kariel commented that if he was busy, he should not have accepted the assignment at all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-stays-state-ib-depts-hiring-process/articleshow/88419831.cms||---

Speaking at the ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organized by the Times Group, Awasthi said, “Bullet train is being proposed on a route between New Delhi and Varanasi along the expressways. Work on around 290 km expressway is also being fast-tracked and the main carriageway will be started by January. Likewise, the Gorakhpur Link Expressway is one of the key projects that will reduce the travel time between Gorakhpur and Lucknow.” Awasthi said the bridges on Bundelkhand and Gorakhpur expressways were being constructed “well ahead of time”. “The Yamuna bridge on Bundelkhand Expressway was constructed in 18 months. Usually such huge bridges take at least 3-4 years in completion,” he said. The proposed 594km long Ganga Expressway, the foundation for which was recently laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be the largest build, operate and transfer project. “The total cost of construction and the proposed expressways is around Rs 75,000 crore,” Awasthi said, maintaining that the government was ensuring that the projects were completed timely and the quality of construction was not compromised. Awasthi said despite the first and second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the state government did not put brakes on construction activities. “This is the reason why we have been able to complete the expressways on time,” he said, adding that around 60 lakh mandays of employment was provided in the construction of expressways. He said big ticket projects on the Defence Corridor were being taken up along the expressways. “The foundation stone for the proposed Brahmos missile manufacturing plant in Lucknow will soon be laid by defence minister Rajnath Singh,” Awasthi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-purvanchal-eway-ups-share-in-national-expressways-up-at-37/articleshow/88420860.cms||---

---||India||Marriage law won’t make child marriage ab initio void: Expert||NEW DELHI: Soon after the government introduced a bill in Parliament to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, some of those who were at the forefront of supporting the decision, however, lamented that the proposed legislation does not bring amendments to make child marriage void. They pointed out that the proposed law will not make child marriage, in its present form, void at the outset and it will continue to remain voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage. After the bill was introduced in Lok Sabha, Vikram Srivastava, founder “Independent Thought” and Convenor, Campaign against Child Marriage, said, “The special and secular character of PCMA having an overriding application is a welcome step.  The consequential amendments to other laws will end the otherwise ambiguity and provide the much needed protection to girls through a uniform law.” “The 2021 amendment to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, however leaves the most controversial and complicating gap of ‘void ab-initio’ clause unresolved. It is unclear how this increase in age would resolve or restrict solemnisation of marriage, if it remains to be valid,” Srivastava said. In the ‘Independent Thought’ case judgment of 2017, the Supreme Court had declared sex with minor wife as rape. Dr Renu Singh Country Director, Young Lives India, said that bill sets forth the rationale for increasing the age of marriage for girls to 21 years based on the principle of equality (same age for men and women) and the need to increase the age so as to ensure that the “physical, mental and reproductive health” of women is protected. “Both these arguments are valid claims by the government and are supported by research. My only criticism is why hasn’t Section 3 (1) been amended to make child marriage void,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/marriage-law-wont-make-child-marriage-ab-initio-void-expert/articleshow/88421536.cms||Ambika Pandit

Muslims constitute nearly 96% of Lakshadweep population as per the 2011 census and Friday has been a holiday in schools there for decades. An order issued by the education department of the Union Territory administration, dated December 17, said the school timings and regular activities are "suggested" to be modified to "ensure optimum utilization of resources and proper engagement of learners and necessary planning of teaching-learning process". The order also includes a detailed subject-wise allotment of classes for both English-medium and Malayalam-medium schools for the 2021-22 academic year, which says all Fridays will be working days. Reacting to the development, Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal PP said Friday has been a holiday for schools since they were launched six decades ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dweep-schools-to-be-open-on-friday-closed-on-sundays/articleshow/88419836.cms||---
---||Delhi||Christmas in time of Covid: Cap on visitors at Delhi churches, carols at home||NEW DELHI: Several churches across Delhi said that Christmas celebrations would be held with certain restrictions in place this year due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. While prior registrations will be required to attend the service on Christmas day in some of the churches, most said that the number of people would be capped at 200 in accordance with government guidelines. Father Lawrence of Sacred Heart Cathedral Church said that the general public would not be able to access the services and only those registered could attend the same. “Some restrictions have been put in place due to the Covid-19 situation. Only those who have registered will be allowed to attend the prayer services and the usual public will not be permitted, unlike other years. The number of people will be capped and the registration slots will close accordingly. No other events will be taking place this time,” Father Lawrence said. St Stephen’s Church in Old Delhi will remain open to the public with mechanisms in place to ensure that the congregation does not exceed 200 people. Reverend Baldev Sandhu, the presbyter-in-charge of the church, said, “There will be a service at 10 pm on December 24 and then another at 10 am on Christmas day along with the regular services. The church will remain open for all those who wish to visit, but we will ensure that the number of people does not exceed 200 at any given point. In another hall, arrangements for a television have been made and people can attend the mass from there.” Social distancing and wearing of masks are also important factors to be kept in mind, said Reverend Paul Swarup of Green Park Free Church. “While the churches will be open to the public, the basic idea is to maintain social distancing and ensure use of sanitisers and masks. People can attend the midnight services as well. Cross marks have been pasted to ensure adequate distance in the seating arrangements and chairs have also been placed at safe distances on a separate floor that will have screens,” he said. While the pandemic has also marred the usual pre-Christmas celebrations, Reverend Sandhu said that small groups from the church were visiting door to door for carol singing and reading portions of the Bible. “We have already covered areas like Malkaganj and Fatehpuri. This will continue till Tuesday,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/christmas-in-time-of-covid-cap-on-visitors-at-churches-carols-at-home/articleshow/88419835.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Twin flyover plans have greens doubly worried||Nagpur: Environmentalists have voiced concern over the damage that the construction of twin flyovers on Amravati Road will cause. According to them, around five-to-six heritage trees are expected to come in the way of the four-lane flyover which will begin from the bridge over nullah on Amravati Road in front of RTO and land before the traffic signal on University Campus Square. The national highway division of the public works department (PWD) has reportedly submitted a proposal to Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) garden department. “We have asked them to submit a detailed plan report and also the number of trees that need to be cut. After that, a team of garden department will conduct a survey,” said NMC officials. Talking to TOI, officials of national highway division said they would make sure minimum damage is done to the existing green cover. “We have identified the trees and our estimate is that we wouldn’t need to cut many of them as there is a divider where the flyover’s foundation will come. We will cut only the trees which will pose danger to commuters, otherwise we will have to trim some branches,” they said.  Environment activists, however, have their share of worries. “The flyover should be designed in a way that the city’s already depleting green cover is not damaged, especially the age-old trees should remain untouched. There are sustainable architects who are willing to save trees when designing infrastructure. It’s high time that authorities change their approach and move towards sustainable development,” said green activist Anasuya Kale-Chhabrani. The activists added that before planning such projects, a feasibility study needs to be done. “Flyovers are being built, but where are the traffic assessment reports? Apart from this, a joint survey should be done along with NMC and a third party to assess the environmental damage such projects lead to. At a time when we are battling climate crisis, all efforts should be made to save whatever green cover that is left in the city. And for this, authorities must take guidance from experts,” said activist Wasudev Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/twin-flyover-plans-have-greens-doubly-worried/articleshow/88419837.cms||Manka Behl

The union that had given the notice of strike had withdrawn from the field after the union leader held talks with the state government in the backdrop of the hearing in the Bombay High Court with an appeal to the MSRTC employees to get back to work from December 22. But this literally had no impact in Nashik district as the protesting staff did not return to work and some of them said they would wait for the HC hearing that will come on Wednesday. “There is no resolution offered to the issues raised by the employees of the MRTC and hence there is no chance of withdrawing the strike,” Sandesh Dhanait, one of the state transport utility employees, said. The employees are on strike since November 7, seeking merger of the MSRTC with the state government as it will enable better salaries, fixed payment dates and other benefits at par with other government employees. There were several round of talks with the state government after which the BJP leaders including Sadabhau Khot and Gopichand Padalkar had decided to call off the strike on November 25, but the employees refused to budge. Meanwhile, MSRTC officials confirmed that though some people got back to work, the number was very less and the stalemate continued as majority of them continued to abstain. Only 37 buses operated across Nashik district from two depots — Nashik and Lasalgaon — on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-staff-continue-their-protest-in-nashik/articleshow/88418429.cms||Abhilash Botekar

HC will hear the matter next on February 14. Claiming that the one-day bandh on October 11 in the state was “thoughtlessly imposed", the PIL filed by ex-Mumbai police chief Julio Rebeiro (92) and others seeks an order to direct three political parties — Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP to pay Rs 3,000 crore as “exemplary damages or compensation’’ to the central and state governments and to affected citizens, through a ‘Bandh Loss Compensation Fund’. The bench asked Soni, “Who is going to identify how much and who is to be paid?” and Soni said the thrust of the PIL is to set up a bandh compensation fund. The bench, in its order, noted the “concern expressed by senior citizens... to calling of a bandh by party n power”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-seeks-replies-of-state-parties-in-pil-on-oct-bandh/articleshow/88398464.cms||---
---||Lucknow||‘Law & order was biggest challenge in attracting biz’||Lucknow: Poor law and order situation was the biggest challenge before the UP government when it started inviting investment to the state in 2017, said additional chief secretary (industry) Arvind Kumar here on Monday. He was speaking at a session on ‘policy umbrella and incentives to attract investment’ at ‘Destination Uttar Pradesh Conclave’ organized by the Times Group in Lucknow. Kumar said that the state government was able to initiate a severe crackdown on mafias who had been posing a grave challenge to the government and its functioning. Kumar was principal secretary (home) between May 19, 2017 and July 31, 2019 in the Yogi Adityanath government. Kumar said that the second challenge was the availability of land in the state. He said that the state government made the process of land acquisition for various development projects, including expressways and airports, smooth. “The new policy and process gave farmers no reason to crib about land acquisition,” he said while elaborating about the move to connect the land bank of the state to the national land bank online. “Now, the investors can see where the land is available and can file their application through Nivesh Mitra Portal,” Kumar said. Kumar said that the state government also roped in consultants to identify the potential areas along the expressways where industrial hot spots could be developed. “That can be a private industrial park as well as a government backed utility,” he said. This, he said, has been facilitated by the Purvanchal expressway and the upcoming Gorakhpur link expressway and the Bundelkhand expressway. Speaking about the Defence Corridor policy, he said the state government has managed to get investment worth Rs 4000 crore in six nodes of the corridor in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/law-order-was-biggest-challenge-in-attracting-biz/articleshow/88420867.cms||Pankaj Shah

Terming it as one of the major tax evasion cases detected after the launch of the GST regime, department officials said the volume of his transactions based on forged bills could go up to Rs 1,000 crore. Baneesh, who was arrested from Thrissur under Section 69 of the GST Act, has been remanded in judicial custody. Officials said the accused had been securing GST registration under benami names in different states and producing fake bills for areca nut sales from different places within Kerala to claim input tax credits. Actually no sales would have taken place, they said. Officials said they have been conducting inspections in business units and houses of those suspected to be involved in forgery for quite some time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rs-500cr-tax-fraud-in-areca-nut-man-held/articleshow/88419841.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Delhi||Delhi: North corporation resumes work on Old Delhi heritage park||NEW DELHI: Giving another reason to the tourists to visit Old Delhi in future, the north corporation has resumed work on the heritage park opposite Red Fort. The project was conceived over two years back, but due to several hiccups, including legal issues, Covid crisis and construction ban, work at the site got delayed, said a senior official.  The project is going on at a 1.75-acre land facing two historical places—Red Fort on one side and Jama Masjid on the other. The park will be developed into two parts. One of them will be about a 5,000 sq metre rectangular area with entrance plaza, sunken sitting area, baradari, landscaped courts, open air amphitheatre, fountain, stage and washroom. Next to this, there will be a 2,000 sqm triangular portion with huge lawn covered with interlocking tiles. The civic body may conduct light and sound shows here too. “The project costs Rs 7.75 crore and a portion of the fund for this project was allocated by an MP from MPLADs funds more than two years back. But due to Covid and other reasons, it could not be implemented and a majority of the fund lapsed. We were still left with Rs 50 lakh with which work has started. Two more MPs have come forward to help with funds and we have arranged the remaining amount,” said the official. He stated that work for installing tiles, steps and other structures was going on and the project was expected to complete by mid-March. “As soon as permission for construction work was given by DDMA, we immediately started work at the site. The park will be developed with intensive use of white sandstone, red sandstone, marble stone, dholpur stone, etc, to make it look similar to the two historical monuments,” said the official. The park will have a 400 metres boundary wall constructed with RCC pillars and bricks. The finishing will be done with Mehrab made of red stone, decorative stone jalis, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/north-corpn-resumes-work-on-old-delhi-heritage-park/articleshow/88419852.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Plea to cut Carter Road mangroves withdrawn||MUMBAI: In a victory for residents of Carter Road, Bandra, the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) that had approached the Bombay high court seeking permission to cut mangroves to place tetrapods has withdrawn its application.The application was withdrawn after the Carter Road Residents Association along with P K Das, the architect of the two promenades, filed an intervention plea opposing the cutting of mangroves for placing tetrapods. In their plea, the residents pointed out that the stretch already had a natural barrier in the form of mangroves, which they had worked hard to clean and conserve, and helped grow and flourish. The MMB has been placing tetrapods along the coast ostensibly to prevent erosion of the coast. A few months ago it placed several tetrapods, destroying the rocky coast along Bandra Bandstand, said residents. While the MMB said it had the permission of the local residents’ body to carry out the work, Das said that MMB carried out no study to ascertain if the coast was being eroded. “It is wise of MMB to realise their mistake and withdraw the petition. It must learn to conduct relevant studies, discuss with all concerned residents and take a collective decision. I am happy that we have been able to save one of the waterfronts. People will be able to continue to interact and enjoy the waters,” he said. Das added MCZMA should be careful henceforth before granting permissions. “The MMB will hopefully take action to remove the tetrapods from Bandstand and repair the damage caused there.” Naaznin Husein, member of the Carter Road Residents’ Association, said it was important for citizens to voice their concerns, especially for the environment. “In our plea, we pointed out that we never have the sea gushing over as the mangroves naturally protected the coast. If these tetrapods were to be put here, the mangroves would have been completely destroyed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-plea-to-cut-carter-road-mangroves-withdrawn/articleshow/88421199.cms||---

The victim, identified as Yogesh Kumar, had come to Jaipur to meet a married woman with whom he is suspected to have a secret love affair. When the woman’s husband got the whiff of their affair, he stabbed him multiple times before slitting his throat with a sharp object. According to DCP (West) Richa Tomar, the incident took place when the accused heard his wife speaking to the victim at 4 am. “The victim had come to meet the woman on Tuesday. He had called up the woman early morning that he has arrived. Her husband overheard their conversations and followed her wife to the bus stop,” she said. Police said that the woman left her house to meet Yogesh, the accused secretly followed her wife to the meeting spot and confronted him. A brief scuffle broke out and the accused frantically began attacking him with a knife. When Yogesh tried to resist, the accused slit his throat with the same weapon. Police said that the accused fled from the scene while Yogesh lay in a pool of blood, he was ferried to the hospital where he later died. A team of VKI police was informed about the incident and they arrived at the spot to preserve the crime scene. FSL teams collected evidence from the spot as police quizzed several people and learned that the murder was a result of a love affair. The prima facie evidence suggests that the accused worked in the city as a scrap dealer. His wife is a native of New Delhi and had met Yogesh in one of her visits there. Police said that the accused will be nabbed soon as teams have been constituted to track him down. “The preliminary investigation had indicated that the grisly murder was a result of a love affair because the accused had heard his wife speaking to Yogesh in the morning. He decided to confront his wife’s lover and killed him,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-kills-wifes-paramour-from-delhi/articleshow/88419842.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kochi: Canal rejuvenation project running behind schedule||KOCHI: The apathetic attitude of Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL), the proponents of integrated urban rejuvenation and water transport system (IURWTS), is causing inordinate delay in implementing the Rs 1,528 crore project. Even after two years of government entrusting KMRL with the responsibility of implementing the project, the Metro agency is yet to secure necessary clearances for the project. In its meeting held in the second week of December 2021, Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA) has asked KMRL to submit more documents for coastal zone regulation (CRZ) clearance. Though KMRL has submitted the revised application for CRZ clearance and revised detailed project report (DPR) before KCZMA for its nod, other mandatory documents like environmental impact assessment (EIA) report, disaster management report, CRZ map indicating high tide line and low tide line in 1:4000 scale, hydraulic modelling and flood plain study report etc were not revised in tune with the revised DPR. KCZMA has been seeking clarifications and changes in the reports, including the DPR, CRZ application and other documents, for the past several months. The Metro agency also made a few presentations before the KCZMA on the IURWTS project. But, KCZMA has sought further clarifications which the Metro agency couldn’t give it on time. In November 2021, KMRL had submitted a fresh application for CRZ clearance and revised the DPR, along with certain clarifications on the project, before KCZMA. But, KCZMA cited that the clarifications given by KMRL was not satisfactory. “We are working out the details. We will submit more documents soon,” said KMRL managing director Loknath Behera. KZCMA raises serious concerns over the chances of increased flooding once canal lock gates (CLGs) are erected in the canals. KMRL plans CLGs to ensure a minimum water level in the five canals, which are being renovated under the IURWTS project. The aim of CLGs is to regulate a standard water level in these canals for facilitating navigation through the waterbodies. The explanations given by the Metro agency regarding CLGs as well as other issues didn’t satisfy KCZMA. “There is no doubt that the restoration of 34.33km of canals will have a marginal beneficial effect in reducing waterlogging during heavy rainfall in the urban catchment areas of the canals. However, when CLGs are in place...they would impede the natural inflows and outflows. This raises concerns about the integration of the opening and closing of CLGs as a synchronized activity within the framework of a larger flood management plan for the Greater Kochi Region...only a detailed independent study can decide how the authorities concerned can implement such an integration of CLGs with requisite synchronisation,” stated KCZMA after considering the clarifications submitted in November. At the same time, there are allegations that KCZMA is throwing a spanner in the wheels of IURWTS project by continuously demanding clarifications and changes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/canal-rejuvenation-project-running-behind-schedule/articleshow/88419247.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

On December 17, the Ludhiana Parents’ Association had sent a complaint against the teacher to the chief minister, the department of education, the deputy commissioner and the district education officer, seeking action against him. The CM had directed the department to mark an inquiry.A member of the association, Rajinder Ghai, said, “I had received a call from a student of the school, who said the teacher has been molesting girl students by touching them inappropriately. We immediately visited the school, spoke to the students and took up the matter with the principal. We wanted a written affidavit from the teacher that he won’t do it again, but he refused. When no action was taken, we sent a written complaint to the CM, the district education officer, the deputy commissioner and the education department.”  District education officer Lakhbir Singh Samra said, “The association had apprised me of the issue on December 17. I immediately instructed the school head to submit a report, which I received on Monday. Now, an inquiry has been marked which will be supervised by deputy district education officer Charanjit Singh. The teacher has been shifted to a boys’ school.”  The school principal said, “I had received a complaint against the teacher from the students on November 17, after which we called the parents.

As the defect remained undiscovered for more than nine years, the girl underwent 18 failed surgical attempts in the past. The patient, a native of Palakollu in West Godavari district, was brought to SLG Hospital with severe swelling in the neck, along with regular pus discharge from that region. During previous surgeries, the pus was cleared but the problem recurred after a few months. “The patient was presented with a rare problem, and after contrast CT scan and related examinations, we were able to identify the exact complication. She was suffering from an abnormal connection between skin and food pipe, which was passing in between major blood vessels from heart to brain. The patient was operated upon to remove the whole tract, which was the abnormal connection, without damaging other parts,” said Dr Bhargaw Ilapakurty, consultant, head and neck cancer, reconstructive surgeon, SLG Hospital.  The patient started feeding the same day of the surgery.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-docs-cure-teen-with-rare-defect/articleshow/88419844.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||1,254 Marathwada ZP schools lose power supply for failing to pay dues||AURANGABAD: Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has cut the power supply to 1,254 Zilla Parishad (ZP) schools spread across the Marathwada region for failing to clear outstanding dues. There are 5,279 ZP schools across the eight districts of Marathwada. Currently, they have outstanding power dues of Rs 9.82 crore. MSEDCL joint managing director Mangesh Gondavale told TOI, “For the past two years, these schools had not been operational. As a result, the respective school authorities did not bother to pay the power bills. Now we have started disconnection the as our plea to clear the dues have fallen on deaf ears”. He said that none of these connections will be restored unless the arrears are cleared. As per the data obtained from the MSEDCL, an amount of Rs 3.47 cr is yet to be recovered from the 1,254 ZP schools, for which the power supply has been temporary disconnected. Out of these schools, 409 schools are in the Aurangabad zone comprising two districts of Aurangabad and Jalna; 485 schools are in the Latur zone comprising Beed, Osmanabad and Latur districts; while 360 are in the Nanded zone comprising Hingoli, Parbhani and Nanded districts. Authorities said that power supply to 238 ZP schools in Aurangabad district — the highest in any district from the region — has been cut for want of about Rs 30 lakh in arrears. Interestingly, Gondavale was the Aurangabad ZP CEO before he was recently transferred and posted as the joint managing director of MSEDCL. As many as 171 schools in Jalna, 152 in Beed, 199 in Latur, 134 in Osmanabad, 75 in Hingoli, 185 in Nanded and 110 schools in Parbhani currently have no power supply. The move to temporarily disconnect the power supply to the schools at a time when the schools are being reopened after a span of two years has not gone down well with the education department authorities. However, the MSEDCL officials have contested that due to poor recovery of dues from commercial, industrial as well as residential power connections, the MSEDCL has been compelled to initiate strict measures to get out of the serious financial crisis it is facing. An officer privy to the development said, “The pandemic has taken a serious toll on the overall collection of bills. Not only the individual customers, but also several government offices and departments have defaulted on power bills for two consecutive years of the pandemic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/1254-marathwada-zp-schools-lose-power-supply-for-failing-to-pay-dues/articleshow/88418449.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Kochi||Kochi: HC dismisses plea against PM Narendra Modi’s picture on vaccination certificate||KOCHI: The high court on Tuesday dismissed a petition seeking removal of prime minister Narendra Modi’s photo from the certificate issued upon availing paid Covid-19 vaccination and imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioner. In the judgment dismissing the petition filed by Peter Myaliparambil of Kottayam, Justice PV Kunhikrishnan said it is the duty of the citizens to respect the prime minister. Disagreeing with the petitioner’s contention that the prime minister’s photo on the vaccination certificate amounts to violation of fundamental right and is equal to compelled viewing, the court said these are frivolous contentions that should be curbed immediately. Holding that no fundamental right has been violated, the court said in the judgment, “The politicians are going to the people and spending time with them directly. The people elect the eligible persons among them and send them to the Parliament and the majority party will select their leader and he will be our Honourable Prime Minister for five years. Till the next general election, he will be the Prime Minister of India. Nobody can say that a Prime Minister is a Congress Prime Minister or a BJP Prime Minister or the Prime Minister of any political party. Therefore, according to me, it is the duty of the citizens to respect the Prime Minister of India, and of course, they can differ on the policies of the Government and even the political stand of the Prime Minister. They can address the citizens saying that what the Government under the leadership of the Prime Minister is doing is not for the welfare of the citizens. But the citizen need not be ashamed to carry a vaccination certificate with the photograph of the Prime Minister with a morale boosting message, especially in this pandemic situation.” Further, the court said it is a frivolous petition filed with ulterior motives and it is doubted that the petitioner has a political agenda. It is a publicity-oriented litigation and is a fit case to be dismissed with a heavy fine, the court said while noting that thousands of criminal appeals, matrimonial disputes, and property disputes are pending before the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dismisses-plea-against-pms-pic-on-vax-certificate/articleshow/88419252.cms||---

Even in the 2021 assembly polls, this was the only ward in Kolkata where Congress had secured a lead. Pathak secured 4,813 votes—a little pver 61% of total votes polled in the ward. A youth from Buxar, Bihar, Pathak started making a mark in Kolkata’s political circuit in 2005, when he first won from Ward 45, comprising Strand Road and surrounding areas. He was seen attending every occasion—from mundan to shradh—where he was invited and he even visited villages of ward residents, most of them migrant workers from Bihar and UP. “They consider him a son of the soil. He know the pulse of Hindi heartland,” said a Congress leader. “No other contestant is this close to the people in the ward,” said Congress leader Amitabha Chakraborty. “False voting was reported from Brabourne Road and Pollock Street. We put up a resistance and it ended in a clash with Trinamool workers,” said Pathak. Another Congress winner was debutant Wasim Ansari from Ward 137, who won by 1,374 votes. “We fought in 50-60 wards and expected to win in 10. Had the polls been fair, we could have won those,” said Congress president Adhir Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/congs-pathak-holds-on-to-hindi-heartland/articleshow/88419860.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Lucknow||Commit crime in UP, get it back with compound interest: Ex-DGP||Lucknow: If you indulge in any criminal activity in Uttar Pradesh, you will get it back with compound interest, former DGP, AK Jain said, addressing ‘Destination UP Conclave’ on Monday. He said mafia elements have been dealt with a heavy hand and the manner in which they have been crushed will be an example for generations to come. “Government land has been vacated from criminals and it will have a permanent impact if it continues like this for a few years,” said the former DGP. “The action taken in the aftermath of Bikru carnage will be remembered for a long time, the whole gang was wiped out. The gang was extorting money and getting support. It was because of this that no development or investment was happening in the state,” he said. The former DGP said that UP has been infamous for organised crime, kidnapping for ransom and occupation of government land, but since the current government has come to power there has been a complete shift; criminals are lying low or are serving jail term. The former DGP praised UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his administrative prowess and keeping police officials on their toes by giving specific instructions on cases, holding video conferences with police officials before any big event and stressing that nobody should be spared. “No politician can now interfere in police working,” he said. “The CM himself reviews all sensitive cases,” he said. The way UP CM reacted to violence in the anti-CAA and NRC protest in Lucknow and other cities of the state is commendable and after his action no incident or violence was reported in the state. Not just policing but technical capabilities and resources of both the Anti-Terrorist Squad and Special Task Force are being strengthened, he said. ATS is now also being stationed at Deoband, Jewar airport and near Nepal border. The UP police has recently had a massive recruitment drive which was due for a long time, he added. “CM did not care for powerful lobbies and instead made four police commissionerates in UP. The idea of police commissionerate in Kanpur came up long ago, but the move was given up before the new commissioner was to assume charge,” Jain said, adding that the credit for ensuring there was no visible tension in the state before festivals and that the atmosphere remained relaxed goes to the CM. “Revenue has also increased manyfold because of the atmosphere in the state. Police budget is also being increased, which was the need of the hour,” he said. “You can change the perception, you can convert it from bad work to good work and that is what policing is. The perception of law and order should be equal for both the rich and the poor,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/commit-crime-in-up-get-it-back-with-compound-interest-ex-dgp/articleshow/88420876.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Mercury drops to 11.2°C in city, slide may continue to 10°C today||Kolkata: The city woke up to a sharp chill on Monday even as the minimum temperature dropped to 11.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest of the season so far. With the northwesterly winds getting stronger, the mercury was set to dip further and might slide to 10 degrees on Tuesday, said the Met office. The chilly spell, however, could be broken on Wednesday as the northwesterly starts losing intensity. But the mercury may still remain below 15 degrees. The temperature had been on a steady slide since early last week when the minimum temperature dipped three degrees from 18 to 15. Ever since, it has remained below 15 degrees Celsius, inching down gradually to slide below 12 degrees on Monday. “The northwesterly has been gaining strength gradually as there is no obstruction in its path. From Wednesday, though, some easterly winds will infuse moisture and may hinder its flow. It will help the mercury rise marginally and the chill will lose its sting,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. He added Christmas could still be moderately chilly in Kolkata. A western disturbance is expected to intervene into the path of the northwesterly and slow down its intensity. The mercury is expected to hover around 14-15 degrees on December 25. “Once the northwesterly weakens, both the minimum and maximum temperature will rise. But it may not continue for long,” said Das. This is the first chilly spell in Kolkata this winter. The city experiences at least three, during which the mercury plunges. The rise and fall of the mercury depend on the flow of northwesterly winds that bring in the chill from the icy Himalayan peaks. It is often interrupted by weather systems, like low-pressure troughs along its pathway or incursion of easterly winds from the sea. This season, it had happened during the second week of December when a low-pressure trough had led to clouds and drizzles, pushing the minimum temperature up and pulling the maximum down. The difference between the two had narrowed down to just two degrees. Monday’s minimum temperature was four notches below normal. The maximum—22.8° Celsius—was four degrees below normal as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mercury-drops-to-11-2c-in-city-slide-may-continue-to-10c-today/articleshow/88419848.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The consumers stated the water supplied by the government poses a health risk. Sushma Naik, a resident, said, “There were two tanks earlier. One was demolished recently, and now we are supplied water from one tank only which was built 21 years ago. The water is muddy as the tank may have been cleaned only once since its construction. Also, the water is supplied using a pump, and when there is no power, we don’t receive water.” The residents behind the sub district hospital at Chicalim criticised the government for negligence. “Who will take responsibility if our health deteriorates? PWD should immediately take up cleaning of the tank and build another tank for better supply of water. Whenever we question the staff, they tell us that there is sufficient water and that it is not their fault,” a local Tulshidas Phaldesai said. The locals pointed that recently they have been supplied water for a few hours which is not sufficient. They demanded that instead of giving free water, the government should ensure adequate supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chicalim-locals-complain-of-turbid-water-supply/articleshow/88420436.cms||---

According to irrigation department authorities, the trial run of releasing water through the main canal of VVIP would begin on Friday. The trial run of the low-level canal and high-level canal also would be held in the following days prior to the opening of the main canal. The main source of water, stored in Boothathankettu barrage, is from various hydroelectric projects located along the Periyar River and Idamalayar hydroelectric projects. The stored water diverts through canals for irrigating agricultural land in Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Kunnathunadu, Aluva, Paravoor and Kanayannoor taluks in the district. “Water flow through the canals for irrigation purposes will also recharge drinking water sources in the entire area, including some parts of the Thrikkakara municipality,” said sources at the irrigation division, Ernakulam. “We had a plan to open the canals last week. But due to intermittent rains received in the region the plan was postponed. The water release would continue until the onset of the monsoon in the state,” said the source. Perumbavoor MLA Eldhose Kunnappalli has recently visited the Odakkali region to review the preparation to release water through canals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/water-from-periyar-valley-to-be-released-from-next-month/articleshow/88419270.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Fake degree racket busted in Warangal||HANAMKONDA: A major fake certificate racket involving overseas consultancy firms was busted and 12 persons arrested in Warangal on Tuesday. The racketeers were providing fake certificates to failed students or boosting marks for engineering as well as degree graduates to help them secure admissions in prestigious universities in the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The consultancies were charging students anywhere between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 4 lakh based on the level of fraud. These consultancies would forward students’ full details to their computer experts who prepared a fake certificate for failed/passed students with marks boosted to 80-90%. Police have identified 212 students who obtained fake certificates and of these 62 students are already abroad. According to Warangal police commissioner Tarun Joshi, the consultancies engaged Dara Arun (28) of Mahabubabad and Akula Ravi Avinash (33) of Hyderabad who specialised in editing and creating marks memos. The racket had not only denied meritorious students a chance to attend courses abroad but also created an alarming situation by allowing unqualified students to get global placements, the commissioner said.

---||Delhi||‘On demand’ collection of C&D waste kicks off in east Delhi||NEW DELHI: To combat dust pollution and ensure disposal of construction and demolition waste in accordance with norms, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has started a service for ‘on-demand collection of C&D waste’. It has tied up with the concessionaire maintaining the C&D waste plant at Shastri Park to lift and transport the C&D waste from the building sites to this plant. “It is an on-call system wherein the concessionaire running the C&D plant arranges for staff, vehicles for lifting C&D waste from under-construction buildings after charging nominal rates,” said an EDMC official. Lifting and transportation will be done at night, payment will be made by the beneficiary in advance and the collected waste will be measured/weighed before entering the plant. The civic body has mentioned the number of the concessionaire on its website. “As soon as the concessionaire receives the call from generators (residents), it will take all details, including tentative quantity, location and pictures. After physical verification, the concessionaire can ensure which vehicle can be deployed for lifting. After collecting malba and taking fees, the service call will be closed. After weighment at C&D plant, a slip will be given to the generator,” stated EDMC. “We assume that the system will help in checking illegal dumping,” the official said. Besides running a helpline, the concessionaire has been asked to advertise the facility regularly. The facility will not be available for bulk generators or government or institutional complexes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-demand-collection-of-cd-waste-kicks-off-in-east-delhi/articleshow/88419890.cms||Vibha Sharma

They seized 2kg of hashish oil in a joint operation held by Dansaf and Ernakulam rural police on Tuesday. The arrested were identified as Mohammed Aslam of Kakkanad NGO quarters and Clint Xavier (24) of Pattikad in Thrissur. Aslam, a law student in Bengaluru, was travelling from Bengaluru to Kochi in an inter-state luxury bus and was supposed to handover the contraband to Xavier at Angamaly bus station on Tuesday morning. The operation was carried out based on a tip received by district police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick. The police caught Aslam first from the bus around 7am and later caught Xavier when he reached Angamaly bus station to collect the product, without knowing the arrest of Aslam. Police said the hashish oil was procured from Paderu in Andhra Pradesh and the money for the contraband was provided by Xavier. Aslam reached Bengaluru by train after procuring the ganja and later boarded the private bus to avoid checking mid-way. The contraband was meant to be sold in various place in Kochi ahead of the New Year celebrations. The accused have been produced before the court and were remanded into judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/law-student-another-youth-held-with-2kg-hashish-oil/articleshow/88419281.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cluster of Covid cases in IIT-Bombay hostel, 220 contacts tested||MUMBAI: A cluster of Covid cases has been detected at an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay Hostel, taking the total number of Covid cases currently on the campus up to 16. Initially, two students from hostel number 18 were found positive, but after a test drive, five more asymptomatic cases were detected. The total number of cases is now the highest in almost two months. To contain the surge, the BMC tested 223 high-risk contacts of the hostel residents on Tuesday. Their reports are awaited. Most residents on the campus are fully vaccinated. The first case in the hostel 18 cluster was diagnosed on October 16. Two students came down with symptoms and were being treated at the campus hospital, said an official. “It is very difficult to figure out the possible source of infection, but the first student had gone for a get-together outside the campus,” he said. On October 18, the BMC conducted a test drive and three more students tested positive and were put in isolation, said the professor. The last two were detected later following which a drive was arranged on Tuesday. As per BMC guidelines, the entire floor has been sealed for now. Students in hostel 18 are senior students. Of the total 16 cases at IIT-B, nine are students. Deputy director of academic and infrastructural affairs, S Sudarshan, said all Covid patients on the campus are doing fine.  “We have had a higher number of cases in the second wave and on some days the numbers were as high as 10 per day. Cases have started declining since mid-October. It's only in the last week or so that we have seen a small increase in numbers, but most of them are from one cluster,” he said. The institute had decided to allow second-year B Tech students to return to campus for the semester starting in January. “The numbers are not alarmingly high so far. Therefore, we will leave the decision to the students,” he added. A civic official said the BMC and the institute are doing contact tracing and had tested around 220 possible contacts of the patients on Tuesday. A couple of professors from the campus, too, tested positive last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cluster-of-covid-cases-in-iit-hostel-220-contacts-tested/articleshow/88419901.cms||Yogita Rao

Also, accounting books were cooked to show bogus expenditure and truncated income. As per IT sources, the most sensational expose in the funds trail straddled the UP district of Mau, Bengaluru and Kerala, where SP national spokesperson Rajiv Rai’s southern companies purportedly parked funds in two Kozhikode-based Muslim trusts with linkages to the Gulf. While these were disguised as donations to skirt tax glare, sleuths busted critical violations of Foreign Exchange Maintenance Act and Income Tax Act for three years, IT sources said. Rai runs a chain of educational institutions in Bengaluru. Taxmen also claimed to have seized money to the tune of Rs 1.12 crore after the three-day pan-India searches. They also zeroed in on incriminating evidence, including hard copies of documents and digital data. The searches were conducted at residences and establishments of two Samajwadi Party leaders and party president Akhilesh Yadav’s aides, including RCL Group promoter Manoj Yadav on tax evasion tip-offs. A Kolkata-based accountancy firm is also under the radar. More than 125 tax sleuths were pressed into service for state-wide searches in Mau, Lucknow, Mainpuri, Agra, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Several entities engaged in civil construction business were involved in a multi-crore scam of fudging accounting books, said IT sources. Directors of a company in Mainpuri searched by taxmen had disproportionate income of Rs 86crore and the promoter admitted to sleuths of an undisclosed income of Rs 68 crore, which he promised to return. During searches in the Lucknow residence of a SP associate, sleuths found his firm had routed investments of Rs12crore in shell companies, while showing a turnover exceeding Rs 150crore. He also had benami properties of Rs.3.5 crore, sources said. A Kolkata-based accommodation entry provider, who was close to these leaders operated shell companies to make fake entries of share capital of Rs 408 crore and unsecured loan of Rs 154crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-neta-violated-fema-parked-funds-in-kerala-based-muslim-trusts/articleshow/88420895.cms||---

This is for the first time that a tiger has been sighted by tourists in Dajipur wildlife sanctuary. Earlier, in 2019, the forest department was successful in getting camera trap images of a tiger in Radhanagari-Dajipur wildlife sanctuary. Srirang Chougale, a resident of Hupari in Hatkanangle tehsil who spotted the tiger, said, “I had gone for the safari with my family and friends. We were a bit sad as no animals were sighted while going inside. While returning at around 5:15pm when we were near the watch tower at Sawarai plateau, our guide Sanket Jadhav showed us a herd of bisons around 300 meter from our vehicle. When our jeep approached them, the bisons got alert and started creating noise. When we looked carefully a tiger was seen passing from the area. We tried to click pictures, but could not get it due to poor light.” He added, “We had come here to see bisons, but were lucky enough to see a tiger. We are happy that we are first ones to spot a tiger in Dajipur wildlife sanctuary.” Ox carcass found A carcass of an ox was found in Kitawde forest area which is near Ajara-Amboli region on Monday evening. Foresters feel the hunting style resembles that of a tiger kill and a forest department team is searching if they could get any traces of the big cat in the region. Till now tiger has never been spotted in Kitawde forest region. Forest ranger for Ajara region Smita Dake said, “A farmer from Kitawde, Dattatreya Zendu Chavan, had left his cattle free for grazing last week, but one of them went missing. On Monday evening, the carcass of the ox was found in the forest area. After getting information, our forester Suresh Gurav and forest guard Rahul Kamble went to the spot and found that the ox was hunted from behind and also had wounds to the neck area. There might be a possibility that the tiger may have come from Chandgad or Amboli region.” Forest guard Kamble said, “The spot where the ox was found is in extreme interiors. We carried out a search today (Tuesday) as well but no tiger pugmarks were found in the surroundings, but the hunting style indicates that it might be a tiger kill. There are leopards too in the vicinity, but killing a full size ox is not easy for leopards.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/tiger-spotted-in-dajipur-wildlife-sanctuary/articleshow/88418486.cms||---
---||Jaipur||90% of Jaipur’s Covid cases above 18 years in December fully vaccinated||JAIPUR: Over 90% Covid cases among 18+ population in the city in December were fully vaccinated. The city has reported 176 cases in 19 days of this month and out of these 35 were children (who were not vaccinated as they are not eligible for vaccination). Health department officials claimed that since they were fully vaccinated, most of them did not have severe complications. Out of 141 vaccinated people aged above 18 years, 125 had been administered both the doses, while six were partially vaccinated (received only first dose). The status of eight was unclear and two patients were untraceable. “Most of the cases reported in the city in December were fully vaccinated. Despite that, Delta variant is still being found in most of the cases, which had dominated the second wave of Covid,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). The health department is checking the vaccination status of people who were found infected. They are also sending the samples to genome sequencing to identify the variant. “In almost all the cases, Delta variant is being found,” said a health department official. A family in Adarsh Nagar and the family who arrived from South Africa were tested positive for Omicron. Officials said that it is seen that entire families are being found infected with Covid, including children. In most of the cases of children getting infected with Covid, it is seen that there family members were also infected. Health department officials said if a person tests positive or has symptoms, he should isolate himself to avoid risk of transmission of virus to other members of the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/90-covid-patients-among-18-fully-vaccinated-in-dec/articleshow/88419892.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

In a written reply to the questions raised by Nalgonda MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy, the minister stated: “As per the office of Registrar General of India, the Census is a decennial exercise and the last Census was conducted in 2011, when Telangana was a part of (united) Andhra Pradesh. The population of Telangana separately is not available in the Census.” The Congress MP had sought to know the present population percentage of SCs and STs in Telangana, the percentage of reservation for them, whether there was any proposal from the state government to the Union government seeking an increase in reservation as per the population percentage and, if so, the details thereof The minister further stated that as per the department of personnel and training (DoPT), the percentage of reservation as on date for SCs and STs in central government posts and services was 15% for SCs and 7.5% for STs in case of appointment by direct recruitment to civil posts and civil services on all India basis by open competition. “In case of appointment by direct recruitment to civil posts and civil services on all India basis otherwise than by open competition, 16.66% reservation for SCs and 7.5% reservation for STs is provided,” he stated. The percentage of reservation for SCs and STs in case of direct recruitment to Group C and Group D posts, normally attracting candidates from a locality or a region, is generally fixed on the basis of proportion of their population in the respective states and Union territories, the minister said in his reply. In case of promotion, 15% reservation for SCs and 7.5% reservation for the STs was provided, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-proposal-from-t-to-raise-sc-st-quota-centre/articleshow/88419887.cms||---
---||Nagpur||No Metro on Amravati Road, but 2 flyovers||Nagpur: The skyline along Amravati Road is set to change as state public works department (PWD) has planned two flyovers, with a combined length of 4.75km, on two stretches. This will, however, seal the chances of rapid transit system, especially the Metro Rail, on this busy road for at least foreseeable future. Though officials and experts have negated the need to have rapid transit system on Amravati Road, citing the existing Metro Rail corridor on Hingna Road, MahaMetro has not yet considered a link corridor to connect Amravati Road to Sitabuldi-Lokmanya Nagar Metro route in phase-II despite the consultant’s suggestion. The national highway division of PWD has awarded the Rs314 crore contract for twin flyovers and concretization of roads below to Pune’s T and T Infra Limited, which has started soil testing. Amravati Road starts from city’s commercial hub — Sitabuldi — from Variety Square and ends at Wadi octroi check post. The road skirts through prime locations like Civil Lines, Giripeth, Ravi Nagar, Bharat Nagar followed by the most congested stretch — Wadi gurdwara till entrance of erstwhile Ordnance Factory of Ambajhari (OFAJ), now rechristened as Yantra India Limited. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had proposed Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) on this road some years ago, but dropped the plan. Some experts had also advocated the need to have rapid transit system on this road as city has already expanded along this national highway till Gondkhairi village. PWD executive engineer Naresh Borkar told TOI, “There is no need for rapid transit system on this route as Metro Rail corridor exists on North Ambazari Road (from Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar in MIDC Hingna) that runs parallel to Amravati Road.” “Distance of 8-9km between two corridors is considered ideal for having separate Metro Rail route. As Amravati Road is less than 1km from North Ambazari Road, Metro Rail feeder service can serve the purpose,” he said. “The two flyovers will ease traffic congestion and also remove black spots at Law College Square, Ravi Nagar Square, Bharat Nagar Square, Telangkhedi Lake T-point and the stretch from Wadi gurdwara to OFAJ gate,” said Borkar. The PWD has claimed to have consulted MahaMetro before planning the two flyovers, which a MahaMetro official denied. The funds for the project have been sanctioned under Central Road Fund (CRF), through the ministry headed by Union minister Nitin Gadkari. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B also discounted the need for rapid transit system on Amravati Road. “PWD never consulted NMC before planning these flyovers. Any government agency should solicit the opinion of the civic body before planning anything within the city limits. But there seems to be no issue with the construction of the two flyovers and it will be good for city’s mobility,” he said. A MahaMetro official said no corridor was ever proposed on Amravati Road and it may not be needed in future also. “The consultant had suggested link corridor to connect Amravati Road with Aqualine, but the same is yet to be considered in phase-II,” he said. Initially, the consultant had suggested link corridor from Vasudeo Nagar Metro Rail Station to Wadi using abandoned railway line. But it required MIDC land and also of the ordnance factory, hence the consultant later suggested link corridor on 4km road connecting MIDC Hingna T-point with Rahul Hotel Square at Dattawadi. Urban planning expert Parag Date said, “It will not be feasible for constructing Metro Rail on Amravati Road, especially when a corridor already is operational on North Ambazari Road. MahaMetro should make use of road connecting MIDC Hingna T-point with Rahul Hotel Square at Dattawadi for link corridor as this will not require much land acquisition.” This will not only help people from Wadi, Dattawadi and adjoining areas, but also hundreds of workers engaged in factories in MIDC Hingna, he said. Similarly, a series of flyovers have been constructed on Koradi Road eliminating scope for having rapid transit system on this national highway connecting Saoner to Madhya Pradesh. Twin flyovers are also proposed on Umred Road. Metro Rail covers major highways like Wardha Road, Bhandara Road, Kamptee Road and Hingna Road. Whatever infrastructure activities are to be taken up should be initiated only after proper planning, or else the utility value of the same reduces as it happened in case of Chhatrapati Square flyover on Wardha Road, which was demolished after a few years. Also, another proposal is in the works to bring down flyover situated in front of the main railway station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-metro-on-amravati-road-but-2-flyovers/articleshow/88419897.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Hyderabad||Sub-categorise most backward groups in SCs: Revanth||Hyderabad: Telangana Congress president and Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy has demanded that the central government amend the Constitution to sub-categorise the most backward groups in the Scheduled Castes (SCs). He raised the issue under Rule 377 in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday and said the reservation policy without special protection to most backward castes within SCs was creating new inequalities in terms of education and employment. “The Dalit movement in Telugu states has been divided into groups along the lines of new inequities. The shared list of Scheduled Castes, both advanced and backward, is establishing new disparities and setting the groundwork for divides within the Scheduled Castes,” he said. Revanth pointed out that in every village it is increasingly seen that the Madigas, Rellis and Mehtars are in juxtaposition to Malas and Adi-Andhra. “According to the Justice (Rtd) Usha Mehra Commission, 22 of the 59 SCs in Telugu states have seen no progress. Backward groups within SCs, such as the Madigas, Rellis, and Mehtars, are the most backward within SCs in Telugu States. All the committees and commissions formed to investigate different concerns relating to application of reservations to Scheduled Castes suggested that special reservations be granted to the most backward scheduled castes within SCs,” he said. The Congress MP urged the centre to sub-categorise the Scheduled Castes into groups and allow the state governments to distribute reservation benefits and provide equitable social justice in word and spirit of the Constitution. To another question by MPs A Revanth Reddy and Feroze Varun Gandhi, Union minister of state for rural development in a written reply stated that the socio economic and caste census (SECC) of 2011 has helped in tackling multidimensional poverty more efficiently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sub-categorise-most-backward-groups-in-scs-revanth/articleshow/88419888.cms||---

The location of the animal can be easily traced if they are fixed with the collars and forest department can try to keep the animal in forest area itself so that the animal do not enter farmlands to create nuisance.” “The animal has to be tranquillized first to fix the radio collar and the process has its own risk. Similar experiments have been done in other states and it has been found that the elephants somehow remove the collar or they fall on its own,” he added. There are a total of six elephants in the district that are found mainly in Ajara and Chandgad regions. “Out of these, as per the forest department language Kaloba Ganesh is from Ajara, whereas Anna and Tusker Ganesh are from Chandgad. The remaining is a female with two young elephants,” Patil said. Umakant Chavan, environment researcher, said, “Radio collars should be tagged if the count of animals is high in the region and the forest department is unable to track them. In Kolhapur, there are few elephants that stay in close vicinity from villages and are easily spotted in Ajara and Chandgad region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/radio-collars-proposed-for-tuskers-in-kolhapur/articleshow/88418497.cms||Rahul Gayakwad
---||Delhi||Firm seizes vehicle for non-payment during pandemic, draws city court ire||New Delhi: A Delhi court has come down heavily on a financial services company for allegedly illegally retaining a vehicle bought by a man due to non-payment, saying the act of the company has caused immense hardship and mental harassment to the customer. Additional Sessions Judge Bharti Beniwal said that since the vehicle was seized from the petitioner in the month of August and he could not earn during this time, the company was burdened with a cost of Rs 40,000 for the hardship and mental harassment caused to him. It said that the company was at liberty to recover the amount of cost imposed from the salaries of the officers/employees responsible for this unlawful act. The petitioner stated that he had bought a car for about Rs 7 lakh, out of which Rs 1.7 lakh was given in cash as down payment and the remaining amount of Rs 5.35 was financed by Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. The company had divided the loan amount to be paid in 48 monthly installments. He stated that he had made the first installment in January 2019 and regularly paid total 19 EMIs, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he could not pay the EMI from April 2020 to August 2020. He further claimed that he had again started paying the EMI from September 2020 to January 2021. Thereafter, he could not pay the EMI regularly. He submitted before the court that due to non-payment of EMIs, the company forcefully got the possession of the vehicle from him on August 7, 2021. The company’s counsel had claimed that the vehicle was hypothecated in its favour in order to secure dues and obligations of the customer under the loan agreement. Advocate Ravi Prakash Mishra, appearing for the petitioner, had stated that he was a driver and the vehicle was the only source of income for him and his family. The court said that it was deprecating the practice adopted by the defendant company. “The act of the defendant company has caused immense hardship and mental harassment to the plaintiff. The court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic has triggered one of the worst jobs crises we have seen. Further, the pandemic has brought the economy of India to a halt over the past one and half year. The court cannot shut its eyes to the injustice caused to the plaintiff,” it said in an order on December 17. The court further directed the company to release the vehicle to the petitioner within three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/firm-seizes-vehicle-for-non-payment-during-pandemic-draws-city-court-ire/articleshow/88419966.cms||Usha Das

Dr Mishra and his student Veer Singh already published this research in the international journal ‘Separation Science and Technology’. He said that the hexavalent chromium is responsible for several types of health problems in humans like various types of cancers, liver and kidney and liver malfunctioning, and skin problems. This is a new eco-friendly product, synthesized from the Citrus limetta (mausmi) peels biomass. This adsorbent is very effective for removal of hexavalent chromium from waste water compared to other conventional methods and takes less time to hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution. According to Dr Mishra, this adsorbent can be easily separated from the aqueous medium after the metal removal process. The researchers have tested the hexavalent chromium removal capacity of this adsorbent in synthetic simulated waste water and have found satisfactory results. The heavy metal removal efficiency of this adsorbent was also tested for other heavy metal ions, such as lead and cadmium, and found emerging heavy metal removal efficiency of this adsorbent. He said that in developing countries, water-borne diseases are the major problem. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year 3.4 million people, mostly children, die from water-related diseases. According to a United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) assessment, 4,000 children die each day due to the intake of bacterial contaminated water. WHO reports that over 2.6 billion people lack access to clean water, which is responsible for about 2.2 million deaths annually, of which 1.4 million are children. Improving water quality can reduce the global water-borne diseases. Cancer due to hexavalent chromium and other heavy metal ions is a severe problem worldwide. Report from the water resources ministry says that a large number of the Indian population drink water with lethal levels of toxic heavy metals. About the socio-economic aspect of this research, Dr Mishra said that this research is focused on the cost-effective, eco-friendly method for removal of heavy metal ions from water. Citrus limetta peels are readily available as fruit waste. Adsorbent synthesis from this and chitosan is a cost effective and eco-friendly method.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mosambi-peels-to-remove-cancer-iit-bhu-research/articleshow/88420931.cms||Binay Singh

The directions were issued in response to a letter written to the CM by a Kota resident who had said his five-year-old son suffering from rare disease was denied treatment by JK Hospital as he was unable to afford the cost of treatment which was more than Rs 50 lakh per year. TOI had published a story highlighting the issue recently. “Mohammad Rafiq, a resident of Kota, has attracted attention saying despite high court orders, children with rare diseases such as Gaucher and Lysosomal storage disorder are being denied treatment at JK Lon Hospital,” the letter reads by CMO. The CMO further added, “The provision of treatment of rare diseases has been made under national policy for rare diseases, 2021. Hence, it is directed that children with rare diseases should get the treatment under the policy.” The JK Lon Hospital says since the treatment is expensive, treatment of such children requires a lot of funds. “Under the national policy on rare diseases, the Centre has authorised a few centres including Jodhpur AIIMS, which provides treatment for such children with crowd funding. JK Lon Hospital is not among such centres,” said Dr Arvind Shukla, superintendent, JK Lon Hospital. He said treatment of such children is possible only through crowd funding as they require lakhs of rupees for medicines every year. The 38-year-old Rafiq, who had written to the CM seeking help said, “I already lost my daughter earlier, now my son is also suffering from the same disease. If he is not provided treatment, it will be difficult for him to survive.” Rafiq has a vegetable shop in Kota and he is not capable of providing expensive treatment to his child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cmo-orders-treatment-of-a-kid-with-rare-disease/articleshow/88419914.cms||---

The prosecution case is that Manuvel George from Kerala, who had obtained permission for a stock yard for storing the minerals, exploited the licence and was involved in illegal quarrying of river sand from a nearby check dam and patta lands at Therku Kallidaikuruchi village in Tirunelveli district last year. The sub-collector of Cheranmahadevi imposed a penalty of Rs 9.57 crore and a criminal case was also registered against him and 22 others. While hearing a batch of petitions seeking to prevent illegal sand quarrying at the village, a division bench took serious note of the fact that several officials from revenue, mines, police and agriculture departments facilitated the illegal sand mining and hence transferred the case to CB-CID on July 20, 2021. The court was hearing the bail petition filed by Gopi who was arrested by the Tirunelveli CB-CID police on November 24. The petitioner has been arrayed as the 13th accused in the case. Justice G Ilangovan said interim anticipatory bail was earlier granted to George. It may not be proper for the court to detain the petitioner on the ground that he is the main person who made all arrangements for committing the illegal activities. Taking into account the role played by the petitioner in the offence and the fact that a major portion of the investigation was completed, the judge granted bail to the petitioner on certain conditions.TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/man-gets-bail-in-illegal-sand-mining-case/articleshow/88419913.cms||---

The affected include an 11-month-old girl and a six-year-old boy from Mumbai, both asymptomatic, officials said. State officials said barring the children, all adults are fully vaccinated and have mild to no symptoms. Eight of the 11 new cases were found in Mumbai, most during screening at the airport, while three were detected from Pimpri-Chinchwad, Osmanabad and Navi Mumbai. The patients are mostly travellers who landed in the city between December 7 to December 16. Their samples were sent for genome sequencing. Officials said 34 of the 65 patients have been discharged. Of 65 cases in the state, 31 are from Mumbai, a dozen from Pimpri Chinchwad and ten from Pune. The children, who were detected with Omicron, had returned from Uganda via Dubai on December 7. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC's executive health officer said the family’s samples were collected from their homes as part of surveillance of foreign returnees. "None of the adults in the family tested positive," she said. Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills Hospital, said the children were asymptomatic but hospitalised for precaution. Of the eight Omicron patients found at Mumbai airport, five are Mumbai residents and three are from Thane, Kerala and Gujarat. Among Mumbai residents, two had returned from UK on December 14 and December 15. The fifth Mumbaikar to test positive is a 59-year-old man with a travel history to Dubai in mid-December. A 19-year-old from Navi Mumbai was the first to be detected from Thane district. “The youth had travelled to Kenya and returned to Hyderabad last week, where his swab test turned out to be positive. However, the youth returned to Navi Mumbai before his RT-PCR test result was declared in Hyderabad. On Monday, it was also confirmed that he has Omicron. All possible precautions are being undertaken,” Sanjay Kakade, NMMC additional municipal commissioner told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/11-more-omicron-cases-in-maharashtra-total-is-now-65/articleshow/88420964.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Chandra said that concerns about disenfranchisement of voters are misplaced, as there are adequate safeguards to ensure that voters’ names are not arbitrarily deleted. “This is a very useful bill which has been passed, and the reason for this particular linkage, I think, is that in our voter rolls, the person’s vote is recorded in two or three places. This will help us in eliminating the names of the same person who is registered in more than one particular constituency,” said Chandra. The Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which enables the linking of electoral roll data with the Aadhaar database, has been passed by both houses of Parliament. Asked if he is in favour of the bill and if the reforms will benefit the Election Commission, Chandra replied in the affirmative, saying “100%”. “This will ensure that the electoral roll is very clean, but I can assure you, that no name will be deleted without full verification,” said Chandra. The chief election commissioner said that the bill also allows the enrolment exercise to be conducted four times a year for youth who attain 18 years of age. Earlier, only those youth who turned 18 on January 1 could be registered to vote. “Now, there are four dates in a year to enrol people who have attained the age of 18. This will bring young voters in the electoral roll four times in a year rather than once a year. This is the most effective reform that has come in since the Act was brought in in 1951,” said Chandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/poll-reforms-bill-a-good-initiative-will-ensure-deletion-of-bogus-voters-cec/articleshow/88441559.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: This newsreader is taking free maths classes for over 50 years||DHARWAD: December 22 is not the only date for 73-year-old Nagesh Shanbag to mark Mathematics Day. He has done it every year for over five decades by teaching maths to high school students for free or for a nominal fee, which too he gave to needy students. December 22 is celebrated as National Mathematics Day to mark the birth anniversary of Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Shanbag, who was a familiar voice on All India Radio (AIR) as a newsreader, has been teaching mathematics to students in Dharwad although he was not trained as a teacher. His students are now spread across the world. Shanbag told TOI that teaching mathematics has been his hobby since his degree days and it stayed with him even after joining AIR. “Earlier, I used to teach high school students too. Now, due to age, I have restricted my teaching to students of Class X of state and CBSE schools,” he said. Shanbag gave an unusual reason for continuing with teaching --- selfishness. “I have selfishness when it comes to teaching Mathematics. It keeps me fit mentally and I feel young and energetic while interacting with teenagers,” he said. “Many students feel maths is a boring subject,” he said. “Maybe, the lack of enthusiasm among teachers is the reason for it. But I say mathematics is not only interesting but it’s also the easiest subject. I try to give the child a strong foundation.” On why he started accepting fees voluntarily paid by parents, Shanbag recalls the case of a student who had secured 96% in SSLC. “When I suggested he take science and go for engineering, his mother said they have financial constraints. I said we can think about it later. After two years, the question arose again. He needed Rs 12,000 to join engineering. I had Rs 5,000, and then I took the help of my friends. Then came the second year. My daughter suggested that I accept a fee from whoever gives voluntarily and use that for such poor students. I started taking fees after 42 years as a mathematics tutor. I pass on the amount to the needy,” he said. Dr Anand Kabbur, the president of the Dr NB Kabbur Samaraka Shikshana Vikasa Anweshana Pratisthana, said Shanbag earlier taught students at Pratisthana for free too. “He used to train Mathematics teachers and teach candidates of competitive exams here. Now we have shut classes, but he forwards all his tuition earnings to us for the scholarship of poor but talented students,” he added. Sanjeev Angadi, who had joined Shanbag’s tuitions in 1990-91 and is currently the vice-president at a BPO in Bengaluru, said he found Math boring till he went to Shanbag’s classes. He made Sanjeev fall in love with Math. “My speed of solving sums improved a lot. Apart from the tuitions, he (Shanbag) guided us about our future. When he did not know about something, he gave us contacts of the right persons. He never asked for a fee. Some parents used to pay a fee forcibly but that money he forwarded to students who were in need,” Sanjeev said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/newsreader-who-taught-almost-for-free-for-over-five-decades/articleshow/88418536.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Madurai||Bid to space out intervals at schools in Tirunelveli district||TIRUNELVELI: The district administration is exploring the option of spacing out intervals in schools to avert tragedies like the toilet wall collapse that claimed the lives of three students and left four injured at Schaffter higher secondary school last Thursday. The incident took place during the interval around 11 am when students thronged the toilet at the same time. “We are working with the school education department to regulate the interval time such that all the classes don’t have the interval at the same time,” district collector V Vishnu told TOI. Accordingly, a few classes will have interval at a said time, followed by the other classes in batches. He said they will emphasise on building more toilets for schools where the existing facility is not commensurate with the student strength. These measures are apart from identifying and demolishing school buildings in dilapidated condition and initiating action against those responsible for the tragedy. A sensitisation programme is also planned for headmasters and teachers to motivate them to jump into action and save those in distress. “The ‘First Samaritan’ programme is where they will be incentivised,” Vishnu added. It may be recalled that three physical education teachers of the school were suspended for failing to regulate the crowd. On the other hand, students alleged that a few teachers stood as mute spectators without helping the students who were stuck below the debris, stopping other students from helping them and by not providing their cars to rush them to hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bid-to-space-out-intervals-at-schools-in-tirunelveli-dist/articleshow/88419935.cms||M K Ananth

Rev Frank Ben Roosevelt, deputy chairman of CSI ciocese of Madurai and Ramnad, gave the Christmas message while Rev J John Jeya Kamaraj, the chaplain, led the service. Christopher Sherwood and PFE Divakaran conducted the choir and around 10 songs were performed. “The American College has its own tradition for Christmas carol services which extends for more than 40 years with performance of singing carols and also having readings. In groups, the student choir, faculty and non-teaching staff take part,” said Divakaran.Currently, 45 students are a part of the Jubilee Chapel choir. SAL Sudhakaran, a member of the choir for five years, said it is always special for students of the college to be part of the choir. At the annual carol service of Lady Doak College on December 11, soulful renditions by a children’s choir led by Dr Daisy Gohain, NTS choir led by chaplain Dr Jessie Ranjitha Jebaselvi C and faculty choir led by Dr Marie Serena McConnell were the highlights. “Message in a mess Age” was the theme of the message by motivational speaker and writer Rev Edward Francis.“We had regular practice from December 1 before the performance. Last year, we had a recorded carol service in virtual mode. By streaming the carol services online too, we had more audience. Around 60 students are usually a part of the choir with some students from other religious faiths also generally taking part,” said Dr Jessie. For first year and second year students, this was the first time they performed offline on campus.“Last year, I took part in an online audition to join the choir. We had to record a video and send it, which came out well. But offline performance is better and this year we were also able to practise together with seniors,” said Bibilin Sharon, a second year student. Student choir president Grace Anu summed it up thus: “Being in the choir is not just about singing but it’s more like everyone is a family. We got that feeling back this year with everyone coming together.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/christmas-carols-in-colleges-spread-cheer-in-madurai/articleshow/88419943.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The Rs 475-crore plant will be named Banas Kashi Sankul. Also known as Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, Amul is an apex organization of Banas Dairy. Banas Dairy chairman Shankarbhai Chaudhary on Tuesday said, “With the foundation laying of this plant, which will be third in the state after Lucknow and Kanpur, by the PM in the presence of Governor Anandben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday, Varanasi will see it becoming operational in 18 months.” “The plant will begin with a production capacity of five lakh litres per day,” he said adding, “In the second phase, its capacity will be expanded up to 10 lakh litres per day.” “This plant is being built on 30 acres of land with an estimated cost of Rs 475-crore. The plant will also produce 50,000-litre ice cream, 20-ton paneer, 75,000-liter butter milk, 50-ton curd, 15,000-litre lassi and 10,000-kg Amul sweets per day,” he said, adding, “The plant will also have a bakery unit and will also include a take home ration plant for producing nutritional supplements for women and children.” Banas Dairy managing director Sangram Chaudhary said, “It is the vision of the PM. He told us that Gujarat has been benefited by Operation Flood Programme that was launched to usher in white revolution in the country, and now do something to benefit Varanasi and the surrounding east UP region. On his call, we planned to establish Banas Kashi Sankul for the production of the full range of Amul products.” The project will benefit the local farmers of 1,000 neighbouring villages of Varanasi and surrounding districts, including Jaunpur, Machhlishahr, Chandauli, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Azamgarh. “It will end the problem of price fluctuation for milk producers, getting payment on a weekly basis through direct bank transfer while consumers will also get high quality products at affordable prices. The project is expected to provide direct employment to 750 people in the plant, about 2,350 people in allied areas and about 1,00,000 people in villages,” the chairman added. He further said, “In the beginning, efforts would also be started for breed upgradation of cattle of this region for improvement in milk production of dairy farmers. In July 2021, Banas Dairy had provided 100 cows of the best indigenous breeds to farmer families in Varanasi for model dairy farming. These farmers were given training in cattle rearing and dairy farm management and arrangements have been made for continuous guidance for animal husbandry. Presently, more than 25,000 litres of milk is procured daily from 111 places in Varanasi.” “Apart from laying the foundation of this plant, Rs 35.19 crores would be paid to around 1,75,000 milk farmers as a year-end dividend for the year 2020-21 on the occasion by the PM through digital transfer in farmers’ bank accounts,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-of-rs-475cramul-dairy-plant-in-varanasi-tomorrow/articleshow/88420955.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

Only one experienced operator will maintain and run all 26 toll stations for first three years. MSRDC’s special purpose vehicle — Nagpur Mumbai Super Communication Expressway Limited (NMSCEL) — floated a tender on Tuesday for appointment of one operator for all 26 toll stations. As per tender, last date for submission of bids is February 4, 2022, which raises a question on recent announcement by MSRDC minister Eknath Shinde about opening of stretch from Nagpur to Shirdi in February next year. Till now, there was no clarity on number of toll stations on the expressway being constructed at a cost of Rs55,000 crore. MSRDC vice-chairman and managing director Radheshyam Mopalwar told TOI, “It is final that there will be 26 toll stations. Notification of toll prices for vehicles will be issued before appointment of operator,” he said. MSRDC officials said construction of toll stations is underway. “All 26 toll stations will be operated on latest technology system and installation is also going on,” they said. As per tender, the operator should have average minimum net worth of Rs420 crore in last three financial years, of which 50% shall be from toll collection works. Security deposit and performance security is Rs22 crore each while earnest money deposit is Rs16.07 crore. Criteria mentioned in the tender calls for very highly experienced toll operating company. During Shinde’s visit to the city in August, MSRDC joint managing director Anilkumar Gaikwad said toll for one-way journey from Nagpur to Mumbai will be around Rs1,100. Earlier, MSRDC officials had said vehicles will have to pay toll for only the kilometres they travel on 120-meter wide cement concrete road. Four toll stations are likely to come up on package-I and package-II in Nagpur division. Crossing through 10 districts of the state, the expressway is likely to have 24 wayside amenity centres. MSRDC officials said there will be a wayside amenity centre in around 60km on each side. “Already, 6.5 hectare land has been acquired for each centre, and works are going on for petrol pumps, air filing station, motel, restaurant, toilets etc,” they said. Mopalwar said three oil companies run by the government have been asked to run petrol pumps on the expressway. “Remaining works will be started at later stage.” Toll stations and wayside amenity centres, especially petrol pumps with air filing station, toilets, restaurant, are required for starting traffic. Package-I in the district is reportedly late compared to other packages. Mopalwar inspected this package twice in last one month. “I am not worried about the delay but pushing for completion of works as soon as possible,” he said. MSRDC had also proposed to develop 20 new townships and land acquisition has been going on for last four years,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/single-operator-for-all-26-tolls-on-701km-samruddhi-e-way-msrdc/articleshow/88419956.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Things are different this year and many even want to make up for last year’s loss. So, we have had good business and customers are eager to buy,” said S Kannan, a shopkeeper on East Avani Moola Street. Plastic Christmas trees of various sizes and stars to hang are some of the sought-after items.“We had a good variety of Christmas decorations and stars with new designs. We have seen more shoppers than we expected this time, many of whom bought in bulk,” said N Gnanajothi, another shopkeeper. A Rajeshwari, a resident of Kamarajar Salai, said their family usually sets up a Christmas crib set and a tree to celebrate the festival every year. “Last year, we couldn’t celebrate much as we couldn’t invite guests home. So, everyone was eager to buy new decorations to light up our house this year,” she added. Shopkeepers meanwhile said that the cost of most decorative items has gone up by 25% to 50%. “Most of the decorative items that we get are imported from China or some from states like Maharashtra or Delhi and only some of it is from Madurai. Hence, we are seeing a rise in prices due to inflation. Items that were selling for about Rs 500 now cost even Rs 800,” said Nikhil, a shopkeeper near Pudhu Mandapam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sales-of-stars-decor-items-pick-up/articleshow/88419945.cms||---
---||Goa||HC quashes FIR against Khaunte for ‘causing hurt’||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Tuesday quashed an FIR against former Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte for wrongful restraint and voluntarily causing hurt in the legislative assembly complex, in a complaint filed by BJP spokesperson Premanand Mhambre. “In our considered opinion, the allegations made in the FIR do not clearly constitute a cognizable offence justifying the registration of a case or the commission of any offence under Section 341 or 506 of IPC against the accused, and the FIR in respect of the said charges is liable to be quashed and set aside,” stated the division bench comprising justices Revati Dere and M S Jawalkar. Khaunte submitted to the high court that on February 2, 2019, during the budget session, he raised various issues regarding the performance of the government and highlighted the lack of proper administration by the government, which caused it great discomfort. He added that three days later, BJP state president Sadanand Shet Tanawade addressed a press conference at the party head office and raised questions about the properties and businesses of Khaunte and his family. According to Khaunte, on the same day he and the CM were walking out of the assembly hall, Mhambre shook hands with them and exchanged pleasantries and went his own way, but Tanawade, at a press conference, levelled false charges against him that he had assaulted Mhambre outside the assembly hall, and demanded strict action against him. On the same day, Mhambre filed a complaint with the speaker of the assembly, alleging that Khaunte, in an “angry and furious manner” gripped his hand and asked him why he was concerned about his properties, and that he would show him his father’s and mother’s properties. Mhambre then called upon the speaker to immediately order a police inquiry. “It appears that though there is a prima facie case made out of having committed an offence under Section 323 of IPC, it being a non-cognisable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without the order of the magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the CrPC. As such, the FIR registered with respect to having committed an offence under Section 323 of IPC is also liable to be quashed and set aside. Consequently, the charge sheet on the basis of the said FIR is also liable to be quashed and set aside. The investigating officer is at liberty to take necessary steps as per the provisions of law.” Khaunte was represented by senior advocate S S Kantak and Ryan Menezes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-quashes-fir-against-khaunte-for-causing-hurt/articleshow/88441593.cms||---

With this, the total number of members suspended from Rajya Sabha goes up to 13. The session is to conclude on December 23. This comes on a day when the opposition staged a walkout over a bill on electoral reforms to link voters’ cards with Aadhaar. The opposition wanted a division of votes as they had moved a motion to send the proposed law to a select committee, which was rejected by voice vote. The TMC MP was suspended after he allegedly threw the Rule Book at the direction of the Chair during a discussion on the Election Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021. Before adjourning the proceedings for the day, Sasmit Patra, who was in the Chair, condemned the behaviour of O’Brien. A motion for his suspension was moved by the government and approved with voice vote. It said O’Brien has been suspended “from the services of the House for the remaining part of the current session for his unruly and contemptuous behaviour, unbecoming of a member of Rajya Sabha, by brazenly throwing the Rajya Sabha Rule book towards the Chair… thereby bringing disrepute and shame to the august House”. Taking to Twitter, O’Brien said he has been suspended for protesting against BJP which was “making a mockery” of Parliament by “bulldozing” the electoral reforms bill, hoping it will also be repealed soon. “The last time I got suspended from RS was when govt. was BULLDOZING #FarmLaws,” the TMC leader tweeted. “We all know what happened after that.” The last time I got suspended from RS was when govt. was BULLDOZING #FarmLaws We all know what happened after tha… https://t.co/TkU77jri4S— Derek O'Brien | ডেরেক ও'ব্রায়েন (@derekobrienmp) 1640090605000||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/obrien-suspended-from-rajya-sabha-for-unruly-behaviour/articleshow/88421573.cms||Mohua Chatterjee

These will include Subhas Chandra Bose, Chittaranjan Das, Sri Aurobindo, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lal Bahadur Sashtri, Bhagat Singh, Tantia Tope, Lala Lajpat Rai, Rani Lakshmi Bai, Mangal Pandey, Biju Patnaik, Jaiprakash Narayan, Dadabhai Naoroji, Ram Singh Kuka and Rani Gandinliu,” said NSC joint secretary Vinod Jaiswal. For instance, there will be seven coins on Gandhi: one 20 paise coin in aluminium bronze; one 50 paise denomination in pure nickel; one Re 1 coin in pure nickel, two coins of Rs 5 denomination in cupro-nickel and steel, and two coins of Rs 10 denomination in bi-metal and silver. The 16 other cabinets will showcase coins on subjects that range from early coins of Bengal to early medieval Bengal coins, Mughal coins from Bengal mints, coins from Murshidabad and Cooch Behar, bi-metal coins on birds and animals, coins and notes on Indian flag and bank notes on Nobel laureates. “The Indian coins on display will cover a very wide period — from the 6th century to the modern era. There will be coins issued by various dynasties in eastern India through time. Also, there will be a display of coins manufactured by mints in Bengal located in Murshidabad, Jahangirnagar, Dhaka and Akbarnagar,” said NSC secretary Ravi Shankar Sharma. The three-day event starting Christmas eve will also raise awareness on frauds in social/electronic media who have been trying to mislead the public on the rarity/value of post-Independence currencies. “This kind of fake campaign is a threat. It is causing harm to the professional numismatists and citizens being trapped. We have asked stall holders to immediately alert the NSC counter if any such incident is noticed during Mudra Utsav 2021,” said Jaiswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/coin-exhibition-to-celebrate-75-years-of-independence/articleshow/88419357.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MSEDCL gets back Rs 2,100cr arrears from 17L farmers||Mumbai: The Maharashtra Agriculture Pump Power Connection policy, 2020, has succeeded in pursuing 17.4 lakh farmers across the state in the past 12 months to repay pending electricity bill arrears to the tune of Rs 2,100 crore. “This is a huge recovery from farmers considering that there was very low recovery in the past few years,” said an official. While this has brought such a huge sum to the MSEDCL kitty, the latter has now decided to utilise Rs 1,400 crore to create better infrastructure in villages and towns for the farmers. The new infrastructure will involve strengthening of existing electricity distribution systems, installing high capacity transformers and substations. It will also involve repair and maintenance of existing feeders to ensure uninterrupted supply, an official said. While some farmers paid 30% of pending electricity bills, others paid 50% while some have zero arrears as on date, a senior official said. “We are glad that the policy has attracted a large number of farmers and brought in revenue for MSEDCL,” he added.  The state plans to give at least eight hours of electricity during the daytime to farmers and in the five years, plans to generate 17,360 MW solar energy which can be distributed for agriculture pumps.

---||Allahabad||HC to Govt: Strive to timely advertise sr posts, fill vacancies in med colleges||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court has directed the Uttar Pradesh government to make sincere efforts to see that senior level posts are timely advertised in all the medical colleges of the state and vacancies are filled expeditiously, as it directly affects the teaching of students. Disposing of a writ petition filed by Dr. Yasmeen Usmani, Justice Alok Mathur further directed that a copy of this order shall be communicated to the principal secretary, medical education, government of Uttar Pradesh by the chief standing counsel, representing the state government. The petitioner is a professor in the radio-diagnosis department of the Shaikh-Ul-Hind Maulana Mahmood Hasan Medical College, Saharanpur. By a state government order dated August 24, 2021, she was directed to perform duties for four days in a week at the medical college, Meerut while the remaining two days, she was to work at Saharanpur. She challenged the said order before the high court, where her counsel submitted that a piquant situation has arisen on account to the fact that between both the medical colleges, the petitioner is the only professor of radio diagnosis department. Consequently, due to acute shortage of vacancy of specialists in the field of radio diagnosis, the services of the petitioner has been divided in the two medical colleges. It was submitted that the petitioner being a lady, so commuting 150 kms twice a week, is a heavy burden and consequently requested that she may be permitted to resume and continue with her services at medical college, Meerut. However, the state counsel supported the aforesaid order stating that the same has been passed in the public interest as well as in the interest of the patients and consequently she is the only professor in the radio diagnosis department, hence she has been asked to perform the duties for four days in a week at Meerut and two days at Saharanpur. Disposing of the petition, the court directed the petitioner to make a fresh representation before the principal secretary, medical education, government of UP, within two weeks, which shall be considered and decided in accordance with law expeditiously within a period of four weeks thereafter and communicate the decision to the petitioner. However, while passing the above directives in its order dated December 20, the court took serious note of vacant posts of state medical colleges, observing, “This court has an opportunity to notice the present situation where at such senior level in two medical colleges, there is acute shortage of senior staff including post of professor in the radio diagnosis department, which has led to passing of the aforesaid order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-to-govt-strive-to-timely-advertise-sr-posts-fill-vacancies-in-med-colleges/articleshow/88420961.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

Till last weekend, the permission was necessary for gathering over more than 1,000 people. In a fresh circular, BMC chief I S Chahal said on Monday that if more than 200 people gather for any programme or activity, whether, social, religious or political, after December 20, prior written permission of the assistant commissioner of the local ward would be required. Further, the local ward would send representatives to supervise, as observers, the gatherings to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour. On December 18, Chahal had asked citizens to completely avoid any kind of gathering or parties for Christmas or New Year’s Eve. On Monday, the circular took it further, saying since Mumbai continues to be threatened with the spread of Covid-19 (especially the Omicron variant), it is imperative to continue with the measures to prevent and contain the spread of virus, with a view to prevent danger to human life. The civic body has reiterated that in case of any programme function/gathering/wedding/ party meeting, activity or happening whether, social, religious or political takes place in enclosed/closed spaces, people up to 50% of the capacity of the space will be allowed by strictly observing social distancing and other Covid-appropriate behaviour.

---||Delhi||Maps, animations and holograms: Mughals holding court at Red Fort in Delhi||NEW DELHI: It is not just a fort. Or any fort. It is the throne of power in the seat of power. It is the place from where the highest elected representative of the world’s largest democracy speaks to its people. The Red Fort, with centuries of history behind it — last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried here by the British after the failed 1857 War of Independence, and so were INA’s Shahnawaz Khan, Prem Sahgal and Gurbaksh Dhillon in 1945, sparking protests all over the country — will now tell this history at a multi-storeyed visitor’s centre managed by the 77-year-old Dalmia Bharat group. For the centre, the Dalmias have restored a sprawling barrack used by the British army within the fort, peeling off ugly paint to show up the original old-brick structure. This has ensured the structure doesn’t become an eyesore in a fort known for its architecture. Now, hold your breath, if you love history, and you love maps. The Dalmia Bharat centre has maps, lots of them, giant ones, colourful ones, maps with sections that can be opened and closed — you can play with these maps actually to know, for instance, what was happening around the world when Mughal emperor Shah Jahan ruled India from this fort. There is a wall-to-wall sketch of Red Fort and the city of Shahjahanabad, copied from an original drawing by Gordon Sanderson, an officer with the Archaeological Survey of India during the British rule. The barbican built by Shah Jahan’s successor, Aurangzeb, in 1659 to shield the fort from public gaze (and public wrath since he wasn’t much liked after the way he treated his father) is recorded, and one pillar of the barbican replicated in the visitor’s centre along with a human height-measuring tape to show the size of the boundary wall of this mighty fort. To give visitors a feel of the Mughal court, the Dalmias have blown up a painting and turned it into animation. So you can see the emperor enter the court, with the durbar in full swing. Another screen shows the layered seating of the common people, wazirs and courtiers in Diwan-i-Aam with 3D or hologram impact. The visitor’s centre, which will be open to the public soon, is part of the Dalmia Bharat group’s five-year adoption of the Red Fort as part of an MoU signed with the Centre in 2018. Anand Bhardwaj, who is spearheading the project, said the group had spent its CSR funds, and would, in all probability, levy a ticket on visitors to recover the cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/maps-animations-and-holograms-mughals-holding-court-at-red-fort/articleshow/88419995.cms||Aparna Kalra

From December 20, 2021, onwards.” Till Tuesday morning, the Air Suvidha portal said all international arrivals at Mumbai needed to pre-book RT-PCR tests. This was based on an earlier Maharashtra government order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/airport-rule-rt-pcr-only-if-from-at-risk-nations-in-mumbai/articleshow/88420999.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Kolkata||CISCE sends sample questions for 2nd semester||KOLKATA: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on Tuesday sent sample question papers for the second semester exams of ICSE and ISC, which will be subjective unlike the first semester exams that were MCQ-based. Schools said that since the sample questions have been sent well in advance, they will have enough time to make students practise. Schools are presently busy with practice for practical exams — punctuated by short winter breaks — that will have to be completed by January 31. After that, the syllabus for the second-semester will have to be completed and sample questions practised. The Council has prepared sample questions for all subjects and posted them on the website as well so that candidates can get an idea of what is expected of them. There will be a mix of objectives — where candidates will have to write short answers — subjective questions, which will carry greater weightage. Here, candidates will be expected to write longer answers. Subjective questions will need analytical answers in many cases, school heads said after studying the sample questions. The question pattern has slightly changed to help children use their understanding of concepts rather than falling back on rote, school heads said. The biggest challenge is to get students to get back to writing, schools felt, because they have been out of touch with writing during the past 20 months of online teaching. Also, the past three months of preparations for the MCQ mode of exam have also kept children from getting back to long-hand writing. “However, children are much more adaptable than we think. The Council has kept in mind the challenge of writing and we find that very long answers are not there. In English, analytical questions are of four marks. The challenge is to train students to write content keeping in mind the marks allotted and time limit,” said Sonali Sen, principal of DPS Newtown.  Ian Myers, principal of Frank Anthony Public School, agreed. “There is a combination of objective and subjective type questions, so students now have to switch over from the MCQ pattern. It is quite a challenge considering the time factor because the syllabus will also have to be completed,” he said. Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls, said that since the sample papers have been sent timely, students will have time to understand the rubrics of the papers. Father Rodney Borneo, principal of St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar felt the sample papers were student-friendly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cisce-sends-sample-questions-for-2nd-sem/articleshow/88419420.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

While this will ease the worries of those parents who are not too keen to send their children to school until they are vaccinated, it will leave another section of parents who want the children to go to school flustered. The notice issued by school education department commissioner Anindya Narayan Biswas states that since schools are not re-opening for classes from pre-primary to VIII, the books may be handed over to parents. Offline classes have resumed for students of classes IX to XII that reopened on November 16. Department officials have since been discussing on when to reopen junior sections. Education minister Bratya Basu had also hinted at the possibility and a meeting was held to discuss the issue. However, fears about a surge in Covid cases following the emergence of Omicron appears to have triggered a rethink. Jadavpur Vidyapith headmaster Parimal Bhattacharyya said the department had taken the prudent decision to distribute books in January. Scottish Church Collegiate School principal Bibhas Sanyal added that while students are eager to return, one has to act according to the evolving situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-junior-classes-at-state-schools-any-time-soon/articleshow/88419438.cms||---
---||Delhi||No ‘VIP class’ in new hospitals being built by Delhi govt: Satyendar Jain||NEW DELHI: Health minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said the hospitals being constructed by the Delhi government would not have any “VIP class” as there wouldn’t be any private room. The AAP government’s hospitals will have airconditioned wards for all patients, and everyone will receive better treatment than in private hospitals, he said. Jain, who was inaugurating an advanced life support ambulance at Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya in east Delhi, said health services should be for everyone and there should be no “exclusivity” as the Delhi government didn’t believe in good treatment for 10 out of 100 patients, leaving 90 patients aside. “I believe all 100 should get the best treatment and we are talking about Metro class, not VIP class,” he said. All these government hospitals will have only normal wards, all of which will be airconditioned and for everyone like the Metro, the minister stated. “The Metro is airconditioned and fabulous, and it doesn’t have any VIP class.” The “culture” of private rooms has ruined government hospitals, he rued. Jain also said that with treatment for government doctors and other employees allowed in private facilities, government hospitals were overlooked and eventually got ruined. “The Delhi government hospitals that are being constructed will be better than private hospitals. Those who want private rooms can go to private hospitals, but those who want treatment can come to our hospitals and we take full guarantee of treatment,” he said. “We want to treat all two crore people of Delhi.” Seven hospitals are coming up in Delhi for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the next four-five months, and work is going on at 20 other hospitals, Jain pointed out. “This is world’s biggest expansion programme with 20,000 beds under construction. Most of the work will be completed by 2022 and some by 2023.” He claimed, “There are 29 other governments in the country, apart from the central government, and all these governments combined are not making as many hospital beds as the Delhi government.” Jain said the ambulance service, launched on Tuesday, would be available round the clock. “This ambulance can work as a mini operation theatre. It will have special facilities for infant and newborn patients like an incubator, monitor and oxygen therapy,” he said, thanking Seed India Foundation for donating it. He said a 600-bed building was also coming up at Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, which would make it the country’s biggest paediatric facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-vip-class-in-new-hosps-being-built-by-govt-jain/articleshow/88420003.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||Jammu man may have died of heart blockage: Delhi Police||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police said on Tuesday that the possible reason behind the death of a 36-year-old Jammu man in south Delhi's Greater Kailash might be heart blockage, but suspects are being nevertheless questioned. Benita Mary Jaiker, DCP (South) said following the post-mortem examination, the surgeon verbally confirmed that the probability of murder wasn’t determined. “The possible reason for death could be due to 70-80% blockage of blood vessels leading to the heart. The final report is expected in 2-3 days. So, no arrests have been made yet,” an investigative officer said. According to Jaiker, all things will be clearer once the post-mortem report was received. In the meantime, everyone whom Rahul Thakur, a native of Jammu, was in touch with are being questioned to get clarity about the possible sequence of events leading to this death. Thakur lived with his mother in a rented accommodation on the ground floor of the house in S Block of Greater Kailash I. According to sources, police have questioned a few people, including some drivers about people who visited Thakur’s house on Monday. “In the house, we found everything intact. The laptop, mobile phones, his money all were found in his room. One lock was found broken from inside,” a source disclosed. However, one person who visited the Thakur house late at night was captured leaving the house by two CCTV cameras in the colony. Police sources said the person has been identified and interrogated but not arrested. During the investigation, Delhi Police registered a case of murder at the GK police station. DCP Jaiker said preliminary inquiry has established that Thakur may have been smothered to death but that they were waiting for a post-mortem report for more clarity. According to the local residents, a maid came to the house in the morning as usual but found the door to Thakur’s house open. “The maid got suspicious and she went and conferred with the owner of the house, who lives on the second floor. Together, they rushed to the ground floor and informed police,” a local said. Residents of S Block also claimed that the night patrolling in the area had decreased. Recently, a house in the locality was burgled. "The house belongs to an 80-year-old retired teacher who is currently on a visit to the US,” a resident said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jammu-man-may-have-died-of-heart-blockage/articleshow/88420010.cms||---

---||Delhi||3-year delay in obtaining nod for prosecution draws court’s ire||New Delhi: A city court pulled up Delhi Police for delay of about three years in obtaining the sanction required for prosecution in a case related to organising of a rally in violation of Model Code of Conduct by then AAP leader in 2014, saying such blemishes on the part of the police establishment are not palatable and demonstrate an unsavory casual kind of approach. District Judge Dharmesh Sharma said that such blemishes not only undermine the importance of free and fair elections but also strike at the root of the whole democratic ideals of this nation. As per the prosecution, former AAP leader Veena Anand had conducted election campaigning allegedly without any permission. After obtaining the sanction for prosecution on April 5, 2017, the final police report was filed on May 5, 2017, on which date cognisance of the offence was taken and summons were issued to Anand. A magistrate court had on March 18, 2021 allowed the application seeking condonation of delay and a notice was issued under Section 188 IPC against Anand. Anand challenged the order before the sessions court. District Judge Sharma said it clearly appeared to be an alleged case of disobedience of lawful order passed by a public servant. The court, however, added that such disobedience was not to cause or tend to cause any danger to human life, health or safety or cause a riot. “The cognisance of the offence taken by the court on 05.05.2017 was clearly barred by limitation in terms of Section 468 (2) (b) of the Cr.P.C. that provided that period of limitation would be one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a terms not extending one year,” it noted in the order on December 10. It added that a bare perusal of the application by Kumar dated April 5, 2017, merely spells out that investigation was assigned to him on May 16, 2016, and all the officers prior to him were trying their best to obtain the requisite sanction. “It is shocking to find out that the whole department of Delhi Police did not know as to how the request for obtaining sanction for prosecution from the Returning Officer (Election), New Delhi is to be routed and it appears that the IO directly forwarded a letter to the Returning Officer (Election) on 30.10.2014 and there was second reminder on 16.01.2015 and thereafter third reminder was given on 04.07.2016,” it further noted. “The entire police establishment was in the dark as to what procedure be followed… Hence, I am of the considered view that there was no sufficient cause to condone the inordinate delay for obtaining sanction or permission for prosecution,” the judge said. The court set aside the magistrate court’s order and quashed the proceedings emanating out of the FIR lodged in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3-year-delay-in-obtaining-nod-for-prosecution-draws-courts-ire/articleshow/88420006.cms||Usha Das

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: From today, unlimited BEST bus rides on monthly pass||MUMBAI: The BEST undertaking introduced unlimited rides on monthly passes, special student passes and an unique colour coding for indicating occupancy in buses on its mobile app, Chalo, which was launched by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray on Tuesday. Thackeray urged BEST to go for a hydrogen fuel cell bus, like the one designed in Pune that provides a range of 450km utilising 30kg of hydrogen. The fuel cell uses hydrogen fuel cells and air to generate electricity to power the bus. The only effluent from the bus is water and therefore it is an environment-friendly mode of transportation. Thackeray suggested “Haath dakhva, bus thamba” (Show hand and stop bus) facility for students as he also launched BEST’s National Common Mobility Card-compliant smartcard which can be linked with any mode of transport in India, including Metro and railways, and soon also with bank ATMs and retail outlets. The unlimited rides monthly pass can be availed on the app or smartcard for Rs 1,000 for non-AC BEST buses across Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane. The price for unlimited monthly rides in AC buses is Rs 1,250. For students, there is a new category of monthly pass 100 trips for Rs 200, quarterly pass 300 trips for Rs 600, and half-yearly pass 600 trips for Rs 1,000. Physically challenged persons can get a three-year free pass. BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said an unique feature in the app was the “colour coding of buses” arriving at stops. “You can get the estimated time of arrival of any bus at any stop, and every bus has a colour code. A green colour indicates the bus has seats available, amber colour means only standing facility is available, and red colour means the bus is full,” he said. The app showed that a daily unlimited ride pass was for Rs 60 for AC buses and Rs 50 for non-AC. —Somit Sen||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-from-today-unlimited-best-bus-rides-on-monthly-pass/articleshow/88421334.cms||Somit Sen
---||Nagpur||Cold weather a chance to boost immunity: Doctors||Nagpur: City has witnessed a sudden drop in the day’s minimum temperature in the last three days. After Covid-19, people are more alert about their health-related issues following every season change. The sudden drop in temperature has increased worries for many. However, doctors have advised that healthy people should use this period to boost their immunity. Patients with ailments like asthma and arthritis, may turn serious due to cold; doctors have some general tips to maintain health as the cold wave is set to stay here for more than a week. Physicians have insisted that people should continue their routine, especially the daily walks, exercise, and Yoga without fail during the cold. “Get over the laziness and continue your daily schedule. Walking, running, cycling, other exercises, and Yoga in cold weather keep your body warm and also maintains immunity,” said physician Dr Anu Vishwas. Eating right during cold also is important, she added. “As soon as the cold wave sets in, we get to see more patients with cough, viral infections, general cold, and flu-like illnesses. But, these are seasonal problems and everything cannot be linked with Covid-19,” said general physician Dr Sudesh Bhakre. Not many doctors are advising RT-PCR to every patient with seasonal symptoms, he said. “We used to advise people to go for test in last December (in 2020). This year, we ask for vaccination status first and then travel history. Not every cough and cold is Covid-19,” he added. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said that winter brings rise in Covid-19 cases in Europe but the picture is not the same in India. “Our cold is moderate as compared to Europe so its not that the cold weather will increase infection. We must continue to follow the Covid appropriate behavior,” he said. Rheumatologist Dr Smruti Ramteke said that many patients with arthritis find themselves in a tough situation due to cold. “Following your regular medication and exercise schedule helps you keeping fit even during cold. Regular exercise and physiotherapy is a must during winters,” she said. Vaidya Swanand Joshi said that cold elevates pain as well as respiratory problems. “Abhyanga (medicated oil massage) is best for conditions like joint pain, joint stiffness as well as to strengthen muscles in healthy,” he said. Procedures like Nasya (putting 2-3 drops of ghee or oils in nostrils) is beneficial for people with a dry nose, chronic cough, or even headache due to exposure to cold wind. “One should avoid taking steam as it may add dryness to the respiratory tract,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cold-weather-a-chance-to-boost-immunity-doctors/articleshow/88420013.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Loan waiver of Rs 2L fails to stops farmer suicides||AURANGABAD: Despite two consecutive state governments waiving the farm loans, farmer suicides continue. Activists have pointed out that after the first loan waiver in 2017, there was excess rainfall for two consecutive years. This was followed by the Covid outbreak. As a result, several lakh tonne of crops, fruits and vegetables ended up rotting in the farms for four consecutive years. The activists alleged that micro-finance companies (MFCs) are also playing a role in fuelling farmer suicides in the state. In the first 11 months of 2021, the eight districts of Marathwada alone reported 805 farmer suicides. Of them, 605 cases were concluded to be eligible for ex gratia, while 84 cases were concluded as ineligible. As many as 115 cases are pending inquiry to confirm if the suicides can be considered farmer suicides. In comparison, in 2020, 773 farmer suicides were reported. Of them, 617 were considered eligible cases, 110 ineligible, and the rest pending inquiry. In 2019, 937 farmer suicides were reported in Marathwada region — 761 eligible and 176 ineligible. On February 25, 2020, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government announced a waiver of farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. This was for loans availed between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2020. The implementation of the waiver was carried out under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Crop Loan Waiver Scheme in the state. It eventually benefitted 19 lakh farmers. In 2017, as the CM, Devendra Fadnavis announced a farm loan waiver scheme. Under this scheme, the state exchequer spent Rs 24,000 crore on farm loan waiver and state claimed that it had covered 85% farmers in the state. Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna’s Raju Shetti told TOI, “Loan waiver is not a solution to the problem, it is just a superficial remedy. Farmers end up in debts and get returns lower than what they have invested.” He said that making the minimum support price (MSP) statutory should address the issue. Farmer activist Jayajirao Suryawanshi said, “The only way to stop farmer suicides in Maharashtra is to implement the Telangana pattern, wherein the state gives Rs 10,000 per acre for purchase of seeds and fertilizers.” He said excessive rainfall followed by outbreak of the pandemichave ruined crops for four consecutive years due to which the loan waivers given by the state are proving to be ineffective. Echoing him, Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Shetkari Mandal’s Deepak Joshi said, “The consecutive governments have waived off thousands of crores of farm and crop loans, but never took steps to encourage repayment of the loans. The system is flawed.” He expressed his unhappiness citing that these waivers never benefitted the farmers who have been religiously repaying their farm and crop loans punctually. Some activists also pointed out that there are large number of farmers in the state, who have consecutively benefitted from both the loan waiver schemes in the past four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/loan-waiver-of-rs-2l-fails-to-stops-farmer-suicides/articleshow/88418648.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Rain or shine, get weather advisory for your location||NEW DELHI: Lodhi Road recorded the lowest minimum temperature at 3.7 degrees Celsius and a cold wave on Tuesday, while the sports complex station in east Delhi reported the highest minimum temperature at 9 degrees Celsius. With the capital recording many one-day extreme weathers in the past one and a half years in some parts of Delhi, India Meteorological Department (IMD) is developing an urban meteorological service for Delhi-NCR to forecast the impact of weather at certain places. For instance, if there is moderate-to-heavy rain, the Met department will provide a list of “inundation hotspots”. “In the monsoon season this year, it was seen that Lodhi Road recorded ‘heavy’ rainy day, while Safdarjung station, which is a few kilometres away, saw light-to-moderate rain. We are developing our system to give forecast on weather impact in certain pockets of the city,” said a Met official. IMD is compiling data from different agencies on the city’s topography, roads and housing structures to give impact-based weather forecast. R K Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, told TOI, “We are compiling high-resolution exposure data from different agencies. We are collecting data from the traffic department on areas that witness major traffic snarls and from other agencies on low-lying areas. We are also collecting the housing data considering the socio-economic conditions of the communities.” He added, “Our idea is to know how many slums, multiplexes or houses are in a cluster so that if there is an extreme weather event, we may be able to give advisories in advance to the public about vulnerable spots in the city.” The Met department said it was digitalising the data on the GIS platform for providing impact-based weather forecasts. “Once we get details of Delhi’s topography, we can identify vulnerable areas for cold wave, cold day, heatwave or moderate-to-heavy rain. We will issue advisories accordingly to avoid urban pockets in case of an extreme weather event,” said Jenamani. The weather department currently issues general advisories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rain-or-shine-get-weather-advisory-for-your-location/articleshow/88420016.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Dehradun||51% Uttarakhand area in 'high', 'very high' landslide-susceptible zones: Study||DEHRADUN: A study by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) in Dehradun has found that 51% of Uttarakhand falls under 'high' and 'very high' landslide-susceptible zones. Some religious tourist destinations such as Uttarkashi, Badrinath, and Munsiayari fall in 'high' to 'very high' landslide-susceptible zones, the study, published in the Journal of Earth Systems this week, stated. Researchers studied all the 13 districts of Uttarakhand after noting that 11 districts in the hill state witnessed enhanced number of landslides in the past few years.  Northern districts such as Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Bageshwar and Rudraprayag are also more susceptible. 'High' and 'very high' landslide-susceptible zones are located in the vicinity of the Main Central Trust and the higher Himalayas, whereas zones with 'low' and 'very low' susceptibility were in Indo-Gangetic plains, the study finds. Slopes ranging between 40 degrees and 60 degrees located at an elevation between 2,000 and 4,000 metres and facing south are more susceptible to landslides. “There has been a lot of human interference on slopes in the form of development activities, such as the construction of hydropower projects, tunnels, dams, bridges, new roads, etc,” said senior scientists Vikram Gupta and Sandeep Kumar of WIHG. The researchers said many of these activities have impacted the geological conditions of the state. “All these activities require anthropogenic intervention on slopes, in the form of change of geometry,” they added. “Generally, any deviation from the natural angle may lead to destabilisation of slopes, and subsequently, the slopes may either fail instantaneously or in due course of time if not treated immediately,” the study stated. Citing examples of landslides that recurred this year during monsoon, the study said, “A few recent examples of such failure triggered by rainfall have been witnessed along the road-cut section or widening of roads section on the Rishikesh-Badrinath highway in Tota Ghati area. It is, therefore, of 'utmost importance' that any change in the geometry of slope must be evaluated carefully at the local scale, particularly in 'high' and 'very high' landslide-susceptibility zones.” The information gives an edge to the government to execute its developmental projects in sync with the findings of the study, say experts. "This would help avert frequent landslides," they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/51-ukhand-area-in-high-very-high-landslide-susceptible-zones-study/articleshow/88418654.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bookie who bought SIM cards for Sachin Waze to get bail||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court said on Tuesday that alleged bookie Naresh Gaur, who is accused of supplying SIM cards used in the planting of explosives in a vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's bungalow, had no knowledge of the conspiracy involved in planting explosives or the murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran. It said both acts cannot be attributed to him directly or indirectly and upheld his bail order. A bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal said buying SIM cards “cannot be stretched’’ to bring it within the umbrella of a terror or murder conspiracy as argued by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and dismissed its appeal to cancel a November order of bail passed by the special trial court in Mumbai. NIA counsel, additional solicitor general Anil Singh and Sandesh Patil, had argued that Gaur’s role was to arrange SIM cards for dismissed police inspector Sachin Waze and it was not possible that he was not aware that they were to be used for an “illegal purpose’’. Singh said Waze and co-accused Pradip Sharma conspired along with others to eliminate Hiran and they made use of one of the SIMs to make a WhatsApp call to Hiran on March 4, 2021 to summon him to a particular spot after which the businessman was found murdered. The judgment authored by Justice Kotwal said “prosecution case itself is that the conspiracy to commit murder of Mansukh Hiran was hatched after Sachin Waze realized that he was not willing to co-operate with him.’’ The HC said when SIM cards were procured by Gaur on February 2 and handed over to Vinayak Shinde on February 21, “the plan to commit murder” had not been hatched by Waze. Therefore, it would be “far-fetched” to attribute knowledge of this plan to Gaur when he procured the cards, the court said. The HC also noted that there was “no connection’’ between Gaur and Waze and it was only at the instance of a witness who was aware that Waze was an important police officer that he procured the SIM cards. The high court referred to Supreme Court guidelines which said for a conspiracy there has to be a ‘meeting of minds’ prior to the act and against Gaur, such prior agreement is not reflected so far. Gaur’s senior counsel Shirish Gupte and advocate Aniket Nikam argued that the chargesheet only invoked offence of sections 403 Indian Penal Code (IPC) (dishonest misappropriation of property attracting up to 2 years jail and hence bailable) and 120B IPC (criminal conspiracy) against him. “The only strong evidence against him is that he had procured those SIM cards illegally, for which he will suffer the consequences of his act,’’ said HC.  It clarified that its observations are “strictly restricted’’ to decide the NIA appeal; the trial court need not be influenced by them when conducting the trial.

He also criticised the Narendra Modi government for pushing the bill on raising the minimum marriage age for girls to 21. Balakrishnan said the government has a long list of things to do concerning the health of adolescent girls in the country. “Pregnant mothers are deprived of nutritious diet and medical facilities in the country. Instead of focusing on such issues, they are passing bills in Parliament without any discussions,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/aadhaar-poll-roll-link-wont-stop-frauds/articleshow/88420018.cms||---

However, Joshi said it remains to be seen how Omicron would behave in India, where there is widespread “exposure” to the Delta variant. “At present, Delta derivatives, descendants of Delta, are the main variants in circulation in India. Omicron is fast replacing Delta in other parts of the world, but there is no way to predict how the Delta derivatives and Omicron would behave,’’ he said. Moreover, there is hybrid immunity in India. “Sero surveys in Mumbai, Delhi showed that over 90% of the surveyed population had been exposed to Covid. Also, 88% of Indians have taken the first vaccine shot at least,’’ said Joshi. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/doc-delmicron-hurting-west-hybrid-immunity-will-help-india-in-mumbai/articleshow/88421004.cms||---

Mayor said that “it is unfortunate that the deputy CM is presenting a false figure regarding the fund given to three MCDs and misleading people”. “Delhi government is trying to paralyse MCDs with a motive to gain political mileage in upcoming MCD elections. Just displaying figures of fund release on paper does not make sense,” he alleged. He said that since 2016, Rs 1,482.19 crore of SDMC share is due in ‘plan head’ and Rs 708.63 crore in ‘non-plan head’ with the Delhi government. As per the recommendations of fifth DFC, a grant of Rs 878.1 crore was to be given to SDMC by the government in 2021-22 in plan head, but only Rs 371.36 crore has been released. In non-plan head, grant of Rs 405.28 crore was to be released, but only 246.05 crore has been released. Oberoi said that the corporations were not in a position to pay salaries because of fund shortage. On Monday, Sisodia had accused the BJP of corruption in civic bodies and said that the Delhi government has paid Rs 2,588 crore to the corporations till December.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-mayor-refutes-sisodias-allegation-over-corporation-dues/articleshow/88420023.cms||---

Had I not worn a helmet, my injuries would have been severe and could have caused me my life,” Amol Kadam of Shirgaon in Maval taluka told TOI, adding, “The planks fell on my head and then my right hand. Due to the helmet, I did not sustain any harm to my head, but it jerked back and caused lip injuries. My wife was not wearing a helmet — thankfully, she escaped unhurt.” Kadam works as an admin executive in a software company, while his wife is a ward co-ordinator at a private hospital. After the incident around 9am on Monday, Kadam observed that there were no safety measures at the site. “Had they been iron bars instead of wooden planks, it would have been fatal,” Kadam said. He said employees at the site were uncooperative. “They did not even share a contact number for senior officials. I decided to file a police complaint. Proper precautions should be taken by such contractors,” said Kadam. MahaMetro general manager (PR) Hemant Sonawane said, “An inquiry will be conducted to obtain details and check if adequate safety measures were present. Action will be initiated against the agency based on this outcome.” (Inputs by Sarang Dastane)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-injured-after-metro-site-wooden-planks-fall-on-him/articleshow/88419467.cms||Mihir Tanksale

While the commission and district collectors maintained that the exercise was carried out in a fair manner, a section of participants alleged that the public hearing meeting was hastily planned without giving adequate time to research and submit the feedback. The attendance for the meeting was also poor. As per the recent announcement from the state government, Lalgudi and Musiri town panchayats in Trichy district, Adiramapattinam town panchayat in Thanjavur district and Punjai Pugalur-TNPL Pugalur (merged), Pallapatti town panchayats in Karur district were upgraded as municipalities. Considering continuity of wards, geographical compactness and population density, the delimitation of wards was carried out as per Tamil Nadu Delimitation Act 2017 without favouring any individuals or group, the commissioner of the delimitation commission V Palanikumar said. Meanwhile, a section of residents from Thuvakudi, who participated in the meeting, claimed that change in ward number would impact their address proof. “We are using ward numbers in our documents and Aadhaar, changing the ward number as per the delimitation will put us in a big trouble since we have to change all the documents,” R Chandrasekar, a resident of Thuvakudi said. Reacting to the objection, officials said that Thuvakudi municipality’s expansion proposal will be discussed separately. Representatives of political parties and consumer groups who arrived from Adiramapattinam said that the conduct of the public hearing meeting was not informed in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/delimitation-locals-allege-public-hearing-carried-out-hastily/articleshow/88420022.cms||---

Inaugurating a siddha exhibition titled ‘Agam-2021’ on the campus of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy on Tuesday, Nehru said there have been demands to establish the second government siddha medical college in the state in Trichy. At present, the state has only two government siddha medical college at Chennai and Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli. “Efforts will be made to have the announcement on the siddha medical college in the governor’s speech in the assembly session to be held in January next year. Or, the demand will be mentioned in the demands for the grants of the family welfare department,” said Nehru. The department of India medicine and homoeopathy has organised the three-day event on account of Siddha Day to mark the birth star ‘Ayilyam’ of Siddhar Agasthiyar. The event will end on December 23. The ministry of AYUSH, government of India, has approved the observation of the birth anniversary of Agasthiyar as ‘Siddha Day’ every year. It was the fifth year celebration at the government hospital in Trichy. Nehru said that sensitisation to use siddha drugs should be cultivated among people. District siddha medical officer (DSMO) Dr S Kamaraj and his team of doctors displayed hundreds of raw drugs, herbs, fruits, traditional rice varieties used for making siddha medicines. While promoting the way of life through Indian medicines, the exhibition also explained why one should avoid junk food.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: With Omicron variant, doctors feel milder third wave likely||MUMBAI: Even as the Centers for Diseases Control announced 73% of the new coronavirus cases in the US are caused by the Omicron variant as against 3% last week, the Covid statistics at home too are slowly rising and experts believe the third wave — even if less severe than the previous one — is inevitable. The Rt value or the effective reproduction value of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has risen in a few states, including Maharashtra. An Rt value of 1 means one patient can spread the disease to one other person. In a tweet, epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu on Tuesday said states with an increase in Rt values on December 19 as compared to December 13 are Bihar, MP, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Tripura, TN, Assam, Odisha, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Manipur and Nagaland. India’s effective Rt is 0.89 as on December 19, he added. In the week ending November 2, the R value in Maharashtra was 0.7 and kept increasing — 0.82 (November 14), 0.96 (November 22) — before falling — 0.92 (November 29) and 0.85 (December 6). In the last fortnight, it has again begun rising: 1.08 (December 19). The rising weekly caseload and Rt value are, according to doctors, an indicator of how the Covid graph will turn out in the next month. Dr Shashank Joshi, a state Covid task force member, said: “The third wave seemed remote a few months ago, but the emergence of the Omicron variant that spreads five times more rapidly than Delta has raised the possibility of cluster outbreak and the third wave.’’ Dr Rahul Pandit, also on the task force, said there is no cause for panic. “The public health machinery should strengthen contact tracing.’’ Internal medicine specialist Dr Swapneil Parikh said a third wave is inevitable going by cases in other countries. “What remains to be seen is what… sort of load the 3rd wave would put on hospitals,” he said. Most doctors said immunity due to vaccine, past infection will blunt its severity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-omicron-docs-feel-milder-3rd-wave-likely/articleshow/88421017.cms||---

According to AAP legislator Saurabh Bharadwaj, a private company, which got the contract to install approximately 85,000 meters between 2012-13 under the previous regime, had arbitrarily increased water bills in these south Delhi areas. “I raised the matter in the assembly and got it investigated by a committee. Many residents welfare association members gave testimonies against wrongful water meters and billings. Finally, the contract for water metering and billing of SMPL has been terminated,” said Bharadwaj. Now residents can approach the office of the MLA along with a copy of their water bill. Any pending bill will be fixed as the metering and billing will be handled by the Delhi government. Four camps are being held between December 21 and 28 at DDA flats Kalkaji, Parchin Shiv Mandir Metro Station, and MLA Bharadwaj’s offices in East of Kailash and Shahpur Jat DDA flats to initiate the process of new metre fitting and filing of grievances.

---||Allahabad||PM interacts with women gps benefiting from govt schemes||Prayagraj: Prior to addressing the women assembled at Parade Ground of the city, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy CM, Keshav Prasad Maurya interacted with the women groups, benefiting from the schemes of the state and central government. To start with, the PM met the women working as banking correspondent (BC)- Sakhi at various villages of the state. Modi addressed them as ‘ghumti-firti’ banks (roaming banks) and inquired about their style of working, are they being respected among village folks and how they are helping villages and also in changing banking scenario in villages. The women members explained to the PM about how the world has changed for them, how they have stood on their own, earlier they were considered only to cook and look after the household but now they are helping the villagers, going out of the houses and earning for themselves and the household too. When one of the member, Nitu Maurya, told the PM that her daily transaction is around 2-2.5 lakhs, he asked, “Aapko der nahi lagta itna cash le jaate hue” (are you not afraid handling so much of cash) to which she confidently replied, ‘no sir’. The PM then met the group of women engaged in supplementary nutrition (take home ration) manufacturing units.The PM instantly struck the chord with the women present in the spacious pandal. He asked them that besides manufacturing nutritional ration, are they making people aware about the importance of staying healthy and eating healthy. He also told them to make sure that the adolescent girls are properly looked after in the village because if they stay healthy, only then they would become a healthy mother in due course of time. The PM also said, “You people (members associated with the manufacturing scheme) have done so well that we are thinking of implementing the scheme at other places too”. In his last interaction, the PM met the girls and mothers benefiting from the Mukhya Mantri Kanya Sumangala scheme. He inquired how and to what extent this scheme is helping the girls pursue their studies. To young girls, the PM asked whether they go to school or not or learning through online mode. The PM asked the students that although they can study through offline mode, they should not leave the habit of gathering more knowledge through online mode. He stressed, “Chahe kuch bhi ho jaaye, beti to padna chahiye” (what may come, daughters have to study).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pm-interacts-with-women-gps-benefiting-from-govt-schemes/articleshow/88421010.cms||---
---||Nagpur||SSC, HSC subject-wise timetable released||Nagpur: On Tuesday, the state government issued a subject-wise timetable for SSC and HSC board exams. Earlier this month, the education department had announced exam window period. The exams to be held in March and April shall be done in offline mode only. Both HSC and SSC will kick off the exam season with ‘first language’ paper on March 4 and 15 respectively. While CBSE has not yet released the exam timetable, which it officially refers to as datesheet, it is expected that the dates will be more or less in the same period. Last year, both state board and CBSE cancelled their written board exams as the second wave started peaking in summer months. Students were allotted marks based on internal marks and other parameters, which were different for both boards. There were multiple issues reported with this format because many schools had done assessments only in online mode. To counter such issues, CBSE moved smartly this session by dividing its board exams into two parts. The first one was held recently in November-December while the second phase (known as Term-2) dates are yet to be announced. So, even if for some reason CBSE’s Term-2 exam is cancelled, it has Term-1 offline board exam marks to use as a benchmark. State board, which caters to a very diverse population based in urban and also the remotest part of the state, has however not been able to do any such thing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ssc-hsc-subject-wise-timetable-released/articleshow/88420051.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Cold wave in Delhi may loosen grip over next 10 days||NEW DELHI: A cold wave gripped parts of Delhi for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), cold wave was recorded at Safdarjung, which is the city’s base station, Lodhi Road and Ayanagar. However, locals are expected to get relief from cold wave conditions as the minimum temperature is likely to rise for the next 10 days under the influence of three western disturbances. The lowest minimum temperature was recorded at Lodhi Road at 3.7 degrees Celsius followed by Ayanagar at 3.8 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature at Safdarjung was reported at 4 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal. RK Jenamani, senior scientist at IMD, said, “The cold and dry north-westerly winds led to a drop in minimum temperature.” IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is four or more notches below normal or when the minimum temperature is less than 4 degrees Celsius. However, the maximum temperature remained at a higher side on Tuesday as it rose to 22.4 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal, at Safdarjung. “As the speed of north-westerly winds slowed down during day time, the maximum temperature remained above normal,” said an IMD official. The minimum temperature may rise to five degrees Celsius on Wednesday. However, the night temperature is likely to hover from 7-10 degrees Celsius between December 23 and 27 under the impact of three western disturbances. “Two feeble western disturbances are likely to impact the region on December 22 and 24. They are likely to cause cloudiness and a change in wind direction to easterly,” said Jenamani. North-westerly winds are cold and dry, while easterly winds are warm in the winter season, said another official. However, the third western disturbance, which is likely to affect the region on December 26, would be active. There is a possibility of very light rain or drizzle on December 27, IMD said. “Due to back-to-back western disturbances, the minimum temperature may not come down for the next 10 days. However, the maximum temperature may decrease on December 27,” said Jenamani. Delhi saw the first cold wave in December this year on Sunday in parts of the capital, including Lodhi Road and Jafarpur. Safdarjung and a few more stations were under the grip of a cold wave on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cold-wave-may-loosen-grip-over-next-10-days/articleshow/88420033.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

They also arrested Ashwin Kumar (49), a former manager with the GA Software Company, from Bengaluru on the charge of connivance with six others to alter the marks of some candidates during the Teachers' Eligibility Test (TET) on July 15, 2018. The results were declared online on October 12, 2018. “A separate FIR for cheating and forgery offences in relation to the 2018 malpractice has been registered with the cyber police,” Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta said on Tuesday. The fresh FIR also names the now suspended MSCE commissioner Tukaram Supe, GA Software’s director Pritish Deshmukh and four others, a police officer said. Dattatray Jagtap, MSCE chairman, who is also the complainant in the fresh FIR, told TOI on Tuesday, “The candidates, who appeared for any of the MSCE-conducted examinations, which are under investigation by the police for alleged malpractice, need not worry if they have not been involved in the wrongdoing themselves. The investigation will give us information on the candidates who were involved in wrongdoings. Action will be taken only against those candidates,” he said. Gupta said, “GA Software company had bagged the contract to conduct the TET-2018. He and the company officials then manipulated marks of the failed/ineligible candidates directly on the online system after taking money from the beneficiaries and then the results were displayed. Preliminary information revealed that they collected a total Rs5 crore from 500 candidates to declare them eligible.”  Joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve said, “The candidates of TET 2018, left the OMR answer sheets blank and the suspects changed their marks by manipulating the mark sheets on the system before displaying the results. The candidates paid between Rs50,000 and Rs60,000 each to the arrested persons.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/former-top-exam-official-held-for-tet-2018-misdeed/articleshow/88419488.cms||Gitesh Shelke

The ACB on September 2, 2015, had registered a case of cheating and forgery, besides offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act against nine people, including Supe. The other eight officials named in the FIR were from the Pune ZP and a government-aided school at Pimpalwandi in Junnar taluka. Patil said, “These officials came together and recruited teachers at the school disregarding the government norms, provided monetary benefits to the teachers and other school officials. It was done by misusing the powers vested in Supe and the other officials involved. In this way, the people named in the FIR cheated the state government between 2004 and 2015.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/acb-ends-probe-against-supe-in-abuse-of-power-case/articleshow/88419500.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Goa||Goa: Soon, pay for KTC bus ticket in digital mode||PANAJI: The Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC) became the first state transport service in the country to implement the national common mobility card (NCMC) for its buses for seamless transactions. The Paytm transit card will be accepted on every KTC bus and the swipe devices are being installed at all the bus stands across the state. The card will be open for sale in Goa from the first week of January. The card covers a network of over 600 buses in Goa and it can also be used for payments at offline merchant stores, tolls and parking charges and online shopping. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said this is another step towards providing citizens “a sense of comfort and ease while making everyday payments”. Paytm Payments Bank has developed a completely digital process to apply for a new card or to recharge and track all transactions of the existing card. On successful application, the physical card will be delivered at the doorstep of the user or can be purchased at designated sales points. The prepaid card is directly linked to the Paytm Wallet, where users can just top-up the wallet to use the transit card and do not need to create any separate account. Stating that the venture is the dawn of digitisation, transport minister Mauvin Godinho said, “It will not only accelerate payment collection in the buses, but also decongest the crowd at ticketing counters. The latter is imperative to ensure conformity to social distancing protocols to navigate errands in a post-Covid world.” “Every KTC bus conductor will get Re 1 cashback for every transaction accepted on the card and every card sale will get them incentive of Rs 50,” said Sajal Bhatnagar, chief business officer of Paytm Payments Bank Ltd.

Justice Nazmi Waziri highlighted in a recent order the “non-availability of requisite and enabling infrastructure for persons with disability is glaring and apparent throughout the city” and noted that it is a violation of Fundamental Right since “freedom of movement has to be honored and assured in every way possible, it cannot be restrained by lack of civic amenities.” The HC’s direction came while hearing a plea filed by a disabled woman who underlined problems faced by her in using the wheelchair optimally as she is unable to access public transportation or wheel herself out of her residence on to a footpath. The bench took note of her plight and how she is unable to use footpaths, narrow streets, and transportation facilities. “All agencies shall endeavour to respect the dignity and individual autonomy of persons with disabilities. It needs to be borne in mind that this exercise is necessary and needs to be carried out in terms of objectives and context of enactment of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016,” the court noted, directing all such agencies in Delhi, which provide facilities to the public, to enable a comprehensive audit. “North Delhi Municipal Corporation, Public Works Department, DISCOM, Delhi Police, Delhi Traffic Police, Delhi Transport Corporation, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, New Delhi Municipal Council as well as such other agencies shall appoint a senior officer not below the rank of the executive engineer to assist and coordinate with the nodal officer appointed by Delhi government for provision of due facilities to persons with disabilities.” The court clarified that this exercise shall be completed within six weeks and said that “it is hoped that in three months, streets not less than two kilometers each in the south, east, north, west and central regions will be identified, and made ready, in terms of the social disability audit.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conduct-audit-of-facilities-for-the-disabled-says-hc/articleshow/88420060.cms||Abhinav Garg

A portion of the intersection connecting the RoB on Karur Bypass Road is to be strengthened and widened to avoid bottlenecks during peak hours. Trichy Corporation officials said that around 3 metres of space will be freed up on either side of the road merging with the Old Karur Road near Kalaignar Arivalayam. Temporary encroachments and other hindrances to the traffic at the intersection will be removed for widening the junction. “Over the past few months, Karur Bypass Road has witnessed a drastic surge in the volume of vehicles, as commercial establishments started attracting public movement. As a part of the road safety improvements suggested, we will widen the road near the Anbilar statue,” a corporation official said. The Srirangam zone of the civic body has planned to enable a separate lane on either end of the road for the vehicles using the Old Karur Road, connecting Chathiram bus stand end and Kudamurutti bridge end to approach the Karur Bypass Road RoB at ease. Now, vehicles waiting at the traffic signal at the intersection are causing bottlenecks resulting in vehicles piling up till the RoB and Kalaignar Arivalayam. The civic body will construct retaining walls for a length of 50m on both the sides of the road to widen it and eliminate blind spots. “As a part of the improvements, speed breakers can also be considered at the junction to prevent speeding of trucks,” V Anand, a resident of Melachinthamani, said. Corporation will launch the work, which will take 2-3 months to complete.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-to-improve-infra-at-karur-bypass-road-junction/articleshow/88420046.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Trichy||Unused lane opened after almost five years in Trichy||TRICHY: The abandoned lane on Anna Nagar link road merging with the MGR statue roundabout near the district court was opened for vehicular movement after almost five years in Trichy city on Tuesday. The mofussil buses approaching from Karur and Coimbatore destinations will now be directed to approach the lane and reach the Central bus stand via Aiyappan temple and Major Saravanan roundabout. So far, the mofussil buses heading to the Central bus stand were commuting via district court, Cantonment police station and Reynolds road. The route was causing severe traffic congestion on Reynolds road. Similarly, the traffic signal near the Cantonment police station was also facing traffic bottlenecks as mofussil buses were accessing the stretch. As a solution, Trichy city police as per the instruction from the city police commissioner G Karthikeyan has opened the unused lane on Anna Nagar link road that remained barricaded for several years. As traffic signal infrastructure is already available in the MGR statue roundabout connecting Puthur, Cantonment, Anna Nagar and Bhima Nagar, traffic police sources said that the traffic signal might soon be reactivated. “Traffic signal with timers can streamline the vehicular movement in the roundabout, timer for green light can be adjusted as per the intensity of movement in each lane,” a traffic police official said. A section of residents welcoming the move has sought a reduction in the size of the MGR statue roundabout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/unused-lane-opened-after-almost-five-years-in-trichy/articleshow/88420055.cms||---

Interestingly, BJP and it’s associates have joined the Congress-NCP panel led by ministers Hasan Mushrif and Satej Patil. Shiv Sena leader Arun Dudhwadkar announced the panel comprising candidates of Sena, Peasants and Workers Party, Republic Party of India and other smaller outfits. So far, three candidates — all from the Congress and NCP led panel — have been elected unopposed. Congress and NCP leaders were ready to share two seats with Sena, which wanted five seats. Two days of discussion among all the leaders did not yield any result. It has been learnt that Sena’s local leaders got the go-ahead from party president and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to form a separate panel and break away from the Congress and NCP team. Shiv Sena, however, received a jolt after two of its leaders — Nivedita Mane, the mother of sitting Sena MP Dhairyasheel Mane, and minister of state Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar — joined the Congress and NCP panel. Dudhwadkar, speaking after declaring the panel, said, “We will let our party chief know of the activities of some leaders. Them joining hands with the incumbent will not hurt our prospects of winning the election.” Meanwhile, in a statement issued by BJP, district president Samarjitsinha Ghatage and leader Dhananjay Mahadik stated that since BJP and it’s associates have got five seats, the BJP has decided to join the panel led by Congress and NCP. The attempts of Congress and NCP to elect a panel unopposed has been futile and now the election will take place for 18 seats between the Congress-NCP led panel and the Sena-led panel. The voting will be on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kdcc-poll-sena-forms-own-team-against-congress-ncp/articleshow/88418707.cms||---
