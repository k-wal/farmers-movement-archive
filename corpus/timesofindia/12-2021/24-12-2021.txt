A chargesheet was filed in the NIA special court in Jammu naming Nadeem-ul-Haq, Talib-Ur-Rehman (both from district Ramban) and Nadeem Ayoub of Shopian. The case pertains to recovery of 5.5 kgs of IED at Bhatindi in Jammu on June 27 earlier this year. During questioning the accused confessed their involvement and also that they acted on the directions of their handlers in Pakistan. Owing to the sensitivity of the matter, the case was handed over to the NIA in July. A spokesperson of NIA said, “During investigation it was found that the three accused persons were receiving instructions from Pakistan-based handlers via WhatsApp. Investigation has unearthed a larger conspiracy of recruitment and plans to activate a significant number of radicalised youths in Kashmir to target security personnel and public places to wage war against the government of India.” Further investigation in the case is going on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jammu-ied-case-nia-files-chargesheet-against-three-accused/articleshow/88461505.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

"You cannot shut the mouth of a patient in pain and declare him stable. Measures of coercion can buy you some time but will not bring peace,” she said while addressing villagers in RS Pura, which has been affected due to the government plans to develop Gharana Wetland. "Peace," she said, “cannot be enforced but established by understanding the core problem and addressing the grievances of the people." Mehbooba alleged that like the villagers around Gharana Wetland, farmers across Jammu & Kashmir were being forced out of their properties. Endorsing the demands of the protesting villagers, Mehbooba asked for allotment of alternative land, apart from jobs, to the affected families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/peace-cant-be-enforced-but-established-pdp-chief/articleshow/88461611.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||PM Imran’s govt left with no option but to yield to IMF programme||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s worsened economic situation has dried up all options for the country to address its monetary woes except to yield to the existing International Monetary Fund programme to avoid a full-fledged financial disaster. According to senior government officials, top authorities in the finance ministry have decided to consult with Prime Minister Imran Khan to devise a new strategy to introduce legislation mandated by the IMF to resume a suspended $6 billion extended fund facility (EFF). The IMF has linked resumption of loans to parliamentary approval for the passage of two key bills — the Tax Laws (Fourth) Amendment Bill and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Autonomy Bill. The Tax Laws (Fourth) Amendment Bill envisions the withdrawal of GST exemptions on hundreds of commodities in a bid to boost tax revenue by an estimated Rs 350 billion (Pakistani rupees). The government fears that imposing these new taxes at this stage — when inflation in November was reported at 11.53% — might provoke a strong public backlash. The SBP Autonomy Bill, meanwhile, would grant the central bank independence in all matters of monetary policy, the exchange rate, and recruitments. The government believes that due to strong political opposition it won’t be possible for the ruling party and its allies to pass the bills in parliament. Knowing its limitations, the government has been attempting to convince the IMF that it will introduce a mini-budget and change the laws through a presidential ordinance — a common practice in the incumbent government. In addition to the withdrawal of tax exemptions and autonomy for the central bank, the IMF has also been pushing the government to reduce the public sector development programme by Rs 200 billion, bringing it down to Rs 700 billion. Meanwhile, the Saudi government has deposited a $3-billion loan with Pakistan to boost its foreign exchange reserves but it is also reliant on Islamabad remaining under the IMF programme. The terms of agreement, which are no longer confidential, allow Riyadh to withdraw the sum within 72 hours if Islamabad abandons the IMF programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pm-imrans-govt-left-with-no-option-but-to-yield-to-imf-programme/articleshow/88461713.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Well placed sources in Delhi said Kabul MP Khalsa and Manjeet Singh of Jalalabad flew back to Afghanistan four days ago against the wishes of Afghan Minorities Group (AMG), a joint coordination committee comprising of Afghan-origin Hindus and Sikhs living in India and Afghanistan. As per reports of an Afghanistan-based channel, during the meeting, the Hindu and Sikh community representatives told him that they wanted to stay in Afghanistan and play a constructive role in the development of the country. "Maulvi Abdul Kabir told them that the Taliban government has provided security to all and that their policy for everyone, including minorities, is to live in prosperity and peace. All ethnic groups and citizens of the country have the right to live and to contribute to the development of the country," reported Aamaj News. The Afghan minorities also demanded return of their usurped land and property, added the report. Apart from Khalsa, Gurnam Singh, president of Gurdwara Sahib Dashmesh Pita at Karte Parwan near Kabul and Ram Sharan Bhasin, a Kabul-based leader of Hindus were present in the meeting among others. Efforts were made to contact MP Khalsa and Singh but they could not be contacted. MP Khalsa had flown to India after the Taliban had taken over the control of the government in Afghanistan and on his arrival here, he had broken down while speaking to the Indian press. "We have never seen this kind of situation in Afghanistan and now that we are seeing it, everything is over. Even the government that was built in the last 20 years is finished. Everything is zero now," he had said after being evacuated from Kabul in an Indian Air Force aircraft on August 22, 2021. India had then evacuated 168 people, of whom 107 were Indian nationals and the remaining were Afghan Hindus and Sikhs. Another batch of nearly 100 persons was flown to India in the second week of December. The Afghan minorities had brought along some saroops (scriptures) of Guru Granth Sahib and some holy books of the Hindu faith.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghan-sikhs-hindus-who-were-on-exile-in-india-meet-taliban-dy-pm/articleshow/88461616.cms||JK Singh
---||World||Iraq calls for direct talks between Iran and US||TEHRAN: Iraq's foreign minister said on a visit to Tehran Thursday that the time has come for the Islamic republic and the United States to negotiate directly on Iran's nuclear ambitions.  US-Iran relations have been severed since April 1980, just months after the fall of the shah and the occupation of the American embassy by Islamist students loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  They worsened significantly after former US President Donald Trump's 2018 decision to unilaterally withdraw from the nuclear deal and impose sanctions on Tehran.  Negotiations resumed in November after a five-month hiatus to try to restore the deal, which gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities.  Diplomats from the remaining parties to the deal -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- are in talks in Vienna with Iran and the US, with the two sides refusing direct contact.  "We call for, and this is no secret, direct negotiations between the two parties," Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told a joint press conference.  "Iraq's interest is in helping the two parties to sit round a table and talk," he said.  "We have proposed this to the Americans and have made this proposal (to Iran) and even before our visit to Tehran.  "It is better that a direct meeting takes place between the American party and the Iranian party," Hussein said.  He said Iraq felt there was a "problem" with the negotiating mechanism at the Vienna talks.  "The negotiations with the American side are indirect, through the European envoy," he said.  "We think the time has come for direct talks between Washington and Tehran to reach common understandings not just on the nuclear issue, but also on sanctions.  "We need direct contact between the two parties and we are working towards that," Hussein said.  Iraq is Iran's neighbour, and Hussein said US-Iran relations "are not an external matter for Iraq, but an internal one".  He said tensions between the long-time foes impacts directly on the political and security situation in Iraq, and that detente between the two would have a positive effect.  Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian outlined the way contacts currently take place.  "The Americans send unwritten messages to meetings and receive responses" indirectly from Iran, he said.  "As for the Islamic republic, we seriously declare that we want to reach a good agreement and we hope the other parties also come and negotiate with the same seriousness and the same goodwill," Amir-Abdollahian said.  The Vienna talks are set to resume on Monday after a 10-day break.  On Thursday, EU diplomat Enrique Mora, who is chairing the negotiations, said he hoped for speedy progress.  "Important to pick up the pace on key outstanding issues and move forward, working closely with the US. Welcome to the 8th round," Mora said in Vienna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/iraq-calls-for-direct-talks-between-iran-and-us/articleshow/88461824.cms||---

The Republican former president recently said in an interview that he received a booster shot, and called the vaccines "one of the greatest achievements of mankind".  "The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take the vaccine," Trump said in an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens. "If you take the vaccine, you're protected."  "We're grateful that the former president got the booster, and we're also grateful that he made clear in a recent interview that they work and they're safe," Psaki told reporters in a briefing on Thursday.  Just 62% of Americans are fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates among rich nations, thanks in part to a Republican-led pushback against Democratic President Joe Biden's year-long vaccination campaign.  Trump revealed on Sunday during an interview with former Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly that he received a booster shot, triggering jeers and hectoring from the live audience.  Public support of boosters represents a change in tone for Trump who said in September that he likely would not get one.  More than 800,000 Americans have died from Covid-19, the most in any nation. The vast majority of deaths this year have been among the unvaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-says-it-is-grateful-trump-got-promoted-covid-19-booster-shot/articleshow/88462081.cms||---

Hoping that Punjab Police and other security agencies will closely coordinate with each other in investigating the blast, the former CM regretted the “diversionary tactics” by the Punjab government, particularly Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.  “It is not only unfortunate but highly irresponsible on part of the CM to jump to conclusions by trying to construct a link between the blasts, the sacrilege incidents and the FIR against an Akali leader without any investigation,” Captain said, observing that Channi must speak out with facts and not with political rhetoric, lest it bails out the real culprits and perpetrators.  Pointing out that he had been continuously flagging the regular smuggling of arms and ammunitions, the former CM said it was sad that the government was continuously in a denial mode. “There is a serious threat to the peace and security of Punjab and such incidents are an indication towards that, which must be taken seriously and not brushed aside the way the government is trying to,” he remarked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/serious-threat-to-punjabs-peace-security-that-govt-is-brushing-aside-amarinder-after-ludhiana-blast/articleshow/88462265.cms||Vibhor Mohan

---||India||1 killed, 6 injured in Ludhiana court blast; bogey of terror, says Channi||LUDHIANA: A powerful explosion inside a public toilet in the main building of the district court complex in Punjab's Ludhiana on Thursday killed an unidentified man and injured six others, including a lawyer. The possibility of the deceased being the perpetrator of the blast couldn't be ruled out yet, police said. CM Charanjit Singh Channi termed the 12.30pm blast "a bogey of terror" ahead of the assembly polls and instituted a high-level inquiry. State Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu linked it to "an attempt to scare a particular community for polarisation of votes". The explosion, which occurred on the second floor of building no. 1, damaged the walls and the roof of the toilet, and shattered windows across the structure. Several parked cars were damaged by falling debris. "There were two women near a photocopier, and both were flung in the air when the blast occurred. My friend Kuldeep Singh Mand, who was there, fell down and was covered in debris. We pulled him out and ran as we feared the explosion could be the first of a series of blasts," advocate Harjot Singh Harikay said. But for a lawyers' strike on Thursday that kept many people away, the toll and injury list might have been higher. District bar association president Gurkirpal Singh Gill said the advocates were on strike to protest the transfer of Ludhiana’s 800 consumer forum cases to Nawanshahr and Kapurthala districts. JMIC Shweta Dass, whose court is close to the site of the blast, was on leave for the first half of the day, which ensured there were fewer people around than on a normal weekday. Ludhiana police commissioner Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said investigators had found "vital clues" and hoped to crack the case soon. Bomb disposal squads combed through the court complex after the blast while police teams scanned CCTV footage to try and tie up the loose ends. Police were tightlipped about how the explosives were detonated. Sources said high-intensity explosives might have been used. A National Security Guard team reached Ludhiana by evening to examine the blast site for forensic evidence along with experts from the state police, Bhullar said. "The Punjab government will soon give a befitting reply to such anti-social forces out to traumatise people ahead of assembly elections," CM Channi said after visiting the injured, three of them women. Sidhu, who was in the city, also met the injured in hospital. "There isn't a shadow of a doubt that a series of peace-disrupting activities has been planned by those with vested interests to create a law and order problem in Punjab," he said later. The Union home ministry sought a report from the Punjab government on the blast. Home minister Amit Shah spoke to the CM for an update. The Union home secretary, too, briefed him after getting some details. Deputy CM Sukhjinder Randhawa, who holds the state home portfolio, visited the blast site along with officiating DGP Siddharth Chattopadhyaya and other officers. He said Punjab will investigate if the recent incidents of sacrilege had any connection with the Ludhiana explosion. The FIR, filed by ASI Sukhpal Singh, states that "anti-national elements triggered the explosion to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in Punjab". The blast came days before the expected announcement of assembly polls in the state in early 2022. Sources said the circumstances were similar to the 2017 Maur blast that rocked the state just days before voting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1-killed-6-injured-in-ludhiana-court-blast-bogey-of-terror-says-channi/articleshow/88462426.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||World||Biden Omicron measures too little, too late for fast-moving virus: Experts||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden's steps to backstop hospitals and distribute coronavirus test kits, however welcome, are too little too late to stem a surge of Omicron-related coronavirus cases over Christmas and New Year's, health experts have said.  A day after Biden outlined plans to distribute 500 million at-home coronavirus test kits, Anne Rimoin, a UCLA professor of epidemiology, praised his focus on testing, a "critical tool" that the United States was "woefully" behind on.  "Unfortunately, it's late in coming and will be a small drop in the bucket compared to the tsunami of cases on the horizon."  The tests promised by the White House starting in January equate to just one or two per US resident. Households need far more to make daily decisions about exposure, Rimoin said.  "We need those tests now," she said. The US testing is behind the curve because of a lack of skilled workers, a shortage of at-home tests and under-investment in recent months, according to interviews with more than a dozen officials, health providers and testmakers.  Biden, a Democrat who took office in January, campaigned on a promise to take control of the pandemic, which his predecessor, former Republican president Donald Trump, played down as hundreds of thousands died.  He has focused largely on persuading Americans to get vaccinated, amid pushback from many Republican leaders who reject vaccine and masking rules and an anti-vaccination movement fueled by conspiracy theories on social media. The United States recently passed 800,000 deaths the most in the world, and its vaccination rate lags most rich nations. Biden's latest measures, including new pop-up vaccination clinics run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and federal testing sites in the hot spot of New York City and elsewhere, were welcomed by health experts and local politicians.  Biden said some 1,000 military doctors, nurses and medics had been deployed to support hospitals. He stressed the unvaccinated carried the bulk of the burden of health risks. Asked about the tests shortage in an interview broadcast on ABC late on Wednesday, the president said, "No, nothing's been good enough," adding, "I wish I had thought about ordering" 500 million at-home tests "two months ago".  Nevertheless, White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the administration's track record on testing this week, noting that it had quadrupled the size of its testing programme in the last four months. She added that Biden's use of the Defense Production Act and $3 billion in prior investments in at-home test kits helped ramp up production capacity to where it could even handle a 500 million kit order.  State and local leaders in New York, where Omicron is surging, said they supported Biden's approach. But other academics criticized Biden for reassuring Americans that schools and businesses could remain open and that the vaccinated could safely gather without emphasizing the risks they face if they fail to get a booster shot.  Breakthrough Omicron infections are rising among the 61% of the country's fully vaccinated population; only 30% have gotten booster shots said to provide more protection.  "He kept reiterating, 'vaccines work, vaccines work,' like a mantra, a talisman," tweeted Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University professor of epidemiology, adding Biden should have made clear a booster shot was key to protecting against the Omicron variant.  He said Biden should have made masks a more integral part of the response.  "And on masks? Bupkis. Get people N95s and other better masks," he wrote. "This sounded like an administration caught flat-footed, running to play catch-up."  Psaki on Friday, however, stressed that the administration has an ample supply of masks and works with community health centers and other medical organizations to ensure Americans have access. "We have not seen a shortage," she said.  "There's a tidal wave of infection coming, and I would have liked to see the president emphasize that all of us - whether vaccinated or boosted or unvaccinated - can do more to minimize transmission risks," said Joshua Salomon, a Stanford University professor of health policy.  The World Health Organization urged people to cancel holiday gatherings, saying they would result in "overwhelmed health systems and more deaths". Instead the White House said on Tuesday it was following CDC guidance, which includes recommending masks in indoor public settings and self-testing before gatherings with another household.  "They're going to the path of least resistance now. They know people are tired, people are fed up. They know that any talk of any harsher measures... will get met by vociferous pushback from the Republicans," Gonsalves said.  While that decision may have averted further political backlash, some saw it as a lost opportunity, including Harvard Professor Bill Hanage, who said he understood why lockdowns were unpalatable but described curbing activities as a useful tool.  "It takes time to send rapid tests out," he said. "People can choose right now to not go to the holiday party because they want to see Grandma on Christmas Day," Hanage said.  Some US cities, states and businesses have wasted no time in imposing fresh mask and vaccine mandates or cancelling events, often going far beyond White House recommendations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-omicron-measures-too-little-too-late-for-fast-moving-virus-experts/articleshow/88462500.cms||---
---||World||Ex-Minnesota cop found guilty of manslaughter in shooting of Black motorist||A Minnesota jury on Thursday found former police officer Kimberly Potter guilty of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Black motorist Daunte Wright during a traffic stop when she mistakenly discharged her handgun instead of her Taser.  A 12-member jury found Potter, 49, guilty of first degree and second degree manslaughter in the death of the 20-year-old Wright who she killed in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center on April 11 with a bullet to the chest.  Potter, who broke down last week on the stand as she testified to her remorse for the shooting, showed little emotion as the Judge Regina Chu read the verdict.  "We will be taking Ms Potter into custody and holding without bail," Chu said.  The shooting sparked multiple nights of intense demonstrations in Brooklyn Center. It happened just a few miles north of where Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was at the same time standing trial for killing George Floyd, a Black man whose 2020 death during an arrest had set off protests in the US cities over racism and police brutality.  Chauvin was convicted of murder. Both he and Potter are white.  Caught on Potter's body-worn camera, the basic facts of the incident were for the most part not in dispute. Both prosecutors and the defence attorneys agreed that Potter mistakenly drew the wrong weapon and never meant to kill Wright.  At issue was whether the jury would find her actions to be reckless in violation of the state's manslaughter statutes, or chalk up the incident to a tragic mistake that did not warrant criminal liability.  Throughout the trial, prosecutors stressed Potter's 26 years as a police officer, a level of experience they said made her mistake indefensible. They said she disregarded her training, which included Taser-specific courses in the months before the shooting, and took a conscious and unreasonable risk in using any weapon against the unarmed Wright.  Potter's attorneys sought to blame Wright for resisting arrest, which they argued had created a dangerous situation and justified her use of force. While acknowledging her mistake, they said her actions were not criminal because she thought she was using her Taser and was unaware she had drawn her handgun.  The defence also leaned heavily on Dr Laurence Miller, a psychologist who testified about "action error", or when a person takes one action while intending to do another. Miller said such mistakes were common and can be triggered by stress.  To secure a conviction on the first degree manslaughter charge, prosecutors were required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Potter caused Wright's death while committing the misdemeanor offence of recklessly using a firearm, according to Minnesota law.  For second degree manslaughter, the jury was required to find Potter was guilty of "culpable negligence", meaning she created an "unreasonable risk and consciously" took a chance of causing Wright death or serious bodily harm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ex-minnesota-cop-found-guilty-of-manslaughter-in-shooting-of-black-motorist/articleshow/88462507.cms||---

The top Indian diplomat, however, met the leadership of the opposition National League for Democracy, the MEA spokesperson said in a statement on Thursday. Sources said the Myanmar military leadership assured India that anti-India insurgent groups would not be supported by them. This came in the context of discussions on insurgent attacks like last month’s ambush in Manipur Churachandpur district in which seven people — CO of 46 Assam Rifles Col Viplav Tripathi, his wife, their six-year-old son and four soldiers — were killed. “The foreign secretary stressed the need to put an end to any violence and maintain peace and stability in the border areas. Both sides reiterated their commitment to ensure that their respective territories would not be allowed to be used for any activities inimical to the other,” the statement said. The MEA spokesperson said Shringla “emphasised India’s interest in seeing Myanmar’s return to democracy at the earliest; release of detainees and prisoners; resolution of issues through dialogue; and complete cessation of all violence”. Shringla pushed for a return to democracy in Myanmar. “India has been involved in the democratic transition process in Myanmar and, in this context, has worked with various stakeholders in developing capacities on democratic systems and practices. India proposes to renew these efforts for Myanmar to emerge as a stable, democratic, federal union in accordance with the wishes of the people of Myanmar.” The foreign secretary reaffirmed India’s support to the Asean initiative on Myanmar. Sources said China has been working with its friendly countries in the regional grouping to take a more accommodative stance on Myanmar. Shringla also conveyed India’s continued humanitarian and medical support and handed over Covid vaccines and announced a grant of rice and wheat. India has important connectivity projects in Myanmar which were emphasised, the MEA spokesperson said, citing commitment to expeditious implementation of initiatives such as Kaladan multimodal transit transport project and the trilateral highway. “The foreign secretary also reiterated India’s commitment to continue with projects under Rakhine State Development Programme and Border Area Development Programme,” he said. “India shares a 1,700-km-long border with Myanmar. Any development in that country has a direct impact on bordering regions. Peace and stability in Myanmar remain of utmost importance to India, specifically to its north-eastern region,” the MEA statement said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/foreign-secretary-request-to-meet-suu-kyi-turned-down/articleshow/88462516.cms||Indrani Bagchi

The Reserve Bank of India on Thursday said that it was extending by six months its deadline for non-bank payment aggregators and merchants to purge card data they have already stored. The central bank also allowed the payment industry to devise new methods to handle recurring payments and equated monthly instalment (EMI) payments without storing cards. On March 31st 2021, the RBI had asked all non-bank payment system participants and merchants to purge card data from their systems by December 31, 2021. Online billers, including e-commerce companies, ticketing services and other providers, have been storing credit card data in their customers’ accounts so that customers do not have to key in card data every time they make payments. The RBI does not want entities it does not regulate to store card information as some merchants store millions of card information and a breach could result in card information being exposed. According to central banking sources, the number of malware attacks on business establishments is on the rise. To ensure that card data is not put at risk and at the same time ensure that the customer is not inconvenienced, the RBI has come out with tokenisation guidelines. Here the customer authorises the bank or payment network (Visa, Mastercard, Rupay) to issue a token to the merchant, which corresponds to their account. The merchant then uses the token in place of the card for accepting payments and processing refunds. If the merchant’s servers are breached and token data is stolen, it cannot be used by the hacker. “We would like to thank RBI for giving industry this much needed time to scale up its efforts and work towards achieving the true intent of this guideline. PCI will work with the industry and RBI to come up with solutions to handle any use cases such as refunds and post-transaction activity, including chargeback handling, dispute resolution, reward/loyalty programme that currently requires the storage of card data by entities other than card issuers and card networks,” said Vishwas Patel, director Infibeam Avenues and chairman of the Payments Council of India. “As an industry, we are firmly committed to achieving the RBI vision of enhanced customer protection of customer card credentials and have all embarked on that journey,” said Srinivasu MN, Founder, Billdesk and Co-chair of the BBPS committee at PCI. He said the industry will use the next six months to implement appropriate uniform solutions for seamless migration for cardholders as well as ensuring adequate security for storage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/card-tokenisation-last-date-put-off-by-6-months/articleshow/88462602.cms||---

The whistleblower is the CBSE Schools’ Management Association (CSMA), an umbrella organisations of such schools in Tamil Nadu. It has asked the Central Board for Secondary Education to cancel the exams, which began in December first week. This year, CBSE had introduced a new exam pattern for classes 10 and 12. The first phase, in December, had MCQs. CBSE allowed all schools to conduct and evaluate the December exam papers on their own, with only one external supervisor. The CSMA has sent to the CBSE an eight-page letter detailing how question papers were leaked to students through WhatsApp, LAN, and hard copies. The students would be made to sit in a separate hall and given the answers before they were sent to the exam halls. The complaint says schools asked students to write option ‘c’ in the last answer box if they were not sure of the answer. After the exam, the teachers would change the ‘c’ to whichever was the right answer, according to the letter accessed by TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/several-cbse-schools-across-tamil-nadu-manipulating-results-plaint/articleshow/88462786.cms||Ram Sundaram

The bill is aimed at curbing illegal religious conversions. The Karnataka Protection of Right to Freedom of Religion Bill, 2021, introduced in the assembly on Tuesday, was passed by voice vote even as Congress members protested from the well of the House demanding more time for debate on the legislation. The government is likely to introduce the bill in the legislative council, where BJP does not have a majority, on Friday, the last day of the session. After assessing the chances of the bill passi-ng, sources said the party may table the bill or refrain from doing so for now. State home minister Araga Jnanendra, who piloted the bill in the assembly, said the law was not against any religion and eight states had already passed similar legislation. To secure easy passage of the bill, the BJP government counted on its majority in the Assembly and a Congress caught off guard after BJP placed documents to support its claims that the bill was first initiated by the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in 2016. Though opposition leader Siddaramaiah admitted that he as CM had only asked for the draft bill to be placed before the cabinet, no decision had been taken in this regard. Later, Siddaramaiah also claimed that the law commission prepared the draft bill based on the direction of the previous BJP government. BJP does not have a majority in the legislative council and has to depend on a tacit understanding with JD(S) to see the bill through. The regional party has bailed out the BJP government in passing other contentious bills, like the land reforms and APMC bills, in this session. It is expected that JD(S), while opposing the anti-conversion bill, may stage a walkout from the House, helping BJP complete the formalities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/karnataka-assembly-oks-anti-conversion-bill/articleshow/88462841.cms||---

State public prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah made a submission to this effect before the division bench of Justice P N Prakash and Justice R Hemalatha. The bench was hearing a plea moved by Padma, seeking direction to the authorities to consider her application to grant leave to her daughter. When the plea came up for hearing, in view of the submissions made by the prosecutor, Padma requested the court to permit her to withdraw the plea. Recording the same, the court dismissed the plea as withdrawn. According to the petitioner, in 2018 the state cabinet passed a resolution for release of her daughter and all other convicts sentenced to life term in the assassination case. A recommendation to this effect was also made to the governor. However, the governor is sitting on the recommendation without taking any decision for over two years, she said.

The surface-to-surface tactical missile, with a strike range of 150 to 500 km, was tested for the first time from the Abdul Kalam Island off the coast of Odisha on Wednesday. The Pralay missile, which is powered with a solid propellant rocket motor and can carry a payload of 1,000-kg, is designed for major conventional or non-nuclear strikes against enemy targets. “This is for the first time that two flight tests of a ballistic missile have been conducted successfully on two consecutive days. The flight test on Thursday also met all the mission objectives. This launch proves the system in both the configurations of the missile,” a DRDO official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-successfully-tests-pralay-for-2nd-consecutive-day/articleshow/88462980.cms||---
---||India||CBI accuses own officer of papers’ leak, court asks it to probe Deshmukh role||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the role of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh in a document leak case. The CBI in its FIR alleged that the central agency’s sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari had entered into a criminal conspiracy with Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga and unknown persons, and disclosed sensitive and confidential documents to Daga. Tiwari, the FIR said, did this for subverting CBI’s investigation in an extortion case allegedly related to Deshmukh, in lieu of undue advantage and illegal gratification to himself. Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal said that from the reading of the chargesheet as a whole, and relevant record, it appears that other accused persons were closely associated with Deshmukh, and may have been acting in tandem with him, who may be the controlling mind of the larger conspiracy. It said that other accused persons might only be hands, as Deshmukh would have been and was the main beneficiary from the leakage of the documents. The court also pulled up the CBI for forsaking the “man pulling the strings” and directed it to thoroughly probe the role of Deshmukh. “The CBI seems to have left the engine/horse pulling the cart, thereby only arraigning those travelling in the cart. Without the pull of the engine or horse, the ride of the cart or conspiracy would not have been possible. Despite a mountain of apparent evidence, CBI seems to have forsaken the man pulling the strings or the controlling mind or master mind or head while only chargesheeting the hands, for reasons best known,” the court said in an order dated December 22. It asked the CBI to discreetly and thoroughly investigate Deshmukh’s role with utmost alacrity and in a time-bound manner. The court also directed the CBI to file a status report in this regard within four weeks. On August 29, the report allegedly mentions that the probe agency had concluded that “no cognizable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-accuses-own-officer-of-papers-leak-court-asks-it-to-probe-deshmukh-role/articleshow/88462995.cms||---

CM Yogi Adityanath ordered an inquiry into the land deals on Wednesday on the basis of certain media reports alleging that government officials, their relatives and BJP leaders had purchased land in the area soon after the court ruled in favour of the Ram Temple at the disputed site. Additional chief secretary Manoj Kumar Singh said he had nominated a special secretary to visit Ayodhya on Friday to collect the necessary documents and the revenue department would present its report to the CM within a week. Sources said the inquiry would look into whether the land belonged to Scheduled Castes and whether any officers had purchased the land. Meanwhile, BSP chief Mayawati demanded that the Supreme Court monitor the investigation, saying that if there was anything fraudulent in the land deals, then they should be cancelled. Congress national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused BJP of looting the Ayodhya Ram Temple Trust and said the probe ordered by the UP government was an eyewash. Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh also said that the investigation should be done by an SC monitored SIT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-orders-probe-into-ayodhya-land-deals-sc-must-monitor-opposition/articleshow/88463082.cms||Neha Lalchandani

CBI officials say this would be ‘the end’ of their investigations into the Vyapam scam. “It was only after a letter from the central vigilance commission that the state government released their sanctions,” said a CBI officer, adding that the chargesheet would be filed before December 30. After CBI chargesheeted 500-plus people, including some high profile businessmen in the PMT 2012 scam, Vyapam whistleblowers had accused the central agency of overlooking the PMT 2013 case in which they claimed around 200 state quota seats were ‘auctioned’ by six private medical colleges. Anand Rai, one of the whistleblowers in the Vyapam scam, had filed a complaint before Supreme Court, alleging that state quota medical seats were sold to ineligible students by private medical colleges in PMT-2013. He claims that 270 state quota seats were ‘sold’ to unauthorized students. The private colleges were fined Rs 13 crore by Madhya Pradesh Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (MPAFRC) after Dr Rai’s complaint. They however got a stay on the fine and the state government has failed to get the stay vacated in the last two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/vyapam-scam-cbi-gets-mp-nod-to-prosecute-top-officials/articleshow/88463126.cms||P Naveen

Viewing areas that normally accommodate about 58,000 people will be limited to about 15,000 to allow for more distancing, and everyone in attendance must show proof of vaccination and wear a mask, mayor Bill de Blasio said in a news release announcing the changes.  "There is a lot to celebrate and these additional safety measures will keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year," de Blasio said, noting the city's success in getting residents vaccinated while also keeping businesses open.  The added precautions for New Year's Eve in Times Square were spurred by the rapid spread of the omicron variant in the Big Apple, where lines for testing have snaked around blocks in recent days.  On Tuesday, the city set a one-day record with 17,200 new cases, though a true comparison to the number of cases during the initial Covid-19 surge in spring 2020 is impossible because tests were very limited at the time.  Because of vaccinations, hospitalizations and deaths from the current surge are far fewer than at the pandemic's height.  The new wave of cases has led to the cancellation of concerts, sporting events and Broadway shows, but de Blasio has shown a strong preference for having the annual Times Square ball drop go on as planned - the last major event of his eight-year tenure, which ends January 1.  Little more than a month ago, de Blasio gleefully announced that a fully vaccinated crowd of hundreds of thousands of people would be back at the iconic celebration - donning goofy 2022-themed glasses and watching a crystal-clad ball drop at midnight - after it was limited last year to small groups of essential workers.  But that was before omicron caught fire, forcing city officials and event organizers to rethink just how many people they wanted to squeeze into the bright, billboard-lined tourist haven known to some as the Crossroads of the World.  On Tuesday, the Fox network gave its verdict, pulling the plug on a planned live broadcast from the New Year's Eve event. Other networks plan to air the festivities, including Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on ABC, the stalwart now hosted by Ryan Seacrest.  De Blasio said along with Thursday's announcement that the city is monitoring the COVID-19 situation and could impose additional precautions if needed. Among the other changes announced Thursday, revelers won't be allowed into viewing areas until 3 p.m., much later than in past years.  On New Year's Eve last year, Times Square was mostly empty, with Jennifer Lopez and other artists performing behind police barricades. After vaccines became widely available in the U.S., the city allowed crowds back to the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and other events.  "New York is the best place in the world to celebrate New Year's Eve and now it will be one of the safest against Covid as well," Mayor-elect Eric Adams said in a written statement endorsing the new precautions. "New Yorkers and visitors alike can now enjoy Times Square and the rest of our city as we ring in 2022."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/new-years-eve-in-times-square-still-on-with-smaller-crowd/articleshow/88463174.cms||---

Of the 12 new cases, 10 are from Bengaluru and one each from Mysuru and Dakshina Kannada. The new cases comprise Bengaluru’s first Omicron cluster with three primary contacts of a UK-returned, 26-year-old woman. She travelled to Bengaluru on Dec 12, developed symptoms post arrival and tested positive. On Thursday, her father (56), mother (54) and sister (20) were confirmed to be infected with the Omicron variant. “This is the first Omicron cluster among primary contacts of an international passenger,” BBMP authorities said.

Bengaluru's new Omicron cases include two men, aged 31 and 21 years, and a girl aged 18 who travelled from the UK on December 17. They tested Covid positive on arrival and have remained asymptomatic. While the men were fully vaccinated, the girl had taken one dose of Covishield. Mysuru logged its Omicron case on Thursday, with a 9-year-old girl who recently arrived from Switzerland via Abu Dhabi on December 19. The Omicron cases also include a 27-year-old man who travelled from Ghana via Dubai to Mangaluru on December 16. He happens to be the first traveller landing at Mangalore International Airport detected with Omicron. Two new Omicron patients were jabbed with booster doses. A 49-year-old woman, who travelled from Denmark to Bengaluru on December 17, tested positive for Covid on arrival and was found with the Omicron variant. She had taken two doses of Pfizer vaccine and a booster dose of Moderna. A 42-year-old man from the UK, who travelled to Bengaluru on December 17, was found infected with Omicron.

CBI had registered an illegal-wealth case against M Selvakumar, who was deputy director (research), Training Centre, Central Coffee Research Institute, Coffee Research Station, Balehonnur, Chikkamagaluru district. The agency has named his wife VM Saraswathi in the FIR as co-accused since many movable and immovable properties were in her name. The case refers to his posting from January 2005 from March 2013. Selvakumar died on March 29, 2017, before the charges were framed. On the ground that the principal offence against the principal offender had abated, she had sought discharge from the case. Rejecting the challenge to continuance of the trial against Saraswathi, the high court judge said the trial will continue before a criminal court. The judge quashed a part of the order passed by the special court for CBI cases, Bengaluru city, directing the investigation agency to register offences punishable under Section 13(1)(e) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against her. The special court had disallowed pursuing abetment case against her. Saraswathi filed an application before the special judge seeking her discharge in the case. On June 6, 2018, the special judge rejected her application. Both Saraswathi and CBI challenged the order of the special court. Saraswathi contended that if the act that abetted itself could not be proved, the question of continuing the trial would result in miscarriage of justice. P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor for CBI, argued that the order of the special court was erroneous and CBI was aggrieved by dropping of the charge of abetment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-relief-for-wife-if-man-charged-with-graft-dies/articleshow/88463318.cms||---

The study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Itolizumab in patients with SLE and lupus nephritis. Itolizumab is a drug developed by Biocon and is currently used to treat acute psoriasis. Equillium has initiated this study across several tertiary hospitals specialised to deal with lupus nephritis patients in India after obtaining approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). SLE, or Lupus, is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease. The prevalence of SLE in the US has been reported to be between 20 to 150 cases per 100,000. In India, the reported prevalence of SLE is 3.2 per 100,000. Dr Sandeep Athalye, chief medical officer at Biocon Biologics, said, “In India, approximately 45,000 patients are diagnosed with SLE, of which over 20,000 patients have kidney involvement (nephritis), many of which do not respond to standard available therapy with steroids and immunosuppressive drugs.” The firm believes Itolizumab can address this need.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/biocon-drug-being-tested-in-india-to-treat-lupus/articleshow/88463323.cms||---

The government will provide up to 50 per cent of the project cost to manufacturers looking to establish a facility to fabricate chips up to 28nm (nanometer), up to 40 per cent of the cost for chips above 28nm and up to 45nm, and up to 30 per cent for chips above 45nm and up to 65nm. Nm is one-billionth of a meter and, in semiconductors, represents the least distance between transistors in a chip. Chips are getting smaller and better as researchers find ways to reduce the distance between transistors. “Support under the scheme shall be provided for six years. The tenure of the actual fiscal support outflow may be extended based on the approval of the electronics and IT minister,” the document said. In case of fiscal support being provided as equity , the government’s share will not exceed 49 per cent of total project equity. The scheme will be implemented through a nodal agency called India Semiconductor Mission. Applicants have to make a minimal capital investment of Rs 20,000 crore. And applicants must have minimum revenue of Rs 7,500 crore (including group companies) in electronics system design and manufacturing in any of the three financial years preceding the year of submission. The document said that domestic electronics manufacturing has increased substantially over the last few years and is steadily moving from the semi-knocked down (SKD) to the completely knocked down (CKD) stage of manufacturing. “However, domestic value addition is estimated to be in the range of 10 per cent - 30 per cent only, and growth in manufacturing so far has primarily been on account of final assembly using imported components, sub-assemblies/parts, etc. This is due to the lack of a robust semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in the country,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-to-offer-up-to-50-of-project-cost-to-cos-setting-up-chip-plant/articleshow/88463324.cms||Shilpa Phadnis
---||Bengaluru||Manual scavenging claimed 26 lives in Karnataka since 2017: Ministry data||BENGALURU: The deaths of two people in Mysuru earlier this week, which are yet to enter official records, and the case of the Dalit employee at Chinmaya Mission Hospital being forced to clean a manhole are not stray cases of manual scavenging in the state. Years after India banned the practice of manual scavenging and physical cleaning of sewers/septic tanks, it continues to plague the state with tens of workers made to indulge in it, including in Bengaluru, without even basic safety gear and measures. Data from the Union ministry of social justice shows manual scavenging claimed at least 26 lives in Karnataka since 2017. As reported by TOI earlier, there were at least 54 deaths between 2008 and 2016. Those on the ground, however, say that the number could be much more than what official records show. Last Monday, social welfare minister Kota Srinivas Poojary told the legislative council that the government has embarked upon a survey of manual scavengers across the state and 5,000 people were identified from 12 districts “who secure employment only by way of scavenging”. While the Centre and state governments have in place rehabilitation programmes for manual scavengers, activists say the government has been inefficient in identifying such people in the first place and that efforts to reskill them for employment have not had desired results. Poojary, while stating that the government has set February 2022 as the target to complete the survey in the remaining 18 districts, admitted that several urban local bodies, including BBMP, have failed to take the issue seriously. A meeting of all legislators and officials is likely to be scheduled in January to discuss the matter. Samuel Sathyaseelan, a social worker and PhD scholar, said: “The numbers are higher than we know. In fact, sanitation workers are frequently hospitalised due to the hazardous nature of their job but every such case is treated with apathy.” The BWSSB Contract Sanitation Workers’ Union says it receives between 15-20 complaints from each area under a single Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board service station daily but can only address about five. Pointing out that Bengaluru has 110 service stations operated by BWSSB, S Balan, an advocate representing the Union, said: “In each service station, a minimum of four workers are contractually appointed to clean the chambers, gutters and sewers. Therefore, BWSSB has been engaging more than 440 people to manually clean sewers and manholes.” Claiming that there are injuries and accidents every day, Sathyaseelan said not even contract workers are given technical training. He said that given the fact that they don’t know how to use the hydro-jetting machine or others, there have been cases of amputation. “We are always working under a lot of pressure. Since the designated manhole and sewer cleaners cannot attend to every complaint, contractors send other workers under them or non-contract individuals looking for a job, to resolve issues,” Sathish JR, a contract sanitation worker who undertakes tasks of BWSSB, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/manual-scavenging-claimed-26-lives-in-ktaka-since-2017-ministry-data/articleshow/88463326.cms||Sanika Athavale
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Engineering students seek change in deadline to give up seats||BENGALURU: With engineering counselling in Karnataka under CET extended till December 31, students who have taken admission in private universities are in a fix. According to All-India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), the last date to surrender seats and get full fee refund was November 25. However, at that time, not even the first round of CET and Comed-K counselling was completed and students had no idea whether they would get a seat of their choice. “We paid around Rs 2 lakh as first-year fee at a private university. Now that we are asking for cancellation and refund, the college is saying the deadline was November 25. However, University Grants Commission had said the last date for withdrawal of admission with refund after deducting Rs 1,000 would be December 31. But the institution says that being an engineering college, it follows the AICTE academic calendar,” said a parent. Another parent said the process has been a major hardship for middle-class families. “The AICTE deadline of November 25 serves the interests of only JEE students who have completed at least 5-6 rounds of counselling. Even Maharashtra counselling dates were later. Now, colleges are refusing to provide any refund for surrendered seats... We may be forced to lose the entire tuition fee of Rs 2 lakh and additional fees paid if AICTE does not revise the last date.” Students and parents said it is unfortunate the system is not in sync, leaving them in a pickle. The Supreme Court recently ordered extension of the last date for engineering admissions to December 31. It had, back in 2012, ordered completion of such admissions before July 31 every year. But Karnataka Examinations Authority sought permission to allow admissions till December 31 in the best interests of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/engg-students-seek-change-in-deadline-to-give-up-seats/articleshow/88463328.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The accused is Mahesh, a resident of Ramamurthynagar, and the injured is Tarun K of Dooravaninagar. Police registered a case of assault and criminal intimidation against Mahesh and others based on a complaint filed by Tarun’s father Kumaresh on Monday. Police identified the suspect by verifying CCTV footage from the spot and nabbed him. Tarun, a first-year student of a private college, and his friend Surya went to the fuel station to fill petrol. At the same time, three persons on a bike arrived there to fill fuel. Both sides were in a hurry to get their two-wheelers filled up first, which led to arguments. The situation worsened after Mahesh and Tarun kicked each other. Mahesh took his bike key and stabbed Tarun in the neck and fled from the spot with his associates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/fight-over-fuel-youth-stabs-student-with-key-held/articleshow/88463333.cms||---

Her accounts were frozen in March this year when her husband was arrested by Anti-Corruption Bureau sleuths for possessing disproportionate assets and not cooperating with the investigation after raids on premises belonging to him and his relatives. Swetha contended that freezing her bank accounts was not necessary for the purpose of investigation into the case. She said she worked with a private firm and was going through hardship because of the accounts being inaccessible. She submitted that the amount would be redeposited before the court if it came to the conclusion that the accounts were part of the ill-gotten amount. The prosecution opposed the defreezing of accounts, saying probe was still on. The accounts had a balance of Rs 27,431, Rs 75,289 and Rs 5,161. The court, however, ruled that unfreezing the accounts would have no impact on the investigation. Judge Lakshminarayana Bhat directed Swetha to execute an indemnity bond for Rs 1.1 lakh subject to the condition that she would deposit the outstanding amount as and when directed by the court till final disposal of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/court-defreezes-3-accounts-of-tainted-inspectors-spouse/articleshow/88463334.cms||Santosh kumar.B

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Metro gets nod to cut 577 trees||BENGALURU: In a big relief to BMRCL, the high court on Thursday allowed it to remove 577 trees along Nagawara-Gottigere Metro alignment as per a tree expert committee (TEC) report. The order was passed on an office memorandum (OM) submitted by BMRCL dated November 26. Two more OMs filed in the second week of this month are pending as the petitioners want to file objections. Recording BMRCL’s submission that there is a daily loss of Rs 2 crore/cost escalation because of the project being withheld for want of permission to cut trees, a division bench headed by chief justice Ritu Raj Awasthi said the project should be completed in a time-bound manner. The bench said the November 18 expert committee report says that out of 833 trees examined, 44 were found suitable for retention and 212 for translocation, thus saving 256 trees. Have to go by report: HCResponding to the petitioner’s objection on the need to cut 577 trees, the bench said courts are not experts on this and have to go by the TEC report. “We are of the view that the report of the expert committee constituted by this court shall be accepted. There being some variation in the number of trees mentioned in the DPR and the TEC report, does not mean the committee has not properly carried out the work as per the process elucidated in the court’s December 9, 2020 order. There can be a variation as the initial DPR was prepared in 2016 while the TEC examination was carried out after December 2020,” the bench added. Counsel for the petitioner said as per the DPR of November 2019, only 1,218 trees were to be affected, but in case all the three OMs are taken together, the total number of trees affected will be 2,115. The court was hearing a PIL by Bangalore Environment Trust and Dattatraya T Devare, an environmentalist. The petitioner sought the constitution of a committee/task force to ensure tree officers and the tree authority carry out their functions in accordance with provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, and Karnataka Preservation of Trees Rules, 1977. In June, an interlocutory application was filed by the petitioner seeking court intervention on chopping of trees along Nagawara-Gottigere alignment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/metro-gets-nod-to-cut-577-trees/articleshow/88463339.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||GST relief may be extended beyond June 2022, says CM||Bengaluru: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday informed the assembly that the Centre plans to extend GST compensation for states beyond June 2022. Bommai said the GST council, in its next meeting, is all set to propose the same to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman since all states have agreed to push for it on account of the impact of Covid-19 on economy and finances. He informed the house that new tax revenue-generating ideas have been discussed by the GoM within the council, which the CM himself chairs, and a report will be submitted by January-February 2022.Earlier, the supplementary budget of Rs 3,480 crore was passed in the assembly. As the opposition Congress warned of increasing debt, Bommai said the government has identified several goods and some commercial tax circles that have considerable potential to generate revenue. The CM quoted an example of arecanut, wherein the leakage under GST was quite hefty. “In one week, after providing impetus towards collecting taxes, we recovered Rs 8 crore from arecanut sales,” he added.Bommai also said the government had reached as much as 67 per cent of its revenue target as of November-end and a revised target will be provided to all departments to increase revenue in the next three months. He said motor vehicle tax was at the bottom of the list in terms of revenue generation, with just 54 per cent of the target achieved, primarily due to lack of semiconductors and poor sales. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/gst-relief-may-be-extended-beyond-june-2022-says-cm/articleshow/88463340.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru Urban first district in Karnataka to clock 100% 2nd dose coverage||BENGALURU: Bengaluru Urban, excluding BBMP areas, has emerged as the first district in Karnataka to have fully vaccinated 100% of its target population against Covid-19. The population of 10.3 lakh has been double jabbed, according to data with the state health and family welfare department as on Thursday morning. However, in first dose coverage, the district has gone beyond its target and reached 129%, as many migrant labourers, workers from Tamil Nadu and neighbouring districts of Kolar, BBMP and the floating population have taken vaccines in the district’s primary health centres. The district has administered first dose to 13.2 lakh persons. The challenge now is to cover the remaining nearly 3 lakh persons who have taken the first shot in the district, with the second dose, said J Manjunath, deputy commissioner, Bengaluru Urban. He added the target was set based on the 2011 census and given that 10 years have passed, the data may not be accurate. “Anyone can take Covid vaccine anywhere. Many who work in our district but live in BBMP areas have taken their first dose here. To cover the rest with the second dose we will contact those who are in the due list and check if they have taken the second shot already,” he said, addressing media on Thursday. As a token of appreciation, the district administration felicitated some of its doctors as Covid warriors on the occasion. Acknowledging the work of the district Covid-19 war room staff who have worked without a day’s off, Manjunath said the team played a crucial role in micro-planning the entire vaccination drive since January 16. “In initial days, there was hesitation among the public to take the jab. Some of the first ones to take the shot were healthcare workers, including the district health officer who boosted the confidence of others,” he said. The district administration took up measures to create awareness to eliminate vaccine hesitancy, said officers. The DC added the 100% second-dose coverage was possible due to collaboration with several organisations, including Biocon, One Billion Literates, United Way, Mylan Lab, Narayana Health and Care India. “To conduct mobile vaccination drives in rural areas, Care India provided vehicles,” the officer said. The participation of elected representatives seeking vaccines for their jurisdiction also helped in increasing the coverage, the DC added. “The response among the public was good wherever vaccination centres were near their houses. We also took the vaccines to the public near their dwellings and working areas. Har Ghar Dastak initiative which started from November 3 also helped in reaching the last mile,” said district health officer Dr SG Srinivas. Micro planning of the vaccination drive included identifying essential service sector units in the industrial pockets of the district and ensuring the staffers there were jabbed. “Mylan which produces the antiviral drug remdesivir is in our district and we ensured that all their 1,050 employees were fully jabbed. Employees of pharmaceutical companies producing medicines like Dolo were also covered in our outreach drives, to ensure that none of them falls sick due to Covid, as their work was essential for the country’s medical supply,” said Manjunath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-urban-first-district-in-stateto-clock-100-2nd-dose-coverage/articleshow/88463343.cms||---

Justice S M Subramaniam has directed the Director of Rural Development to ensure effective implementation of the Tamil Nadu Village Panchayats (Prohibition or Regulation of use of places for slaughtering animals) Rules. “Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees right to life. Health is an integral part of right to life and, therefore, any public health issues arising on account of such irregularities or illegalities, must be addressed without causing any undue delay,” the judge said. The authorities are duty bound to ensure implementation of the rules through subordinate officials. Safeguarding public interest is of paramount importance. People are facing health issues on account of improper clearance of garbage, medical wastage and animal waste, the court said. When these aspects are not monitored, and the rules are not implemented, it amounts to authorities failing in their duties, the court said. The court passed the order on a plea moved by V Paneerselvam in 2015 seeking action against illegal slaughter houses in Nagapattinam district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/meat-shops-slaughter-houses-without-licence-to-face-action/articleshow/88463345.cms||Suresh Kumar

Little do they know their fate hangs at the mercy of the dilapidated sun-shades 15-ft high. While last week’s tragic wall collapse at a Tirunelveli school that killed three is still fresh in mind, the situation in many government and corporation schools in the city is scary. A corporation survey this week found 32 school buildings were fit to be razed. At the school on Angallamman Kovil Street in Pattalam, under zone six (Thiruvika Nagar), at least four sun shades are badly damaged, with deep cracks in the faded wall that badly needs a coat of paint. In Pulianthope, an annexe building of a primary corporation school on New Farrance Road that’s used as a cultural hall has dilapidated compound walls with bricks exposed. One would expect institutions in core city areas to be maintained properly, but the Corporation Boys’ School on Rajaji Street in Nungambakkam has half-broken shades and the walls of a government school in Ashok Nagar have collapsed. Sources part of the corporation survey say more than 1,000 windows need to be replaced, major cracks on floors at about 400 spots need a fix, while ceilings and slabs at 800 spots should be changed. A top official said the corporation would seek funds under Singara Chennai 2.0 to renovate the schools.” Already 20 schools have been renovated at a cost of Rs 50 crore under the scheme and 28 schools are being transformed under the CITIIS programme,” he said. The survey would be scrutinised by engineers again before proposals for renovations are made. “This process will be over within a week.” School education department officials said a review will be held to finalise proposals for all dilapidated buildings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/children-at-these-schools-in-city-may-be-sitting-ducks/articleshow/88463348.cms||Omjasvin M D

The central agency, so far, has not received any written communication from the state government to drop the project, sources said. The Supreme Court in December last had upheld the notification for acquisition of land for the 10,000 crore green corridor project and directed the NHAI to get environmental clearance for the project before carrying out land acquisition. “To get the environmental clearance, the Union environment ministry has suggested that studies have to be carried out on the field for which the state government’s cooperation is required. It is not forthcoming despite a communique to the top state government officials recently,” said an NHAI official. The NHAI has to do a comprehensive socio-economic assessment with emphasis on the impact of ongoing land acquisition on the locals living around the proposed alignment. An assessment of impact on local biodiversity, wildlife corridors and its mitigation strategy, including baseline generation, wildlife movement, and identification of corridors along 277.3km corridor has been completed by the department of environmental science and engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad. Similarly, Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore, completed an ecosystem study.In a related development, Union minister for road transport Nitin Gadkari had told Rajya Sabha last week that the project would be completed by 2025. “NHAI has appointed M/s KITCO (a Kerala government undertaking) to carry out the socio-economic study. After completion of this study, the environmental impact assessment report has to be prepared and submitted to the pollution control board to hold public hearings,” said the official. None of the collectors have responded yet.Meanwhile, sources said chief minister M K Stalin in his memorandum presented to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June, had requested the Centre to drop the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-salem-highway-nhai-seeks-tn-help/articleshow/88463350.cms||Julie Mariappan

Police said that the arrested minor girls — two school students and one from a college — were sent to an observation home. While the main accused — Ashok Kumar, 21, of Kandigai village and Levin, 22 of Red Hills — surrendered on Tuesday, the other accused were identified as Moses, 21, Stephan, 21, Praveen Kumar, 21, and Jeganadhan, 20, of Ponneri. Police said they were employed at factories in the locality. The deceased college student — Premkumar of Mannivakkam, — threatened the two schoolgirls with recordings of their phone conversations and a few videos and extorted Rs 50,000 from each. He even warned that he would show up at their houses if they did not part with the money. One of the girls then approached her elder sister, a college student, who in turn sought help from Ashok Kumar, her Instagram friend, police said. As instructed by Ashok Kumar, the girls asked Prem Kumar to come to an appointed spot in Red Hills. They had asked him to erase their photographs and phone recordings in Prem Kumar’s possession, but he and his friends kidnapped Prem Kumar on a two-wheeler and took him to Eachangadu where the gang members smoked ganja. Premkumar’s friend, who accompanied him to the spot, fled and after Ashok and the others began to attack Prem Kumar. “The girls were part of the crime as they did not approach us till the body was exhumed,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/murder-of-college-student-three-girls-among-9-arrested/articleshow/88463351.cms||---
---||Chennai||Government to start work on Tamil Nadu population health registry||CHENNAI: Names of more than 79,000 people of Kandamangalam village in Villupuram district are now added to the state population health registry along with details of at least 14 medical conditions they were screened for. The unique health ID (UHID), assigned to each person, will help them access better medical services and provide the government with a database to prioritise health care, health minister Ma Subramanian said. On Thursday, after reviewing the work, he said more than 150 health workers screened people with the help of four private software firms. “This was a pilot programme launched two months ago. We will be increasing the consortium to at least 30 firms so we can include all citizens in the population health registry,” he said. Nearly 6.5 crore people across the state now have been assigned UHIDs. The names, gender, age, and contact details of the citizens were drawn from the family database, CM health insurance schemes and other registries maintained by the state e-governance agency. “By June, we will launch the project. Once it is completed, the health details of every individual will be available. Rights to access the information will be given to empanelled healthcare providers including doctors and hospitals,” health officials said. Doctors and hospitals can make changes to health details with permission from the individual and the government. While the digital record will help patients seek treatment at any hospital, the state will have a denominator for all diseases and be the driving force for all policy decisions. The unique ID will also be the backbone for ‘makkalai thedi maruthum’ scheme that provides comprehensive and holistic healthcare for non-communicable diseases at people’s doorsteps. With medical details getting digitised, nurses need not carry huge registers to keep a check on vaccinations, tests, or delivery of drugs. “We can integrate and digitalise several existing health schemes. For instance, we can send reminders for child vaccinations to a parent, or blood tests to an adult, or for annual breast cancer screening to women,” the health minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-to-start-work-on-tn-population-health-registry/articleshow/88463352.cms||---

State public prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah made a submission to this effect before the division bench of Justice P N Prakash and Justice R Hemalatha. The bench was hearing a plea moved by Padma, seeking direction to the authorities to consider her application to grant leave to her daughter. When the plea came up for hearing, in view of the submissions made by the prosecutor, Padma requested the court to permit her to withdraw the plea. Recording the same, the court dismissed the plea as withdrawn. According to the petitioner, in 2018 the state cabinet passed a resolution for release of her daughter and all other convicts sentenced to life term in the assassination case. A recommendation to this effect was also made to the governor. However, the governor is sitting on the recommendation without taking any decision for over two years, she said. Since my health condition deteriorated I made an application to the superintendent of prison, special prison for women, Vellore, seeking grant of leave for my daughter so that she can take care of me, the petitioner said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nalini-granted-parole-for-a-month-to-look-after-mother/articleshow/88463355.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Chennai||Use yellow bags to go green, says Stalin||Chennai: Cloth and jute bags may be in vogue, but the state government and the TN pollution control board have pledged to bring back the traditional ‘Manja Pai’ (yellow cloth bag). Chief Minister M K Stalin, who inaugurated an exhibition of alternate products for banned throwaway plastic items, said that the ‘Manja Pai’, once associated with special family occasions, is now considered embarrassing and out of fashion. “The TNPCB has shut 130 industries that manufacture plastic bags and banned items in the last two years. We need to convert this ban into a people’s movement and embrace the forgotten yellow bags to keep the environment clean and free from pollution,” the chief minister said. In fact, the TNPCB officials closed 13 such industries in the last month based on public complaints. “We will continue to issue guidelines and ensure that we support the local bodies in imposing the ban that took a backseat due to the pandemic,” said a TNPCB official. About 14 stalls with innovative alternates to plastic were kept on display. This included manufacturing clothes with used plastic bottles, cloth flex banners, areca nut, plant fiber cutlery, and edible cutlery.The state government, on January 1, 2019, had banned 14 types of plastic and food packaging items. The Greater Chennai Corporation, over the last five months, has penalized over 15000 traders and collected more than 15 lakh in fines. S Saroja, executive director, Citizen Consumer, and civic action group, said, “Trying to change public behavior is a welcome move. However, more focus should be on strict enforcement and putting an end to the production of these banned items. If such items are available, consumers will use them. The ban should also be for all snacks packaging sectors and not focus on a single sector where smaller shops and vendors are penalised. Unless there are strong policies and effective enforcement it will be a difficult task to achieve.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/use-yellow-bags-to-go-green-says-stalin/articleshow/88463356.cms||---

Registered professionals, including engineers, who execute the construction with deviations, will also face action. The government is working on the quantum of penalty and punishment for registered professionals, ahead of launching the initiative aimed at averting the delay in issuing the planning permits. The deemed approval is likely to kickstart with residential constructions over plots measuring 1000-1200 square feet. Builders’ association has observed that the move will help in having checks and balances for the scheme that offers hassle-free planning approvals on self-attested applications. Sources in the TN housing and urban development department that the penal action could lead to cancellation of the planning permission for the respective constructions and fine. Action against professionals engaged may range till the suspension of their registration. "An amendment is required in the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, to launch the deemed approvals for construction applications based on self-certification," a source in the department said. The TN Combined Development and Building Rules mandate the registration of construction professionals with the CMDA and DTCP. Close to 1,857 personnel have registered as construction engineers and engineers of grade I, II and III, while 452 architects have enrolled as registered professionals in the past three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/engineers-will-now-face-action-if-building-plans-are-violated/articleshow/88463357.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss
---||Chennai||Tambaram corporation ward delimitation: Locals, opposition parties unhappy||CHENNAI: Residents demand smaller wards while political parties criticize hasty bifurcation of earlier constituencies at a public meeting held to elicit views of residents about the delimitation exercise for the newly formed Tambaram Corporation on Thursday. The AIADMK has threatened to move the court against the delimitation. Residents and parties, including AIADMK, CPM, BJP and others criticized the hasty manner in which the wards have been demarcated and said that the public hearing was held without giving time for the people to study the changes. After the delimitation exercise, the authorities have divided the areas that come under Tambaram corporation into 70 wards. The demarcation of wards was announced on December 20 and the public hearing was scheduled three days later. There was a last minute change of the venue too. On Thursday, a common public hearing was held for newly formed and expanded corporations and municipalities in Chengalpet, Kancheepuram and Ranipet districts. S Chandrasekharan, the secretary of Chitlapakkam Anna Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said at the public hearing that delimitation was done based on 2011 population but the number of residents, houses and neighbourhoods have increased multifold but there are only three wards. “We feel that there can be five wards. The entire Chitlapakkam can be made into one zone.” He also said of the existing wards, 16, 17 and 18 were left out. Venkatesan B, former vice-chairman of the Pammal Municipality, said that five streets located in ward 10 have been included in ward 8, which is far away. V Santhanam, the president of People's Awareness Association, said more people will get a chance to contest in elections and emerge as leaders if the wards are smaller. “Small parties will not be able to spend in the elections in big wards.” M Elangovan, the commissioner of the Tambaram Corporation, said the delimitation was done based on the 2011 census and has followed the principle that the population per ward should not increase more than 10% or fall less than 10% of the average population of the corporation area. “We have got more than 200 petitions. Alterations will be done if the demands are feasible. Field visits will also be done to check the ground situation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tambaram-corpn-ward-delimitation-locals-oppn-parties-unhappy/articleshow/88463358.cms||---

Visit nextdoor grocer in Chennai||CHENNAI: Soon, you can buy a metro rail smart card for Rs 150 in your neighbourhood grocery store or petty shop before you walk into a station to board a train, as Chennai Metro Rail Limited has started assigning authorised agents to sell these cards. The move will prevent commuters from waiting in long queues at metro stations to buy the smart cards. Commuters, however, can recharge these cards for subsequent travels only at metro stations. “We introduced this facility because many commuters don’t want to wait in queues at the ticket counter to buy these cards. It’ll also encourage more people to buy smart cards if they are available in a store or anywhere in their neighbourhood,” a metro rail official said. A passenger can buy a smart card from any agent authorised by CMRL for Rs 150 and can travel for ₹100 with it before he/she recharges it for further commute. Officials said while commuters will get a 20% discount on their tickets with a smart card, an authorised agent will get a 5% commission for sale of a card. On Thursday, the first set of metro train travel cards were given to R Premnath, an authorised agent, by Pradeep Yadav, managing director, CMRL. Officials said those who want to enroll as agents will have to fill a form available in metro stations and provide PAN, GST and bank account numbers. Upon scrutinizing, the agents are issued an authorisation letter along with promotional materials which will have details about the smart card and discounts available for commuters. “We are inviting people to enroll themselves as authorised agents. We are also approaching shopkeepers and others on our own and requesting them to become our agents,” an official said. In a release, CMRL said those willing to become an agent can contact CMRL helpline 18604251515, email at customercare@cmrl.in or call 9445196185.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/need-metro-smart-card-visit-nextdoor-grocer/articleshow/88463359.cms||---

---||India||Education ministry warns against ed-tech scams, issues advisory||NEW DELHI: The Union education ministry has advised parents, students and all stakeholders in school education to be careful while opting for online content and coaching being offered by ed-tech companies. The MoE, in its advisory issued on Thursday, said it has come to the notice of the department of school education that some ed-tech companies are luring parents in the garb of offering free services and getting electronic fund transfer (EFT) mandates signed or auto-debit option activated. According to the advisory, the decision to opt for such services has to be well considered by following several dos and don’ts and offers of free services must be carefully evaluated. The ministry has suggested all stakeholders within the education ecosystem to — avoid using the automatic debit option for payment of subscription fee; read the terms and conditions thoroughly before acknowledging the acceptance of learning software/device as the person’s IP address and/or personal data may be tracked; avoid asking for a tax invoice statement for purchase of educational devices loaded with contents/app purchases/pendrive learning; do a detailed background check of the ed-tech company; verify the quality of content provided by ed-tech companies and make sure that it is in line with the syllabus; and ensure the study material is easily comprehensible by the child, among others. Other safety measures suggested include activating parental controls and safety features on the device or in the app or the browser as it helps restrict access to certain content and limit spending on app purchases and help the child understand that some features in education apps are used to encourage more spending. Parents must go through the child safety guidelines mentioned in the PRAGYATA guidelines of the ministry of education before using any ed-tech platform, the advisory said. Asking parents and students not to blindly trust the advertisements of the ed-tech companies, they have also been asked not to sign up for any loans which they are unaware of. Other don’ts are not to install any mobile ed-tech applications without verifying the authenticity, avoid credit/ debit cards registration on apps for subscriptions, adding data like emails, contact numbers, card details, addresses etc. online as the data may be sold or used for later scam attacks and not to share any personal videos and photos, among others. The ministry has also asked stakeholders not to trust the “success stories” shared by the ed-tech companies without proper checking and not to share bank account details and OTP number with any marketing personnel. The advisory stated that before purchasing any content, stakeholders may also explore government initiatives. “Free e-learning contents/textbooks/ digital labs/ for all classes have been made available online ensuring quality and access for all by the ministry of education, its autonomous organisations, and all states/ UTs which may be effectively used for learning and can be accessed here (but not limited to),” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/education-ministry-warns-against-ed-tech-scams-issues-advisory/articleshow/88463310.cms||---

With the Omicron threat looming large, Bengalureans are choosing to continue Covid-19 restrictions and limiting the number of people they invite even to house parties. Vivek Chiriyankandath George, founder of e-store Your Design, describes himself as “a hardcore partygoer” but is now cautious even when visiting a slightly crowded space. “There are different slots for the Christmas mass to avoid crowding. We will attend a 7pm mass, sing carols and will be home for dinner by 9pm with cousins and family,” he said, adding that in pre-Covid times, the dinner would be followed by meeting friends and going out. “Now, there is a mental block. Not everyone is comfortable coming out into crowds. There is a fear of the Omicron variant. It is also good as such caution will probably prevent another wave of Covid-19,” the Viveknagar resident said. His sister and her family will be joining the celebrations virtually from China. “The last time she was with us for Christmas was in 2019. Though the time zones do not match, she will be present for the celebrations,” he added. Some miss big gatheringsEven Sapna Matthew will be celebrating Christmas with her family virtually from the US. “I was to travel to Bengaluru but decided not to at the last minute because of Omicron. The Christmas vibes are beautiful here, but I miss my family,” the techie told TOI.  The British-born and Bengaluru-based Moya Caddy said she likes the close-knit Christmas celebrations with family but misses the bigger gatherings. Christmas trees with aluminium foils and Channapatna dollsThe Primrose Road Mar Thoma Syrian Church has installed a 25 ft tall Christmas Tree made with recyclable materials like packing boxes, aluminium foils, hardboards, and newspapers. It has a tradition of using recyclable materials for Christmas Tree. Rev Charley Jones, Vicar, of the church told TOI that the food wrappers and boxes mark their initiative where they shared 100 food lunch packets to people in need every day since June 2021. "Between 11.45 am to 12 pm, we distribute food parcels to poor and needy sponsored by not just our Church members, but even complete strangers,” Rev Jones said. “As part of Christmas celebration, we are sharing blankets and dinner made in our campus by our dedicated members for 150 people in need,” he added. Conrad Bengaluru in Ulsoor has also installed a sustainable Christmas Tree with Channapatna Dolls. The 18 ft tall tree has base layers of 600 saplings, and 300 Channapatna Dolls for higher layers.

The message comes in the backdrop of Covaxin manufacturer Bharat Biotech’s recent announcement about its open-vial stability. Following this, Karnataka had sought a clarification from the Centre.On Wednesday, TOI had highlighted the confusion created by the Covaxin manufacturer’s new open-vial policy. Bharat Biotech had said Covaxin vials once opened could be used for 28 days if stored in 2-8 degrees Celsius and needn’t be discarded immediately or at the end of immunization session. Prior to this, the manufacturer had maintained that the doses if opened must be used within six hours. The Centre also clarified to states that all vaccines, including those of Covid-19, shouldn’t be used beyond the expiry date.In November, Bharat Biotech had said the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDCSO), a wing of Drugs Controller of India, had approved extension of Covaxin’s shelf-life up to 12 months from the date of manufacture. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/centre-says-no-to-open-vial-policy-shelf-life-extension/articleshow/88463437.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: BMTC moots free bus travel for women a la Delhi||BENGALURU: After Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Punjab, women passengers in Bengaluru may soon be able to travel in non-AC BMTC buses for free. While Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation officials said the proposal is still in discussion stage, if implemented, it will not only boost women empowerment also give the BJP a leg-up in the 2023 BBMP elections, experts said. A senior BMTC official said the proposal may be placed in the upcoming state budget. BMTC’s daily ridership was around 36 lakh before Covid-19 and reduced to 25 lakh now. The utility estimates 25-30% of its passengers are women. As per Census 2011, male workforce participation in Bengaluru Metropolitan Area is 62% and that of women is 24%. In addition to this, girl students and children will be covered under the plan. BMTC proposes to issue a smart card to women passengers and charge one-time annual fee. Passengers will need to tap the card at electronic ticketing machines and the utility will claim the amount from the government based on transactions/trips. Tara Krishnaswamy from Citizens for Bengaluru, an NGO said: “Free bus travel will empower women and also create more livelihood options. But it is also the government’s responsibility to reimburse the amount to BMTC. Now, many women walk or travel in shared autos because they cannot afford bus fare.” AAP-led Delhi government was the first to introduce free bus travel for women in the country. In Delhi, non-AC bus conductors issue pink tickets of a face value of Rs 10 each to women passengers. The government reimburses the public transport utility based on the number of such tickets issued. In Tamil Nadu, the government provides a subsidy of Rs 1,200 crore a year to state transport undertakings to compensate for free bus travel for women. BMTC officials said free bus travel is unlikely to hurt the utility provided the government reimburses the cost without delay. “BMTC’s annual revenue from ticket collection is Rs 1,400-Rs 1,900 crore. If the government can provide the amount to BMTC, we could make travel free for all,” said an official. BMTC, along with the labour department, recently decided to issue free monthly passes to women garment workers. Similarly, in association with the Building and Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, it issues free bus passes to construction workers. The transport utility also provides concessional passes for students, senior citizens and others. But the government is yet to reimburse crores of rupees to BMTC, especially for providing concessional passes to students and others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bmtc-moots-free-bus-travel-for-women-a-la-delhi/articleshow/88463438.cms||---

But then Pritha scored four consecutive points to go one up. She was aggressive and confident, and I had to change my game plan thereafter,” Yashaswini, who trains at the Skies Academy here, told TOI.The Bengaluru girl engaged Pritha in rallies, explored the corners of the table to force her opponent to move around in an attempt to tire her out. Yet, it was a test of temperament for Yashaswini as a determined Pritha ran her close in the third and fourth games. “But the last game was comparatively easy. I led throughout before winning it 11-4,” Yashaswini said.In the semifinals, Yashaswini, 17, got the better of West Bengal’s Munmum Kundu 4-0 while Pritha ousted Risha Mirchandani of Maharashtra 4-1 (11-4, 18-16, 7-11, 11-6, 11-7). This was Yashaswini’s first gold medal in the U-19 category at the national level this season.

Venture capital (VC) funding in deep tech enterprises -businesses working on deep science and technology solutions stood at 133 investments worth over $1.4 billion in 2021 (till Dec 15) up from 106 deals worth $556 million in 2020 and 107 deals worth $567 million in 2019, as per data from Venture Intelligence.The average deal size in the segment rose from $5 million in 2020 to around $11 million in 2021, data shows. However, deep tech investments made up only around 4.5% of the total funding pie in 2021 and have hovered around the 4% mark since 2018. Investors and industry watchers say while it is still early for deep tech investing to go mainstream in India, 2021 has seen a sharp rise in deal making and interest from investors with the pandemic’s thrust on digitisation. While it did not enjoy the ‘FOMO’ style of investing seen by e-commerce, fintech or edtech, deep tech entrepreneurs were able to catch investor eye this year, they said. “Deep tech as a sector is gaining momentum globally, and while it is true that it has been on the sidelines so far in India, we are currently seeing increased interest from non-traditional investors who want to explore the space for generating potentially non-linear benefits to their traditional businesses led by technology,” Pratip Mazumdar, partner at Inflexor Ventures, said. The deep tech-focused VC firm is seeing strong interest from large family offices with a wide variety of business backgrounds such as pharma, retail, automotive, etc. Speciale Invest, another VC firm with a focus on investing in deep tech and engineering innovation, sees the year as an optimistic start of things to come. Vishesh Rajaram, co-founder, Speciale, said they regularly introduce their portfolio companies to other investors and response rates on such connections have almost tripled this year. Manish Singhal, founder of early-stage deep tech fund pi Ventures, says such innovations do not require the millions that are needed by consumer tech ventures but despite that they saw huge amounts of international investor interest in 2021. “A lot of our portfolio companies raised follow-on rounds this year and we have also done more deals than before,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/deep-tech-startups-attract-more-than-double-investment-in-2021/articleshow/88463440.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: 45-year-old smuggling case falls apart in court||AHMEDABAD: No case papers, no complainant, no witnesses, no evidence, and not even all the accused – this was the state of a smuggling case during trial, 45 years after customs officials made the seizure. Only two of the 12 accused charged with smuggling in synthetic fabrics and metallic yarn in 1976 were present in the city session court. So, when the department told the court that it had lost the case papers and had no clue where the officers involved in the case were, the two accused requested the court to end their long ordeal and were acquitted. According to case details, in December 1976, Customs officials had nabbed a truck smuggling synthetic fabrics and metallic yarn worth Rs 1.54 lakh into India through Kutch. The department named 14 persons but booked 12 persons in the smuggling case registered in 1986. One was granted pardon while the department could contact only seven of the remaining men. The case was sent to the sessions court for trial in 1989. This case came up for hearing in 2019 and the court came to know that the main accused, Jumma Hingoria, had died. One more accused was killed some 25 years ago, though his death could not be confirmed so the court proceeded with the trial against him. Only two accused remained present through their advocate. During the trial, the customs department told the court that the case papers were not traceable. When the court asked the prosecution to reconstruct the case papers, it expressed helplessness even in photocopying the documents, saying that with the passage of more than four decades, all documents had gone missing. Moreover, the special prosecutor in the case had also passed away in 2020. The case received its final blow when the department informed the court that none of the officers involved in the case could be contacted and their whereabouts were unknown. This situation led to the two accused, Niranjan Teckchandani and Rasiklal Thakkar, who are senior citizens now, to request the court that they now have age-related physical infirmities. “They have faced the ordeal of the trial for quite a long time, and the prosecution also does not appear to be in a condition to place any evidence. The case against them should be dismissed,” their advocate argued. Additional sessions judge, M A Bhatti, narrated in his order how it was impossible to try the accused persons in the absence of case papers, complainant, witnesses and even some of the accused, and there was no evidence to base conviction in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/45-yr-old-smuggling-case-falls-apart-in-court/articleshow/88461734.cms||Saeed Khan

This makes the deal the largest ever buyout in India’s fund industry. It also marks a rare instance of a foreign financial major buying an Indian fund manager. As of September-end, total assets managed by L&T MF were a little over Rs 80,300 crore, while HSBC was managing about Rs 11,300 crore, AMFI data showed. For HSBC, the blended cost of acquisition of L&T MF was about 4% of the total assets, which industry players feel is a good price for the acquirer. In recent years, several global financial majors have sold their MF business in India to a local entity, including Principal Financial Group, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. In recent years, US financial major Invesco’s buyout of Religare MF in 2018 was the only exception to this predominant trend in the domestic fund industry. Additionally, according to the contours of the latest deal, HSBC will be buying the entire fund house and not just the schemes and the AMC licence — a trend seen in several of the recent acquisitions. Speaking to TOI, HSBC India CEO Hitendra Dave said that this acquisition underscored the British financial services major’s commitment to double down on its focus to grow its India business. “We will continue to play to our strengths and favourably grow our wealth management business in India,” Dave said. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, will be another milestone as HSBC delivers on its strategy of becoming a leading wealth manager in Asia, a release from the UK financial services major said. “Strengthening HSBC’s asset management business in India will add to its ability to serve the wealth needs of its customers in the country as well as those of its growing non-resident Indian customer base across the world,” it said. Recently, HSBC said it was acquiring French financial major AXA’a Singapore arm. Interestingly, exactly a decade ago, L&T MF had bought the Indian fund management business of Fidelity. Since then, it had grown its asset base organically. In the last 10 years, several of the global financial services majors have sold their local fund house to Indian entities. In 2013, HDFC MF had bought Morgan Stanley’s MF business in India and SBI MF bought Daiwa’s India MF arm. Then in 2014, Kotak MF bought PineBridge MF, while Aditya Birla MF bought ING MF in India. In 2015, Reliance MF bought Goldman Sach’s India MF arm and Prameriac MF bought Deutsche MF India. In 2016, Edelweiss MF bought JP Morgan MF’s India arm, while earlier this year Sundaram MF bought out Principal Financial Group’s India fund management arm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hsbc-to-buy-lt-mf-rs-3-2k-cr-deal-largest-in-fund-industry/articleshow/88462651.cms||---
---||Business||A/c not KYC-compliant? Banks, fin cos will freeze it from Jan 1||MUMBAI: Many customers of banks and other financial services who have not updated their identity and address proof documents might find their accounts frozen in the new year. The reason: On December 31, 2021, the Reserve Bank of India’s freeze on action by banks against customers who have not complied with know your customer (KYC) norms will come to an end. At any given point, there are hundreds of customers whose KYC validity expires. However, there could be a bunching-up of action as the RBI had asked banks not to insist on KYC in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic. The requirement of updating KYC norms is not just for banks but every regulated financial entity as it is part of anti-money laundering laws. This includes finance companies, mutual funds, broking houses and depositories. Bankers said that for customers in low-risk accounts, KYC needs to be updated once every 10 years. However, those classified as high-risk will need to update their account once every two years. Besides this, dormant and inactive accounts also require fresh KYC updates to unfreeze or reactivate the accounts. Although for most customers the requirement is to update only once in 10 years, bankers say that more frequent updates are required because in some cases the documents submitted might not be part of the list of official valid documents. Also, where customers have changed the account and the communication returned to the bank, the KYC would have to be done afresh. In a circular to all banks on May 2021, the RBI had said, “Keeping in view the current Covid-related restrictions in various parts of the country, regulated entities are advised that in respect of the customer accounts where periodic updating of KYC is due and pending as on date, no restrictions on operations of such account shall be imposed till December 31, 2021, for this reason alone, unless warranted under instructions of any regulator/ enforcement agency/court of law.” While there are a number of options now for regulated entities to comply with KYC norms (video KYC, sharing of documents via DigiLocker), many have still not complied. Another problem is that given the number of phishing attacks that are taking place using the KYC as a bait, customers have turned wary of these messages or calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/a/c-not-kyc-compliant-banks-fin-cos-will-freeze-it-from-jan-1/articleshow/88462661.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||Banks roll over Financial Year 2022 AT-1 bonds||MUMBAI: Public sector banks have managed to successfully roll over their AT-1 (additional tier-1) bonds that were due for call option in FY22. These bonds had received a bad publicity last year after the Yes Bank failure resulted in Rs 8,415-crore AT-1 bonds being written down to zero and investors in them getting a worse deal than equity investors. The write-off also resulted in Sebi revising the norms for investments by debt mutual funds in these quasi-equity instruments issued by banks. The circular also revised the norms for the valuation of perpetual bonds issued by various classes of issuers (banks, NBFCs and corporates). According to a report by ratings agency ICRA, as mutual funds were a large investor segment in these bonds, these changes were expected to impact the demand for these instruments issued by the banks. According to ICRA’s estimates, Rs 20,505 crore of AT-I bonds of PSBs and Rs 7,925-crore bonds of private banks are due for the exercise of a call option (after five years from issuance) in FY22 with a majority of Rs 19,750 crore in H2 FY22. ICRA attributes the success of the issuance to the relatively better return these bonds offered. Interest rates on debt have crashed after the RBI eased liquidity conditions in the wake of the pandemic. However, all PSBs that had bonds coming up for repayment managed to collectively raise Rs 24,471 crore through the issue of fresh AT-1 bonds effectively rolling over their borrowing. In the private sector, two banks (Axis and HDFC Bank) raised Rs 12,371 crore. As compared to this, private banks had raised Rs 7,925 crore through AT-1 bonds in FY21. “Given the impact of the pandemic and the perceived weakness in the financials of PSBs compared to their private counterparts, the large upcoming rollovers and the revised regulations were expected to pose challenges. However, all PSBs have largely raised fresh AT-I bonds nearly equivalent to the call options due in FY22, which is likely to preserve their capital ratios,” ICRA said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-roll-over-fy22-at-1-bonds/articleshow/88462664.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar checks readiness of oxygen plants||PATNA: Ahead of the Omicron threat looming over the country, the state conducted a mock drill of all pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants in Bihar on Thursday to ensure their functionality and readiness to provide oxygen in the event of an emergency. The state can now produce over 490 metric tonnes of oxygen per day through a variety of techniques. Sanjay Kumar Singh, the executive director of the State Health Society, issued instructions regarding the mock drill in response to a directive from the Centre. He stated that nodal officers were instructed to run the PSA plants for six hours and monitor everything minutely, including pressure, pipe leaks, and any issues with oxygen delivery to the bed. The details of the mock drill will be submitted on Friday due to the large number of columns that needed to be filled, but officials have stated that they do not anticipate any major problems. During the earlier testing, 118 of the 125 PSA were functional, and 111 were able to take the oxygen up to the bed without a hitch. In response to a question about Bihar’s oxygen-generating capacity, Singh stated, “According to a calculation conducted on December 6, the state’s oxygen-generating capacity was 489 metric tonnes per day. During the peak of the second wave, 377 metric tonnes were required. Now, if we add 30% to that, we will require 490 metric tonnes. We added two more PSAs following the December 6 calculation, and it is certain that we have now exceeded 490 metric tonne capacity.” Singh added that 62 of the PSA plants were established under the PM CARES Fund, 10 by public sector units under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, and the remaining 55 were set up by the state government and other organisations, including a couple by individuals. Apart from the PSA plants, the state maintains 13 cryogenic tanks and over 6,000 oxygen concentrators to meet the state’s oxygen requirements. People also use oxygen cylinders purchased from the market. There are only a few air separation units in the state, which remove nitrogen from the air while leaving oxygen in it. Nine more test Cov +ve: The state reported nine new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, out of 1,58,222 samples tested. In the same time period, 13 people recovered from Covid and the number of active cases decreased to 82. Patna had four new cases, followed by Aurangabad, Darbhanga, Sheikhpura, Siwan, and Gaya. The total now stands at 7,26,405, but 7,14,228 have recovered and 12,094 have died as a result of Covid-19 in the state. Meanwhile, over 3.51 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered on Thursday, bringing the state’s total to over 9.54 crore doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-checks-readiness-of-oxygen-plants/articleshow/88460205.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Patna||Children should be vaccinated against Covid-19: Bihar health experts||PATNA: With the rising cases of Omicron infections in the country, demand for booster shots and vaccination of the children below 18 years of age are picking up. Health experts of the state are also advocating the need of administering booster doses for the people already vaccinated with two doses. They also plead for vaccination of children to ensure their protection against the new variant. Doctors assert that booster doses are becoming necessary as Omicron has the ability to get around the existing immunity, whether from vaccination or infection. However, this ability is likely to be weakened when people are vaccinated with a third vaccine dose. Many countries like USA, UK, Spain, Russia, Germany and Australia are rolling out booster shots of the Covid-19 vaccine in view of the Omicron threat and hence, it is high time India should also start vaccinating people, especially the senior citizens with booster doses, they add. All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Sanjeev Kumar said the efficacy of the vaccine starts weakening after six months of the second dose, hence, the third booster dose will definitely provide greater protection against any new variant of the Covid-19. “A discussion regarding this is already going on,” he said. According to the Indian Medical Association state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar, the frontline warriors like doctors, nurses, community health workers, sanitation workers and police must be administered booster doses on priority basis. He pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on the last Independence Day that booster doses would be started but it is yet to get the green signal from the Indian Council of Medical Research. Paediatrician Dr Vivekanand told this newspaper that booster dose for adults, particularly senior citizens, is necessary but to get children vaccinated is even more necessary. “Though flu vaccine does provide protection against some strains of virus to the children, Omicron is not to be compromised with this vaccine. Moreover, children are going to schools, playing outside and hardly following Covid-protocol. If they get vaccinated, the severity of infection will be minimized,” Vivekanand said. Retired civil surgeon Dr Kumkum Prasad observed that even before the arrival of Omicron, it was becoming clear that boosters were needed. Recent findings indicated that vaccine protection starts declining after 90 days. Yet, vaccination remains the best defence to handle any new surge of coronavirus cases. “Vaccination of all remaining unvaccinated at-risk people and consideration of a booster dose for those 40 years of age and over must be given a priority in the fight against Covid-19 during the current pandemic,” Prasad said. However, orthopaedic surgeon Dr Uday Krishna Jha said in a country like India with such a huge population, it is very difficult to administer the booster dose of vaccine to all. “More than 50% of the country’s population are yet to be vaccinated with the double dose and the vaccination of the people below 18 years of age has not started so far. In such circumstances, how can one think of launching booster doses for the people,” Jha said, adding that the best way would be to convince the people to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/experts-children-should-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19/articleshow/88460182.cms||B K Mishra

According to district health officials, while 72.1% of approximately 20 lakh eligible people in Bhojpur district have been vaccinated to date, the figure actually rises to 80% when residents of Bhojpur who received the jab outside the district are included. Bhojpur’s civil surgeon, Dr L P Jha, told this newspaper on Thursday, “There has been a remarkable increase in awareness about getting inoculated against Covid-19 among both rural and urban residents in our district, with 72.1% of approximately 20 lakh eligible people having gotten vaccinated thus far. We are actively involved in raising public awareness.” Dr Sanjay Kumar Sinha, the district immunization officer in Bhojpur, said, “The most encouraging aspect is the rapid decline in vaccine hesitancy in the Bhojpur district’s hinterland areas and among the underprivileged section of society. We visited such an area in Shahpur of Bhojpur district on Wednesday and raised awareness among the poor. To our delight, 27 individuals immediately agreed to be vaccinated and received their first shot on the spot. Some people are also being enticed by the Bihar government’s recent scheme of randomly selecting vaccinated individuals and rewarding them with attractive prizes and gifts.” Dr K N Sinha, the district’s additional chief medical officer, said, “We hold regular meetings and discuss various measures, including awareness campaigns, to expedite vaccination in our district.” According to official figures, 23.87 lakh people in the district have been vaccinated against Covid as of Thursday. While 14.40 lakh people have received their first dose, 9.47 lakh have received their second dose. As many as 11.94 lakh men and 11.93 lakh females received the vaccine. The total number of third gender individuals who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 is 552.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vax-drive-picks-up-pace-in-bhojpur/articleshow/88460253.cms||---

It was alleged that the attendants of the newborn began assaulting the doctors present in the outpatient department (OPD) around 12.30pm. PMCH principal Dr V P Choudhary said the two doctors received head injuries and were rushed the central emergency unit of the hospital for treatment. “Their condition is stable now,” he added. Dr Choudhary said the attendants hurled abuses and attacked the doctors on duty. “The incident sparked tension at the hospital. However, we succeeded in calming down the doctors, staff and all the attendants,” he added. The unit head of the PMCH paediatrics department later lodged a complaint with the police. Dr Kundan Suman, president of Junior Doctors Association (JDA)-Bihar, said the attendants of the newborn reached the OPD and created ruckus alleging lack of proper facilities at the hospital. “Attendants of other patients came out in support of the doctors and counterattacked the troublemakers. It created a noisy scene at the hospital,” he added. Dr Suman said the JDA has urged the PMCH administration to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in future. “We want stern action against those involved in the attack,” he added. Condemning the incident, Dr Ajay Kumar, acting president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Bihar, said it was unfortunate that the doctors said the police should take strong action against those involved in attacking the junior doctors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-pmch-junior-docs-hurt-in-attack-by-attendants-of-newborn/articleshow/88460265.cms||VK Tripathi

Nitish also asked the officials concerned to review the existing capacities of prosecutors and take suitable steps to enhance their capacity to make the prosecution work in a more efficient and effective way. He told the officials to complete the process to constitute nine other special courts for expeditious disposal of the cases regarding atrocities committed on the persons belonging to the SC and ST sections. The CM issued these directions at the meeting of the state-level vigilance and monitoring committee (SLVMC) constituted for assessing the activities meant for the prevention and eradication of atrocities on the SC and ST sections, besides the payment of compensation to the victims and steps taken for their rehabilitation. The meeting was held at the Samvad auditorium of the CM secretariat. Nitish asked the DGP to hold a review meeting with the SPs concerned at least once a month on the matters related to the investigation of the pending cases and take steps for early completion of investigation and expeditious disposal of the cases. He said special efforts should be made to increase the conviction rate through speedy trial at the special court. The CM said DMs and SPs should also review the status of pending cases at the district level vigilance and monitoring committee meetings. “The victims should be paid compensation and relief on time. The DMs and SPs should entertain suggestions from the elected representatives at such meetings,” he said. Among those who also participated in the meeting were former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, SC and ST welfare minister Santosh Kumar Suman, PHED minister Ramprit Paswan, excise and prohibition minister Sunil Kumar and assembly deputy Speaker Maheshwar Hazari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-asks-officials-to-expedite-disposal-of-sc/st-atrocity-cases/articleshow/88460277.cms||Abhay Singh

The master plan will seek to improve infrastructure of the cities to meet the future requirements of the residents as well as to address the gaps in the existing infrastructure. This will facilitate strengthening the of the cities’ existing facilities. The department has initiated the bidding process to select three consultancy firms for three different groups of cities by January next year. The work on preparing master plan of the selected cities will begin from February and complete in next six to nine months depending on the size of the urban area. According to sources, the proposed master plan will be prepared to cater to the developmental requirements of corporation areas for another 20 years. It will improve tax collection and prevent revenue leakages. The selected consultancy firms will conduct the socio-economic assessment of the cities. A UDHD official said the survey would cover demographic details, household categories, population report, education status, land holdings and cropping patterns, topography, climate, natural resources, demography, urban-rural trend, employment, economic aspects, traffic and transportation, water supply, sanitation, health, recreational facilities and other civic amenities. “It will provide detailed information on existing status and developmental strategies required in each sector to ensure better amenities to people in the urban areas,” the official added. The GIS-based master plan for Patna was prepared in the first phase. The development plan for four cities – Chhapra, Rajgir, Begusarai and Biharsharif – is at the final stage. Work has recently started in 11 other cities – Buxar, Kishanganj, Katihar, Sasaram, Dehri, Motihari, Aurangabad, Hajipur, Siwan, Bettiah and Bagaha – under the Centre’s Amrut project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gis-based-master-plan-for-9-more-cities-to-be-made-soon/articleshow/88460441.cms||Faryal Rumi

The R-Day parade offers an opportunity to the states to put their art and culture on display through tableaux. According to an official of the state information and public relations department, the tableau will highlight how Bihar has followed Gandhi’s ideologies on prohibition, eradication of child marriage, dowry and women empowerment. “The state government under the leadership of chief minister Nitish Kumar has implemented several policies which are based on Gandhi’s teachings, ideology and philosophy. Liquor has been banned in the state and a crusade started against social evils like dowry and child marriage,” the official told this reporter. The ‘Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali’, a multi-stakeholder programme for climate sustenance, conservation and rejuvenation of water bodies, is also based on Gandhi’s thought (Earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s needs, but not every man’s greed). “Work on the tableau will begin as soon as the state gets the Centre’s nod,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-proposes-to-prepare-a-tableau-reflecting-gandhis-ideas-teachings/articleshow/88460421.cms||Faryal Rumi

The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is looking to take up the project under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP). The VMC had proposed the riverfront project around 13 years ago. But it has seen little development so far. Even the idea of taking up the project with NRCP was conceived five years ago. In 2018, the state government had even sought an undertaking from the VMC that if the project was taken up under NRCP, the civic body will pay its share. Under NRCP, 60% of the project cost is provided by the centre, 10% by the state government while the remaining 30% has to be borne by the local body. A proposal put up before the standing committee of the VMC has revealed that the state government had last month asked VMC to prepare a proposal for NRCP. The proposal will have to be routed through the state urban development department. The present proposal will cover the stretch from Vadodara to Asoj and ensure that sewage does not enter the river. This itself will cost around Rs 551crore. The idea of a riverfront has also been abandoned by VMC after it was challenged in the National Green Tribunal. It was then decided to prioritise the rejuvenation of the river. Not only the nature of work to be done along the Vishwamitri, but the nomenclature of the project too has changed from time to time. From Vishwamitri Riverfront Project, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation changed the name of the project to Vishwamitri River Revival Project. The name of the special purpose vehicle formed to handle the project was also changed from the Vishwamitri Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd to the Vishwamitri River Revival Corporation Ltd. Off late, the project is being referred to as only the Vishwamitri project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vmc-proposes-sewage-free-vishwamitri-river-project/articleshow/88460791.cms||---

With more restrictions imposed by various states, and a likely reduction in international participation amid rise in Covid-19 cases, demand for hotel rooms has nosedived for the January 9-13 period. Narendra Somani, president of the Gujarat chapter of the Hotels and Restaurants’ Association (HRA), said, “Bookings and inquiries started bullish and the average daily rate (ADR) was pegged at around Rs 20,000 per room per night for five-star hotels. However, with the growing uncertainty over Omicron and more restrictions imposed not by various countries and states in India, participation in the summit is expected to go down and this is reflecting in inquiries and bookings.” “Only five or six five-star and luxury hotels are seeing some bookings and traction, while business for the rest has remained lukewarm with few to no bookings,” Somani added. Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar have inventory of at least 5,700 hotel rooms combined according to industry estimates. With fewer bookings, rooms at many hotels are expected to remain vacant, while in past years they used to be completely sold out during Vibrant summits. Jay Sudhakaran, general manager of Novotel Ahmedabad, said, “Bookings are lukewarm especially with a lot of countries and companies from abroad withdrawing. Several companies may send only India representatives, due to which overall participation may remain low. January however, looks promising because business will pour in due to a pharma conference, weddings and a few other corporate events.” Hotels will almost certainly surely see less revenue generated this summit, hoteliers’ estimates say. With most properties remaining vacant, the average daily rate (ADR) has plunged to the range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 per room per night from the projected Rs 20,000 initially. Hoteliers also say that some embassies which had inquired about rooms have put their bookings on hold due to fresh concerns over Omicron.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hotel-bookings-muted-for-vggs-dates/articleshow/88461438.cms||Niyati Parikh

The city’s largest mall is even contemplating entry to only fully vaccinated adults and conducted a trial on Thursday. Nearly all malls have deployed additional manpower to ensure customers are masked and maintain distance. Some mall managers conceded some customers wear masks while entering but turn casual thereafter and allow masks to slip off their noses. “We have put in additional security personnel to increase vigilance and ensure compliance. We will also enforce 70% occupancy in the food court. We are discussing with retailers about entry being restricted to fully vaccinated adults,” said South City mall VP Manmohan Bagree, who is expecting footfall of over 1 lakh a day over the two weekends. The mall’s restaurants, food courts and cinemas will be open till 2am till January 1. Multiplexes at City Centre I and II will be open till 2.30am. “We are bullish about ending the year with a bang but cautious about Omicron at the same time because we cannot afford another closure. We have deployed 20 additional security personnel during this period and asked them to be polite but firm if people are found without masks in the non-dining areas,” said Ambuja Neotia, whole-time director Ramesh Pandey. The projected footfall at City Centre I is 60,000 and at City Centre II it is 45,000. Quest will be open till 2am on weekends and 1am during the weekdays. “All our Covid protocols are in place. We haven’t let our guard down. Customers are also adhering to the regulations,” said Quest mall VP Sanjeev Mehra, who expects 30,000-35,000 people a day during the weekends.

The agreement happened on December 22. Insolvency proceedings in AWUKO had selected CUMI as the successful bidder in a competitive bidding process. The assets of AWUKO include land and buildings, plant and machinery, fixed assets, leased assets, brands and trademarks, patents, technical know-how and other intangible assets but excludes cash and receivables. “The asset purchase deal will be subject to completion of negotiations with the Works Council in connection with rightsizing of employees as well as agreements with the lessors/creditors of AWUKO,” the company said in a statement. The estimated purchase price is 6.01 million excluding the compensation cost to be agreed with the Works council and other costs. N Ananthaseshan, MD, CUMI said, “Acquiring the assets of AWUKO fits in well with CUMI’s expansion plans in Europe. CUMI will gain access to the Coated Abrasives capacity of 10 million square meters, global distribution base and an experienced process and application engineering team. Significant cross learning is possible as CUMI also operates two coated abrasive makers in India. Further, CUMI will be able to provide critical raw materials to AWUKO from its operations in India and Russia.” Sridharan Rangarajan, director finance and strategy of CUMI said, “AWUKO is a 120-year-old leading brand in the coated abrasives business.

---||Lucknow||UP: Unvaccinated elderly at risk of critical illness||LUCKNOW: Comorbidity, low immunity, and proportionately lower vaccination rate among the elderly has put people aged 60 years or above at higher risk of contracting Covid-19 from Omicron variant, experts warn. They added though that panic is not the answer and such people should strictly follow all Covid protocols in letter and spirit and get vaccinated at the earliest. Prof Kausar Usman, faculty in the medicine department at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), who is also an expert of geriatric medicine, said, “Comorbidities and low immunity make the elderly prone to infection. Initial reports are suggesting that Omicron causes myalgia (muscle pain), fatigue, fever, sore throat and cough in most patients. Since the elderly have low immunity and conditions like diabetes, high or low blood pressure and heart and lung issues, this variant could harm them more, especially if they have not been vaccinated.” The concern rises when one looks at vaccination data of Lucknow. Of the 4.6 lakh elderly people in the district, only 2.7 lakh have completed the two-dose vaccination course and 1.3 lakh have taken a single shot. The remaining 75,000 people have not taken any dose. This means that nearly 2 lakh people aged 60 years or above are at risk. Former head of microbiology department at IMS BHU Prof Anil Kumar Gulati said, “Reports emerging from South Africa and World Health Organisation suggest that this variant spreads more quickly in comparison to Delta variant and it has a greater risk of reinfection among those who have acquired immunity through natural infection. Besides, it is still unknown how it behaves against vaccine- generated immunity. Therefore, it must be taken seriously as it might have potential to cause serious sickness especially in the unvaccinated elderly population. The government should start a door-to-door vaccination drive for the elderly.” Medical superintendent of KGMU Prof D Himanshu said, “The elderly are always a high-risk group for any viral infection but with higher transmissibility of Omicron, they should take utmost precautions.” Epidemiologist and secretary of Provincial Medical Services Association Dr Amit Singh said, “We are witnessing huge gatherings at public places, markets and malls. People have become complacent after the second wave. They should not underestimate Omicron.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/unvaxxed-elderly-at-risk-of-critical-illness/articleshow/88462717.cms||---

From about 59 per cent in 2017, contribution through SIPs has now increased to 64 per cent, a survey by ETMoney showed. “SIP inflows are coming from across the country and one state each from all the four corners finds a place in the top five states with the highest SIP contribution. Maharashtra at 20.6 per cent, Uttar Pradesh at 11.2 per cent, Delhi at 9 per cent, West Bengal at 8.1 per cent and Karnataka at 5.7 per cent currently lead the pack as states with the highest SIP inflows,” the survey results by ETMoney showed. ETMoney is a leading app for financial services in India. The share of money being invested via SIPs is also going up every year in different income groups, the survey showed. This indicates that people are trusting SIPs even more and continue to hike their contribution to it each year with an increase in their income. In the Rs 5-10 lakh income group, the share of SIPs is over 6 per cent in 2021, it said. The survey also points towards improvement in investment habits. Over 70 per cent of investors are now not stopping their SIPs for at least a year. This number has been growing continuously from 49 per cent in 2017 to 56 per cent in 2018 to 61 per cent in 2019 and 68 per cent in 2020, the ETMoney survey showed. “The report also indicates a constant rise in the SIPs started by investors in the 30 and above age group,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/64-sips-from-smaller-cities-etmoney-study/articleshow/88462678.cms||---

A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting of the representatives from the party’s UP unit held in New Delhi on Wednesday. UP LJP (RV) president Mani Shankar Pandey, state office-bearers and district presidents of the party attended the meeting in presence of Chirag. Party’s spokesman Chandan Singh said the decision to contest all the 403 assembly seats in UP was taken as the party had a strong organizational structure in the state and it had won six assembly seats in the 2012 election. While the JD(U) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi have already set their eyes on contesting the UP assembly elections either as partner of the NDA or alone, Chirag-led outfit has become the third such party that may impact the poll equation in eastern-UP districts bordering Bihar in the best-case scenario.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-faction-of-ljp-to-contest-up-election/articleshow/88460353.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Kolkata||Kolkata restaurants, bars tighten Covid vigil as footfall spikes ahead of festive week||KOLKATA: With footfalls rising sharply even before Christmas, the Hotel and Restaurants’ Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) has asked its member restaurants to prevent crowding on and around their premises and ensure safe distance between tables. It is also considering a proposal from the National Restaurants’ Association of India (NRAI) to allow customers after they have produced a vaccination certificate, which can be downloaded using a QR code provided by the restaurant. Following a prod from Kolkata Police, restaurants and bars have chalked out a series of measures, including adhering strictly to the 70% cap on occupancy, during the festive week. The HRAEI has also asked restaurants to allow only their fully vaccinated staff to serve and not allow patrons without masks. “Now that we have Omicron patients in the city, we have asked all restaurants to step up their screening and not compromise on social distancing. Only those who have received both vaccine doses will be allowed to serve and 30% of the tables must be kept vacant, as per the government order. If the government makes it a rule to allow only vaccinated customers, we are ready to follow it,” said HRAEI president Sudesh Poddar. “We have received a proposal from NRAI on a QR code to download a vaccination certificate for entry. It could be difficult to implement this rule since crowds are large at this time of the year. But if the government makes it mandatory, we will do it,” said a restaurant owner. Mocambo and Peter Cat have made face shields and gloves mandatory for staff. “We have stepped up sanitization at the tables and the kitchen. That apart, use of sanitizers and temperature checks at the entry points have been made more stringent. We have put up glass partitions between tables,” said owner Nitin Kothari. Chapter 2 will organize a live carol show outside the restaurant on Christmas. “But we will make sure a crowd doesn’t build up on the pavement.

On Thursday, Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti suspended an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), two chowkidars, and attached the SHO of Nauhatta police station to the police lines for allegedly threatening a woman to pay a bribe or her husband would be implicated in a false case. The SP confirmed Thursday’s action against the cops. According to sources, an audio recording of a chowkidar and the SHO pleading with a woman to pay them a bribe of Rs 50,000 went viral. Dehri-on-Sone’s SP conducted an investigation and determined that the accusation was true. As a result of SHO Sanjay Kumar Verma’s failure to exercise control over his subordinates, the SP suspended ASI Dinesh Prasad and two chowkidars, Satendra Pasawan and Sanjay Ram. The sources also claimed that following the discovery of liquor in a forest area under the jurisdiction of the Nauhatta police station area on December 18, chowkidar Satendra Pasawan called one Kusum Chaudhary and inquired about her husband Ravi Chadhary, who was sentenced to prison in 2018 for a liquor case. When she stated that her husband had gone to the market to get vegetables, she was told that she needed to arrange Rs 50,000 immediately or her husband would be charged with liquor recovery. “The chowkidar and the ASI threatened that the recovery would be displayed at their home because no FIR had been filed in the case. She was requested to respond immediately as the station diary was still waiting. The chowkidar disconnected the phone call after detecting foul play,” the sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-suspended-cop-attached-to-police-lines-on-graft-charges/articleshow/88460363.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Patna||Patna: Move to raise marriage age of women welcomed||PATNA: Young girls and women in the city have welcomed The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 that has been introduced by the Centre in Parliament to raise the age of legal marriage for women from 18 to 21 years. The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday by Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani. It was sent to a parliamentary standing committee for further discussion. The decision comes more than a year after PM Narendra Modi announced the plan during his Independence Day speech in 2020. The approval is based on recommendations submitted to NITI Aayog in December 2020 by the Centre’s task force led by Jaya Jaitly, which was tasked with looking into “matters pertaining to the age of motherhood, imperatives of lowering maternal mortality rate (MMR), improvement of nutritional levels and related issues”. Welcoming the move, Medha Verma, a resident of Boring Canal Road, said, “Apart from health benefits, including reducing MMR, the new law will also break several gender stereotypes associated with women. When we talk about gender equality, why should there be a difference of three years in marriage age between girls and boys? The new law will also reduce the societal pressure on parents for getting their daughters married at the age when they should be more concerned about their studies and career.” Echoing similar views, Rakshanda Ahmad, a city student, said, “This law will go a long way in reducing MMR and improving nutrition level. It will also give young girls a chance to be financially independent. Young girls, who are forced by their parents to marry at an early age, will now be able to continue their studies. A mature mindset acts as a backbone of a healthy family.” Pooja Kumari, a civil services aspirant, said, “The Bill, if passed, will break orthodox mindset related to marriage of girls. It is a pioneering move towards safeguarding the health of young girls. Also, the Covid-19 pandemic has increased gap in women education. Several child marriage cases are also being reported. The Centre’s move will break societal misconceptions about early marriage and will impact health and education of women in a positive way.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/move-to-raise-marriage-age-of-women-welcomed/articleshow/88460425.cms||---

Work on this project is going on in full swing under the supervision of railway experts with a view to completing the major portion of the project in the current fiscal. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, railways is carrying out track-doubling work on Muzaffarpur-Sugauli route, a stretch of 101km at an estimated cost of Rs 1186 crore, while Sugauli – Valmikinagar route, a stretch of 110 km, is being completed at an estimated cost of Rs 1,216 crore. Thus the total distance is 121 km which is close to Nepal, the railway official added. “Railways will complete the Sugauli–Valmikinagar route in seven phases. While the 8km-long distance of track doubling work between Chamua and Harinagar will be completed in the current fiscal 2021-22, the 11 km stretch between Sathi and Narkatiaganj and 12 km stretch between Sugauli and Majhauli are also being expedited to complete them in the current fiscal,” the CPRO said adding, “The rest four phases will be completed within the stipulated deadline of 2022-23 fiscal.” As the entire stretch of 121 km between Muzaffarpur and Valmikinagar is dotted with ditches and culverts, railways has thus completed the construction of maximum number of big and small rail bridges on the route to lay tracks and complete track linking work. Five small bridges have been constructed on Chamua-Harinagar route also. The 11-km long Narkatiaganj–Sathi route is dotted with at least eight bridges. Railways has completed construction of all rail bridges and track linking work on this route. Besides, railways has completed construction of 20 small bridges located on the 12 km long Majhauli-Sugauli route. On the 101 km long Muzaffarpur-Sugauli route, railways has set a deadline to complete the 16 km-long between Mahwal and Chakia in the current 2021-22 fiscal, while construction work on small rail bridges located on the 11 km-long on Mehsi-Pipra, Pipra–Jiwdhara (10 km) and Jiwdhara-Sugauli (7 km) has been completed now, the CPRO said adding completion of the entire project is likely to benefit the people of East and West Champaran districts and Muzaffarpur also. According to the CPRO, the track doubling project on these two routes is likely to incur a total cost of Rs 2,402 crore for railways. “In fact, all ongoing major projects are being strictly monitored by a team of dedicated railway officials under the supervision of ECR GM Anupam Sharma,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rlys-gears-up-to-complete-track-doubling-work-in-north-bihar/articleshow/88460394.cms||Kumod Verma

However, Manjhi has set certain conditions for the guests who will participate in the feast. “Such Brahmins and pandits (priests) who have never consumed liquor and non-veg and indulged themselves in other wrongdoings, including theft, are welcome to my official residence for the feast on December 27 at 12.30pm. They will set an example by attending this feast along with dalits and adivasis,” Manjhi tweeted. Earlier in the day, he had said some priests eat non-veg and consume liquor. “They don’t have adequate knowledge. They just recite ‘Om Namah Shivaya’ or ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ while conducting marriage and ‘shradh’ rituals only to make people fool. The entire pandit community is not like this. I think 10% to 20% of them are genuine,” he said. Meanwhile, a small group of Brahmins gathered outside Manjhi’s official residence here on Thursday and performed Satyanarayan Puja. After this, security in and around his bungalow was beefed up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-manjhi-to-organise-brahmin-bhoj-with-riders/articleshow/88460329.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Venture capital (VC) funding in deep tech enterprises -businesses working on deep science and technology solutions stood at 133 investments worth over $1.4 billion in 2021 (till Dec 15) up from 106 deals worth $556 million in 2020 and 107 deals worth $567 million in 2019, as per data from Venture Intelligence. The average deal size in the segment rose from $5 million in 2020 to around $11 million in 2021, data shows. However, deep tech investments made up only around 4.5% of the total funding pie in 2021 and have hovered around the 4% mark since 2018. Investors and industry watchers say while it is still early for deep tech investing to go mainstream in India, 2021 has seen a sharp rise in deal making and interest from investors with the pandemic’s thrust on digitisation. While it did not enjoy the ‘FOMO’ style of investing seen by e-commerce, fintech or edtech, deep tech entrepreneurs were able to catch investor eye this year, they said. “Deep tech as a sector is gaining momentum globally, and while it is true that it has been on the sidelines so far in India, we are currently seeing increased interest from non-traditional investors who want to explore the space for generating potentially non-linear benefits to their traditional businesses led by technology,” Pratip Mazumdar, partner at Inflexor Ventures, said. The deep tech-focused VC firm is seeing strong interest from large family offices with a wide variety of business backgrounds such as pharma, retail, automotive, etc. Speciale Invest, another VC firm with a focus on investing in deep tech and engineering innovation, sees the year as an optimistic start of things to come. Vishesh Rajaram, co-founder, Speciale, said they regularly introduce their portfolio companies to other investors and response rates on such connections have almost tripled this year. Deep tech ventures need patient capital and large corporations getting into venture investing is a good sign for the segment, he added. Manish Singhal, founder of early-stage deep tech fund pi Ventures, says such innovations do not require the millions that are needed by consumer tech ventures but despite that they saw huge amounts of international investor interest in 2021. “A lot of our portfolio companies raised follow-on rounds this year and we have also done more deals than before,” he said. In segments like agriculture, agritech startups helped keep the entire agri supply chain afloat during the pandemic. Mark Kahn, managing partner, Omnivore says in FY2020-21, the need to enhance farming operations drove investment activity in the farm management software, IoT and other categories, which saw an 8x jump in funding and 2x growth in deal volume. Omnivore participated in three deals in agri deeptech in 2020 and 8 deals in 2021.  However, he added that almost all of the current venture investing in agritech focuses on digital technologies and innovations in agrifood life sciences remains neglected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/deep-tech-startups-attract-more-than-double-investment-in-2021/articleshow/88461856.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Ahmedabad||Vedic maths in Gujarat schools from next year||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat government has decided to introduce Vedic maths in Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) school curriculum from next year. Vedic maths is considered to be an easier and faster way to solve mathematics problems and helps in strengthening the foundation for students, the government said in a notification dated December 23. An ancient Indian method, Vedic maths simplifies mathematics by integrating arithmetic operations into 16 ‘sutras’ or formulae. It will be rolled out in phases, beginning from Class 6 to Class 8 students in the academic year 2022-23, it said. Further, it will be introduced for Class 9 and Class 10 students in 2023-24, as per the notification. While it is mandatory for the 20,000 schools under the Schools of Excellence (SoE) project to implement Vedic maths in a phased manner, other schools under the state board are to consider the local conditions and implement it voluntarily, it said. State education secretary Vinod Rao said the decision has been taken keeping in view a large number of students who fail in Class 10 mathematics exams. “Vedic maths will be covered in the mathematics textbook beginning from Class 6 to Class 8 students. Many students fail in mathematics and this decision will make the subject more engaging and fun for children to learn and study,” said Rao. About 3.10 lakh regular students failed in Class 10 board exams held in March 2020. Education Minister Jitu Vaghani said in a social media post that the decision was taken on Wednesday on the birth anniversary of renowned Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. “Vedic maths will improve the students’ command of the subject and also make it easier to understand,” he further said. Kalpesh Akhani, who teaches maths in Radhanpur and has written eight books on recreational maths, said he and other experts have since long asked the state to introduce Vedic maths in schools. “Students can calculate faster and it becomes easier to solve arithmetic problems. Also, it can engage students who otherwise are not very interested in the subject,” said Akhani, who is also an executive member of Gujarat Ganit Mandal. Vedic maths cuts the time needed for solving complex problems by reducing the number of steps involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vedic-maths-in-gujarat-schools-from-next-year/articleshow/88461461.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Tree cutting continues at Himayat Bagh||AURANGABAD: Himayat Bagh, the Mughal-era garden, continues to suffer due to official apathy. A spot visit to the garden revealed that trees had been axed at three spots. Also, a large branch of an old tree had been chopped off. The site does not have a single security guard and has become a den for addicts. It is also frequented by cattle grazers, who too cause nuisance. Honorary wildlife warden Kishor Pathak said an agitation would be launched if the authorities fail to provide security at Himayat Bagh. “It is outrageous. The authorities have failed to take action despite indiscriminate tree-cutting. We are planning to knock on the doors of the judiciary as well,” he said. Morning and evening walkers blamed cattle grazers for cutting some trees. “They carry axes and cut trees to feed cattle and goats. When accosted, they warn people of dire consequences,” said Yogesh Dharashiwkar. Regular visitors also narrated incidents of dogs accompanying the cattle grazers killing peacocks. “Several spots are littered with liquor bottles and plastic waste. Even Shakkar bawadi, the water body in the garden, is littered with waste,” Pathak said. M B Patil, the in-charge of Himayat Bagh, did not respond to calls. Dhiraj Kadam, registrar Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, said the process to appoint guards at Himayat Bagh was on. “The local authorities will be alerted to ensure proper vigil at the garden till guards are appointed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tree-cutting-continues-at-himayat-bagh/articleshow/88459658.cms||---

The garbage dumping ground in Dadumajra and the neighbouring malfunctioning waste processing plant in Sector 25 remained hot topics in the municipal corporation election campaign this time too. These issues have been dragged for the past over 15 years, since the planning stage of the plant at site. The rising trash mountains at the dump and the flawed plant are often the favoured grounds for political mudslinging, but neither the municipal corporation nor the Chandigarh administration has been able to ensure an effective solid waste management in the past over one-and-a-half decade. With measures and proposals largely remaining on paper, the improper functioning of the plant and the related issues had even reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Subsequently, the MC took over the plant from Jaypee company on June 19, 2020. While both the Congress and the BJP ruled the MC in these years, there was hardly any political will to thrash out a solution despite the many promises. And thus, the unsolved issue let political parties kick up a stink every election, whether civic or parliamentary. The residents of Dadumajra and nearby areas of the city are the main sufferers, but during windy weather, people living in other parts also face the stink. With the plant not able to process complete waste generated from the city, at the later stage tussle began between the MC and Jaypee company over the issue of tipping fee. Since this issue could not be settled, as MC denied giving tipping fee and the company remained adamant, the matter, along with some other issues, reached the NGT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parties-come-and-go-but-the-stink-lives-on/articleshow/88461444.cms||Deepak Yadav

Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of AHNA, said hospitals have been asked to screen all patients rigorously along with visitors, to find out if any have Covid symptoms. “The common symptoms of the Omicron variant observed so far in India and abroad will soon be circulated,” he said, adding that a declaration will also be taken from all patients and relatives at hospitals. AHNA officials said that keeping in mind the risk from those with a history of international travel, all patients with a history of travel outside India in the past fortnight must produce negative RT-PCR reports conducted in the last 24 hours. Entry will be restricted for those with no report. “The vaccination status of all patients – both IPD and OPD – will be recorded. Those who have not taken second doses will be encouraged to do so before admission. Efforts will also be made to vaccinate patients and relatives right at the hospital if they haven’t taken both doses,” said Dr Gadhvi, adding that they have decided to restrict the number of relatives with patients. AHNA also requested the state government to implement Covid protocols more stringently, including screening at entry points, requiring of Covid vaccine certificate for travel and negative RT-PCR reports for international passengers. The doctors also appealed to citizens to adhere to Covid safety protocols including wearing masks, avoid gatherings and maintaining social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahna-lays-down-omicron-protocol/articleshow/88461463.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Random test for flyers from states where Covid-19 numbers are high||NEW DELHI: Domestic travellers flying into Delhi from the states reporting high Covid cases will now be randomly tested at the IGI airport, but they will be allowed to leave after giving sample. The passengers who subsequently test positive will need to quarantine at home or a dedicated Covid centre for 10 days. These are among the heightened surveillance steps that will be taken at Indira Gandhi International Airport in the wake of the Omicron surge, according to a Union aviation ministry tweet on Thursday. The surge in cases may also bring back suspension of serving/selling in-flight meals and beverages by the airlines. “Thermal screening will be done for all passengers upon arrival. If you are travelling on a connecting flight and not leaving the airport in the transit station, please refer to the detailed guidelines of the respective final-destination arrival state. All passengers must download Aarogya Setu app,” the ministry tweeted in the state-wise regulations for Delhi. Clarity is still awaited on who will conduct this test and whether selected passengers will need to pay for the same. Airport sources say they are trying to get the logistical details for the new measure. The 2% international arrivals from “non at-risk” countries who are randomly selected for RT-PCR tests are not required to pay for the same and the cost is borne by the airport operator. Meanwhile, airline officials say the domestic air traffic has recovered to an extent after a “very bad” Omicron impact in the first two weeks of December following the news of the new variant of novel coronavirus breaking out in November-end. “Forward bookings to travel beyond 15 days have dropped by about 10% after the new variant’s scare. Fewer people are booking in advance due to the uncertainty,” an airline official said. Seasonally, the winter holiday travel rush subsides from around mid-January. The travel and booking trajectory beyond that will depend on the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/random-test-for-flyers-from-states-where-covid-19-numbers-are-high/articleshow/88462736.cms||Saurabh Sinha
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No bail for aide of Sena Sena MP Bhavana Gawali as court points to missing Rs 7 crore||MUMBAI: Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali’s trust received Rs 15 crore cash in a span of nine months last year by way of fees paid by the students of 24 educational institutions under its control but the accounts reflected only Rs 8 crore, indicating that Rs 7 crore had been siphoned off, said the special court while rejecting the bail of the politician’s aide Saeed Khan on Monday. Khan allegedly gave Rs 3.5 crore cash to a hawala operator, who issued a cheque for the same amount and showed it as a loan which was used to purchase an office at Nariman Point which is under Gawali’s control. Khan said to ED officials that it was interest-free loan and for it he had kept a property as mortgage which was not in his name. The ED had attached the office in the case. Special judge M G Deshpande’s order said: “There is a clear case to hold that black money, rather tainted monies, are tried to be projected as untainted by way of such transactions.” It added: “Bhavana Gawali is yet to appear before ED. Once the applicant is released on bail, both of them are likely to take fate of the case in their hands by frustrating all the efforts of the ED… . Applicant (Khan) and his associates had attacked prosecution witness CA, Muley, at Aurangabad. If such applicant is released on bail, there is every possibility that he will pressurise each and every prosecution witness and also take the fate of trial in his hands.” Gawali is the Shiv Sena MP from Yavatmal-Washim. The ED alleged that she, through Saeed Khan and his accomplices, had criminally conspired to convert the Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan trust into a non-profit organisation (company) under Section 8 of the Companies Act through forgery and fraud. The trust had 11 members, but after converting it as a company, Saeed Khan and Gawali’s mother, Shalini, became its directors. Through them Gawali got complete control of the trust that has various assets collectively worth Rs 69 crore. The trust was converted into the company allegedly with the help of forged signatures and NOCs from public institutions. Former trustees opposed her decision, after which she, through her associate, allegedly filed a false police case against them saying they robbed Rs 7 crore cash from the trust. Khan had withdrawn Rs 1 crore from the trust when its accounts were frozen as part of the conversion. The court said Khan, being director and one of the controlling persons of the company, diverted and siphoned off funds received by various educational institutions of the trust by withdrawal from its accounts to own accounts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-bail-for-aide-of-sena-mp-gawali-as-court-points-to-missing-rs-7-crore/articleshow/88463509.cms||Vijay V Singh

Aurangabad range inspector-general of police Mallikarjuna Prasanna has started the initiative so that the locals may sound the sirens in case they are targetted by robbers or dacoits. After the recent robbery and gang rape incident under the limits of the Bidkin police station, Prasanna came up with this practical solution for the safety of residents in areas with recurring dacoity, robbery and theft incidents. When contacted, Prasanna said, “We have identified remote areas prone to robberies and thefts. We want to distribute sirens to residents of maximum houses located in the sub-divisions of Gangapur, Vaijapur and Paithan.” As per the initiative, all these people are also being given stickers comprising contact numbers of authorities from local police station to the superintendent of police. The residents of these areas are being briefed by the police on how to sound the siren when they face any threat. After hearing this siren, the residents from neighbouring areas or even those residing in far off places can call the authorities and alert them. Prasanna further said, “These robbers and dacoits barely give time to the families to alert the police or anyone else. As a modus, the suspects even snatch the mobile phones and do not let them raise their voice or alert others.” The officer said even one villager playing a siren would alert others and they would eventually alert the police in time. Aurangabad rural SP Nimit Goyal said the police stations under three divisions have started convincing the locals to purchase the sirens and there has been a good response so far. Acting on the directives, Tatyarao Bhalerao, an assistant inspector at Devgaon rangari police station told TOI, “We have distributed over a dozen siren to the hamlets and even to individual houses in our jurisdiction. People are positive about it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-rural-cops-give-sirens-to-let-dacoity-victims-sound-alarms/articleshow/88459687.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Dubai-returned youth Omicron +ve, 1 more suspected, 35 -ve||Nagpur: Genome sequencing has confirmed Omicron variant in the sample of a 21-year-old youth who returned from Dubai, while 35 local patients tested negative for Omicron. These samples were processed in record two days by Neeri’s environmental virology cell in collaboration with CCMB Hyderabad. Neeri’s cell had received the samples on December 20, when it dispatched sequencing quality RNAs of all 36 samples to CCMB in the evening. However, five more international flyers have been found Covid positive in the city, and shifted to AIIMS Nagpur’s special ward. One of these five – a Dubai traveller — has also tested positive for ‘S’ gene target failure (SGTF), which indicates he is likely to be the third Omicron positive case. All of them are asymptomatic and doing well, doctors said. After Neeri, Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) also confirmed Omicron variant in the 21-year-old’s sample, which was sent to it on December 19 through IGGMCH’s sentinel centre. This is the second Omicron case of the city while the first patient, who too had returned from abroad, is now declared fully recovered. Unlike this time, the NIV had assessed the first patient as ‘Omicron-like’ and not ‘confirmed Omicron’. The youth, a resident of Dhantoli, returned from Dubai via Delhi on December 18. He had tested Covid positive in Nagpur on December 19. The youth’s swab was collected by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and sent to AIIMS lab. He also got himself tested at a private lab. The sample of AIIMS was sent to NIV while the private lab’s sample went to Neeri, civic officials said. “His sample is confirmed Omicron positive. He was SGTF positive too. Whole genome sequencing has 100% confirmed he is Omicron patient,” said Krishna Khairnar, head, environmental virology cell, Neeri. He was shifted to AIIMS Nagpur special ward as per norms for Omicron surveillance. The youth is fully vaccinated and had a negative RTPCR when he reached Delhi on December 18. The youth’s sample was expected to be positive for Omicron after SGTF (S gene target failure) report was found positive. ‘S’ gene is missing in the new variant. SGTF report is presumptive diagnosis, which will be confirmed in genome study. Around 17 close contacts, including two family members, have been tested and found negative. He was the fifth international flyer to test positive in the city since the Omicron surveillance was initiated from December 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dubai-returned-youth-omicron-ve-1-more-suspected-35-ve/articleshow/88461897.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||India||Omicron may trigger 3rd wave, could peak by February 3: IIT-K study||HYDERABAD: Researchers at IIT Kanpur have predicted that a third wave, which may be triggered by the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus, may peak in India by February 3. “Following the trends around the world, this project report forecasts India’s third wave to start around mid-December and peak in the beginning of February,” the report, published in online preprint server MedRxiv, said. The team used a statistical tool called the Gaussian Mixture model to predict the third wave in India. The research report used the data of the first and second waves in India, and the current rise in cases triggered by Omicron in various countries, to predict a possible third wave in the country. The researchers said the study “suggests the cases reach peak value after 735 days from our initial observation date, which is January 30, 2020, when India reported its first official case of Covid-19. So, the cases start rising around December 15, 2021, and the peak of the third wave will occur on Thursday, February 3, 2022”.

The head of the NationalThe research team, drawn from the department of mathematics and statistics, IIT Kanpur, comprises Sabara Parshad Rajeshbhai, Subhra Sankar Dhar and Shalabh. The researchers said the key question after the first and second waves of Covid-19 was “will the third wave also arrive and, if yes, then when”. To unravel the puzzle the team used a statistical method based on the fitting of a mixture of Gaussian distributions.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Tomato prices high as local supply constrained||AHMEDABAD: While prices of tomato in the Jamalpur APMC wholesale market is between Rs 18 to Rs 30 a kg, by the time it reaches consumers in Satellite or Memnagar, it becomes Rs 80. Prices of other vegetables are also as much as 200 per cent when it reaches the consumer. A supply chain analysis shows that middlemen and traders at every stage walk away with the lion’s share of the proceeds. On Wednesday, the price of tomato was between Rs 18 and Rs 30 in the wholesale market, was selling for Rs 50 per kg just outside it. In areas like Satellite and Thaltej the prices ranged from Rs 80 to Rs 90 a kg.  A senior APMC officer said that at all the stages the profit of traders gets added. “Everyone benefits from high prices, but only farmers suffer when prices fall. Middlemen take their commission no matter what. This is a no-loss venture for vendors. We have also observed that prices of vegetables once they increase, take a long time to come down. In such cases, retail prices are not related to the wholesale market. Khemji Marwadi, a vegetable trader in Bopal, said, “We have to bring get the vegetables in loading rickshaws from Jamalpur and with high fuel prices, transport costs are increasing. Traders at the APMC also raise their prices and we have to bear the brunt of the increase.” The government has a market committee, but the committee has no role to play in prices especially outside the APMC. At the APMC, prices are decided based on the quality and supply of the produce. Secretary of the Jamalpur APMC, Deepak Patel, said unseasonal rains in the state and the cloudy weather affected supply and prices are thus increasing. In the case of tomatoes, produce from local farmers has just started coming in and prices will come down in the APMC, but he couldn’t comment on prices in the retail market. An APMC officer said vegetable vendors also mix low-quality and high-quality produce and sell it at high prices. He said that on grocery apps, the price of tomatoes was about Rs 45 per kg, while it is Rs 85 at vegetable stalls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tomato-prices-high-as-local-supply-constrained/articleshow/88461526.cms||---

The churches are all decked up while many are planning to soak in the festive spirit with family dinners, Christmas trees and surprise gifts for their children. While the Christians will be celebrating Christmas like any other festival, the non-Christian families too are set to spend the festival in a righteous way. For Shruti Awasthi, the festival becomes an occasion for a family gathering for her and her cousins as they decorate a Christmas tree every year. “My cousins and I have bought a monkey puzzle tree for decoration this year. On the beats of jingle bells, we decorate the tree and add small gifts for everybody which we buy out of our pocket money. For me personally it feels like a second Diwali where we relish the plum cake and coffee while sitting in front of the bonfire,” she said. Hina Parveen, a housewife, has planned a picnic day for her kids. “Since it’s a holiday and the next day is Sunday, I’ve thought of taking the kids for a picnic. The weekend coupled with festivals is a perfect opportunity to spend time with family,” added Parveen. Celebrating his son’s Mihireer’s fifth birthday on Christmas day, Anamika Gautam has planned a Santa Claus themed birthday party. “We have also planned a Santa storytelling session for the kids as they are very much interested to know about him,” she added. “Like every year, being a home baker, I, along with my team, will visit schools for deaf, underprivileged and distribute cakes, chocolates and presents to all the children,” said Aashi Rizvi, a resident of Sahadatganj.

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Demolition work begins in Sabarmati Ashram precinct||AHMEDABAD: The state government on Thursday began clearing the Sabarmati Ashram precinct of buildings whose possession has been obtained. Of the many properties at Thakorvas within the project precinct area, 14 families are still at the negotiation table. The demolition of properties was undertaken after a “coordination committee” comprising the Ahmedabad collector and three representatives of Ashram inmates approved the site clearing. “In the next fortnight, these 14 families will also move after alternative arrangements are made,” said a senior nodal official of the Gandhi Ashram Memorial and Precinct Development Project. The project aims to develop a “world-class memorial”, with the state government beginning to acquire properties and compensate their owners, who have been residents of the precinct of the Ashram for generations. To speed up work on rehabilitation of residents, the authorities have set up the coordination committee. There are approximately 200 families within the precinct, the majority of whom are from SC communities, whose forefathers had settled in the Ashram after 1917. The state government has earmarked Rs 1,246 crore for the project, which will take the Ashram complex to its status in 1948, when Bapu was assassinated. According to the plan, the state aims to integrate 35 acres of the Ashram campus, which houses 63 heritage properties established during Gandhi's lifetime. The plan is to bring together all original structures on one campus. At present, the campus is scattered over several parts that are managed by different trusts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/demolition-work-begins-in-sabarmati-ashram-precinct/articleshow/88461481.cms||---

The accused Vasant Parmar (51) is a resident of Chandkheda. He has worked with the city and traffic police for about 30 years. Paldi police officers suspect that Parmar was into bootlegging. But Parmar claimed that the liquor bottles seized were for his self-consumption. According to the FIR filed with Paldi police, they got information that a man riding a scooter was carrying liquor bottles near Suvidha crossroads in Paldi. A team kept a watch in the area and nabbed Parmar who was riding a scooter. At first, Parmar told the cops that he himself is an unarmed head constable with the E Division Traffic police station. When one of the cops asked about a jute bag kept on the footrest of the scooter, Parmar started fumbling. When the cops opened the bag, they found the liquor bottles. During questioning, Parmar told the cops that he had bought the liquor from a bootlegger near Mohan cinema in Asarawa and it was meant for self-consumption. “Parmar told us that his mother was not keeping well, so he got addicted to liquor. But we suspect that he was into bootlegging,” said inspector Riddhi Dave of Paldi police station. A case under the Prohibition Act was registered against Parmar late on Wednesday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/traffic-head-constable-held-with-27-imfl-bottles-in-paldi/articleshow/88461511.cms||---

---||Mumbai||7 years later, 4 get life sentence for stabbing Shiv Sena worker to death in Mumbai||MUMBAI: The Dindoshi sessions court on Thursday convicted four men and sentenced them to life imprisonment for killing a local Shiv Sena functionary, Ramesh Jadhav, near his Malad (E) residence in 2014. The court acquitted a woman, while one more accused, a juvenile-in-conflict-with-law, has his case pending for trial before the juvenile justice board. The murder had led to rioting in the area and a case against the alleged rioters is pending before the court. The case registered by Dindoshi police was that the accused had conspired to murder Jadhav and executed the plan by stabbing him in a scuffle in a chawl in Malad (E) on October 21, 2014. While five of the accused, including the minor, were arrested the next day, the woman managed to secure anticipatory bail. The complainant, Jadhav’s cousin, said Sohail Ansari, Yusuf Sazida, Imran Kazi and the minor were assaulting his neighbour and when he tried to intervene, they attacked him too. He then called Jadhav for help. The cousin said when Jadhav tried to intervene, Ansari held him while Yusuf and Kazi pushed him against a wall. He claimed that Ansari stabbed Jadhav on his chest, face and hand, while another accused Gullu Sazida stabbed him with a ‘gupti’ on the thigh. Jadhav succumbed to the injuries. The complainant’s lawyer, Kaushik Mhatre, in written submissions to the court said it was a case based on direct eyewitnesses’ accounts and in all, 20 witnesses were examined to prove the prosecution case. He said the police collected metal pipes with bloodstains from the spot and Gullu voluntarily had disclosed where the “weapon (gupti) and blood-stained clothes were concealed”. The police found them in a bush on a building construction site. Avinash Rasal was appointed special public prosecutor, but local public prosecutors Ravindra Savle and Mhatre argued for the complainant. They said three eyewitnesses’ accounts and th-em identifying the accused, along with CCTV footage and forensic report, were su-fficient to prove their guilt. Defence lawyer Bhanudas Jagtap argued that Jadhav had fallen from the first-floor of his building and the injury was not caused by sta-bbing. He examined a defence witness who said he heard someone fall and then saw a few men running tow-ards Jadhav who had fallen from the first floor and an ir-on rod had pierced his thigh. The witness, a brother of one of the convicts, deposed that he and two accused, including Gullu, took Jadhav to hospital. But in his cross-examination, he could not show any hospital entry or CCTV footage and prosecution said he was not a reliable witness as he was trying to get acquittal for his brother. The story of a fall is not supported by medical evidence, said the prosecution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/7-yrs-later-4-get-life-sentence-for-stabbing-sena-worker-to-death/articleshow/88463544.cms||---
---||Delhi||Hospitals to airport: Testing to check spread in Delhi||NEW DELHI: It is not just air travel. An RT-PCR negative result is a must even if you want to undergo a planned surgery in most hospitals these days. Some, like Apollo, have also mandated the family member/attendant staying with the inpatient to have an RT-PCR negative result. Hospitals say these steps are being taken in view of the increased incidence of Covid in the city. Dr Priyadarshini Pal Singh, who heads the emergency and critical care at Apollo, said each and every person visiting the hospital was being screened and if someone was found to have any of the Covid symptoms, they were referred to the flu clinic. Dr H S Chhabra, director of Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said they had totally separated Covid and non-Covid pathways in the hospital so that there was no intermingling of any manner. “It is mandatory to follow all Covid protocol at all times on the premises — mask discipline, sanitisation of hands and surfaces, thermal screening and social distancing and there is appropriate monitoring to ensure compliance,” he added. During the first and the second waves, several hospitals reported outbreaks of Covid. This led to fear among patients and many people suffering from non-Covid illnesses, including cancer, deferred visits to hospitals for surgeries and follow-up. Dr Singh from Apollo said they hadn’t seen any decrease in non-Covid patients yet, but there was a possibility that this might happen if cases continued to rise. “We have to try and segregate the two as much as possible, but, frankly, if the cases go up rapidly and substantially, then there is little that a hospital can do. Hopefully, that doesn’t happen as there was too much delay and lack of treatment of non-Covid issues the last two times because of fear and hesitation,” she added. Dr Rajesh Malhotra, professor and head of orthopaedics at AIIMS who also heads the trauma centre, said hospitals ran the risk of becoming places where infection could rapidly transmit, given the large number of visitors, admitted patients and their attendants, many of whom were suffering from multiple comorbidities. Therefore, he added, attempts had to be made to prevent crowding and ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour among the hospital staff, patients and their attendants. “We have a protocol in our department where screening for symptoms is done and documented as a self-declaration by every staff member who’s coming to work,” Dr Malhotra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hospitals-to-airport-testing-to-check-spread/articleshow/88462769.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Vishal Patel, 32, a resident of Krishna Society near Visnagar Circle in Unjha town of Mehsana district, in his FIR said that his maternal uncle, Prabhulal Bhesdadia, a resident of Jamnagar, had a business relationship with him. Due to financial discrepancies, Vishal snapped all business ties with Bhesdadia around a year ago. Vishal said Bhesdadia has been demanding Rs 25 lakh from him since then. On Tuesday morning, Vishal’s father, Bharat Patel, and his business partner, Parth Patel, loaded a truck with around 1,500kg of cumin and went to deliver it to a businessman in Ahmedabad city. At around 5pm on Tuesday, Parth called Vishal’s wife Geeta and told her that someone had kidnaped him and Bharat. At around 7.45pm on Tuesday, Vishal received a WhatsApp call from Parth’s number, on which Bhesdadia’s driver Javed Shaikh was speaking. Vishal said that he was demanding Rs 25 lakh and threatened to kill both if the money was not paid to Bhesdadia through a Jamnagar angadia firm. Vishal called Bharat’s truck driver, who told him that four or five men armed with sticks, forced Bharat and Parth into an SUV and took them towards Rajkot from Ujala Circle. At around 8.20pm on Tuesday, Vishal received another call from his father, where he told him to provide at least Rs 10 lakh so that they would be released. Vishal called the city police control room and later filed a complaint of kidnapping with Sarkhej police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/uncle-kidnaps-cumin-traders-father-partner/articleshow/88461504.cms||---

Sajan Sonawane, the police inspector at Sarkarwada police station said that Sunita Dhangar, the NMC education officer, has registered a complaint against two for obstructing her from attending a government function on Tuesday. When the NMC officer was about to leave for ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ programme organised at Maratha high school, both the accused reached her office at Rajeev Gandhi Bhawan and asked for her appointment. After the officer told them that she had to leave for a programme immediately, the accused allegedly started shooting a video that was made viral on social media without the officer’s knowledge. Only after the security guards got hold of the accused, Dhangar could leave for the programme. She later called the duo to her office for discussion at 4pm. The duo did not have any issues related to the public, children or even the schools. They wanted the schools to subscribe to a private publication. “I have no right to do this and told them so. But they started making more clips viral on social media, thus defaming the office, the officer and the NMC. Hence, I have registered a complaint,” Dhangar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-held-for-obstructing-government-official/articleshow/88459710.cms||---

However, they could not find any earlier common symptoms of cough, cold, fever, breathing problems, or loss of smell shown by the Delta variant infected cases. What has been detected so far are three major symptoms including complaints of extreme weakness, headache and body pain by Omicron affected patients. Dr Tushar Patel, pulmonologist told TOI, “During previous variants of Covid-19 patients were suffering from cough, cold, fever, breathing problems, loss of smell and test and lung infection but this new omicron variant does not have any of these symptoms. Even in a study in Africa three symptoms are seen in patients who were infected with Omicron. These symptoms are extreme weakness, headache and body ache.” Dr Patel is a member of the state Covid task force formed by the state government in a meeting it called on Thursday, looking at the rising number of Omicron cases. The meeting discussed the current situation and detailed the effective preventive steps to be taken to control spread of the new variant. Looking at the rapid spread, experts fear the situation may become more sensitive in January and February. Doctors who are closely monitoring the situation also suggested testing all international passengers at arrival and not limit it to only travellers from at-risk countries. “Currently, government guidelines mandate testing international passengers arriving from 14 ‘at-risk’ countries, but now we must test all international passengers,” Dr Patel added. “At present it is like sitting on the tip of a volcano. Till now, most of the cases have travel history, but if it changes to community transmission the situation will turn dangerous. To prevent further spread of the virus, all international passengers should be compulsorily sent for institutional quarantine,” Dr Mukesh Maheshwari, coordinator, Gujarat state, Indian Medical Association (IMA) said. “During previous waves of Covid, we saw cases rise in the US and the UK and after 15-20 days the number of patients increased in India. Citizens must observe Covid guidelines and the government should strictly enforce regulations,” Dr Maheshwari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/extreme-weakness-headache-body-pain-are-omicron-signs/articleshow/88460997.cms||---

Though the state government has not issued any restrictions on movement or gatherings, strict checking for masks and social distancing at malls, cinema halls, hotels, cafes and markets is likely over the next few days. On Thursday, the CM reinforced the need to check all passengers coming into the state at airports and train stations to identify people infected with the Omicron variant.

---||Nashik||Initiative to focus on livelihood of vulnerable groups||Nashik: The human development commissionerate in Aurangabad has decided to focus on livelihood of vulnerable groups through its statewide programme that is being carried out in 123 talukas, including eight in Nashik district. According to the commissionerate, which aims to improve the human development index of backwards districts, this would contribute to an all-round development. The eight talukas in the Nashik district selected under the 13-point MVM are Igatpuri, Trimbakeshwar, Surgana, Peth, Kalwan, Dindori, Baglan and Nandgaon. The criteria for selection were women literacy levels and population falling under below poverty line (BPL), among others. Human development commissioner Nitin Patil, who was in Nashik on Wednesday to take the review of the situation, stressed on the fact that the district administration and zilla parishad should submit proposals that are aimed at providing livelihood to the vulnerable people from the eight talukas. “It has been observed that much of the funds were spent in getting infrastructure for the people of the vulnerable group. Though part of it is important, but funds from other schemes could also be sourced for the same. We have therefore stressed on spending funds for things that will directly start paying dividends in the lives of the people by way of getting bank interest intervention, arranging for ways and means for business, etc,” Patil said. The commissioner stated that the state government has given Rs 1 crore to every taluka to undertake programmes for raising human development index. He added that he was confident that once the issues of livelihood were taken care of people would automatically take part in other activities, including health and education, and thus raise the human development index (HDI). The officer said proposals like funds for equipment for brick kiln workers and food (grapes) dryers of Katkari community in Trimbakeshwar, food processing channels for cashew and mango in Peth taluka, food processing units for those having goats would be welcomed from the local authorities as that would indicate that they were in touch with the vulnerable population from their jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/initiative-to-focus-on-livelihood-of-vulnerable-groups/articleshow/88459741.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Lucknow||Rivals ‘nervous’, going overboard with rallies: Maya||Lucknow: Not having stepped out herself so far to address any election rally ahead of the 2022 polls in UP, BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday hit out at BJP, Samajwadi Party and Congress for holding rallies and meetings, calling them “nervous”. “Those who are doing rallies are worried. I am holding crucial meetings and will address rallies when the time is right. Also, it is very difficult to believe BJP’s claim about getting more than 300 seats this election. Despite being the ruling party, why are they being forced to make these hurried announcements, inaugurations etc. The party has also deputed its central ministers and senior party leaders to visit UP in large numbers,” she said, adding that just before the elections, if the chief minister and other senior UP BJP leaders were having to visit some districts multiple times and lure people including students, it meant that they were not confident. The former UP CM had called a meeting of the 18 mandal heads and 75 district presidents on Thursday to discuss election strategy. The first report of the election preparations taking place at the booth level, an activity which started on October 21, was also submitted to Mayawati. Respective in charges will be given only a week’s time to address any shortcomings or issues being faced in their areas, she said. “Opposition parties are trying all sorts of tricks to create a wave in their favour. BSP workers will be warned about this as well and told what they should do and say in response to these statements and actions. BSP people will have to go across the state and warn people about this,” she said. BSP workers have been told to campaign on two levels, one by talking about the anti-people activities and policies of other governments, including the current BJP government in the state and then by talking about its own achievements, and pro-people policies. Mayawati has also sought a high level investigation into charges against some BJP leaders and relatives of government officials having purchased land in Ayodhya soon after the court awarded the disputed land for the construction of a Ram Temple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rivals-nervous-going-overboard-with-rallies-maya/articleshow/88462793.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Lucknow||Revenue official to probe ‘unfair’ land deals in Ayodhya||Lucknow: With political spotlight on the allegedly unscrupulous Ayodhya land deals, a special secretary from the revenue department will be visiting the temple town on Friday to carry out an inquiry into the allegations and collect the necessary documents. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered an inquiry into the land deals on Wednesday on the basis of certain media reports alleging that government officials, their relatives and BJP leaders had purchased land in the area soon after the court ruled in favour of the Ram Temple at the disputed site. Additional chief secretary (revenue) Manoj Kumar Singh said that he had nominated a special secretary to visit Ayodhya on Friday to collect the necessary documents and the revenue department would present its report to the CM within a week. Sources said that the inquiry would look into what the land case was, whether the land which has been purchased belonged to scheduled castes, whether the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust was selling the land by plotting it since it could not sell the land allotted to it for a specific purpose and whether any officers had purchased the land. “There is a rule that officers need to take permission before purchasing land but there is also a question of morality involved in this case. All document pertaining to these issues will be collected and studied,” an official said. Meanwhile, BSP chief Mayawati demanded a Supreme Court monitoring of the investigation, saying that if there was anything fraudulent in the land deals, then they should be cancelled. “If something like this has happened, then the Centre and state government should take up the matter seriously and cancel any fraudulent land deal,” she said. Congress national general secretary, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, also accused the BJP of looting the Ayodhya Ram Temple Trust. Claiming that the probe ordered by the UP government was an eye wash, Vadra asked why PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath were silent on the issue. She demanded that the ambit of investigation should include the role of Trust secretary Champat Rai and trustee Anil Mishra. Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh questioned the decision to ask an officer of the UP Government to carry out an investigation into the matter, especially as government officials and members of the ruling party were accused in the matter. “How can a fair probe take place in this issue if the government’s own officials have been asked to investigate their own colleagues? The investigation should instead be done by a Supreme Court monitored SIT,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/revenue-official-to-probe-unfair-land-deals-in-ayodhya/articleshow/88462807.cms||Neha Lalchandani

They were apprised about checking, starting and closing of electronic voting machines (EVMs). While AAP held a physical session with candidates, BJP held online meetings alongside physical meetings. Manpower and other issues were also taken up. “Since we are contesting Chandigarh MC elections for the first time, the party’s senior leaders briefed candidates about the intricacies of procedure. Since the functioning of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) is the most important part of the process, related information about it was given,” a senior AAP leader said. The BJP guided its candidates and polling agents about the process and procedure of casting votes on Friday. Sources in the saffron party said that most of the candidates and their polling agents were quite aware about these details so not much time was expended on a briefing. All political parties have kept staff in reserve. The state election commission has allowed only two persons in each polling booth and not many supporters. Box: Arrangements being made Political parties started making arrangements outside polling booths from Thursday. The arrangements included setting up of tables, chairs and tents.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra to roll out fresh curbs for festive season today||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government on Thursday announced curbs on Christmas gatherings in churches and said it will impose fresh restrictions to reduce crowding during the festive season even as Mumbai’s daily Covid-19 case count almost tripled to 577 from 190 reported on November 23. The government notification on the new restrictions will be issued on Friday. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a late-night meeting with the Covid-19 task force members. An official said the government is considering further reducing the number of people allowed in enclosed areas, regulating working hours for establishments and imposing night curfew or Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code to control crowds in public places. “A detailed order will be issued tomorrow. The sole purpose is to curb crowding during the festive season,” said the official. A senior minister, on condition of anonymity, said that the Omicron wave was expected to begin by mid-January, but the sudden surge in cases in the last few days is a cause of concern. “We want to understand from the experts what is fueling the surge. Previously, India and Maharashtra would see a surge about two months after a similar rise in western countries,” added the minister. It is not yet established whether the highly transmissible Omicron variant is already spreading within the community in Mumbai, but the state home department on Thursday issued guidelines allowing only 50% of the capacity of churches for Christmas festivities. “No stalls and shops will be allowed outside churches and social distancing, masking and the use of sanitisers would have to be strictly observed,” said the government notification on Christmas celebrations issued on Thursday. The rising graph is mainly confined to the Mumbai region; on Thursday, of the 1,179 cases registered in Maharashtra, the Mumbai region accounted for 821 cases. Daily deaths in the state rose from eight on Wednesday to 17 on Thursday, but Mumbai registered only one death. BMC officials are most worried about the climbing daily test positivity rate: While the rate hovered between 0.5% and 0.6% in November and early December, it climbed to 1.5% on Thursday. The infection growth rate between December 16 and 22 climbed a decimal point to 0.04 after a fortnight. Apart from the 577 cases in Mumbai, neighbouring Thane reported over double of the cases seen a month back at 46 cases. In Navi Mumbai and Panvel, 44 and 20 positive cases were reported, respectively. A civic official said that cases had risen almost 20% in one day. “The daily test positivity rate has been climbing steadily and we have stepped up surveillance and contact tracing,’’ said the official. Another official said that despite the rising numbers in Mumbai, hospital admissions, especially to ICUs, hadn’t increased. Earlier in the day, the state cabinet held a meeting to discuss the situation in Maharashtra. A few ministers called for some restrictions to be imposed for the New Year festivities to keep Covid-19 cases in check.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-to-roll-out-fresh-curbs-for-festive-season-today/articleshow/88462822.cms||---

The only rider is that they also need to have Universal Travel Pass that is issued to fully-vaccinated citizens. It is for the first time since March 2020 that the passengers are being allowed to travel on a general ticket. So far, only confirmed reserved ticket holders were allowed in the train. Rajesh Fokane of Nashik Pass Holders and Passengers Welfare Association, said the move was much needed. “Many had to leave jobs or were forced to stay in Mumbai in the absence of the permission to use general tickets,” he said. The Central Railway has de-reserved six coaches (D12 to D17) of the train for these passengers.

Pulling off a performance as splendid at it was, with some dancers being on wheelchair and some being deaf and mute, the troupe left everyone frozen to their seats and speechless themselves. The beautifully choreographed dance ans skit performance was two hours long in total and divided into three parts. The first part dived into the rich heritage and culture of India. “No matter which empires have come and gone, the roots, the traditions and the values of ancient India have always remained strong,” rightly said the the host before the commencement of the first part. It started off with prayers offered to Ganesh, Shiv and Ram. Then the timeless story of Mahabharata and Ramayana was wonderfully portrayed along with the iconic dialogue between Arjuna and Shri Krishna. The second part of the performance is a reminder of our freedom struggle and victory for Independence. Taking us through a journey of our past, from the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters to and the revolution they created, this part made the audience feel patriotic and proud of our country and how far we have come. Some of the highlights were the the earlier revolts of our patriots, the efforts of Mahatma Gandhi, the heartbreaking incidents such as Jallianwala Bagh incident and the historic declaration of Independence. The third part was in continuation of the second part, which showed the journey of India from its Independence to its modern might. Their performance included their praises of the current government’s Make in India initiative and the success in the vaccination rate under. An admiration for Nitin Gadkari’s road and transportation transformation and ambitious future plans could also be seen. Lastly a tribute was paid to our country’s fallen soldiers and war heroes and with that the performance ended on a beautiful note.

---||Chandigarh||Kirron arrives in city on election eve||Deepak.Yadav@timesgroup.com Chandigarh: Finally, actor-turned-politician and Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher reached the city a day before polling. She will cast her vote in Sector 7. The city MP has not been in town for the past almost one year. She has been undergoing treatment for cancer in Mumbai. Kher was seen on the set of a popular TV reality show around a month back along with actor Shilpa Shetty and rapper Badshah. Her media team and staff became active when she reached the city and Kher herself also started issuing messages to people using social media, mainly through her Facebook page. In her video messages, she urged people to vote for the BJP and criticised both the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Both these parties have been taking on the BJP on multiple grounds, mainly the drastic slip in Swachhta ranking and failure to remove the garbage dump from Daddumajra. Criticising the Congress, Kher said, “The problem of the dumping ground is given by the Congress party. Then Congress MP Pawan Kumar Bansal brought the company and installed the plant. The plant did not work in past many years and we were taking rounds of the court, so that we could come out from this problem in any manner.” Reacting to Kher’s comment, Congress president Subhash Chawla said, “before electing city MP in the year of 2013, Kher had promised to remove the dumping ground but in her past over seven years’ MP tenure, she did nothing. She is hiding her series of failures like other BJP leaders do.” Taking a swipe at AAP, Kher in her post said, “some leaders, who are in AAP now and served as city Mayor are responsible for the dumping ground. Now these AAP leaders are claiming to make Chandigarh like Delhi. No we don’t want Chandigarh like Delhi and in-fact Delhi needs to become like Chandigarh. We have all the facility and given to the people. We have clinics in all sectors and good hospitals. We have done great job in Chandigarh during COVID-19 pandemic and we had no scarcity of oxygen like Delhi, where people were in bad shape. We want to keep Chandigarh as it is because it is far better than Delhi. AAP is Congress B team and Congress is now C team. AAP leaders only give big speeches and there is nothing on ground.” Box: AAP hits back Pardeep Chhabra, AAP’s national co in-charge and senior leader said, “Kirron Kher is a kind of leader, who preferred her reality show before serving people of Chandigarh, who voted for her with thumping majority. Before coming to her constituency, she preferred to go to a reality show, that too in a time of pandemic, which shows her apathy for the Chandigarh. Kher preferred to stay in Mumbai and thus she did nothing for the city. Due to her indifferent attitude, the dumping ground kept rising in past seven years of her tenure as MP. Like BJP vanished in Delhi assembly election, it will be voted out in Chandigarh MC too, as residents of Chandigarh have made up its mind to throw BJP out from the MC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kirron-arrives-in-city-on-election-eve/articleshow/88461595.cms||Deepak Yadav
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Drug seizures this year break record||AHMEDABAD: The 1,600-km coastline of Gujarat seems to have turned into a boon for international and inter-state drug mafias who are using it to sneak narcotics into the country. This year alone, the Gujarat police have seized drugs worth Rs 1,617 crore – the highest in the state’s history. As per official records, the seizure of 67,304kg of drugs and psychotropic substances so far is at least 800 times more than last year’s seizure of 12,458kg worth Rs 195 crore. This year’s seizure of drugs includes marijuana, opium, charas, heroin as well as synthetic drugs like methamphetamine and mephedrone. This haul is apart from the largest seizure of narcotics substance in the country – a consignment of 3,000 kg of heroin at Mundra port in Kutch district – by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in September this year. Gujarat DGP Ashish Bhatia said the state police made the seizures due to enhanced vigilance. A senior police officer said Gujarat has been witnessing seizures of all sorts of drugs for two reasons. “Firstly, the Gujarat coast has always been a traditional transitional route for drug landing. Then, the consignment is usually transported to Punjab. However, now we are also seeing a trend where the drugs are meant for consumption in Gujarat and states like Maharashtra,” he said. The officer added, “Secondly, the Taliban taking over the power in Afghanistan has led to an increase in the inflow of drugs as the drug mafia wanted to empty their stock at the earliest, fearing execution by the Talibani regime. “After the Taliban came to power in August, we saw the Mundra drugs seizure, two mid-sea operations by ATS where 35kg and 77kg heroin were seized, followed by the 146kg heroin seizure from a Morbi village and other parts of coastal Saurashtra. In all the cases, the drugs originated from Afghanistan. Drug lords from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran were involved and they had rushed their load to clear their stock before it fell into the hands of the Talibanis.” Another police officer from a state agency said that Gujarat was earlier considered as a transitional place for drugs delivery, which is still the case. However, now, the consumption of drugs especially synthetics ones like methamphetamine and mephedrone has risen. “Recently, Ahmedabad police arrested Satellite resident Vandit Patel, 27, who ran a salon in Bopal. He was found with drugs which he got through courier from countries like Canada and the US. He used to sell it to people from the elite class in the western part of the city. The city crime branch also busted a racket where peddlers from the Walled City sold drugs to consumers in Navrangpura and Satellite,” said the officer, indicating the trend of increased drug consumption in the city. He said that the seizures of nearly 63 kg of drugs including nearly 57 kg of heroin and six kg of methamphetamine was seized from Khambhalia and Salaya town of Devbhoomi-Dwarka district. This showed that the consumption and illegal selling of the drugs is also very high in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drug-seizures-this-year-break-record/articleshow/88461592.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Lucknow||State emerging as glocal economy, preferred investment destination||Uttar Pradesh has transformed its economic landscape to emerge as the most preferred investment destination and fastest growing state economy in recent years. One of its biggest achievements has been the change in perception. Following the principles of good governance, the state has drastically improved its image as a policy-oriented investment destination while gaining investors’ confidence. Investment destination UP implemented over 500 reforms leading to a quantum jump of 12 positions to secure the second rank in the Government of India’s Business Reform Action Plan rankings. Uttar Pradesh also jumped seven positions to rank sixth in India on ‘Logistics Ease Across Different States’ survey. Assuring seamless connectivity has been another mainstream agenda to transform the state’s inherent disadvantage of being a land-locked state. Today, network of expressways is connecting the prominent hubs across the state. UP has become hotspot for upcoming flagship projects for multi-modal connectivity in India. One of the country’s largest international airport is also coming up at Jewar. It will soon be the only state to have five international airports in the country. With a policy-based governance approach, Uttar Pradesh government introduced more than 21 policies and land reforms to support needs of investors. A government-facilitated investment attraction of around Rs 3 lakh crore (since FY 2017, including the implemented MoUs signed during UP Investors Summit, 2018) is a testimony of the state’s pro-activeness towards investor facilitation. It has also been one of the most resilient states post Covid-19 in terms of investor attraction. Glocal approach UP is now ready to envision a future where it can compete globally on certain areas, which would entail aggressive reforms, fast-paced implementation, and regular monitoring. One such area can be the transformation of agriculture sector to become a global agri-produce hub. UP may look into ‘ease of doing farming’. It must enable single window system for farmers along with a tech-enabled real time platform to gain market knowledge. Farmers must be induced to meet quality assurance standards and provide decentralised market access. Branding imperative Another key area would be branding itself as a preferred destination for world’s religious tourism. The state, with a large talent pool in India offers respite combined with inclusivity. As 56% of the state’s total population size of 240 million is under working age group (18-60 years), it is one of India’s youngest state with median age of 20 years. The state needs right brand positioning in global market to highlight its skilled labour force. To enable this, globally oriented skill development programmes must be promoted.

At the national level, there is discussion of a night lockdown,” he said. In such a situation, it was critical for legislators to remain masked, he said. “We represent 3-5 lakh constituents and set an example for them. Some say they cannot speak when donning the mask, but they should at least put their mask on once they finish speaking,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/centre-considering-night-lockdown-in-mumbai-ajit-urges-legislators-to-mask-up/articleshow/88462830.cms||---

In a letter to the KRMB, the state government said in the notification it was mentioned that intake, tunnel, appurtenant structures (mean structures such as spillways) and Nakkalagandi reservoir as one component and additional 10 tmcft intake and appurtenant works as another component. Telangana engineer-in-chief (ENC) C Muralidhar said in the letter that the united AP government had enhanced the ayacut under SLBC from three lakh acres to four lakh acres but the quantum of water utilisation was not enhanced accordingly from 30 tmcft to 40 tmcft. “ TRS government has increased quantum of water to 40 tmcft to commensurate with ayacut. The intake for utilisng water has remained same and no additional intake and appurtenant works were added. The board may take steps for removal of additional component from schedules one and two,” he said. Muralidhar said the AP government had accorded administrative approval for Udayasamudram lift irrigation scheme in 2007 to irrigate one lakh acres of fluoride-affected areas of Nalgonda district by lifting water from the foreshore of Udayasamudram tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-govt-opposes-dividing-slbc/articleshow/88461619.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Jaipur||NCR area in Rajasthan’s two districts reduced by over 6.6k sqkm||JAIPUR: The geographical size of the National Capital Region (NCR) in Rajasthan has reduced roughly from the existing 13,446 sqkm to 6,777 sqkm as per the revised NCR boundaries. The NCR includes areas from two districts of Alwar and Bharatpur. While in Alwar, NCR land has reduced from 8,380 sqkm to 4,705.19 sqkm, in Bharatpur, the area has fallen from 5,066 sqkm to 2,071.41 sqkm. According to an official, the ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ has been put in public domain and suggestions or objections have been invited until January 7. The plan will be notified by March 2022. “The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) has given its in-principle approval to the ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ at a meeting held on October 12 this year. In Rajasthan, the total NCR area in the two districts will be 6,777 sqkm,” he said. The NCR area will be reduced to a 100km radius, according to the draft approved by the NCRPB. The NCR delineation consensus was given on the principle of making the geographical size as a contiguous circular region of 100km radius from Rajghat. Beyond the 100km radius and up to existing NCR boundaries, all notified cities, towns along with a corridor of 1km on either side of connecting expressways, national highways, state highways, and regional rapid transit systems will also be included in the new NCR. The decision to include or exclude tehsils lying partly within this 100km delineation was left to the state government. “Areas of five tehsils from Alwar district, namely Tijara, Neemrana, Kishangarh Bas, Mundawar and Kotkasim, will be part of the NCR. Similarly, areas of two tehsils from Bharatpur, Pahari and Kaman, have been included,” an official said. The draft plan gives emphasis on the need for planned housing projects in NCR along the transit oriented development (TOD) corridors. For the same, 2,379.90 sqkm area in Alwar and 950.72 sqkm area in Bharatpur have been earmarked. “The plan’s proposal of TOD along major transport corridors, high floor area ratio (FAR), transferable development rights (TDR), vertical brown field redevelopment, mix land use in old parts of cities and smaller towns to promote medical/educational/tourism hubs, affordable rental housing are transformative in nature and will go a long way in meeting demands of rapid urbanisation,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ncr-area-in-rajs-two-distsreduced-by-over-6-6k-sqkm/articleshow/88462232.cms||Ajay Singh
---||Hyderabad||No word yet from Centre on paddy procurement in state||Hyderabad: The Telangana ministerial delegation, which has been camping in Delhi to get a written assurance from Union food minister Piyush Goyal on paddy procurement, is yet to get a final word from the Centre. Agriculture minister S Niranjan Reddy on Thursday said: “We have neither come here (Delhi) without any work nor the government is writing love letters. The NDA government, which instead of supporting a progressive government, is creating hurdles for paddy procurement.” Niranjan Reddy along with other ministers Errabelli Dayakar Rao, G Jagadish Reddy, Vemula Prashanth Reddy and Gangula Kamalakar has been camping in the national capital on the paddy issue. The ministers expressed their unhappiness over the attitude of the Centre and said it was unfortunate that the Centre was acting like a political party and insulting the state government representatives. The ministers who said they would not leave Delhi unless they get a written order from the Centre also slammed Union tourism minister G Kishan Reddy for not taking any initiative in getting assurance from the Centre. “We are compelled to beg the Centre as procurement and godowns are under the control of the Union government. If the Centre cannot handle the issue, the government could have transferred the powers to the states,” another minister said. Niranjan Reddy said had the Centre not created problems, paddy production would have reached 90 lakh metric tonnes from 70 lakh MTs. Targeting the Centre, he wondered: “Is it wrong if we implement pro-farmer schemes such as Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima and provide irrigation water and free power to agriculture sector.” The ministers alleged that the Union government would go to any extent to help corporate firms to get the MoU done on procurement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-word-yet-from-centre-on-paddy-procurement-in-state/articleshow/88461635.cms||Koride Mahesh

---||Hyderabad||T says no to new lift scheme on Krishna for Chennai||Hyderabad: Telangana government has objected to AP’s proposal of a new lift irrigation scheme at Srisailam reservoir exclusively to draw drinking water for Chennai. Telangana’s officials allege that because the AP Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme to draw from Srisailam and Pothireddypadu is facing legal trouble, the neighbouring state is trying to legalise the scheme through the backdoor via the new project. To supply water for the next four months - January to April, 2022 - the KRMB held an online meeting with AP, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka on Thursday. Telangana’s irrigation officials said they never objected to the 15 tmcft being released for Chennai. “In the current water year beginning in June, Tamil Nadu took just eight tmcft and is asking for the balance. But AP drew more than 100 tmcft from Pothireddypadu head regulator from July. AP government can supply water from Kadaleru reservoir. But having a separate lift irrigation scheme for Chennai is objectionable to Telangana,” a senior official, who participated in the meeting, said. Officials said the Tamil Nadu government never asked for a separate lift irrigation scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-says-no-to-new-lift-scheme-on-krishna-for-chennai/articleshow/88461633.cms||Koride Mahesh

An MIDC official said they will float a tender in this regard in a couple of weeks. “The works will begin immediately once the tender process is complete and the work orders are issued to the private contractors concerned,” the official said. The industrialists have been demanding resurfacing of roads as their conditions have deteriorated and are causing inconvenience to the industries. The MIDC had recently undertaken the road repair and pothole filling exercise of roads that were badly damaged during the monsoon. “We have a total 26-km of major and internal roads across all sectors in Sinnar industrial areas of the MIDC. But the condition of the 14-km road is terrible as resurfacing have not been carried out for the past 15-20 years,” the official said. “However, the condition of other 12-km road in the industrial estate is good. We had sent a proposal for resurfacing of various bad roads with total length of 14 km in Satpur industrial estate to our head office in Mumbai and it has finally got the approval. Now, these old roads will get a facelift,” he added. There are over 1,500 units operational in Sinnar industrial areas and there are huge movements of the containers for transporting industrial goods. Ashish Nahar, an office-bearer of the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture (MACCIA), said the condition of most of the roads in Sinnar industrial areas have deteriorated and around 50% of them need resurfacing. “It is a positive development that MIDC is undertaking resurfacing of bad roads, but the tender process should be completed at the earliest,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/admin-okays-resurfacing-of-bad-roads-in-sinnar-estate/articleshow/88459804.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Lucknow||BJP fulfilling Charan Singh’s dream for farmers, says Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Invoking former Prime Minister and farmer leader Chaudhary Charan Singh on his 119th birth anniversary, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday asserted that the BJP government at the Centre and the state were “fulfilling his dreams by taking all possible steps for the welfare of farmers”. He pointed out how the Ramala sugar mill in Baghpat district, which happened to be the ‘karmbhoomi’ of Charan Singh, was revived by his government after a gap of 30 years. Speaking at an event to felicitate farmers and agricultural scientists on the occasion of ‘Kisan Samman Diwas’, Yogi said the steps taken by the Centre for the welfare of farmers since 2014 have been unprecedented and commendable. “Before 2014 (when Congress-led UPA was in power), farmers were forced to commit suicide. So was the case with UP before 2017,” he said, drawing a contrast with the BJP government which, he said, took various policy decisions to ‘increase farmers income’. He also highlighted PM Kisan Samman Nidhi as a ‘major initiative’ in the interest of farmers. Yogi’s insistence marked BJP’s renewed attempt to reach out to the farming community which has been staging a raging protest against the three farm laws that were later annulled by the Centre. The CM’s statement was also a message to farmers in west UP region which was affected by the farmer stir even as the opposition ranks, especially the SP and its ally Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), harped on the issue to take on BJP in the run up to the polls. Yogi said that even though the announcement of providing minimum support price (MSP) to farmers was made in 1966 but its actual implementation was done under the Narendra Modi government which ensured an MSP at the rate of 1.5 times the cost of cultivation. Training guns at the previous state governments in UP, Yogi said the farmers were either forced to quit farming or got weighed down with massive debt due to ‘irrational and unscientific’ agricultural policies. He recalled how after coming to power in 2017, his government came up with a Rs 36,000 crore loan waiver scheme for the benefit of 86 lakh farmers. “Several irrigation schemes which have been pending for years are now getting completed and an additional 22 lakh hectares of land is now being irrigated,” he said. Yogi also put the previous state governments in the dock over the ‘absence of a procurement policy’ and allowing middlemen in the sale and purchase of food grain. He pointed out that the total paddy and wheat procurement had increased in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-fulfilling-charan-singhs-dream-for-farmers-says-yogi/articleshow/88462840.cms||---

Senior DoT officials said that among the technologies being tested are 360 degrees virtual reality content playback, a virtual-reality connected classroom, where student feels they are being attended to personally by their teacher and can interact one-on-one with their teacher via voice chat or exercises. Another area that is being tested is 5G immersive gaming and artificial intelligence assisted 360 degrees cameras with real-time video streams. Another potential use of 5G technology that the DoT plans to test is where end users can get a 360 degree experience, where the user can also identify objects and people in a given environment. On Thursday, the Gujarat DoT LSA team comprising DDGs Ajatshatru Somani, Roshan Lal Meena, directors Sumit Mishra and Vikas Dadhich, along with technical teams of Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) and Nokia, visited the 5G testing sites of Gandhinagar. On November 19, the DoT team checked speeds at the Mahatma Mandir 5G site in Gandhinagar city, which was found to be about 1.5 Gbps, about 100 times faster than 4G. The speed test was done on non-standalone 5G mode.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/indias-first-rural-5g-trial-begins-at-ajol/articleshow/88461660.cms||---

Justice T Vinod Kumar gave the direction while hearing a petition accusing M Devender Reddy, president of Konapur Primary Agricultural Cooperative Society (PACS) in Ramayampet mandal in Medak, of misappropriating Rs 2.26 crore form the society’s funds. Devender Reddy is the husband of TRS MLA Padma Devender Reddy. The petition was filed by society’s two directors, N Mahipal Reddy and Ch Siddiramulu. Arguing the case of the petitioners, counsel K Pratik Reddy said though the inquiry by the cooperative department established the guilt of the society president, the officials chose to look the other way. “They have not acted on the report,” Reddy said.

---||Coimbatore||When son of the soil locked horns with brick kiln mafia||Thadagam S Ganesh, 44, whose lone fight culminated in the closure of 183 illegal brick kiln units in Thadagam area in Coimbatore this year, was perhaps thrust into the most personal battle of his life."My son fell sick due to pollution caused by the kilns. Doctors advised me to move my family out of Thadagam, which is my birthplace. But instead of leaving, I chose to fight for my rights and protect my people,’’ Ganesh told TOI. Thanks to him, for the last six months, Thadagam has been free from pollution as illegal kilns have been closed. "I could count the kilns in Thadagam in 1995 on the fingers of one hand. As the owners made huge profits, by 2020, as many as 183 kilns were operating here, all of them illegal," said Ganesh. "The area is rich in red soil, which is used to make bricks. Brick kiln unit owners illegally mined 9,500 acres of land, including government lands and stole soil worth Rs 1.80 lakh crore. They dug the land as deep as 40 feet to steal soil using earthmovers between 2010 and 2019." Ganesh, who studied only till Class XI, was managing his father’s pump manufacturing business and dabbling in agriculture when he was elected councillor from ward 1 of Chinna Thadagam village panchayat in 2001. "I also supplied machines to the kilns. What’s more, my brother-in-law was running a brick kiln unit in Thadagam," he said.By 2019, tipper trucks carrying soil used to crisscross Thadagam 600 times a day. "Residential areas and agricultural fields in Thadagam to Kanuvai were covered with layers of dust. People were not able to wear white dhotis and shirts. It prompted activist-turned-farmer T M S Rajendran and a section of people to launch a protest against illegal sand mining," said Ganesh, who joined them when the situation worsened."Many people in the locality suffered respiratory problems due to pollution. My son was admitted to a hospital in 2019. After examining him, doctors told me to leave the place. When I requested brickkiln unit owners to stop illegal mining, they asked me to shift my family to Coimbatore city. But I decided to fight the mafia. With the help of the social activist, we obtained documents from the government, which revealed that the none of the kilns had permission to operate," said Ganesh.In December 2020, Ganesh and a relative stopped a tipper truck carrying soil at an agricultural field. "Kiln owners threatened us, but we informed government officials, who reached the spot only after two hours," he said. "Whenever a new government came to power, the brick kiln unit association would appoint ruling party men as its office-bearers. All politicians were hand in glove with the mafia and would threaten those who opposed them."Ganesh, who continued to challenge the mafia, was arrested and was kept in Pollachi sub-jail for 10 days in January. "Social and environmental activists filed public interest litigations before the Madras high court and based on the court order, illegal brick kiln units were closed in March. The unit owners are trying to revoke the court order. But we are sure that justice will prevail," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/when-son-of-the-soil-locked-horns-with-brick-kiln-mafia/articleshow/88462247.cms||A Subburaj

Once accomplished, the additional infrastructure will help to accommodate more trains originating from Coimbatore, Podanur and Mettupalayam stations.The ministry of railways came up with the response to an online query on railway infrastructure development in Coimbatore district by J Sathish, coordinator of the Coimbatore Development Council. Sathish had asked about the infrastructural constraints in the Coimbatore – Mettupalayam line. He asked for a pit lane, stabling line and maintenance facilities at the Mettupalayam station. Two trains cannot cross in the single line between the 33km stretch from north Coimbatore to Mettupalayam due to lack of crossing stations in between. Without having the required infrastructure, additional trains cannot be operated on the route.Responding to the query, the ministry informed that additional lines for maintenance of coaches is under consideration in Podanur station. However, the platform running line extension work for provision of crossing of full-length trains at Karamadai station is under progress in a phased manner. On completion, it will enable crossing of trains in the single line section between Coimbatore north, Mettupalayam – Coimbatore north section. Thudiyalur and Periyanaickenpalayam are the halt stations in the section and development of the stations into fully-functional crossing stations will be considered based on line capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/additional-lines-to-be-set-up-at-podanur-stn-for-maintenance/articleshow/88462237.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Armed with RTI, he fights to retrieve OSR lands||It was sheer coincidence that S P Thiyagarajan’s first battle to retrieve an encroached land started in 2005, the year which marked the birth of Right to Information Act, a potent tool that he uses extensively in the battle against encroachment. Since then, the activist, often referred to as `RTI’ Thiyagarajan, has helped retrieve 26 acres of land from 51 places in the city, which is worth more than Rs 300 crore as per the current market value.It all started in 2005 when GRG Nagar residents’ association in Sowripalayam, of which he was a part of, took efforts to retrieve 26 cents of land earmarked for children’s park from encroachers. After an eight-year struggle, he managed to retrieve the land, thanks to a Supreme Court order.While other members were content with their achievement after retrieving the land, Thiyagarajan took forward the fight and helped retrieve encroached land across the city. Now, many of them are beautiful parks, providing lung space for residents."I did not know anything about OSR land when we initially started. I used to run from pillar to post. Then, I made myself thorough with the rules and regulations connected to it. That’s when RTI came in handy. I would get the documents I require through RTI to establish facts and expose irregularities," he said.It is mandatory that 10% of the land of proposed layout should be left as OSR and handed over to the local bodies concerned. Most of the layouts came up in the city in the 1980s. The OSR lands fell into the hands of encroachers, thereby shrinking open space in residential localities. Many OSR lands were sold to gullible buyers, who lost their hard-earned money.Now, aged 49 years, Thiyagarajan, who has completed only schooling, remains a bachelor and lives with his elder brother and mother. After seeing his enthusiasm for public cause, his family members did not raise any objection. He works as a life insurance advisor to take care of his day-to-day expenses and to meet his requirements to file RTI applications and get documents."People would offer consultation fees after their land was retrieved, but I never accepted it,’’ Thiyagarajan says.Coimbatore corporation is the only civic body in the state to furnish ward-wise OSR lands data for the entire 100 wards. It was made possible because of the residents, who became aware of their rights pertaining to OSR and started mounting pressure on the establishment. He also ushers in transparency in the city corporation’s administration by filing RTIs to expose scams.Right now, more than 150 OSR sites measuring 25 acres are still encroached. Thiyagarajan has won several battles, but the war is far from over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/armed-with-rti-he-fights-to-retrieve-osr-lands/articleshow/88462252.cms||V Devanathan

Goswami was arrested last month along with prime accused, Vandit Patel, the owner of Rexon Salon in Bopal, and another friend, Jeet Parate. Goswami sought bail claiming innocence. His advocate submitted that none of the contraband recovered in this case was found in Goswami’s possession. Therefore, charges under the NDPS Act cannot be invoked against him. The district government pleader P M Trivedi vehemently opposed the bail plea and submitted that 1.299kg of various narcotics drugs — ganja, charas, magic mushrooms and shatter — worth Rs 3.52 lakh, were recovered from the prime accused. Goswami was in constant contact with him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bail-denied-in-bopal-drug-peddling-case/articleshow/88461691.cms||---

Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Anurag Gautam told TOI, “These people are not missing, but they are untraceable as their mobile numbers are either switched off or incorrect. We have already been working and ensuring that the situation doesn’t deteriorate the way it had during the second wave. We are monitoring every person returning from abroad. Even if returnees test negative, we monitor their condition for 15 days. Their samples are taken at the time of arrival itself to ensure they don't develop any symptoms of the virus.” Dr Gautam further said, “We are observing that Omicron cases are being reported from almost every part of the country, so we can’t say that it won’t reach Bareilly. But, we can ensure that the cases are traced on time before they infect others.” “We are relying on focus sampling and have also covered auto drivers for random testing as they are exposed to the passengers travelling from other states. Besides, our testing units are operational at the Bareilly airport as well. We are also banking on the vaccination drives. It is observed that vaccination has been successful in containing the infection. At present, the numbers of Covid-positive cases are low compared to the last season. The only worry is that people are not following the Covid guidelines, like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, which could prove costly as everyone in the country is not vaccinated,” he added. Meanwhile, two patients tested positive for Covid in Lakhimpur Kheri district. Their swab samples have been sent to Lucknow for further testing, and the reports are expected to come by Friday. “Both the patients have been home quarantined, and the health department is tracing their contacts for testing,” said Kheri CMO Shailendra Bhatnagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/omicron-scare-147-returnees-from-abroad-untraceable-in-bareilly-dist/articleshow/88460656.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||ED attaches Rs 100 crore assets of accused in IDBI loan scam||HYDERABAD: The Enforcement Directorate has provisionally attached Rs 100 crore worth assets of the accused in the IDBI bank loan fraud case. The accused fraudulently availed kisan credit card (KCC) fish tank loans to the tune of Rs 112 crore in the name of 143 benami borrowers from IDBI Bank, Rajahmundry. The attached properties are agricultural lands, fish ponds, commercial sites, plots and flats in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The ED initiated a money laundering investigation based on an FIR registered by CBI Visakhapatnam against the accused Rebba Satyanarayana and others. ED said Satyanarayana was the aggregator and an end beneficiary of the KCC loans sanctioned to the borrowers and that he had conspired with the officials of IDBI Bank. “He availed the loans in the name of his family members, relatives and acquaintances totalling Rs 112 crore. KCC loan amounts were transferred to the borrowers’ savings accounts (opened by Satyanarayana in their names). Later, it was withdrawn and handed over as cash,” the ED said. The accused purchased properties under his name and that of relatives and benamis’ names. He had also invested in his other export-import businesses. “Investigation under the PMLA has revealed that properties purchased by Satyanarayana were used to mortgage for getting other loans in their other business entities,” the ED said. ED alleged that Satyanarayana was taking cyclical loans to repay old loans and divert portions of sanctioned loans to run his various benami ventures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-attaches-rs-100cr-assets-of-accused-in-idbi-loan-scam/articleshow/88461686.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Delhi||Omicron variant: Lower risk factor a shot in arm||NEW DELHI: The risk of hospitalisation in patients infected with the Omicron variant is two-third of the risk posed by the Delta variant of novel coronavirus, a study conducted by the University of Edinburgh claims. It is based on a comparative analysis of hospitalisations among people affected by Covid-19 from November 1 to December 19 in Scotland where both Delta and the Omicron variants are in circulation. According to a working paper released online by researchers, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, 1,26,511 (0.67%) Covid-19 cases were caused by the Delta variant during the study period. Of them, 856 patients required hospitalisation. The number of Omicron patients during the same period was 23,840. Of this, only 15 (0.06%) required hospitalisation. The researchers also found that the third/booster dose of vaccination offered substantial — 57% — additional protection against the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 for Omicron. Another study from South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first detected, has also shown a similar trend of reduced risk of hospitalisation in Omicron cases. Importantly, very few people in South Africa have received a third/booster dose. According to the South Africa study, which has been posted on medrxiv.org and is again yet to be peer-reviewed, 10,547 people were detected with the Omicron variant between October 1 and November 30. Of them, 261 (2.5%) required hospitalisation. In comparison, 12.8% — 121 out of 948 — patients infected with the Delta variant were hospitalised. However, once hospitalised, the odds of severity did not differ between individuals with Delta and Omicron infection, they found. Older age and presence of a comorbid condition was associated with severe illness, the study adds. Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and public health system expert, said the two studies confirmed what had been said for long — that Omicron was unlikely to cause severe illness and, therefore, the fears of a wave of infections that could turn into a crisis of the proportion of the second wave in India was rare. He, however, added, “Nearly 60% of our adult population is fully vaccinated. We need to reach the 100% target soon. Also, the new variant is known to be more transmissible and, therefore, we need to augment the facility for testing,” he said. Dr Lahariya also said the governments needed to equip primary healthcare facilities for easy OPD consultations as hospitalisation needs were likely to be lesser than the second wave. Dr Rajesh Pandey, principal scientist at CSIR-IGIB, said a door-to-door vaccination policy might be taken up to speed up the process. “Aggressive testing, surveillance, contact tracing and importantly sequencing from the remote/rural areas for proactive preparedness towards possible spread also require special attention,” he added. Initially, the Omicron variant was limited among international travellers, but epidemiologists say the sudden spike in Covid cases in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities suggests that it may have spread in the community as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/omicron-lower-risk-factor-a-shot-in-arm/articleshow/88462279.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Meerut||Admin seals Kanav Ashram over govt land claims, panel members meet DM||Bijnor: Bijnor sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vikramaditya Malik has sealed Kanav Ashram on Wednesday, prohibiting the entry of its purported committee members. The district administration officials claimed that the ancient ashram was illegally grabbed by a few people who claimed themselves to be panel members of the ashram, but the institution belongs to the government. The committee members, who claimed to have all the legal documents of the institution, met the district magistrate (DM) here on Thursday and sought his urgent intervention. A team of the revenue department reached the ashram on Wednesday and pasted a copy of SDM's order on its wall declaring it as a "government property". The SDM has served a notice to members of ashram's committee and asked them to show legal papers. “We have sealed the ashram as it is government's property built on village panchayat land. This building belongs to the government and not any committee,” the SDM added. Padam Singh, resident of Bakarpur village and the purported treasurer on the committee, said, “There is 62 bigha land of ashram's trust here on the banks of Malan river. The trust was formed in 1962. Our trust has legal papers." Noteworthy, king Bharat whose name inspired India’s Hindi name, was believed to have lived in Kanav Ashram on the banks of the Ganga. The ashram, in Bijnor’s Rawli village, is also considered to be the site where the story of Abhigyanam Shakuntalam, arguably one of the most famous pieces of Sanskrit literature, unfolded. Sources said that the ashram had around 62 bighas of land but a big chunk of it was grabbed by some villagers. Land has not been demarcated as of now and freed from possession. The local administration reportedly sealed only the land on which the ashram was built by committee members after collecting donations from surrounding villagers, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/admin-seals-kanav-ashram-over-govt-land-claims-panel-members-meet-dm/articleshow/88460663.cms||Harveer Dabas

---||Hyderabad||Report: WFH may decentralise IT/ITeS||Hyderabad: With Covid-19 changing the work dynamics as work from home (WFH) gains global currency, this may lead to the decentralisation of IT/ITeS companies from tier-1 to tier-2 cities due to the presence of a rich talent pool, said a CREDAI-Anarock report that was unveiled during CREDAI Telangana’s first TS conclave here on Thursday. The report, `Telangana – a state on the move’, said IT companies are already exploring tier-2 destinations such as Warangal, Karimnagar and Nizamabad as the next IT/ITeS destinations. IT/ITeS activities are currently by and large concentrated in Gachibowli, Madhapur and Nanakramguda in Hyderabad, the report pointed out. Talking about Hyderabad’s residential realty market, the report pointed out that the demand and supply continues to be very skewed towards western and northern zones and there is an urgent need to decentralise realty development and move towards other regions. “While the physical infrastructure has already been established to create momentum for development in the eastern and southern regions, some incentives and focus by the government will be influential to generate interest from buyers, investors and developers. It will also help reduce the burden on the existing infrastructure in the western and northern zones and create opportunities for holistic development across the city,” it added. The report also pointed out that to enable holistic growth across the city there is a dire need for residential realty developments to be spread across various sizes and budget segments. “A high concentration of mid-end and high-end segments and a practically low supply of affordable housing may not augur well for the economic diversification planned by the government,” the report cautioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/report-wfh-may-decentralise-it/ites/articleshow/88461694.cms||---

The government has instructed to celebrate the festival in simple manner. According to the guidelines, setting up of stalls or shops should be avoided on the campus of churches. The programmes or processions that can attract a large crowd should be restricted. The government also instructed to avoid huge gatherings at public places or on roads. The state government also appealed to residents to follow the noise pollution norms. It also requested the citizens to strictly follow all the Covid guidelines and protocols issued by the various departments and municipal corporations to tackle the Covid situation properly. Health officials have appealed to the citizens to abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour, including double masking and social distancing, to keep the infection at bay. “Especially during the festivities, the number of cases tend to rise, but if people follow the norms, it can be contained,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/50-cap-on-attendance-at-churches-in-pune-civic-limits/articleshow/88461707.cms||---

The water samples were tested after scores of cholera cases were reported from the area including the death of an elderly woman. The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) reported 10 cholera cases on Wednesday in its health bulletin. Seven out of these 10 cases were from the Junighadi area. VMC officials, however, said that there was some error in reporting of cases leading to the high number. On Thursday, no new cases were reported in the area. The east zone of the VMC conducted tests for water contamination in the affected areas. In all, 125 samples were tested in Junighadi area and one was found to be contaminated. In another case, a sample was found contaminated in the Sayajipura area on the outskirts of the city. In both the samples in Sayajipura as well as Junighadi, the reason for contamination was sewage. The opposition Congress party also visited the affected areas. Congress leader in the VMC elected wing Ami Ravat said that complaints of contamination were being made since quite some time, but were not being attended to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sewage-contamination-detected-in-water-supply-line/articleshow/88460910.cms||---

---||Delhi||Tardy probe: Court orders case transfer to different IO||New Delhi: A Delhi court has directed the DCP concerned to transfer a property dispute case from the present investigating officer (IO) to another official, saying it felt that he would not be able to reach “the truth of the matter”. The directions came after the IO filed contradictory replies before the court. Additional sessions judge Lovleen noted that from November 9 till the last reply, the police had a consistent stand that the complainant was in possession of a portion of the second floor of the property for the last 30-32 years. The court said the stand was also reiterated in the November 24 report filed by the DCP. However, it added that on December 21, a brief reply was filed by the IO that seemed to reflect that the police had taken a “somersault” as far as possession of the portion was concerned. The reply stated that the last tenants were inducted by the complainant and they had vacated the floor in August 2020. The court said IO has not been able to reach Rakesh Aggarwal, to whom the possession was allegedly given. “Iit is directed that the DCP concerned shall transfer the investigation of this FIR to some able officer who shall make an honest endeavour to reach the truth of the matter,” the court said. Advocate Sanjay Sharma, appearing for the complainant, had said that the accused’s submissions regarding peaceful possession of the property having been transferred to him were fabricated.

---||Nagpur||Tigress attributed multiple kills gets trapped in pipe, rescued||Chandrapur: A tigress trapped in a culvert pipe on Chintal Dhaba-Ashta road in Pombhurna range was rescued on Thursday evening. It was a stroke of good luck for the forest department, as the tigress turned out to be the one responsible for multiple human kills in the area. The tigress was seen prowling through the fields around village Chek Ashta since the morning. The beast is learnt to have killed a goat in the farm, and later farmers in the area tried to scare it away by making a din. The feline, while trying to cross the Chintal Dhaba-Ashta road crept through a narrow pipe culvert. The pipe being constricted, the tigress got trapped in it. On hearing its roars, farmers soon discovered it was trapped. The video by one eyewitness showed the beast has a serious injury on its face. Rescue teams of the forest department rushed to the spot and installed a cage at one end of the pipe. Rescue workers working from behind forced the tigress to crawl ahead into the cage. DCF, Central Chanda Forest Division, Arvind Munde confirmed this was the problem tigress responsible for attacks on humans in the area in recent months. The tigress had terrorized villages in Pombhurna tehsil by killing at least three people and injuring five others. Former forest minister and MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar and other BJP leaders were pressing for the capture of the problem tigress for many days. Regarding the injury on its face, Munde ruled out an accident with a vehicle. Sources said it is likely to be from crude bombs, often used in rural areas to scare away intruding wild boars. An irked villagers may have put a bomb into the tiger’s kill, leading to explosion when chewed. The injured tigress was taken to Transit Treatment Center for wild animals at Chandrapur after the rescue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tigress-attributed-multiple-kills-gets-trapped-in-pipe-rescued/articleshow/88461703.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Delhi||Delhi: Ready to deal with up to 1 lakh case per day, says CM Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: A close eye is being kept on the spread of the Omicron variant and Delhi government is fully prepared to handle up to one lakh cases every day in the worst-case scenario. This was said by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal after chairing a review meeting on Delhi’s Covid-19 situation on Thursday. “Everyone is extremely concerned about the Omicron variant. It is being reported to be a highly transmissible variant all over the world. The two major characteristics of this variant are that it is mild, with fewer hospitalisations and casualties. We have taken precautions in light of these considerations,” said Kejriwal. During the second Covid-19 wave, the capital witnessed a peak of 26,000-27,000 cases a day. “This time we are preparing for even one lakh cases per day. As the intensity of the variant is very mild, we would like to appeal to all people to stay in home isolation and not rush to hospitals unless your symptoms are severe,” said the CM. Mentioning that since the new variant could spread quickly, Kejriwal said Delhi’s containment infrastructure was being strengthened, including increasing testing capacity. “The current rate is around 60,000-70,000 tests per day, but we can conduct up to 3 lakh tests, if necessary. We are strengthening the home isolation model to an unprecedented level. Till now, our home visit capacity was around 1,000 cases a day. We are now escalating it to one lakh cases a day,” he added. Kejriwal said as soon as someone tested positive for Covid-19, they would get a phone call from the government and a team would visit their house and give them a kit with all required items, including an oximeter. “From then on, doctors will counsel them every day till they get cured. Agencies that are needed to be on-boarded for this arrangement will be employed within a couple of days,” he added. Sufficient healthcare manpower was being prepared, apart from buffer stock of medicines for two months. “A major problem during the second wave was related to oxygen. Even when Delhi was being allotted oxygen, it could not be transported due to lack of trucks as we had never needed such infrastructure. We are now bringing in 15 trucks that will be able to transport oxygen. These trucks will arrive in three weeks,” said Kejriwal. “We believe that Delhi will not face a very strong wave and hopefully the situation will not get severe. The last serological survey showed that 95% Delhiites had antibodies against the novel coronavirus and 99% people eligible for vaccination had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Over 70% are fully vaccinated. In case another wave comes, it is expected that its impact will be mild. But if the situation gets dire, Delhiites need not worry,” the CM said. Delhi government, in a statement, said approximately 37,000 Covid beds and 10,594 ICU beds had been prepared on the chief minister’s orders. If the infection spreads, plans have been made for 100 oxygen beds to be set up in every ward of the city within two weeks, which would mean 65,000 beds in total.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-to-deal-with-up-to-1-lakh-cases/day-kejriwal/articleshow/88462300.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt refunded Rs 35 crore to patients overcharged for Covid treatment||MUMBAI: The state government has helped refund Rs 35 crore to patients who had complained of excessive charges by private hospitals for Covid treatment. Health minister Rajesh Tope informed the legislative council that the government had set up two websites for patients to lodge their complaints. “Patients could file their complaint online with the district collector or with the municipal commissioner in corporation areas. They could also complain directly to the state government. We received around 63,000 complaints against non-empanelled hospitals. We scrutinised the bills and around 53,000 complaints were resolved. The government ensured refund of Rs 35 crore,” he said. In case of hospitals empanelled with the government under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Arogya Yojana, the government received around 2,000 complaints, of which 734 were resolved and Rs 1.2 crore has been refunded, said Tope. The issue was raised in the council through Question Hour by MLCs Sadashiv Khot, Gopichand Padalkar and others. Khot pointed out that though the government had taken over 80% of the beds in private hospitals for covid treatment and fees were regulated, several cases of patients being fleeced have been brought forth in the September 2021 report of the Ekal Mahila Punavasan Samiti, Public Health Campaign and the Public Health Coordination Committee report. In May last year, the government had allowed municipal commissioners of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Panvel and Thane to take charge of 80% of total beds in private hospitals while capping the cost to lowest rates applicable in their respective GIPSA-PPN (General Insurance Public Sector Association – Preferred Provider Network).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-govt-refunded-rs-35cr-to-patients-overcharged-for-covid-treatment/articleshow/88462889.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||MLA Ramesh’s citizenship case adjourned by Telangana HC to Jan 29||HYDERABAD: Justice B Vijaysen Reddy of the Telangana high court on Thursday adjourned the case pertaining to the citizenship row over Vemulawada MLA Chennamaneni Ramesh to Jan 29 for a full-fledged hearing. The legislator’s counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana found fault with the union home ministry who ignored the high court order. When the central government unilaterally terminated the Indian Citizenship of the legislator, HC in July 2019 asked the central government to consider the issue in tune with section 10(3) of the Indian Citizenship Act, the counsel said. This section says that the Centre can deny or cancel citizenship to only such individuals whose continued presence in the country would prove to be a danger to the public order in the country. If there is no such danger, then the centre should not cancel the citizenship of an individual, he said. Despite specific direction from HC to view the issue from this perspective and make a decision, the Centre did not do that and was hell-bent on cancelling Ramesh’s citizenship, Venkata Ramana said. The tussle arose when Adi Srinivas, congress leader who lost the election to Ramesh at Vemulawada, made a complaint that Ramesh who came to India in 2009 without relinquishing German citizenship, obtained Indian citizenship by suppressing details about his stay in India prior to his application for acquiring Indian citizenship. The Centre in its probe found that the legislator suppressed details about his mandatory stay in India prior to his application and terminated his citizenship earlier. The Congress leader’s counsel V Ravi Kiran Rao said that the legislator is still continuing with his German Citizenship and was using his overseas citizen card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mla-rameshscitizenship-caseadjourned-byhc-to-jan-29/articleshow/88461708.cms||---

CR general manager An-il Kumar Lahoti said, “We’ll review the running of AC services on Thane-Panvel Trans-Harbour and CSTM-Panvel Harbour lines. After commissioning of the Thane-Diva project, we will introduce more AC services as and when rakes are made available.” At present, the fifth and sixth lines operate between LTT-Thane and Diva-Kalyan. After the Thane-Diva corridor is commissioned, more lines will be available for suburban services as long-distance trains will be diverted on the new lines. “Commuter footfalls in AC trains are poor on Harbour and Trans-Harbour lines with average daily ticket sales of 45-60. On Main line, it is 150. By augmenting AC services on the Main line, commuters will be assured better frequency,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cr-to-shift-ac-trains-to-main-from-harbour/articleshow/88462899.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Nagpur||Forest authorities asked to attend sarus cranes hearing||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) has asked forest authorities to be present before the court on January 5, 2022 at 2.30pm in the suo motu PIL regarding survival of sarus cranes in Gondia district. None of the government officials were present for the latest hearing before the court. The court observed that the approach was not consistent with the goal of preservation of the environment and forest. The HC rejected the government pleader’s request to exempt the government officers from physical presence, since they have also failed to file a reply to notices issued a couple of months back. The petition pertains to survival of sarus cranes as a bird species in India. It has brought to fore the dwindling habitat of sarus cranes and the challenges faced by the authorities in protecting this species of bird, which is said to be the tallest flying bird in the world. The only habitat of this bird left in Maharashtra is situated in Gondia and Bhandara. Amicus curiae Radhika Bajaj informed the court that carcass of one sarus crane was found near Gondia recently. A local daily had reported the incident on December 14. The decomposed carcass of an adult sarus crane was found near Parawada Lake in Gondia. The court noted that it was most disturbing as per the news report that the partner of the dead sarus crane bird, if alive, would also die as these birds are known to live with the same partner their whole life. The cause of the bird’s death is still not known. “This loss is a further blow to dwindling population of sarus crane,” the court said. Amid this news, the absence of respondents and lack of reply from forest authorities compelled the HC to seek their presence on January 5.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/forest-authorities-asked-to-attend-sarus-cranes-hearing/articleshow/88461724.cms||---

Babies born with such low birth weight have least chances of survival, but in this case, the baby gained up to 1kg weight in 1 month, and started natural breathing. Doctors told TOI that Dinesh Chachere and his wife Shubhangi were blessed with a baby boy on November 11, but the baby was born in a complicated condition and was underweight. Doctors in a local government hospital kept the baby on ventilator and referred to GMCH Nagpur. “Earlier, the baby was kept on oxygen support and when they reached GMCH, the condition was worse. The baby was on ventilator. We took it as a challenge and started treatment,” said Dr Sayra Merchant, head of paediatric department. Associate professor Dr Mohini Apte, and nursing team under Arti Atram and Gunwanti Takod attended to the baby in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). After two weeks, the baby was shifted back to oxygen support from the ventilator. After 21 days, the baby started breathing naturally. The current weight of the baby is 1,430g and stays with his mother now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/baby-with-850g-birth-weight-saved-at-gmch/articleshow/88461728.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congress rides on BJP vote, wins zila pramukh post in Baran||JAIPUR: In a high-voltage election, state mining and petroleum minister Pramod Bhaya’s wife Urmila Jain was on Thursday elected Baran zila pramukh after one of BJP's zila parishad members voted in her favour. Congress also won zila pramukh posts in Ganganagar and Karauli, while BJP had to settle for the pramukh post in Kota. Meanwhile, in elections to the posts of pradhans in 30 panchayat samitis across four districts, the ruling Congress won 19 out of 30, while the BJP secured 10 and an independent candidate the remaining one. Taking a sweet revenge in Baran, the Congress party did what the BJP had done in the Jaipur zila pramukh election, when cross-voting by two Congress zila parishad members helped the BJP win the board. The BJP only had a thin majority of 13 seats in the 25-member Baran zila parishad board. The nearest rival Congress, which had secured 12 seats earlier, prevailed in the close contest. Congress party’s Jain secured 13 votes to defeat her rival Priyanka Sharma of the BJP who got 12. Following the declaration of the result in Baran, angry BJP workers pelted stones at the office of Jhalawar-Baran MP Dushyant Singh. Confirming the incident of pelting stones, Baran city DSP Manoj Gupta said the police were investigating the matter. In Kota, BJP’s Mukesh Kumar, with 13 votes, safely won the pramukh’s post defeating Congress candidate Geeta Megwal, who secured 10 votes, in a 23-member board. In Karauli, Congress candidate Shimla won the zila pramukh post unopposed. In Ganganagar, Congress party’s Kuldeep Indora won the zila pramukh’s post securing 26 votes in a 29-member zila parishad board. BJP’s Kavita won just three votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-rides-on-bjp-vote-wins-zila-pramukh-post-in-baran/articleshow/88462296.cms||---
---||Meerut||UP: After 400 hearings in 35-years, man acquitted for lack of evidence in illegal pesticide making case||MUZAFFARNAGAR: After 400 court hearings and 35 years of legal battle, 85-year-old Dharampal Singh – booked in 1986 for allegedly making pesticide illegally in his house -- has been acquitted for want of evidence by Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate-2 Mukeem Ahmed. "It feels like a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulder," said Dharmpal, a farmer of Haran village in Shamli district. His brother, Kunwarpal, was a co-accused but he died five years ago without getting justice. Another person, Liyakat Ali, booked in the case was earlier declared an absconder by court. “I have lost my reputation, money and mental peace during the long legal battle. It took long to get justice, but now I am happy that truth has prevailed. I would like to thank the honourable court for giving me relief. I have lost a lot of money and time making rounds to court for appearing in nearly 400 hearings in the case." On November 11, 1986, Thana Bhawan police booked two brothers, Dharampal and Kunwarpal, and one Liyakat Ali for allegedly making pesticide without licence. Police had also claimed to have recovered 26 bags of pesticide while they were being loaded into a truck. The three were booked under various sections of IPC, including section 420, and arrested them. After spending 18 days in jail, the three were released on bail. Dharampal’s lawyer Karan Singh Pundir said, "Kunwarpal had died five years ago, and Liaquat was declared a fugitive by the court during trial. The prosecution could not present even single evidence against my client Dharampal in court. Nor could it be proved that the seized material was pesticide Gammexane, as claimed by police, and not manure. The court order came on Wednesday." The trial went on for 35 years but police could not produce a single witness against the accused in court, said Pundir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/after-400-hearings-in-35yrs-man-acquitted-for-lack-of-evidence-in-illegal-pesticide-making-case/articleshow/88460692.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Meerut||Christmas cake aroma wafts through Meerut city lanes||Meerut: The strong whiff emanating from the chimneys of tens of bakeries located at the narrow bylanes of the city is a clear indication that Christmas is round the corner. These bakeries which generally remain obscure throughout the year suddenly come alive with hundreds of Christians making a beeline at these venues, carrying ingredients for Christmas cakes with them. It is customary for every Christian home to get a large number of cakes baked for distribution to family and friends. Since, it is not possible to bake such a large number at home, the task is outsourced to these bakeries. Says Ritu Scott, a resident of Mission Compound, “Getting cakes baked in a nearby bakery has percolated through generations in our families. It is a part of celebrations without which Christmas seems incomplete.” Although, the recipe is somewhat the same, personal preferences can make a difference in taste. For instance, Arun Edwards, who runs a preparatory school, prefers butter instead of ghee or vanaspati for soft and fluffy cakes. Similarly, Snehlata, a retired teacher, soaks raisins in rum 15 days before the baking process. Once brought home from the bakery, the aroma of rum pervades all over the house, tickling the palate of one and all. All the ingredients -- sugar, fruits, white refined flour, etc -- and their weight are predetermined by the baker. These are combined and poured into small casts by experienced hands and placed inside huge ovens run on wood fuel-based furnaces. None of these bakeries is fitted with electric ovens or equipped with mechanical churners. Mahender Gowan, a 60-year-old who has visited almost all bakeries in the city in the last 40 years, says, “Furnaces that use wood as fuel are better for baking than electric or diesel-based ones.” Bhupender Singh Rawat, owner of Rawat Bakers at Begum Bridge Road in Meerut,says, “Earlier, about 200 families availed of our services and we baked about 1,000 kilos of cakes, including those for confectionary shops. Last year was bad due to Covid, but this time, we expect handsome footfall.” Changing trends have also affected these bakeries. As Sudhir of Avon Bakers puts it, “We generally bake 200-300 kgs for individual families. However, many are opting for readymade cakes instead of getting cakes baked.” Admits Maneeka Abraham, "Earlier, women at home would spend hours cutting dry fruits, cherries, etc. into small pieces. People would wait patiently in long queues outside the bakeries. Now, caught up with busy lives, people are gradually opting for readymade cakes.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/christmas-cake-aroma-wafts-through-meerut-city-lanes/articleshow/88460704.cms||Sandeep Rai

It also came to fore that accounts and finance department is overlooking mandatory weekly audit, which would have unearthed the irregularities earlier. Senior PI of Sadar Police Station Vinod Chaudhari told TOI, “NMC accounts officer Rajesh Meshram has been booked like the earlier four. He cleared bills of bogus contracts,” he said. Meshram is the senior-most official after chief accounts and finance officer Vijay Kohle in NMC’s accounts and finance department. He is the first officer of NMC to be arrested in the case. He was among four staffers suspended on December 15. Also, departmental enquiry (DE) has been started against him. With Meshram, total arrests till date are five. Contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode, his nephew Atul, auditor of accounts and finance department Mohammed Afaque Ahmed, and senior clerk of general administration department (GAD) Mohan Padwanshi were arrested earlier. Sadar police are yet to arrest Sakode’s wife Sushma and elder brother Manohar. They were booked along with Sakode and Atul. DE has also started against Kohle and assistant commissioner of GAD Mahesh Dhamecha. NMC started DE against Dhamecha for sharing his user ID and password with Padwanshi, who misused it to approve bills of bogus contracts of Sakode’s firms. The standing committee sent copy of resolution passed in the meeting a day ago to NMC committee department for its implementation. As per resolution, a committee of three standing committee members has been constituted. BJP corporator Sanjay Balpande is chairman, with BJP corporator Pragati Patil and Congress corporator Asha Uikey as members. They will have to investigate all contracts approved in last five years within 15 days and submit report before standing committee. As reported by TOI on Thursday, no resolution has been passed by the standing committee to suspend any officials. NMC sources said, “Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar is yet to approve some more directives given during the meeting. He is likely to sign on it on Friday.” As per proposal tabled by two members of standing committee in the meeting, it is mandatory for accounts and finance department to audit accounts every week and submit report to standing committee. But the department is yet to submit report of last financial year, said members. They also said the scam would have been unearthed earlier if this rule had been followed. BOX Action So Far By Police * Offence under section 420 and other sections of IPC against contractor Padmakar ‘Kolba’ Sakode, his wife Sushma, elder brother Manohar, nephew Atul * Sakode and Atul arrested * Auditor of accounts and finance department Mohammed Afaque Ahmed and senior clerk of general administration department Mohan Padwanshi arrested * Hard disks of computers and CCTV footage from accounts and finance department and store room seized * Accounts officer Rajesh Meshram arrested||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-arrest-nmcs-no-2-accounts-officer/articleshow/88461738.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Delhi||Delhi reports 118 fresh Covid cases, positivity rate 0.19%||NEW DELHI: Delhi on Thursday recorded 118 new cases of Covid-19 and one fatality due to the viral infection. The positivity rate stood at 0.19%. Seven new cases of the Omicron variant were also confirmed. After Maharashtra, Delhi, at 64, has recorded the maximum number of Omicron cases. The new, highly transmissible variant is suspected to be the cause of increased incidence of the viral infection over the past two weeks. In the past 23 days, the government data shows, Delhi has recorded a daily average of 74 Covid-19 cases. This is the highest in the last four months. In August, September, October and November, the city recorded an average of 48, 37, 32 and 35 cases daily, respectively. The number of active cases has gone up significantly. At present, there are 684 active cases. Public health experts say the cases are likely to go up in the coming days due to the spread of the new variant. “While we cannot stop the surge, we can certainly halt its speed by adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour,” Dr K Srinath Reddy, the president of Public Health Foundation of India, recently told TOI. Dr Reddy pointed out that a sudden peak might overwhelm the healthcare infrastructure. “We may not have enough beds or homecare facilities to treat even 1% of the infected people if the overall number is, say, in thousands on a daily basis,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/118-fresh-covid-cases-positivity-rate-0-19/articleshow/88462320.cms||---

The district administration will issue regulations and SOPs for Christmas and New Year week. Hence, we have requested the administration to allow us to remain open past midnight on December 31,” Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurants and Hoteliers’ Association, told TOI. Presently, the eateries have been allowed to function until midnight with full capacity and they have been instructed to strictly follow Covid protocols. “We have instructed them to be alert. They have been requested to not go overboard. Restaurants on the New Year’s Eve are expected to function normally as any other day. The crowd might be more than normal and hence we have asked them to follow safety protocols,” Shetty said. The manager of a lounge at the Seasons Mall in the Magarpatta area said, “There are no guidelines but if sudden guidelines come after we have planned an event, it will result in major losses. We expect that we will be allowed to remain open until atleast midnight,” he said. A representative of a lounge located at Koregaon Park said there were no special events. “We have a permanent DJ who plays music each day. However, if that is banned by the administration, we have to accept it as we don’t want any trouble. We have a small dance floor but we are keeping it off limits already after the new variant started to spread,” he said. Shetty, when asked whether they were planning to request restaurants, hotels and lounges to limit their seating at half during the New Year’s Eve, said, “In many restaurants, staff strength is still a major problem and owing to the same, many are not running with full capacity. We have only asked them to follow all guidelines.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/hoteliers-seek-nod-to-operate-till-1-30am-on-nye/articleshow/88461732.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Meerut||In a first, economic offences wing of UP police secures extradition of Delhi couple from London||MEERUT: In a first by a state agency, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) in Meerut secured the extradition of a Delhi-based couple from London. The accused couple had allegedly duped hundreds of farmers in Bulandshahr of Rs 1.76 crore. EOW officials claimed that the fraud in Bulandshahr is just a tip of the iceberg and the duo has duped thousands in various cities across India in a scam that can go up to Rs 1,000 crore. Talking to TOI, Swapnil Mamgain, SP, EOW, Meerut, said, “This is first of its kind extradition in India, where a state agency managed to secure the orders of extradition from a foreign court. We will now follow the due procedure with the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and will bring the accused to India for further investigation.” Mamgain said it took over a year for the state agency to secure the orders of extradition of Virkaran Awasthi and Ritika Awasthi from Westminster court in London. The agency has been working on the case, lodged with Bulandshahr police in 2015, for the past three years, he added. According to officials, it all began in September 2015 when a Bulandshahr-based trading agency owner Lokender Chaudhary filed an FIR against Bush Foods Overseas Pvt Ltd, whose directors were the Awasthis, residing at Saket in New Delhi. A case was registered at Bulandshahr (rural) police station against the couple under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine, a forged document), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 506 (criminal intimidation).  The EOW in its letter to the MHA said that the fugitive couple also owes banks a whopping Rs 650 crore and another Rs 200 crore to paddy farmers and collection agencies.  The couple, soon after learning about the case against them, had approached the Allahabad high court to obtain a stay from arrest and also sought permission to go abroad. “Their arrest was stayed but the court did not allow them to go abroad. They then approached the Supreme Court and obtained permission to go to London for two months after furnishing Rs 86 lakh as security. The SC ordered Indian agencies to initiate the extradition process after the couple failed to return in May 2016 and since then, the EOW was trying to bring back the couple,” said an official involved in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/in-a-first-eow-wing-of-up-police-secures-extradition-of-delhi-couple-from-london/articleshow/88460721.cms||Ishita Mishra

The vessel, which was expected to be launched by the third week of December, will now be delivered next week, with a tentative launch date slated for the first week of January. “The builders of the ferry are yet to give us a clear date for delivery. We are mostly expecting it to be delivered either towards the end of this month or early January,” captain of ports James Braganza said. The electric-cum-solar ferry boat that is being built by Aquarius Shipyard at Divar will have an operational speed of 12 knots and will be able to ferry 60 passengers. In November 2018, a delegation from Goa visited Kerala which was the first to introduce the vessel. The CoP is also in the process of launching two new ferry boats that will be added to the RND’s fleet. The work order for the two new vessels is likely to be issued soon to Vijai Marine Services. The two vessels, estimated to cost around Rs 1.7 crore, will be much like the conventional ferry boats already operating in the state. They will serve as a replacement for two old vessels that were recently condemned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hybrid-ferry-launch-delayed-till-january/articleshow/88462353.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Dhanuka eyes spraying biz through drones||Nagpur: Agrochemicals company Dhanuka Agritech, which has recently acquired stake in a start-up making drones, plans to leverage its position after the government announced an SOP to allow the usage of drones in crop spraying. The SOP was issued a day ago, said the company’s chairman RG Agarwal at a press conference here on Thursday. The company will also be taking part in the Agrovision expo starting from Friday. “Around four months ago we had taken a stake in a start-up IoTechworld Avigation, which makes drones by the name Agribot. With the current SOP the use of drones in agricultural operations is expected to increase,” said Agrawal. Dhanuka is expecting to start the commercial services of drones to farmers by the next Kharif season. It would begin with commercial crops like horticulture, he said. This can include grapes and oranges. The company would be using its network of distributors to reach out to farmers with its services. Farmers dealing with fruits and other horticulture crops would be preferred as they are fast to adopt new technologies, Agrawal said. The company chairman said even as Dhanuka has advantage due to it its investment in the drone maker, other companies are expected to join the race soon. Drone operations is an emerging business in the farm sector and is expected to ease the job, covering maximum area. This would also lead to the requirement of trained pilots to handle the drones. The pilots need to get an approval from the DGCA, Agrawal said. With falling labour supply in farm sector, mechanization is expected to emerge as the solution, he said. Only the permitted pesticides would be sprayed through the service, Agrawal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dhanuka-eyes-spraying-biz-through-drones/articleshow/88461751.cms||Shishir Arya

In a review meeting on Thursday, the PM directed the government to work in close coordination with states to support their efforts on public health measures of containment and management under a “whole of government” approach. He also suggested sending central teams to states with low vaccination rates, rising cases and insufficient health infrastructure to assist them improve their capabilities. The strategy for a “proactive, focussed, collaborative and cooperative” fight against the pandemic should guide all our future actions, the PM told the officials, according to a government press release. Modi also asked officials to ensure that adequate number of Covid-positive samples are sent for genome sequencing. Till Thursday morning, 236 Omicron cases were detected through genome sequencing. However, these are only from the limited samples sent for genome sequencing and the actual number Omicron-infected cases is likely to be much more. The PM directed officials to conduct heightened and close monitoring of emerging clusters and hotspots through “active, prompt and effective” surveillance. He also highlighted the need to accelerate testing to ensure quick identification of cases, the government statement said. To ensure preparedness to tackle any upsurge in cases, Modi directed officials to ensure that the health systems in the states, beginning from the district level, are strengthened to meet any challenge. According to the statement, Modi asked officials to ensure that sufficient number of oxygen supply equipment is installed and fully functional in each state. He also directed officials to interact with the states regularly and review the status of preparedness of health infrastructure, including training and capacity-building of human resources, timely availability of ambulances, readiness of states to operationalise Covid facilities for institutional quarantining, and effective and supervised monitoring of those in home isolation, the statement further said. Earlier on Thursday, the health ministry also held a meeting with states and underlined the need to be vigilant and monitor case-positivity, doubling rate and clusters of new cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/satark-saavdhan-pm-urges-caution-at-covid-review-meet/articleshow/88463556.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Delhi||Delhi third most polluted city, AQI 423||NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality stayed “severe” for the third consecutive day and even worsened on Thursday, with the national capital becoming the third-most polluted city in the country after Faridabad and Noida. The pollution monitoring agencies predict further worsening on Friday. Though wind speeds were relatively moderate during the afternoon, the rise in humidity over the past 24 hours led to further worsening of the air quality. According to Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 423 as against 407 on Wednesday and 402 a day before. AQI was 452 in Faridabad and 432 in Noida. “The wind speed picked up to 15kmph towards the afternoon. But high humidity, which has risen by 25-30% over the past 24 hours, led to smog-like conditions,” said R K Jenamani, senior scientist at India Meteorological Department. Track the pollution level in your cityThe national capital has been recording “severe” AQI since Tuesday due to an active western disturbance that has led to less wind speed and rise in humidity, among various meteorological factors that are responsible for poor ventilation and more accumulation of pollutants. The particle pollutants, primarily PM2.5, kept worsening throughout the day. PM2.5 worsened from around 262.8 micrograms per cubic metres early in the day to 292 by 6pm. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metres. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality may improve from Saturday. “Increase ventilation, mixing and moist condition will reduce AQI from December 25,” SAFAR stated. According to the Union earth sciences ministry’s Decision Support System for Air Quality Management of Delhi, both local and external emission sources affected the city’s air quality. Local transport, industries, residential emissions, construction remained major contributors to Delhi’s PM2.5. From the rest of NCR, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bulandshahr and Muzaffarnagar districts were the major contributors. Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Thursday said over 96% of the 34,411 pollution-related complaints received on Green Delhi app launched last year had been addressed. “So far 32,897 complaints have been resolved,” said environment minter Gopal Rai. Out of the 27 government authorities responsible for taking joint action, the top five bodies to address pollution complaints are South Delhi Municipal Corporation (8,742 complaints), New Delhi Municipal Council (8,279), public works department (6,286), east corporation (4,347) and Delhi Development Authority (2,216).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-3rd-most-polluted-city-aqi-423/articleshow/88462340.cms||Kushagra Dixit

As per doctors, rest of the patients will be recovering at home without much serious symptoms. “So, there is no need to panic, instead, we must be prepared for the estimated 1% hospitalization,” they said. A senior member of the task force said they informed the divisional commissioner of the worldwide trend of Omicron variant. “Kids are largely unvaccinated in India and could be probable victims. But not more than 1% of the patients will require hospitalization. So, arrangements for the probable 1% should be done in Covid hospitals,” said the member. The paediatric task force has veteran Dr Uday Bodhankar, former IMA president Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala, head of GMCH paediatric department Dr Sayara Merchant, HoD paediatric department, IGGMCH Dr CM Bokde and HoD Paediatrics of Daga Hospital, Dr Vinita Jain. The task force also suggested the divisional commissioner to go ahead with reopening of schools as the spread is likely to remain under control as per the central government guidelines. “Bringing life to normalcy is also important and physical schools play most vital role in it. As far as the positivity rate is under 1% of total tests, we must go ahead with schools,” said a doctor. District collector R Vimala, NMC additional commissioner Ram Joshi, GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta, divisional deputy director (health) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and district health officer Deepak Selokar also attended the meeting.

Additional solicitor general T Surya Karan Reddy made this plea before Justice K Lakshman, who was hearing a petition filed by ED that questioned the action of the ED trial court. The trial court had thwarted ED’s attempt to arrest Srinivas and send him to jail. The ED court on December 18 refused to send him in judicial remand on the ground that the agency did not serve a prior notice on the accused under Section 41-A of CrPC. “We followed Section 19 of the PMLA and that is sufficient for us,” the additional SG said. Trial court judge did not record any reasons for refusing to send the accused in remand, he said. He simply returned remand application made by ED and the accused walked out freely. The trial court should examine the material placed before him and he must satisfy himself whether a prima facie case was made out to arrest a person. Then, he could pass an order either this way or that way. But in the instant case, he simply returned the remand application, which was not correct. “Let the accused be produced before the trial court again and let the trial court judge apply his mind and pass an order,” Surya Karan said. An ED officer, said that it was over Rs 1,000 crore. Madhucon had secured a highway laying project from Ranchi to Jamshedpur. Madhucon created a special purpose company, REL, for laying the road and availed bank loans. Case against two companies and their officials was that they swindled money without laying the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/loan-fraud-ed-knocks-hc-door-on-madhucon-honcho/articleshow/88461760.cms||---

Unveiling the statue of PN Panicker, considered as the pioneer of literacy and library movements, on Thursday in the state capital, he said that the service sector professionals from state, especially nurses and doctors, are highly respected and relied on by people everywhere. “Recently, when Covid affected the entire world, nurses and doctors from Kerala were among the most-visible Covid warriors in India, the Middle East and so many other regions of the globe. The people of Kerala enhance the pride of India,” he said. Expressing his fondness for the state, the president recalled the visit of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Kerala in 2000 who was then inspired to pen new poems. “During the five days he spent in Kumarakom on the banks of Vembanad Lake, both the poet and the thinker in him were inspired. He penned a series of musings, in which he wrote, nature’s silent beauty provides a perfect setting here for contemplation,” he said, adding that he is specially privileged to be in the capital, considered to be the abode of Lord Vishnu. He said the state has attracted people from all parts of the world, absorbed different cultures and religions while maintaining its distinct features. The people of the state have earned the respect and goodwill in the rest of India and in different parts of the world, he said. The president was all praise for governor Arif Mohammed Khan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. “The governor Arif Mohammed Khan and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan are among the most-experienced and sagacious personalities in the area of public service. I am glad that the people of Kerala are benefitting from the guidance of the governor and the leadership of the chief minister to scale even greater heights of excellence and inclusion,” he said. The president said that the ‘Sakshara Keralam’ movement became popular and effective due to the foundations laid down by PN Panicker and it led to Kerala becoming the first state to achieve 100% literacy. This had a multiplier effect on several other sectors, he added.  “Kerala leads other states on several indices of human development, including aspects of sustainable development. Successive governments have kept sustained focus on the agenda of growth and development. Therefore, the state has maintained its leadership position on several markers of excellence,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/covid-fight-prez-lauds-key-role-played-by-states-docs-nurses/articleshow/88460779.cms||---

The state government is spending close to Rs 800 crore for the construction of over 1,255 MFCs. The new godowns would create nearly 50 lakh metric tonnes of additional space for the storage of agriculture produces. The state government has designed the MFCs in such a way that farmers would not face shortage of godowns in their vicinity. The government has already finalised the tenders and set the target to complete the construction of godowns and other works before next March. According to the master plan cleared by the marketing department, about 1,255 godowns along with drying yards would be coming up as part of the MFCs. “We are planning to bring all the facilities into operations by the time Rabi produce arrives in the market. We have instructed the officials to expedite the works,” said agriculture and marketing minister Kurasala Kannababu. He said chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy found that absence of proper infrastructure for storage of agriculture produces is resulting in the distress sale by the farmers and hence wanted to create robust infrastructure for the agriculture sector. He said the chief minister has set his focus on creation of massive infrastructure linking with Raithu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) right from the day-one he took over the reins of the state. He said the works were little delayed following the outbreak of the Covid-19. The state government has finalised the tenders for 19 packages in four zones spread over the 13 districts. While the drying yards and godowns are coming up with Rs 550 crore, about Rs 180 crore would be spent on creation of other facilities at RBKs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/state-to-construct-1255-facility-centres-for-ryots/articleshow/88460783.cms||Samdani MN

Game, who was on a day’s visit to the Sansthan, reviewed the Covid situation at the temple-town in the wake of rising cases of Omicron globally and also considering that a large number of pilgrims visit the temple daily. “Given the threat of Omicron, the divisional commissioner has said the sansthan and the health department should work together and do RT-PCR tests of about 5,000 persons daily. The instruction is a part of precautionary measures to stop the spread of the infection here,” Bhagyashree Banayat, the chief executive officer, of the sansthan said. In Shirdi, about 25,000 devotees are allowed to visit the temple. Game has also asked the Trust to be ready with the liquid medical oxygen storage tank and also the oxygen generation plant in case of resurgence of covid cases. The hospital should also increase the intake capacity of oxygen beds so that the covid patients from the rural areas would not be compelled to visit the major towns and cities for the treatment if and when required. The officer also asked the sansthan to take steps for raising a genome-sequencing laboratory with the help of donors as the laboratory so installed could be beneficial for detection of infection and other things in the medical field.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/game-for-5000-rt-pcr-tests-daily-in-shirdi/articleshow/88459946.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kochi||Consumer panel orders refund to SUV owner||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala state consumer disputes redressal commission has ordered a foreign car manufacturer, its associate and dealer to refund Rs 28 lakh with 9% interest after they were found to have sold a luxury vehicle with faulty engine to the customer in 2011. Nissan Motors India Pvt Ltd, Hover Automotive India Pvt Ltd, the marketing and sales office of Nissan, and the authorized dealer EVM Automobiles Pvt Ltd in Kochi have been held jointly and severally liable for selling a faulty vehicle to Ettumanoor-based Jaison Lukose. The trio have also been directed to pay a compensation of Rs 2.5 lakh (with interest @ 9% for the mental agony and trouble he had to undergo by the actions of the opposite parties in supplying him a defective vehicle). The complainant is also entitled to Rs 50,000, the cost of litigation. The complainant purchased a Nissan X-Trail SUV from the dealer on April 12, 2011 by paying Rs 28 lakh. However, the luxury vehicle broke down in the middle of the road multiple times soon after purchase. The dealer could not identify the reason for the breakdowns, which first happened hardly a week after purchase. It had run just 780km at that time. It broke down again after a month with a heavy thud from the engine. The vehicle had to be towed to the workshop on both occasions. But the company engineers could not identify the reason behind the abysmal performance of the vehicle. The service engineers assured that the vehicle would run smoothly after it crosses 10,000km. But later, abnormal combustion operation was spotted. The opposite parties argued that they were ready to replace the engine, but the customer was not ready for the deal. “The vehicle in this case is one built and assembled in a fully-automated plant and imported to India as a fully-manufactured product. What is contemplated by the warranty can be construed only as referring to a part of the engine of the motor car and cannot encompass the engine as a whole. It is evident that the defect found in the engine was with respect to the synchronization of one of the cylinders with the other two…. the stand of the complainant in refusing to accept the replacement of the engine as a solution to his problems, cannot be found fault with. He is fully justified in being dissatisfied with the vehicle and insisting on a return of the amount paid by him as sale price of the vehicle,” said the commission order issued last week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consumer-panel-orders-refund-to-suv-owner/articleshow/88460797.cms||B S Anilkumar

During the hearing, Justice Devan Ramachandran said, “The tragedy with the present days is that busybodies feel they can comment about anything on social media under the impression that no accountability will come to be on them. Social media is good in the hands of the good and worthy. But for some, it is an unrestrained playground… One can only leave them to their mischief until the long arms of law reach them.” Though the registry was directed to take action as per law against former sub judge S Sudeep, Justice Devan said he is not initiating contempt of court action as it would give undue publicity to such action. “The greatest punishment I can give is to treat him as inconsequential and deny him his ‘15 minutes of fame’ trying to ride on this Court,” the judge said. Through the Facebook post, the former judicial officer had taken objection to the high court making enforcement directorate a party in the Monson ase. Though the court had issued a notice to Sudeep to attend the online hearing so as to hear his views, he had not attended. The court said the social media post was considered only because it was suspected as a malicious attempt to derail the probe. But he is a coward and doesn’t want to appear before the court, the judge said. “He’s just trying to be a self-proclaimed martyr; he’s hallucinating… I’m not going to glorify him by taking contempt of court action against him,” the judge stated while adding that he’s not bothered by personal attacks but would intervene if the attempt is to derail the case. “I’m not affected by all these… I am made of sterner stuff,” Justice Devan said. Considering the original case involving allegations against Monson, the court said there is no reason to suspect any foul play in the ongoing investigation at present. Enforcement Directorate’s counsel alleged that the crime branch team investigating the case is not sharing necessary documents but the state government told the court that necessary help will be provided.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/busybodies-feel-they-can-post-anything-hc/articleshow/88460852.cms||---
---||Delhi||Conduct Tree Census in Vasant Vihar: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday ordered a tree census in Vasant Vihar while taking stock of the progress made in deconcretisation of trees. Justice Najmi Waziri asked Delhi government’s PWD and forest department to coordinate and prepare a log book, having each tree numbered. HC’s direction came after reviewing the work by Delhi government and SDMC. The court was unhappy to note that, till now, its order to SDMC’s engineers to traverse Vasant Vihar colony on wheelchairs to test if pavements and footpaths were user-friendly had not been implemented. “What is the difficulty? Is it beneath your officers to use the wheelchair? If that is so, you have a poor opinion of the disabled. Court has passed a specific order,” Justice Waziri told the counsel for the corporation. HC made it clear that it expected immediate enforcement of the order. Meanwhile, Delhi government informed the court that representatives of SDMC and PWD had assured the forest department they were ensuring that a space of 1x1 metre was left around the trees. It has also been directed that the joint inspection of trees be conducted and the report contain block/streetwise number of trees concretised by the residents of the area and those concretised by SDMC and PWD, along with GPS-tagged photographs so that remedial steps could be taken. The government said it had directed SDMC and PWD to undertake the exercise of numbering the unnumbered trees so that the exercise of deconcretisation could be carried out efficiently. The forest department informed the court that trees from Modi Mill to IGI Airport (Outer Ring Road) and the Vasant Vihar residential area were being continuously watered and washed. The work is also being extended routinely to other parts of Delhi. “Additionally, with respect to the trees under the jurisdiction of PWD that have been deconcretised in Vasant Vihar, the area around these trees is also being revitalised, including by planting grass and plants,” the government submitted. The court acknowledged the efforts made by SDMC and PWD for the work undertaken by them in last four weeks and appreciated the same after going through the status reports. It, however, pulled up Delhi Police, saying there had been no compliance of its direction to remove cars parked on footpaths to improve public access. It directed the police to videograph its removal drive and submit a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/conduct-tree-census-in-vasant-vihar-hc/articleshow/88462354.cms||Abhinav Garg

This is considered to be highest growth rate the AP has ever witnessed. The Centre is also readying plans to invest close to another Rs 88,000 crore to develop national highways in next few years. Responding to a query posed by BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said the national highways in AP were doubled in the last seven years of Narendra Modi’s tenure. He said the total length of national highways which were spread over 4,193 km in 2014, have now touched 8,183 km with almost 100 per cent increase. Gadkari said the Centre is willing to develop important stretches of highways in Guntur district soon after getting the feasibility reports. Gadkari told Rajya Sabha that the detailed project report (DPR) will be soon readied for the stretches of Piduguralla to Vodarevu (167A) and Kondamodu to Perecherla (167AG). Bids for project management consultancy (PMC) services for preparation of DPR are in finalisation stage. Minister said the tender based estimate for engagement of project management consultancy services for preparation of DPR for the stretch from Macherla to Dachepalli (167AD), is being sanctioned. “Preparation of DPR would be taken up after award of the consultancy services. DPR for 4-lanning of Vinukonda to Guntur section of NH-544D is in progress and is likely to be completed by June, 2022,” said Gadkari. Highways between Piduguralla and Vodarevu, and Vinukonda-Guntur stretches play key role in bringing connectivity to the underdeveloped region of Palandu in Guntur district. He also informed that the bids for Nagarjuna Sagar to Davulapally section of NH-565 have already been received and are under evaluation for award of contract.  He said the work for Chilakaluripet bypass was delayed due to delay in achievement of financial closure by the concessionaire and consequent termination of contract. He explained that the contract has been revived through conciliation and the Centre has set a target to complete the project before 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/nhs-in-ap-doubled-in-7-years-gadkari/articleshow/88460838.cms||Samdani MN

After registering for the vaccine, the youth, identified as Rishikesh More, told the officials at the centre set up at Nehru Garden in Dombivli (E) that he wanted to use the washroom, but later fled. A video of the security guards and health staff workers trying to stop the man has gone viral on social media.The team alerted senior health officials who have decided to trace More and counsel him about getting the second shot. Dr Ganesh Dohiphode, in-charge of the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation’s vaccination programme, said, “We have instructed our health staff to trace the youth and give him the second dose of Covid vaccine.” Second shot coverage is emerging as a spot of concern, with the number of people who have not taken their second jab after completing the prescribed interval between two doses, crossing a crore in Maharashtra. The state has so far administered a single shot to 87% of its eligible population but the full vaccination coverage is around 55%.

Jadhav added that due to fear of the Omicron variant, some parents are still hesitant to send their wards to school. “Had this Omicron fear not been there, the attendance would have further increased,” he felt. Ever since the schools opened, the civic health department has carried out random RT-PCR tests of over 5,000 students and over 600 teachers. All of them have tested negative for Covid-19. NMC officials said that they are keeping constant checks and all the schools are following Covid appropriate behaviour. The principal of a private school in the city said that students are happily coming to school and enjoying physical classes. The strength of students, which was 40% in the beginning, has now increased to over 50%. Presently, there are a total of 504 civic and private schools in the city with 1.85 lakh students from classes I to VII. There is a total of 4,714 teachers in these schools. This includes 101 municipal schools with 23,440 students along with 799 teachers. The remaining 403 schools are private with 1.62 lakh students and 3,915 teachers. Earlier, the state government had allowed reopening of schools for classes I to VII from December 1, but the NMC commissioner had decided to defer reopening of schools up to December 10 due to Covid pandemic. But it later decided to reopen schools from December 13 by following covid appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/steady-rise-in-attendance-in-nashik-civic-pvt-schools/articleshow/88459967.cms||Tushar Pawar

Addressing a public rally, Gadkari said, “Late US president John F Kennedy had once said 'it is not true that American roads are good because America is a rich country. But, America is rich because its roads are good'. I truly endorse his words. We have done and are doing road development works of over Rs 11 lakh crore in western UP alone.” The minister, accompanied by Union MoS for transport VK Singh and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, added that these infrastructure projects will also open new avenues for people of the region and help in generating income. The 96-km long 14-lane Delhi-Meerut expressway will reduce travel time between the two cities to 45 minutes from the earlier 2 hours and 30 minutes. In 2016, PM Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the project, which was completed in four phases earlier this year. Though commuting on the expressway began long back, the National Highways Authority of India has now announced to start toll service on the same from December 25. Gadkari also hailed Chaudhary Charan Singh on his birth anniversary and said that he is happy to be here in Meerut today and remember the former PM who worked his entire life for the upliftment of farmers and for the dignity of rural India. Later, while inaugurating national highway projects in Muzaffarnagar, Gadkari said the new highways will help sugarcane farmers to easily transport their produce to sugar mills and markets, and it will "increase their income".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/will-change-face-of-west-up-in-next-5-yrs-says-gadkari-while-inaugurating-delhi-meerut-eway/articleshow/88460878.cms||Ishita Mishra

The peddler procured the cocaine from a Goa-based Nigerian to make a quick buck during the New Year celebrations and two of his techie customers on Thursday. The value of the seized contraband is Rs 26.2 lakh. Acting on specific information, Special Operations Team sleuths of Madhapur arrested Rameshwara Sravan Kumar (24) and his friend G Charan Teja (27) of Kondapur at Sravan’s flat in Ramky Towers near AIG Hospital at Gachibowli on Wednesday night. Police seized two grams of cocaine from the duo who informed police that the contraband was obtained from Mohammed Ashraf Baig (37), an Arabic tutor from Tolichowki. Police raided Baig’s house in Tolichowki and seized 181 grams of cocaine and 44 Ecstasy tablets. “Ashraf Baig has got cocaine from Goa-based Nigerian, Zude, to make profit during the upcoming New Year celebrations,” Cyberabad police commissioner M Stephen Ravindra said. Baig was planning to sell each gram of cocaine for Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 for New Year revellers, police said. A special team was dispatched to Goa to nab the absconding Zude. “So far this year, we have registered 202 NDPS Act cases and arrested 419 offenders. We will keep a strict vigil to prevent sale and consumption of drugs during New Year celebrations. A watch would be kept on farmhouses where some people might try to organise rave parties,” the CP said.

Even banks and shops are now asking customers their vaccination status before allowing them in. Malls and multiplexes in too are abiding by the directions of the NMC and the district administration. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said he has directed the officials to strictly follow the orders. He said teams have been formed to inspect shops and establishments, at random, to check for compliance. The Nashik traders’ association said it has already instructed the traders to put up banners informing customers not to enter the shops if they are unvaccinated. Prafulla Sancheti, the president of Nashik grain and grocery merchants’ association, said though this is a good decision, it will affect the traders’ relationship with customers. “We are putting up banners. However, the government machinery should hold the drive at the beneficiaries’ doorstep who are yet to take the vaccine,” he said. The district administration has made arrangements to ensure that every person entering the four office buildings at the collectorate are checked. “There is no intention to harass anybody, but to contribute in the fight against Covid,” said collector Suraj Mandhare. When contacted, officials from the city’s largest mall said they have already started the ‘No Vaccination, No Entry’ policy. “We have deployed adequate staff at all the entry points of the mall,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-vaccine-no-entry-drive-begins-in-nashik/articleshow/88459971.cms||Tushar Pawar

---||Vijayawada||Docs say lack of awareness was cause for infant deaths||Visakhapatnam: An expert team of doctors said lack of awareness in handling neonatal babies caused the death of at least 17 infants in a village in the Visakha tribal area in the past two years. A ZPTC had raised the issue during the ZP meeting. On the instruction of tourism minister M Srinivasa Rao, district collector A Mallikharjuna appointed a five-member rapid response team led by Andhra Medical College principal Dr. PV Sudhakar to probe the incidents. The team visited the tiny village Rudakota, a stronghold of banned outfit CPI Maoists, on December 20 and December 21. The village with a population of 800 people witnessed 17 infant deaths in the last two years including 10 in this year. Four children died all of a sudden, while five others died in the middle of the night. One died due to epilepsy and 10 others due to breathing-related issues, fever, and other problems, the doctors’ study revealed. Doctors found the mothers put the babies to sleep after breastfeeding which caused entry of milk into their lungs. They found oxygen percentage fair in the water and also in the environment. The team consisted of assistant professor doctor K Manoj Kumar, children’s specialist S Narayana Rao, gynecology expert K Venakta Ramana, microbiologist S Swapan,and SPM D Errayya. They explained various issues to the secretariat staff, PHC doctors, ANMs, and Asha workers including about delivery, infants and their safety measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/docs-say-lack-of-awareness-was-cause-for-infant-deaths/articleshow/88460877.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dropped from IFFI, ‘Dictionary’ set to be screened at 27th KIFF||Kolkata: International Film Festival of India’s loss might be Kolkata International Film Festival’s gain. Bratya Basu’s ‘Dictionary’ that was dropped from the Indian Panorama list this year, thus sparking a row, is being screened at the 27th edition of the KIFF. ‘Ami Soumitra’ — the last project that Soumitra Chatterjee shot before falling ill on September 30, 2019 — has been selected for the non-competition short and documentary panorama section of KIFF. Basu’s ‘Dictionary’ has been selected as the closing film at the 7th Jaffna International Cinema Festival and will have a physical screening on December 30 in Sri Lanka. Basu expressed his happiness that KIFF is screening the film post the “condemnable action” at IFFI. “Cine-lovers from across the world attend a prestigious festival like KIFF. I am glad that KIFF has selected my film on the basis of its merit and has given an opportunity to cine-lovers to watch my movie. This decision also shows how our state promotes good art without any bias,” Basu said. According to ‘Dictionary’ producer Firdausul Hasan, the film has already been submitted and an official confirmation is awaited. “A film should be selected on the basis of its merit and rejected on the basis of its demerit. I am against a film being rejected due to political reasons or citing technical flaws. I wouldn’t have had a problem if my film was not selected on the basis of merit at the Indian Panorama,” Hasan said. Basu added that it is “gratifying” that his two other films. The Indian competition will see Biplab Bandopadhyay’s ‘Dhulo Bali Katha’ based on the eponymous novel by Rabisankar Bal starring Basu, Supriya Dutta and Kanchan Mullick. Besides, Sayatan Mukherjee’s ‘Jhora Palok’ based on the life and works of poet Jibanananda Das starring Basu, Jaya Ahsan, Rahul Arunoday Mukhopadhyay, Debshankar Halder, Kaushik Sen, Supriyo Dutta and Biplab Bandopadhyay is in the Bengali panorama section. Interestingly, ‘Ami Soumitra’ is also helmed by Sayantan Mukherjee with Poulami Bose as the creative director. This 160-minute-long work is an “autobiographical documentary”. “We are glad that KIFF is hosting the first screening of it,” Mukherjee said. Bose said, "The concept is mine and since I had no prior experience in shooting, I asked Sayantan to film it," Bose said. A working still from 'Ami Soumitra'In the non-competitive Cinema International section, KIFF is screening Aparna Sen’s ‘The Rapist’. Vying for the Golden Royal Bengal Tiger award worth Rs 51 lakh for best film and Rs 21 lakh for best director in the Innovations in Moving Images segment are two Bengali films — Ishaan Ghose’s ‘Discards’ (Jhilli) and Madhuja Mukherjee’s ‘Deep 6’. ’Jhilli’, the debut feature film of Goutam Ghose’s son, Ishaan, traces the life of Bokul who works in the middle of Kolkata’s largest dump yard. “It took almost five years to finish the film. Screening at Torino Film Festival last month was wonderful. It’s a very special film festival and it feels great to have got some wonderful reviews there. But sharing the film with our own people is really special,” Ishaan said. ‘Deep 6’ was selected in the non-competitive ‘A Window on Asian Cinema’ section of the 26th BIFF. Director Madhuja Mukherjee didn’t want to reveal details about the KIFF competition just yet. “This film is important for viewers here in Kolkata because it is as much about the city and its life as it is about Mitul, the character played by Tillotama Shome,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dropped-from-iffi-dictionary-set-to-be-screened-at-27th-kiff/articleshow/88461812.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt suspends medical officer of Bhandup hospital as 4 infants die||MUMBAI: The state government on Thursday suspended a medical officer and announced a high-level probe into the death of four infants at the NICU in BMC-run Savitribai Phule maternity hospital, Bhandup, over a four-day period.BMC set up a panel comprising a neonatologist and a neurosurgeon from its Sion hospital to probe the deaths. Civic officials said the four neonates had underlying conditions that made them vulnerable. “Since the NICU opened in August, the mortality rate is 7% while WHO states that up to 10% death rate is acceptable (in NICU),’’ said a official. The deaths rocked the state assembly, with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis accusing the hospital of negligence and demanding action against senior staff. “Three infants died in last three days and a fourth died today. The cause was given as cardio-respiratory arrest due to septic shock,” he said. Fadnavis said the hospital took no action after its AC unit malfunctioned after short-circuit on December 18. “BMC is so wealthy. It has deposits worth Rs 50,000 crore but for three days, the hospital did nothing,” he said. An affected parent, Pramod More, told TOI that his newborn son was transferred from the BMC maternity home in Goregaon on December 15 soon after his birth. “We were told he had low birth-weight and needed NICU care,’’ said More. More said all four kids who died had dropping platelets and were given platelet transfusion. “I shared my fear with the authorities since the short-circuit occurred, but in vain. My son got one transfusion, we got another bag, but he died before getting it Wednesday,” he said. He and other parents were camping outside the five-storey hospital on Thursday and met several leaders to highlight “lack of good care” at BMC hospitals. “If the maternity hospital in Goregaon had a good NICU, we wouldn’t have needed to get our son here,” he added. A BMC official said one of the children brought from a civic nursing home in Mulund was diagnosed with a drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia bacterial infection. “The other three were premature or had low birthweight,’’ said the official. The issue evoked a strong response from political parties. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said the government would launch a probe before fixing responsibility but BJP leader Fadnavis demanded immediate suspension (of doctors responsible). “Usually, senior officials get away with negligence. In the last major case, action was taken against the hospital matron. There has to be a probe and suspension,” he said. Finally, Shinde announced the suspension of the hospital’s medical officer. BJP corporators, who protested near mayor Kishori Pednekar’s office, said the deaths followed the short circuit. They said that the NICUis not run by the BMC but by a private contractor appointed by BMC,’’ said on. BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde said, “The hospital management must be sacked and the management taken away from the contractor. The medical licence and registration of the private contractor should be cancelled at once,” Shinde said. BJP MP Manoj Kotak said. “Cause of death of the four infants is the same, so this is very serious... This shows the hospital is in poor shape and there is no health care.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-suspends-medical-officer-of-bhandup-hospital-as-4-infants-die/articleshow/88463271.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Continuous betel nut exposure leads to pre-cancerous stage: Experts||Nagpur: Underlining the detrimental effects of prolonged exposure to betel nuts, especially the chemically treated ones, senior medical oncologists said such habits can lead to pre-cancerous disorders like oral submucous fibrosis and leukoplakia, having potential to turn malignant. In a related development, city police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar on Tuesday chaired a multi-agency meeting involving Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and Enforcement Directorate, in which the blueprint of a collaborative plan of action was chalked out. Under Section 102 of the Criminal Procedure Code, police will seize betel nuts found under questionable circumstances and without supportive documents, Kumar said, adding FDA and other agencies would be involved too for taking actions further. Senior consultant medical oncologist Dr Amol Dongre said 33% of oral cancer in the world is from India. “Betel nut and tobacco are among the primary reasons for oral cancers, and their extended usage is considered high-risk behaviour,” said Dr Dongre. “Continuous irritation of the mucosa with prolonged consumption of betel nuts, tobacco and their products can lead to conditions like submucousal fibrosis and leukoplakia, which are associated with symptoms like non-opening of mouth and whitish patches inside. Around 4-18% of these complications eventually turn malignant,” he said. Another medical oncologist Dr Vaibhav Choudhury said there is a steady inflow of patients, including ones in their twenties, with complaints of oral cancer-like symptoms or pre-cancerous stages like submucousal fibrosis. “Restrictions of tobacco sale within close proximity of schools and colleges are in place, which helps, else there would have been rampant misuse by students,” said Dr Choudhary, extolling police action on the unscrupulous betel nut and tobacco traders. “Gutka, which is a mixture of many ingredients including betel nuts, is dangerous,” he said. Dr Dongre and Dr Choudhury also said women constitute a substantial chunk of their patients queuing up for treatment related to oral cancers. Meanwhile, CP Kumar said samples of the betel nut would be collected during police action. “One part of the samples would be sent to the food analyst at government laboratory to ascertain whether they were unsafe for consumption or sub-standard. The other part would be sent to the DRI’s laboratory in Bengaluru to ascertain whether the betel nut originated from India or elsewhere like Indonesia,” he said. Kumar said FDA has powers (under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006) to adjudicate if found sub-standard, or launch an FIR under Section 328 of the Indian Penal Code if it’s unsafe or hazardous for consumption. “It has been decided in the meeting that the poor quality betel nuts which have been discarded and are to be used as raw material at other industries (like agarbatti) should be kept separately in every godown with labelled demarcations,” said Kumar, adding the traders must procure godown licences from FDA to be able to use the premises for stocking. “Betel nut trader associations have been urged to be ethical and co-operate with the agencies by revealing the ones who are into foul practices. Police department would also help them conduct an internal sensitization programme, if they want,” said the top cop, adding that the transporters using fake travel receipts to ferry betel nuts would face action. CP at liberty to act against spurious betel nuts: HC Nagpur: Justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Pansare of Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday stated that the city police chief would be at liberty to take criminal action against all those indulging in illegal activities like import, distribution and use of sub-standard betel nuts and areca nuts for human consumption, provided reports of the concerned public analyst or any other authorized laboratory support the allegations. The HC bench issued the direction while hearing a PIL filed earlier, clearing grounds for city police to take action on the sub-standard betel nuts. The high court stated The Amicus curiae in the case senior counsel Anand Parchure had highlighted the dilemma of the city police not being able to act against the unscrupulous racketeers supplying sub-standard betel nut in the market. The PIL was filed by Dr Mehboob MK Chimthanwala through counsel RS Renu in 2016. The court had subsequently asked the CBI to take over four cases this year from Directorate of Revenue intelligence (DRI) after a dissatisfaction had surfaced over the ongoing probe followed by allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/continuous-betel-nut-exposure-leads-to-pre-cancerous-stage-experts/articleshow/88461805.cms||Soumitra Bose

Those who find this as ‘sin’ don’t realise that the livelihood of crores of people depends on cattle”. Addressing a charged gathering at Karkhiyao on Varanasi’s border with Jaunpur after kicking off the new phase of White Revolution in east UP on Thursday, Modi said, “Talking about cow and ‘Gobardhan’ (cattle waste) could be a crime for some, but cow is revered mother for us, who is worshipped. Those who mock cows and buffaloes forget that livelihood of eight crore families depends on the same.” Beginning his speech by paying tributes to legendary farmers’ leader and former PM, late Chawdhary Charan Singh, on his birth anniversary after gifting projects of Rs 2,100 crore, including foundation laying of Rs 475 crore plant of Amul, the PM said, “Strengthening the dairy sector is among the top priorities of my government. It is a trade of Rs 8.5 lakh crore per annum. This value is greater than the price of wheat and rice produced in the country per annum.” “Milk production in the country has increased by about 45% in the past seven years and India is producing 22% of the world’s milk, which is almost one fourth of the world's total milk production. The new energy added to the white revolution will play a major role in changing life standards,” said Modi, adding, “The global market is open for the dairy sector.” He said that being the largest milk producing state, Uttar Pradesh has a huge potential for growth in the dairy sector. “Our double engine government is extending all support to the dairy farmers. Establishment of Banas Kashi Sankul for Amul dairy products here is an evidence of joint efforts of the government and cooperatives as Banas Dairy, which played a leading role in cooperative movement, has come here to join hands with farmers of east UP. This venture is going to benefit lakhs of dairy farmers of Varanasi and surrounding districts, including Jaunpur, Chandauli, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Azamgarh, he said adding that it will add taste to Banarasi sweets also. “Cattle and animal waste will be utilised for bio-gas fuelled power generation plants to meet the energy requirement of dairy plants,” said Modi, mentioning another project of Rs 19 crore started by the National Dairy Development Board in Ramnagar in this regard. “It will help dairy farmers to increase their earning by selling cow dung and people will start taking care of stray animals,” he said adding, “Apart from bio-energy generation, the bio-fertilizer production will also increase and help farmer to switch to it from chemical fertilizers for improving quality of their soil.” He also announced that the government is continuing a mega drive to make farmers aware about switching over to natural farming in order to save soil and also future generations. “Is the cheapest and best way for farming while the price of organic products is also better than the food grains produced with chemical fertilizers,” he said, calling upon startups to explore enormous potential in natural farming.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/talking-about-cow-is-crime-for-some-but-we-revere-cow-as-mother-says-pm/articleshow/88462384.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Delhi||Plan in works to cut travel time by road from Delhi to Lucknow to less than 4 hours: Nitin Gadkari||GHAZAIBAD/ NEW DELHI: Union road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday said his ministry is working on a plan to reduce the travel time between Delhi and Lucknow to less than four hours by building greenfield expressways and making the existing highways linking the upcoming expressways fully signal free or by building bypasses for congested stretches. Speaking at an event to launch the first ever Intelligent Transport System (ITS) on any NH in the country, for the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) project, the minister said, “We already have the expressway connectivity from Delhi to Ghaziabad and in the next 10-12 days we will lay the foundation stone for Kanpur-Lucknow expressway. We will study how we can improve the connectivity between these two expressways. We may have to build bypasses for congested towns that fall on this link or may have to build elevated stretches. We will study all aspects.” Sources said though the minister’s call is a tough one considering the distance between Delhi and Lucknow, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will carry out a detailed study on how the distance can be reduced between the two capitals. TOI has learnt that the NHAI will open the tender for the 6-lane expressway from Kanpur to Lucknow (62 km) in the next two days and once completed, the travel between the two cities in UP will reduce to barely 30 minutes. The current distance between Delhi and Kanpur via Ghazaiabad by road is around 474 km and it takes around six and and a half hours of non-stop driving to cover the stretch. “We would have to see how we can reduce this distance so that people can cover this stretch in less than four hours,” said an official who did not wish to be named. On the highway development, Gadkari said the government has not only accelerated highway construction but also has given more importance to improve traffic movement and for safer roads. He said the launch of ITS was one such initiative and this will be extended to other projects. “I hope to have a similar monitoring system at the NHAI headquarters to monitor all the NHs in the country so that corrective measures can be taken,” he said. While visiting the ITS centre, the minister asked the NHAI officials and managers to feed the accident data in central system. The road transport ministry has rolled out an integrated online platform for real time collection of road crash data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plan-in-works-to-cut-travel-time-by-road-from-delhi-to-lucknow-to-less-than-4-hrs-gadkari/articleshow/88462382.cms||Dipak K Dash

Speaking at a function at Karivellur in Kannur, Shailaja said that some sections are now trying to create a misunderstanding among people that the government had done something wrong, ignoring the considerate service it had provided. Every communist should come forward to resist the attacks against the government, she said. Shailaja said that during the peak of the pandemic, the availability of PPE kits was scarce and to treat patients health workers had to wear PPE. “We needed it in bulk and it was costly. We could have taken the stand that we won’t go near the patients just like what the UK and the US had done. We could have come up with an excuse that PPE kits weren’t available in the market. When we enquired, we found that PPE kits were available in the market for Rs 1,500/set,” Shailaja said. She added that when she apprised the chief minister about the situation, he told her not to think about the price as human life was more important. The former health minister pointed out that during disasters, the government has the power to make purchases by waiving the purchase rules. “We purchased PPE kits wherever they were available at higher prices. After some time, when the production picked up, including foreign countries, the supply improved and the prices decreased. Then we were able to buy PPE kits, which we had earlier bought at Rs 1500/unit, at Rs 500,” she added. There were reports of alleged irregularities in the purchase of PPE kits during the tenure of previous LDF government citing that while the government had given a purchase order for PPE kits at Rs 550/piece, it later brought the PPE kits at Rs 1,500/set.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/ppe-kits-bought-at-high-prices-to-meet-exigency/articleshow/88460902.cms||---

It has also decided to deliberate on a proposal by the South West Port Ltd (SWPL) for uniform coal-handling distribution of around 0.5 MTPM (million tonnes per month), with a 5% variation on monthly handling throughout the year while maintaining the total annual handling to 5.5 MT. The SWPL had approached the board for relaxation on the monthly handling cap on coal/coke within the overall permissible quantity of 5.5 MTPA (million tonnes per annum). Following an earlier deliberation, the GSPCB’s members had agreed to grant 10% leverage during the monsoon months while maintaining the conditions imposed in the previous consent for coal/coke handling in the fair season, and limiting this to 5.5 MTPA. The board is now in receipt of a request SWPL is now requesting variation in the monthly handling quantity. The unit has submitted that during the monsoon season (June to September), it is permitted to handle around 0.6 MTPM, without any variations. During the fair season from October to May, it is allowed to handle 0.4 MTPM with 10% variations, maintaining the total annual handling of 5.5 MT. The unit has stated that the ambient air quality remains within the prescribed limits and also that the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, has not yet submitted any adverse observations on coal-handling in its report on air pollution in the port town. Incidentally, the IIT report has not yet been finalised and is pending due to a petition filed by NGO Goa Foundation before the high court of Bombay at Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gspcb-defers-pleas-for-coal-handling-relaxations/articleshow/88482528.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Police book TDP leader Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju for ruckus at temple||VIZIANAGARAM: Vizianagaram police on Thursday registered cases against the hereditary trustee of the Ramatheertham temple and senior TDP leader Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju and a few others for trying to remove the foundation stone plaque marking development works at Sri Kodanda Rama Swamy temple atop Bodikonda hill at Ramatheertham in Nellimarla in the district on Wednesday. It may be recalled that after Lord Rama idol at the Sri Kodanda Rama Swamy Temple was vandalised by unidentified persons in December 2020, several Hindu organisations and activists of Opposition parties staged protests across the state. On Wednesday, Ashok Gajapathi Raju, and a few others questioned the temple officials for not giving prior information on the foundation stone laying ceremony as per norm. Raju also raised objection to the names on the foundation stone and tried to remove it. He entered into a heated argument with the officials of the endowment department and some YSRC leaders. “Based on a complaint from the executive officer of the temple DVV Prasad, we have registered cases against Ashok Gajapathi Raju and a few others,” said sub-inspector at Nellimarla police station. We are investigating the case from different angles, he added. After the vandalisation of the idols and the protests from the Hindu groups, the Andhra Pradesh government sanctioned Rs 3 crore for the development of the temple. The SIT has been investigating the attack on Lord Ram idol. However, there is no headway in the probe. Probably it could be the single, most mysterious case the SIT has ever taken up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/police-book-tdp-leader-raju-for-ruckus-at-temple/articleshow/88460896.cms||Nalla.Babu

Addressing a public meeting at Karkhiyao on Thursday, Yogi said, “Rejuvenation of Kashi Vishwanath Temple as per its stature was needed for over 1,000 years, but it could not be possible due to lack of vision. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision resulted in KVD’s creation. In the past seven and half years, the image of Kashi has started touching new heights even as its spiritual and cultural heritage has been preserved. “Following the opening of KVD,” he said, “The footfall of pilgrims has increased massively in the past 10 days. The people are surprised to see the rejuvenation of KVT and the shrine area of KVD, where the PM had also expressed gratitude to the construction workers for their contribution.” Talking about the foundation laying of Banas Kashi Sankul by the PM, Yogi said that dairy farmers and state people are going to be benefited by the establishment of this plant. “During this visit, the PM has dedicated 22 completed projects and laid the foundation of projects for roads construction and dairy sector of over Rs 2,100 crore,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pms-envisioned-kvd-restored-glory-heritage-of-kashi-says-cm/articleshow/88462394.cms||---
---||Agra||Child home superintendent refuses to admit 10-month-old, legal action sought||Agra: Firozabad child welfare committee (CWC) has directed Agra district magistrate Prabhu N Singh to take legal action against the superintendent of the government child protection home here for allegedly not admitting a 10-month-old girl abandoned by her father. A probe into the matter has been ordered by the district probation officer. In a letter, the CWC said the infant was made to wait outside the centre in the open for over four hours on December 19. No milk or shelter was provided to her. She was eventually taken back to Firozabad. Despite the pursual of the CWC member Agrasen Pandey, superintendent Vishal Kumar allegedly refused to admit the infant. The letter signed by the president of the CWC and four other members mentioned that the superintendent of the state children home violated the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The officer is liable for legal action. Zafar Alam, director of Firozabad Childline, said, “By making the child suffer, the superintendent has committed a criminal offence under section 75 of the JJ Act (punishment for cruelty to child). CWC has taken strict cognizance of the matter and directed legal action against the officer.” District probation officer Manoj Pushkar said, “On the basis of the letter sent by the CWC Firozabad, a clarification has been sought from the officer concerned. Required action will be taken after a detailed investigation of the entire matter.” Meanwhile, the parents of the infant approached the Childline taking care of her on Monday evening. Following orders of the CWC, she was handed over to the parents on Tuesday. “The infant was found all alone near a clinic by the police response vehicle under Firozabad north police station on December 17. The parents were in a bad relationship. Father had abandoned the child. The CWC didn’t take any action against her father considering a request of her mother that she has two other children and would not be able to take care of them alone,” said Zafar Alam In another case, the state director of the women and child development department has ordered a magisterial probe into the death of a child lodged in the state child protection home in Agra. A six-month-old baby from Aligarh died under treatment at the neonatal intensive care unit of the SN Medical College. Child rights activist Naresh Paras said, “At least four children lodged at the centre died last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/child-home-superintendent-refuses-to-admit-10-month-old-legal-action-sought/articleshow/88460903.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Varanasi||They believe in nepotism, mafiaism & grabbing property: PM on Oppn||Revised Varanasi: Targeting the opposition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “They (opposition parties) don’t have development in their syllabus as they believe in nepotism, mafiaism and grabbing property of the poor”. He was addressing a public meeting at Karkhiyao on Varanasi’s border with Jaunpur on Thursday. “They see everything through the lens of caste, community and votes, hence they never wish to see UP developing and embrace modernity by keeping its heritage preserved. They don’t consider roads, sewer, water and LPG as development as ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Vishwas’ is not the part of their syllabus or ideology because they believed in nepotism, mafiaism and grabbing property of the poor,” Modi said. Modi, who also distributed property certificates under the Swamitva Scheme, said, “Today, 21 lakh people in 75 districts of UP have received these certificates under Swamitva Scheme. It will make the poor, Dalits, backwards and weaker people from the worries of illegal grabbing of their property by the mafia or anyone else.” Talking about 22 development projects in Kashi, which he dedicated to the nation on this occasion, Modi said, “Kashi is already emerging as a model of development by showing a path for incorporating modern facilities without disturbing the heritage. I am told that following the opening of Kashi Vishwanath Dham (KVD) on December 13, a footfall of over 1.50 lakh was recorded last Sunday.” “But, when we talk about the role of a double engine government in the development of UP and Kashi, it starts hurting many people,” said Modi adding, “People are comparing what they got in the previous government with what this government is giving. The difference is getting cleared.” Further targeting the opposition parties, he said, ”The problem and anguish for those who pushed UP back by decades and are upset to see development in UP, Varanasi and Kashi Vishwanath Dham due to personal interests, will keep increasing as people are showing solidarity with our double engine government, which is committed to set new records of development with the blessings of people.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/they-believe-in-nepotism-mafiaism-grabbing-property-pm-on-oppn/articleshow/88462392.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Nashik||Nashik: EV charging stations must for buildings with 25+ flats||NASHIK: In a bid to promote use of electric vehicles (EV) in the city, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided that all new residential buildings that have at least 25 flats will have to set up EV charging stations. Moreover, there should be one more EV charging stations for every 25 additional flats. Therefore, if there are more than 50 flats, then there must be two charging stations. NMC commissioner Kailas Jadhav said he has already passed an order and directed the town planning department to not approve building plan proposals if they do not have provisions for EV charging stations. Jadhav added his order will be implemented with immediate effect. Existing buildings that are yet to take building completion certificate (BCC) from the NMC, will also have to set up EV charging stations. Nilesh Chavan, a senior architect and project management consultant, said this is a welcome move that will inspire other municipal corporations too. “The use of electric vehicles is gradually increasing. Electric vehicles will be a necessity in the future and EV charging stations at the residential buildings will help people charge their vehicles at the parking area. They will not need not go outside to charge their vehicles,” said Chavan. “At the same time, billing metres should be made mandatory at the EV charging stations at residential buildings, so that those who charge their vehicles can pay the amount,” he added. Earlier, the permissible height of building was 24 metre. That meant an eight-storied building. Now the height has been increased to 40 metre, which translates to a 13-storied building. As per the new unified DCPR, one can go up to 100 metre height depending on the height of the ladder of the fire brigade department of the municipal corporation. Therefore, taller buildings coming up in the city in the near future may have 25 to 200 flats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ev-charging-stations-must-for-buildings-with-25-flats/articleshow/88460009.cms||Tushar Pawar

TMC has promised to launch the universal income support scheme if it forms the government after the 2022 assembly elections. The party’s MLA candidate Kiran Kandolkar said the objective behind introducing a welfare scheme like this is to see the women of Goa stand firmly on their feet, without financial constraints holding them back. “Over one lakh families have already registered in just 12 days. It is Goa TMC’s endeavour to make the lives of Goans better with each passing day,” said Kandolkar. He said the BJP government’s “intense apathy” has dismayed people, and voters no longer have faith in the party. Griha Laxmi is the TMC’s proposed flagship scheme that was launched on December 11. The party has begun distributing Griha Laxmi cards to those who sign up for the proposed scheme. Launched as a welfare initiative with universal coverage within the state, the scheme promises guaranteed income support of Rs 5,000 per month, or Rs 60,000 annually, into the bank account of a woman member of every household, covering all of the 3.5 lakh families in Goa. “This scheme was imperative to help revive Goa’s dwindling business. We are trying to put money in the pockets of women because they know the economy better than anyone,” said legal activist Seoula Vas. “Schemes like these will increase the purchasing power of women, thereby furthering the economic prosperity of the family and the state, and will help push up the GDP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/1-lakh-families-on-board-for-griha-laxmi-scheme-tmc/articleshow/88462430.cms||---

The SDLD started its transplant journey with surgeon Subhas Gupta and his team. This time the SDLD team conducted transplant surgery on a 57-year-old on its own. The patient had received the liver of a Bagda farmer who was declared brain dead at IPGMER’s Trauma Care Centre in November. “It is a very proud moment that the SDLD transplant team has taken off on its own finally.More government institutes should start liver transplant surgeries like IPGMER,” said Gupta, who visited SDLD on Thursday to congratulate and encourage the team, coinciding with the discharge of the liver recipient. “We have conducted total 27 transplant surgeries so far, of which 16 were deceased donor surgery, including the latest one we did on December 8,” said gastroenterologist, GK Dhali, SDLD head. “We have the capacity to conduct one transplant every two weeks, depending on organ availability. For this we need more awareness activities through ROTTO on deceased organ donation,” said IPGMER hepatology head, Abhjit Chowdhury.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ipgmer-transplants-liver-on-57-year-old/articleshow/88461838.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Addressing a public meeting at Iglas in Aligarh, Chaudhary said that he was earlier in Delhi to perform rituals on the birth anniversary of his grandfather, Chaudhary Charan Singh, and many farmer leaders had also attended the event. All those who were present there would together fight the anti-farmers' parties, he alleged, not divulging any names. Significantly, BKU leader Rakesh Tikat, was among those present at the Delhi event. “Hum milkar ladenge (We will fight together),” he announced, leading to wide speculations of farmers’ unions joining hands with RLD, SP and others to oppose the BJP. Incidentally, SP chief, Akhilesh Yadav, who was to participate in the rally, did not attend, as his family members, including his wife, had tested positive for Covid-19. However, he tweeted his best wishes to the joint rally of SP-RLD. Chaudhary further announced that farmers who died during the protests against contentious agricultural laws will be given “martyr” status and their kin will be given Rs 1 crore compensation by December 23, 2022, if the coalition is voted to power. He also promised to give Rs 12,000 under PM Samman Yojana, which will be double than what farmers are getting now. Attacking CM Yogi, Chaudhary said that he doesn’t know economics and signs documents without seeing them. Criticising the CM's claims about development, he said the GDP has declined and 67% of youth were unemployed despite holding technical degrees. “Law and order situation in the state is getting worse. Rape cases are being reported every 90 minutes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farmers-union-will-support-rld-sp-alliance-says-jayant-chaudhary/articleshow/88460919.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Amid the festive season, the demand for traditional plum cakes have increased in bakeries. The presence of dry fruits in plum cakes give people all the more reason to savour them during the winter season. In most of the churches, cakes would be served after the Christmas prayers as a form of sweet. John Dias, a resident of Nashik Road, said, “For Christians, savouring cakes, wine and other confectioneries is a tradition just like Hindus savour their faral in Diwali. We come home from the churches after the Christmas prayers and enjoy cake and wine with family and friends. While the trend of buying the plum cakes from bakeries has always been there, a large number of people prepare the cakes at their homes.” Amit Desai of Shree Mahalaxmi Agency, who has the oldest cakes shop in Nashik Road, said, the demand for cakes always increases during the Christmas season. For the past 38 years, people have been coming to our cake shop from faraway places. Though we have many varieties of cakes, the demand for plums increases during Christmas. We sell around 200 kg of plums during Christmas which has been consistent over the years even as new cake shops have come up. Our old customers no matter how far they stay, still come for the plum cakes.” Janhavi Jadhav of Hirawadi, said when it is Christmas, even non-Christians orders plum cakes celebrate the festival. Bakery stores all over the city are filled with plum cakes, pastries and biscuits as they get sold fast during Christmas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-demand-for-plum-cakes-increases/articleshow/88460032.cms||Santosh Sonawane

In view of a recent Supreme Court judgement which directed all states and Union Territories to identify sex workers and extend all welfare schemes that are being given to informal workers, Vimukti demanded the state government to take up a separate census for enumeration and identification of sex workers in Andhra Pradesh. The forum’s state president B Meharunnisa said though the Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (APSACS) has identified about one lakh sex workers in the state, the actual number of sex workers would be more than three lakh. “Many of them have not registered under APSACS and are being denied the benefits they are entitled to under various schemes. Most of the unregistered sex workers do not even have basic identities like voter id and Aadhaar card. Forget financial assistance, without having basic identity cards, they are even denied ration cards. As most of them are the only earning members of the family, they are again falling into the vicious trap of sex work to feed themselves,” said Meharunnisa. Vimukti general secretary B Pushpavati requested the state government to ensure coordinated efforts by the APSACS, state women commission, and women and child welfare department to identify and extend the benefits to sex workers. She also suggested forming small working groups with sex workers on the lines of self-help groups (SHGs) and give them skill development training by creating a revolving fund. “This will enable sex workers to stand on their feet and live a dignified life . We are requesting the government to implement the SC judgement by giving dry ration to sex workers without insisting on ration cards,” she demanded.

A Police complaint was lodged on Wednesday evening. The accused have been detained for interrogation, said police. According to the police, the woman had befriended 24-year-old Krishna Baghel, one of the two accused, on Instagram six months ago. On December 19, she went to meet Baghel after he asked her to meet him. Baghel was with 22-year-old Hemant Kumar. The girl alleged that she was raped by the duo while they were on their way to Sikandra in the accused's vehicle. She also alleged that they "forced her to consume beer and when she refused, they hit her head against the car door, and forced her to drink." Krishna then raped her while Hemant drove he car. Later, Hemant also assaulted her sexually, she alleged. The girl then narrated the incident to her younger sister, after which they approached the police. In her complaint, the girl stated that the two men recorded a video of the assault and threatened to make it viral if she told anybody about the incident. The girl’s brother told TOI that his sister tried to kill herself by consuming sleeping pills. According to circle officer Hariparvat Lakhan Singh, the incident took place in the afternoon, as per the girl's complaint. The duo has been detained for further interrogation, and an FIR has been registered under IPC section 376 D (gang-rape). Police are scanning CCTV footage for evidence. Earlier this month, on December 16, a 35-year-old woman was allegedly raped by two men in Aligarh’s Pisawa area, when she had gone to the field to cut grass. When she tried to resist, she was attacked by them with a scythe and injured her neck. Last month, a 21-year-old woman was gangraped in a moving car on Agra-Delhi NH-2 by an Army personnel and his relative when she was returning home to Mathura from Agra after appearing for a police recruitment exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/firozabad-woman-18-gangraped-by-instagram-friend-his-aide-in-moving-car/articleshow/88460937.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Man convicted for cop’s death after 22-year trial||KOLKATA: Twenty-two years after an on-duty cop was pushed to death from a doubledecker bus, a lower court has held one person guilty in the case. In 1999, traffic constable Surendranath Gupta was on duty near Shyambazar when he heard a commotion from the second floor of a Baranagar-bound double-decker bus. He boarded the bus to check the matter and found a few people having an altercation with another cop, Narayan Roy. As the two cops were standing near the gate to get down from the bus, the accused, Anupam Banerjee, had pushed them out. Gupta succumbed to his injuries at RG Kar Hospital that night. The case was taken up by the detective department even as Roy took months to recover. Banerjee was arrested from Baranagar a month later and was bailed out four months later. “The court relied on three prime witnesses, including Roy, to reach its conclusion,” said an officer. The court is likely to pronounce the quantum of punishment soon in this case. In another case dating back to 13 years ago, five persons were sentenced to life imprisonment for being allegedly involved in the murder of CITU leader Harekrishna Gupta (46) in the Cossipore area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-convicted-for-cops-death-after-22-year-trial/articleshow/88461847.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Kalu Mehta, who has a garment shop on Kuvadva Road, had set up cameras inside the shop and given the live link of the footage to his daughter Krutika who is settled in the US after marriage. At around 3am IST, she saw on her mobile that some unidentified people were moving around inside the shop. They were searching for something using a torch. Krutika immediately called up her father and the family rushed to the shop. They noticed a man standing outside and thrashed him with a stick, but he managed to escape from there. Two other people inside the shop also managed to flee, hearing the commotion outside. The family members were unable to chase them. After they informed the cops, police verified and got to know that the thieves had broken into around 13 shops in the same area in a single night. Though there was no major loss of cash or valuables, people have started recording statements of the owners. “We are trying to ascertain if these are the same burglars who broke into other shops. An offence will be lodged soon,” said Kuvadva Road police.  Police have started scanning the CCTV footage to get more clues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/nrg-woman-in-us-foils-theft-in-rajkot/articleshow/88460948.cms||---

---||Mumbai||A silent night ahead at Mumbai's Khotachi Wadi amid Covid restrictions?||Except for maybe Santa, no other expats, it seems, will be descending on Girgaum’s Khotachi Wadi this Christmas. Missing from the latticed windows and trellised balconies of this tranquil East Indian enclave, will be the annual sightings of jet-lagged sons and daughters sharing vindaloo, port wine and laughter with their ageing parents. “Nobody is coming down,” says fashion designer and passionate cook James Ferreira, who will miss the customary reunions with many of his eight siblings scattered across Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. “This time, like last year, I am alone,” says Ferreira. Apart from the ever-present scent of fresh potato wafers, nostalgia hangs thick in the air this holiday season at Khotachi Wadi — one of the last vestiges of East Indians in the city. What builders’ bulldozers have been doing to its dwindling centuries-old vernacular-style bungalows, Covid and its new variants are doing to its jolly old Christmas-time self. In the face of BMC’s fresh Omicron-threat-induced guidelines, which make prior permission mandatory for events attended by over 200 people, the precinct stands subdued. There will be no midnight mass or get-togethers, informs a resident, adding that community members have been meeting for prayers online in the run-up to December 25. “We have to work within the framework,” says the resident. Recounting the bygone era of tea parties and trails of kids of all communities behind the local Santa, she adds: “But at least we can rejoice in the memories we have.” Strewn across the volleyball court here are decades-old memories of fancy dress contests, Housie games and talent shows. One such show in which he had crooned “You’re my love, you’re my dove, my pigeon, my halwa...” to the tune of Kishore Kumar’s ‘Jhum Jhum Jhumroo’, had turned a teenaged Wilfred Felizardo into ‘Willy Black’, Khotachi Wadi’s answer to deep-voiced American singer Barry White. Those ten-day-long Christmas celebrations now seem distant to 64-year-old Felizardo who stepped out in his trademark beachy shirt, white hat and trusty Fender guitar on Wednesday evening and finished “phataphat within an hour” his door-to-door carol singing rounds. “We went to around 15 houses and sang two carols outside each,” says Felizardo, referring to his socially-distanced, mask-sporting crew comprising a beatbox player, a Santa-hat-toting singer and an amplifier carrier. A similar void is evident at Mazgaon’s Matharpacady, another heritage East Indian village where boozy barbecue parties kept neighbours of all shades warm in cold Decembers. Till 2019, in fact, Santa would arrive here on a BMC-garbage-truck-turned-sleigh pulled by 3D reindeer, built by 62-year-old sailor Julius Valladerus. Now, even as Valladerus mulls a Christmas tea party for kids in the area, Felizardo contemplates donning a “Chrismask” and handing sweets to children passing by.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-silent-night-ahead-at-khotachi-wadi-amid-covid-restrictions/articleshow/88463281.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram
---||Delhi||How floating wetlands may give Najafgarh drain new lease of life||NEW DELHI: After successful pilot projects in some parts of the city, the Delhi government now plans to use the innovative technique of floating wetlands to rejuvenate the Najafgarh drain. The drain, which is actually the river “Sahibi” originating from Alwar in Rajasthan, is the biggest opening that releases water into Yamuna. Through cost-effective interventions, the government has now made cleaning of this drain a top priority. For this, an in situ treatment — which involves cleaning the running water inside the drain through floating wetlands — has been planned in coordination with the irrigation and flood control department and Delhi Jal Board by February 2022. The process will help filter and treat the water in the drain itself. . This will also save the cost of making new sewage-treatment plants. According to a DJB official, the treatment of wastewater via the floating wetlands will help boost the dissolved oxygen levels, necessary for supporting aquatic life. “Dirty water lowers the oxygen levels. Enhanced aeration will help re-oxygenate the drain water while it is flowing. Similarly, the floating wetlands will add healthy microbes into the water before it enters the river. The work is in progress,” the official said. The Najafgarh drain carries 95 million gallons per day of sewage water from Haryana through the Badshahpur drain, which further mixes into Yamuna. The sewage water and industrial effluents coming from neighbouring states, if stopped, will be a huge step towards cleaning the river. The sewage is dumped by the neighbouring states without treatment, resulting in the water from the drains flowing directly into Yamuna. The Najafgarh drain is 57km-long while the complete treatment of Badshahpur drain will be achieved in an initial 4-5 km stretch only. Being the longest and the dirtiest drain of the city, it is now a key focus area as part of the government’s mission to clean Yamuna by 2025. There are five major outfalls carrying wastewater into Yamuna — the drains at Najafgarh, Shahdara, Barapullah, Delhi Gate and Mori Gate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-floating-wetlands-may-give-najafgarh-drain-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/88462422.cms||---

With the high court instructing the government to impose curbs on gatherings during festivals, including Christmas celebrations, churches have turned vigilant before the government issues any orders. “On Christmas, close to 1,000 people are expected to visit the church. Keeping that in mind, we have made additional seating arrangements even outside the church, within the premises, to ensure that social distancing is maintained during service,” said Norman Issac, treasurer of St John’s Church in Secunderabad. Multiple services are planned at many churches to avoid overcrowding. The churches have also issued guidelines, asking parishioners above the age of 60 not to come for the special mass on December 24 and 25. Many have limited the number of members who will attend the service. “We are holding a midnight mass on Christmas eve from 11 pm followed by an early morning mass at 6.30 am on Christmas. The event will also be streamed live so that the elderly and those who are unable to visit the church can watch it from home,” said Father Balashowreddy of St Joseph’s Cathedral, a 200-year-old church in Gunfoundry. Several churchgoers are also contemplating on whether to attend the Christmas mass in church or join the live-stream. “Earlier this month, we were very excited that Christmas would be slightly more relaxed this year. However, conditions don’t seem very conducive now,” said John Jermias, a resident of Alwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/churches-tweak-plans-to-keep-christmas-celebrations-safe/articleshow/88461994.cms||Preeti Biswas

Upbeat industry experts find the growth numbers to be a positive sign amid the despondent global pandemic scenario. This year export of $16,236 million was recorded against $13,412 million in April to November 2019. However, the overall gem and jewellery exports from the country witnessed a decline of 7.65% for the month of November. Decline from $2,582 in 2019 to $2,385 this year was on the cards owing to a break in manufacturing activity during Diwali, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) stated. Meanwhile, gold jewellery exports in April to November 2021 declined by 27.76% to $6137.17 million as compared to $8495.58 million in 2019. Plain gold jewellery exports in April to November 2021 declined by 59.43% to $2487.03 million from $6130.43 million in 2019. However, studded gold jewellery exports in April to November 2021 grew by 54.33 % to $3650.14 million against $2365.14 million in 2019. “India’s gem and jewellery export performance through 2021 has been far ahead of what we had been expecting at this time last year. The good news is that the world’s biggest jewellery consuming nation, the USA, has increased purchases from India this year,” said Colin Shah, chairman, GJEPC. “We expect to achieve the export target of $41.65 billion this fiscal year. And we have recommended to the government a few policy reforms to consider in the Union Budget 2022-23. These include the reduction of import duty on cut & polished diamonds, gold and other precious metals and an amendment in taxation provisions to allow the sale of rough diamonds in the Special Notified Zones in Mumbai and Surat – this would help the industry to achieve its export target of $70 billion in the next few years,” Shah added. Further, silver jewellery exports in April to November 2021 grew by 95.35% to $1691.86 million against $866.05 million in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/21-rise-in-surat-diamond-export/articleshow/88461093.cms||---

She was speaking at the India@75 meeting at Nabanna on Thursday. She asked sports and youths affairs minister Aroop Biswas to conduct a run on the occasions, in which sportsmen, youngsters and students would participate. She wants two rallies—one on Vivekananda’s birth anniversary on January 12 and the other on Bose’s birth anniversary on January 23, the latter to start from the Netaji statue at Shyambazar. Vivekananda’s ancestral house would be decked up, the chief minister said. Pointing out that a memorial column could be built in the city for the unsung heroes of the freedom movement, Banerjee said the walls of Alipore correctional home could be painted to glorify the freedom struggle, where Bengal revolutionaries’ contribution was great. She proposed debates and essay competitions forkids. The Bengal assembly documents would also be put up in the public domain so that younger generations could know the details, the CM said. Banerjee also announced there would be a global Bangla music fest in the city in the end of January, where people from abroad would be invited. The event would showcase Bengali music and there would be a section for patriotic songs, which were gradually fading from people’s memory, she said. Besides, Bangla Sangeet Mela and Bangla Lok Sanskriti Utsav will be held at 11 venues across the city, including Rabindra Sadan, from December 25 to January 1. Exhibitions will be held on singers Subinoy Roy and Dhananjoy Bhattacharya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rallies-run-debate-for-75-yrs-of-independence-cm/articleshow/88461875.cms||---

Police said they received a call from Safdarjung Hospital about an injured person, who was a resident of Rajouri Garden, admitted there. A team from Rajouri Garden police station rushed to the hospital. An inquiry later revealed that the victim had a love affair with a girl who lives in Sagarpur. Both of them had eloped for marriage. The girl’s family was allegedly furious over this. “The victim and the girl allegedly got married outside Delhi and came back to the city on Wednesday. The girl’s family got information from their relatives about the location of the victim and the girl,” additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Gautam said. He further said that the family members reached the spot and from there, they took them forcefully to Sagarpur where the youth was allegedly beaten up by them. “An FIR under sections of attempt to murder and abduction has been registered and further inquiry is on,” the officer said. A man who claimed to be the victim’s relative said they got a phone call on Wednesday that the victim was lying near a drain in Sagarpur. The victim’s brother rushed to the spot and took him to the hospital, he said. “The victim does a petty job and hence, the girl’s family members were against their relationship. They both reached the police station on Wednesday demanding protection. Police made phone calls to both the parties, but the victim’s family did not arrive,” he claimed, adding that the man was beaten brutally by the girl’s family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/22-year-old-thrashed-in-w-delhi-for-eloping-with-girl-case-filed/articleshow/88462437.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad trails Karimnagar in second Covid vaccine dose coverage||HYDERABAD: Some 28 lakh people in the state have not taken the second does, with the majority of them from Hyderabad. Karimnagar has the highest number of fully vaccinated individuals against Covid-19, surpassing Hyderabad and Rangareddy, according to latest data from the state health department. Officials claim the havoc coronavirus triggered during the first and second wave and the spurt seen off late may have driven many to vaccination centres. Karimnagar has completed 100% coverage of first dose and inoculated approximately 7.9 lakh people, while coverage of second dose was at 84% (roughly 6.6 lakh people). Hyderabad has so far vaccinated 79% of target population, while Rangareddy inoculated 77% eligible citizens. However, other districts, which had reported spikes like Nalgonda and Nizamabad, have so far logged 45-55% second dose inoculation. Nalgonda has reached 93% first dose coverage and 44% second dose coverage, while Nizamabad recorded 90% first dose vaccination, among the last five districts in terms of first dose coverage. When it comes to second doses, Nizamabad has reached 55% coverage. Explaining the disparity between these districts, a health department official said, “On one hand, the fear of the virus has been a lot in some districts, especially where the second wave has resulted in a lot of deaths, but that is not the only factor. In fact, all the three worst affected districts, which were hit by oxygen and bed shortage, saw people coming forward to get vaccinated.” “If we see in terms of numbers, Nizamabad and Nalgonda have vaccinated more people, but their overall target is also much larger than Karimnagar, 11 lakh and 12 lakh respectively. As a result Karimnagar is in the first place,” he explained. Vaccination drive was taken up in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area on priority basis, but once the first dose coverage was nearly 100%, the focus was shifted to other districts. Nalgonda has administered the vaccine first dose to 11 lakh people, while Nizamabad inoculated 10 lakh eligible population. “Nizamabad is almost at par with Karimnagar in terms of second dose numbers” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyd-lags-in-2nd-dose-vax-drive-karimnagar-races-past/articleshow/88461977.cms||Amrita Didyala

It will however, outcompete Delta variant. There is currently no clear evidence for increased virulence or lethality for Omicron. “Omicron may have greater immune escape ability than the existing variants of concern (VoCs) and variants of interest (VoIs). However, there are no clear indications coming out from the predictive mutational analysis that Omicron may have higher virulence/lethality than other variants, including Delta. The higher ability for immune escape may be a likely reason for the recent surge in Omicron cases,” the study based on a computer (in silico) analysis said. The study was published in preprint online server MedRxiv. According to the study, compared to the current list of VoCs/VoIs Omicron bears more sequence variation, specifically in the spike protein and host receptor-binding motif. Omicron showed the closest nucleotide and protein sequence homology with Alpha variant for the complete sequence. The mutations were found primarily condensed in spike region (28 to 48) of the virus. The team performed a correlation analysis of the relative proportion of genomic sequences of specific variants (from October 1 to December 10), with current epidemiological data (new Covid cases and deaths) from South Africa to understand whether Omicron has an epidemiological advantage over other variants. As many as 3,604 genomic sequences of Omicron from 54 countries were uploaded on GISAID until December 10 and the team had analysed them for the mutational characteristics. Omicron showed more sequence variation including spike protein receptor binding domain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/study-no-clear-evidence-on-increased-virulence/articleshow/88461989.cms||Syed Akbar

They are the parents of one of the three who returned from Uganda. The Uganda returnees tested positive for Omicron variant a week ago. The health administration screened 36 close contacts of these returnees, and of them, two tested positive and their swab samples have been sent for genome sequencing. According to Satara health administration, the returnees had reached Phaltan, and stayed in home isolation. The parents were shifted to another place. In the meantime, the Uganda returnees tested positive and were shifted to Phaltan’s sub-district hospital. And the parents returned to their home. However, they tested positive. Shivraj Jadhav, Phaltan’s sub-divisional officer, said the health of all the five patients is fine with no major symptoms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/parents-of-an-omicron-patient-ve/articleshow/88460043.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Vadodara: A social media startup with ‘real-time platform’||VADODARA: Imagine getting connected with friend circles, near and dear ones or just acquaintances based on their real-time location, on social media while sipping tea. A startup incubated by MS University that has started a location-based social media platform has opened its smart chai station in Vadodara. It has become the first social media platform that makes money by selling tea and refreshments. What’s more, the tea station is also the first retail store that is accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin & Dogecoin as payment methods. “Currently, there is no indigenously developed well-designed social media platform for the Indian market. At a time when we are talking of ‘Make in India’, there was a need for a location-based social media app. So, we developed Gossip as a better version of Twitter,” said Shubhra Saha, who along with Shyam Sunder has founded the social media platform. The pass-outs from MSU’s Maharaja Ranjitsinh Gaekwad Institute of Design had introduced a GPS feature in the group chat, a tool through which everybody in your vicinity gets a notification. During the peak of Covid-19 induced pandemic, this location and interest-based application also provided a Covid chat feature to connect seekers of ambulance, hospital bed, oxygen cylinders and medicines to service providers. “We have started Gossip smart chai station as the first real-life social media platform. You can meet and have tea and conversation at physical locations of the social media platform in different areas of the city,” said Saha. “Initially, all social media platforms look to increase their subscriber base. Later, however, users get frustrated with the constant flow of advertisements and promotions that keep cropping up. Hence, we have decided to earn from tea and not advertisements,” Saha added. Regarding the highly-debated and highly-fluctuating cryptocurrencies, Saha said that the purpose of accepting this mode of payment is to raise awareness and have discussions around it. “Currently, there is no regulation on its usage. But as economic systems are changing, we may start seeing use of cryptocurrencies as widely as e-wallets or digital wallets are being used,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/a-social-media-startup-with-real-time-platform/articleshow/88460947.cms||Prashant Rupera

The blind curve on Bowenpally crossroads (near graveyard)-Tadbund crossroads where four people were killed and several others injured is a blackspot for road accidents. It is also one of the busiest roads in Secunderabad Cantonment where nearly 5,000 commuters use the stretch. “Thanks to Cantonment board officials, rumble strips are placed on this danger spot,” B Srikanth, a regular commuter, told TOI. B Prabhakar, a private firm employee at RP Road, said two-wheeler riders often skid and fall while negotiating the steep curve. “The rumble strips will at least help alert commuters,” he said. Road users are often blindsided by the narrow curve ansd lack of traffic indicators. Though road safety sign boards have been put up, road accidents have been a regular occurrence at the spot. Apart from people coming from Medchal, Suchitra, KPHB and Bowenpally and adjoining areas of Cantonment, TSRTC buses coming from districts like Karimnagar, Adilabad, Nizamabad and Nanded in Maharashtra use this stretch to reach either Jubilee bus station, Secunderabad railway station or MGBS. At the recent board meeting, a plan to widen the stretch was discussed by president Cantonment board Brigadier Abhijit Chandra and SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy. The CEO proposed transfer of a portion of defence land to Hyderabad Road Development Corporation Limited to widen the blind curve. Brigadier Chandra suggested pruning of branches instead of cutting trees to ensure clear vision for commuters at the sharp curve.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/killer-blackspot-at-tadbund-curve-gets-rumble-strips/articleshow/88462056.cms||---

The winter session was adjourned sine die on Wednesday. This is second time the Centre has added the Cantonment bill-2021 as one of the major bills but failed to table it. The bill was aimed at coming up with legislation that deals with greater democratisation, modernistion and overall improvement in the governance of Cantonment boards in the country. Members of All Cantonments Citizens’ Welfare Association said after considering the recommendations of all 62 Cantonments, the Centre should put forth the bill. The ministry of defence was supposed to announce Cantonment board polls in January 2022, but is likely to defer it by four to six months as the Cantonment bill could not be introduced in the winter session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/centre-fails-to-table-cantt-bill-in-parl/articleshow/88462065.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He is Sayyed Asif Sayyed Nizam, a goon with more than half-a-dozen crimes against him. He stunned cops by sending them the video spouting philosophical lines, apparently to gain sympathy even as he remains on the run. In the 16-second-long video, Asif tried to project himself as broke, famished and living a hard life, showing himself taking cover among some bushes in some fields to evade arrest. #Maharashtra: Goon on the run sends emotional video to cops to gain sympathyREAD MORE:https://t.co/K3ATzkNNox https://t.co/Pea024mXAS— TOI Nagpur (@TOI_Nagpur) 1640316537000Asif’s gang member, Mohd Sarfaraz Ansari, left cops even more bewildered, when he told them that he used a bike stolen by him to make a bonfire to beat the cold wave. While Asif had managed to flee, Sarfaraz was nabbed along with four others. Apart from the gutted bike, nine other stolen two-wheelers were recovered from Sarfaraz this week. Sarfaraz used scissors to jump-start ignition of the locked bikes and would flee with them. He also used master keys to steal new bikes. Yashodhara Nagar police, which busted the gang of criminals, had weird experiences with all the goons. Though they chased a gang of five, Asif managed to flee from the police dragnet. Sarfaraz was caught along with Ahmed Khan, Sameer Ahmed and Karan Yadav. With Asif on the run, Yashodhara Nagar police started repeatedly visiting his residence at Nagsenvan locality. The cops were regularly questioning his family and friends, as he is also wanted in a case of serious assault. The cops had also left their mobile phone number with the family and friends, asking them to alert them as soon as he is spotted or returns home. Senior inspector Sanjay Jadhav of Yashodhara Nagar police station said his team was surprised when one of them received Asif’s video on WhatsApp. “We were intrigued on receiving the video. He was very philosophical and seemed to be trying to gain sympathy, but nothing will stop police from bringing him to book,” said the PI. “Asif is a difficult goon and we will get him soon. He is running to evade arrest and sending the video from the field was meant to mislead us,” he said. Jadhav also sounded surprised by the details revealed by Sarfaraz about his habit of stealing bikes from different places. “Sarfaraz claims to have set a stolen bike on fire to keep himself and his gang warm during the cold wave,” said Jadhav, who is conducting further investigation under supervision of ACP Roshan Pandit and DCP Manish Kalwaniya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/goon-on-the-run-sends-emotional-video-to-cops-to-gain-sympathy/articleshow/88461889.cms||Soumitra Bose

While Himanshu Dalet, son of deceased Mahendra Dalet, of BJP defeated Mahesh Tamboli of Congress by 340 votes in ward 57, Sunita Devi of Congress defeated Prem Devi of BJP in ward 97. Both the wards were reserved for SC candidates. Currently, BJP has 44 seats in the municipal board while Congress has 47 in addition to the support of nine independent candidates through which they formed their majority. The bypolls were necessitated following the deaths of the councillors. As both the party again won back their seats, there won’t be much change in the equation of board. A Congress councilor said, “Sunita Devi won by just 11 votes. This raises questions on the functioning of the board and how people are not happy with the performance of the councillors. Committees have not been made after almost a year of the formation of the board, sanitation work is not going on nor complaints filed by people are being resolved on time.” Congress MLA Rafiq Khan, who was active in the poll rallies, said this win is actually a reinstatement of faith of the public in our board and we will work for them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-heritage-bypolls-bjp-and-congress-win-back-their-wards/articleshow/88462448.cms||---

The drive carried out by labour, factories and revenue departments jointly with Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), district child protection unit(DCPU), child labour elimination and effective rehabilitation society (CHEERS) and Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) led to the rescue of two 16-year-old boys of Odisha and a 15-year-old from Jharkhand. Village administrative officer (VAO) of Vellithirumutham in Srirangam taluk, P Harikrishnan, lodged a complaint with Srirangam police alleging that the three boys were found working as construction workers in the residential apartment site of TNUHDB. He said the boys were employed by Sri Vari constructions at the site after bringing them through agents Jokesh and Sathiyendar. “We found one of the boys watering on the third floor while the two others were involved in mixing concrete materials and other related work,” said CHEERS project manager S Gowtham. The team also expressed shock over the poor living condition provided to the boys who were made to stay under tin sheet shed. “They were served unhygienic food and forced to work for more than 10 hours a day without safety gears,” said BBA state coordinator H Natharsha Malim. The boys also had no idea about the payment given to their families for sending them for work. Preliminary investigation found that the boys were assured of Rs 300 a day but they were not paid. The rescued boys were produced before the child welfare committee (CWC) which ordered them to be kept at the government shelter home in Trichy. Malim said the process of providing the government’s relief measures to the bonded labourers can commence only after registration of case. “If the police book the case without any delay, the boys will get immediate relief measures. After that, we can process their repatriation to their native place,”said Mailm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/three-boys-rescued-from-bonded-labour-at-govt-building-site/articleshow/88462460.cms||---

The Act provides for death penalty for rape and has increased minimum quantum of punishment in case of acid attacks on women and sexual assault of children. It has also set a time limit of 30 days to complete probe from the day of registering of complaint. The legislation has also made provisions to handle crime against women through digital and social media platforms. The bill, modelled on the tough Disha Act in Andhra Pradesh, was first tabled in the legislature in December 2020.“We welcome the bill but there are still certain deficiencies, and we hope the government will make adequate changes. There are some sections in the Act that are not practical and could lead to further litigations,” said leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis. He said the Act mandates social media platforms to share information with probe agencies in three days in certain crimes, but that may not be practical. The Shakti legislation included two bills — Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 2020, which was cleared, while the Special Court and Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law 2020 has been sent to a joint select committee for further discussions. “We want to ensure that the justice delivery mechanism is upgraded, so we would like to send the Special Court and Machinery for Implementation of Maharashtra Shakti Criminal Law to a joint select committee,” said home minister Dilip Walse Patil. As part of the Act, a new IPC section 175A has been created under which failure to share data for probe by social media platforms, internet providers will call for a jail term of up to three months or a fine of Rs 25 lakh. Also, a prison term of 1-3 years for false or wrongful complaints has been prescribed along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh. Acid attack cases under section 326A of IPC will have a minimum jail term of 15 years that may extend to the remainder of a convict’s natural life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-assembly-unanimously-oks-shakti-bill-seeking-death-for-rape/articleshow/88463298.cms||Bhavika Jain

Maharashtra and Karnataka, which are to share 5 tmcft of water each to Chennai, expressed their inability to spare water. However, they requested the KRMB to exempt them from giving water to Chennai. AP and Telangana, the two lower riparian states, too have not come out with a clear stand on giving drinking water to Chennai. While AP suggested an entire new project to be constructed at Srisailam to supply drinking water to Chennai, Telangana opposed the move. Telangana officials said AP has drawn excess water already and Chennai’s share should be taken from Kandaleru reservoir. Telangana officials also alleged that AP had diverted Krishna water from Srisailam to Kandaleru and the same water should be given to Chennai this year. When AP and Tamil Nadu officials raised the proposal of establishing a pipeline from Kandaleru reservoir to Chennai, Telangana raised objection and asked the states to come up with a detailed project report (DPR) for further discussion. The four riparian states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and AP would have to give 15 tmcft of water to Chennai. This time, while Maharashtra and Karnataka have requested the KRMB to exempt them from supplying water to Chennai, Telangana asked the KRMB to take the 5 tmcft of water only from Andhra Pradesh, stating that AP had already drawn additional water this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/meet-fails-to-decide-on-water-supply-to-chennai/articleshow/88460971.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||Museum to recreate Durga Puja in Christmas season||Kolkata: Citizens can enjoy Durga Puja during Christmas if they visit Indian Museum this holiday season. To celebrate Unesco’s intangible cultural heritage (ICH) tag to Durga Puja of Kolkata, Indian Museum has brought out two of its prized collections — a 12th century black stone Mahishasurmardini figurine and an early 19th-century octo-alloy Mahishasurmardini figurine— as the exhibits of the month. The authorities are also recreating an atmosphere of Durga Puja at the museum with dhakis beating drums. They have lined up special exhibitions of paintings, sculptures, scrolls, wood work and masks. The exhibition will be inaugurated on Christmas eve. “Durga Puja is a cultural melting pot where various threads of cultural multiplicity are inter-woven. It is less of religious fervour and more of inclusive and vibrant festivity that embraces all, irrespective of religious, cultural and political beliefs. To an economist, it is great economic activity, to an artist, it is perhaps the biggest exhibition of art. So, the tag means a lot to us,” said museum director Arijit Dutta Chowdhury. “Indian Museum has one of the finest collections of Puja-related artefacts. We are piecing them together to have a sense of the intangible spirit of the festival. The exhibition will continue till the middle of next month. The authorities aim at showcasing some of the folk traditions related to Durgotsav. We have invited the patachitra artists of Midnapore and Bankura who will relive their Durga Puja songs (Pat-er Gaan), along with the running scrolls on Durga patachitra. There will be ‘Chhau dance’, painting, clay-modelling and sculpture workshops, all related to the theme of Puja of Kolkata,” said IM’s education officer and curator of the show Sayan Bhattcharya. “Since IM sees a surge in visitors from December-end till January-end, we want to showcase Durga in its multiplicity of forms conceived by artists .”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/museum-to-recreate-durga-puja-in-christmas-season/articleshow/88461901.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Pandey, who is coming to join the BJP’s “Jan Vishwas Yatra” that began from Ghazipur on December 19, along with Maurya will mobilize support through road shows in the district’s Allahabad North, Allahabad South and Allahabad West assembly constituencies during the 3-km-long road show. City (Prayagraj) unit president of BJP, Ganesh Kesarwani on Thursday said, “Earlier, former BJP national president and union home minister Amit Shah was to come for the road show, but owing to unavoidable circumstances, he is unable to come. As a result, now senior BJP leader and Union minister Mahendra Nath Pandey would lead the road show. He would be accompanied by state deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya.” “Jan Vishwas Yatra” — a road show launched by the BJP, strives to extend the party's outreach among the public in the run up to the state assembly polls scheduled next year. The ‘Jan Vishwas Yatra’ was launched at six different places across the state, including Bijnor, Mathura, Jhansi, Ghazipur, Ambedkar Nagar and Ballia on December 19. “The yatra is being held to showcase the achievements of the government during the past four-and-a-half years. During it, the progress and the development that the BJP government has made would be highlighted. As part of the yatra, our senior leaders are also interacting with locals,” said state BJP spokesperson Manish Shukla. Meanwhile, the yatra, flagged off by Union minister for women and child development Smriti Irani from Ghazipur on December 19, entered Prayagraj’s trans-Yamuna region from Mirzapur late on Thursday evening and camped at Manda area for the night. On Friday, the yatra will tour Koraon, Bara and Karchhana assembly constituency areas and enter the Prayagraj city limits and tour Allahabad West, Allahabad North and Allahabad South assembly constituency areas. On December 25, the birth anniversary of former PM late Atal Bihari Vajpayee being celebrated as ‘Good Governance Day’ by the BJP, the yatra would pass through Phulpur, Handia, Pratappur, Soraon and Phaphamau assembly constituency areas. It would then proceed to Kaushambi followed by Pratapgarh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/union-minister-dy-cm-to-hold-road-show-in-city-today/articleshow/88462468.cms||---

At the same time, producers and entrepreneurs pointed out the absence of satellite offices of export promotion organisations in the district as hurdles in tapping export potential.Considering the presence of the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) and traditional banana growing areas in rural parts of the district, FIEO has identified banana as a suitable product for the district to promote exports. “There is a huge potential for exporting bananas from Trichy, but the quality of production and shipping are a concern. We are planning to appoint a nodal officer for boosting agro-based product exports from Trichy, and frequent interactions are planned,” FIEO southern region deputy director-general K Unnikrishnan said. Locally produced bananas verities such as poovan and nenthran are less expensive compared to the other markets and lack of awareness among producers was cited by the export promotion organisations for failing to utilise potential. However, exporters and traders involved in value-addition process expressed a different opinion. “We need director general of foreign trade (DGFT) office in Trichy which would save our time and money in travelling to Chennai to get permissions and queries addressed. Trichy should be made as a hub for banana export,” N Kumar, an aspiring exporter said. Apart from seeking office and nodal representatives for DGFT and FIEO, the exporters sought for Agriculture and Processed Food Export Development Authority lab facility to screen and certify products for exports through Trichy international airport. Despite the pandemic, the export of food products and vegetables from Trichy has only soared in 2021, exporters said. FIEO officials acknowledged the need to decentralise export activities to consolidate Trichy as a banana export hub.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/plan-to-develop-trichy-as-banana-hub/articleshow/88462473.cms||---

The proposed market, expected to have modernised centres with marketing promotional space spread on 22 acres, will utilise a portion of unused space near the Panchapur green park on Trichy-Madurai national highways.A senior official with Trichy corporation said that facilities such as cold and seed storage godowns have been planned in the market. Considering road connectivity to Madurai, Dindigul, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Karur and Chennai districts via the under-construction semi-ring road, the civic body has planned to establish the market as a hub for wholesale vegetable and fruit sales. “The shops will be available for rent to all sections of people. As the new bus stand and truck terminal will be a stone's throw away from the market, traders from other districts will also be interested,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said. The market will be the largest market facility in central Tamil Nadu, bigger than the Kallikudi integrated market established spread on 10 acres. The civic body is yet to earmark the space for the integrated market, but officials have hinted at the possibilities of using the vacant space near the solar park and green park for the new market.Anticipating opposition from existing wholesale traders in additional to the underutilized Kallikudi market, the civic body has clarified that the wholesale traders in Gandhi Market can continue to function from their existing space. The civic body, to appease Gandhi Market traders who are using political clout to evade the relocation bids, has planned to renovate and strengthen the existing century-old market in heart of the city at a cost of Rs 60 crore. Trichy corporation said that soon the application format to avail new shops in Panjapur market will be disclosed to the public.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/veggie-mkt-near-ibt-to-come-up-at-rs-110cr/articleshow/88462469.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||India||WHO: Blanket booster use will increase vaccine-inequity||NEW DELHI: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned countries against blanket use of booster shots of Covid vaccines, saying it will not bring a definite end to the global pandemic, rather prolong it, as persisting vaccine inequity can help the virus with more opportunities to spread and mutate through countries with poorer vaccination coverage. “No country can boost its way out of the pandemic and boosters cannot be seen as ticket to go ahead with the planned celebrations without the need for other precautions,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization has also issued interim guidance on booster doses, expressing concern that mass programmes by countries that can afford them will exacerbate vaccine inequity. It concluded that focus of immunisation must remain on decreasing deaths and severe illness. Currently, 20% of all vaccine doses administered are being given as boosters or additional doses, Tedros said. “Blanket booster programmes are likely to prolong the pandemic by diverting supply to countries that already have high levels of vaccination coverage, giving the virus more opportunity to spread and mutate,” he added. He said the priority must be on supporting countries to vaccinate 40% of their populations as quickly as possible, and 70% by the middle of 2022. “It’s important to remember that the majority of hospitalisations and deaths are in unvaccinated people, not un-boosted people.” Tedros said with improved supplies globally, projections show that supplies should be sufficient to vaccinate the entire global adult population and give boosters to high risk populations by the first quarter of 2022. However, only later in 2022 will supplies be sufficient for extensive use of boosters in all adults.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/who-blanket-booster-use-will-increase-vaccine-inequity/articleshow/88463646.cms||Sushmi Dey

Addressing the convocation ceremony of the women’s university, Sisodia said, “I am happy to see that students of IGDTUW have secured good packages from famous companies.

Applauding the university for playing an important role in the development of the city, Sisodia added, “The Kejriwal government is with the university in every endeavour. Research plays an important role in the development of any country. The university must increase its focus on quality research by collaborating with the government and different organisations. The government will provide all possible support for this.” He also spoke about the need to increase the intake capacity of universities like IGDTUW. As many as 368 undergraduates, 131 postgraduates and 13 doctoral degrees were awarded at the convocation.

As a result, the physical copies of driving licences and documents related to vehicles will no longer have to be carried on road. The Kolkata Traffic Police had long been asking the transport department to “quickly approve” e-licences following motorists’ online complaints about digitized documents not being accepted. The decision will help launch its e-challan system sooner, claimed cops. The DigiLocker platform of the electronics and IT ministry and the mParivahan app of the road transport and highways ministry has the facility to store digitized versions of various documents, including driving licence, registration certificate, and even vaccine certificate. These electronic records available on Digilocker or mParivahan are deemed to be legally recognised on a par with original documents, as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989, the owner/ driver has to produce the documents to the authority on demand. Insurance details of new vehicles and renewal of insurance are also uploaded on VAHAN database and they reflected on the mParivahan /eChallan app of the ministry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/motorists-can-carry-digitized-licence-other-documents/articleshow/88461914.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The government had earlier banned mustard oil blending and import of edible oils from countries like Nepal and Bangladesh along with futures trade on seven agricultural commodities. "Ever since the government stepped in, there has been a regular dip in the prices. The government had also cut import duty. Compared to the price of mustard oil in April 2020 (Rs 190 per litre), its price is now at Rs 135 per litre. Likewise, the price of the soybean oil, which was Rs 140-150 per litre, is now at Rs 110 to Rs 120 per litre," said Pankaj Gupta, a wholesale dealer of edible oils at Sodala. He added that the prices of edible oils will drop further. "Government has also imposed the stock limit of edible oils, which will bring down the prices further," said Sunil Dadhich, a wholesale dealer of edible oils at Vaishali Nagar. Consumers are now buying pulses at the prices during the pre-Covid era. "During the first wave of Covid-19, suddenly there was a rise in the demand due to the panic buying by the customers. Then the production too had dipped due to the migration of labourers. These were the main reason behind the price rise of pulses. But now the production has improved. Also, the customers are no longer into panic buying. Hence, we are getting pulses at the prices in 2019," said Ramawtar Gupta, a retailer dealing with pulses at Malviya Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rates-of-edible-oils-pulses-drop/articleshow/88462479.cms||Ashish Mehta

Paramasivam and Nagarajan, both workers, sustained minor burn injuries and were admitted to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital. “It took two hours for our team comprising 17 firemen and three fire service vehicles to completely extinguish the fire.

Considering the heavy load of applications, the TSBIE has now procured additional scanners and has set up 13 evaluation centers. “From December 24, we would begin scanning all those answer sheets that are up for revaluation or recounting. These would be sent to the evaluation centers. We are taking utmost care that no technical glitch or other issues mar the revaluation results,” said Kumar. After a long wait, the TSBIE declared the Intermediate first year results on December 16. The results led to an uproar among students as only 49% cleared the exams. Total six student suicides were reported after the results triggering massive protests across Telangana. Following hue and cry by students, state education minister Sabitha Indra Reddy ordered to reduce the re-verification fee by 50 per cent. The board, which charges Rs 600 per subject for re-verification, has reduced the cost to Rs 300 now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/record-39000-apply-for-inter-result-revaluation/articleshow/88461900.cms||Preeti Biswas

The two traders, who were kidnapped from Sarkhej in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, were rescued by Rajkot police on Thursday. According to police, cumin traders Bharat Patel and his partner Parth Patel — both residents of Unjha — were kidnapped when they went to deliver a spice consignment in Sarkhej. Bharat and Parth were talking to a trader when five persons arrived at the spot and forcefully dragged the two inside their car. Later, an offence of kidnapping was registered at the Sarkhej police station. “The kidnappers were taking the victims from Bhavnagar to Jamnagar on Thursday morning when Bharat saw a police patrolling vehicle near Mahika village. He jumped from the kidnappers’ car and asked for help,” deputy commissioner of police zone-1 Manoharsinh Jadeja told reporters. Seeing the cops, the kidnappers tried to flee. The police patrolling van led by constable Rajesh Jadu chased the kidnappers and rescued Parth. The driver of the car, identified as Javed Chira (35) was arrested. The rest of the kidnappers were travelling in another car. Cops manage to nab one of them, Nadeem Sura, while others manage to escape. During police interrogation it came to light that Bharat’s brother-in-law Prabhudas Patel, a resident of Jamnagar, had hired the kidnappers. Cops said that Prabhudas was demanding his share of Rs 1.25 crore of a business deal. But Bharat had settled the matter by giving him just Rs 25 lakh. The accused first took the victims to Bhavangar where they were held captive at a farm house. From there they headed towards Jamnagar and were intercepted by the cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/2-abducted-traders-rescued-kidnappers-were-hired-by-kin/articleshow/88461030.cms||---

The markets of the city are busy making brisk business till late night. With the churches beautifully decorated with multi-coloured lighting, the denizens are busy making their ‘last-minute’ shopping for Christmas tree toppings and other decorative items at different stalls that have come up at various busy crossings of the city. Be it the footpath of Civil Lines or the main market of Katra, Chowk and that of several localities, several shops have mushroomed this week and offering variety of items needed to decorate the Christmas Tree. But what awaits believers on Christmas eve are the serene and solemn midnight services conducted by various churches in the city. A visit to the local Chowk and Civil Lines market revealed that decorative items along with designer cakes are turning out to be the key attractions for visitors thronging the shops set up on the eve of Christmas. From different sizes of bells to decorative laces, snowflakes, toffees, decorative shining balls, stars of different sizes are all there for sale to the festival revellers. Along with these, Santa dresses and caps too are an instant hit in the market. Interestingly, there is no religion divide to be seen anywhere when it comes to celebrate the festival. Thousands of youths of non-Christian families are purchasing the items for decorating their Christmas Tree and celebrating the festival. At the same time, many of those who are selling these items are Muslims. Toys and greeting cards are also among the most sought-after items among people of different ages visiting the markets for Christmas shopping. Both branded and non-branded greeting cards and gift items were selling like hot cakes. After not so profitable celebrations in 2021, this year the bakeries of the city are also flooded with orders with at least 150 odd calls for special cakes. What is more interesting is that denizens have been decorating their homes and shops with the help of special designers and even bringing decorative materials. The preparation for Saturday’s celebrations had begun by mid-December itself with people making plans and looking forward for shopping. People tend to think that Christmas shopping and purchasing gifts is the same thing, however, there is much more to Christmas shopping than just gifts. All the churches of the city have been decked up with colourful lights hanging from the high parapet. “Gone are the days when this festival was confined to Christian community alone as now people from all community don’t want to miss out the chance to take part in the festivities. I have planned to organise a get together at my home as a perfect end to the year-end celebrations and also getting a chance to give my family beautiful gifts,” said Smita Dikshit, a resident of Talirganj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/last-minute-christmas-shopping-soars-as-sangam-city-gears-up-for-celebrations/articleshow/88462495.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Authorities face challenge as strong currents of Ganga erode banks||Prayagraj: The upcoming Magh Mela 2022, scheduled to start from January 14, is all set to witness a face-off with river Ganga. The strong unabated currents of the river, which have shifted towards western direction (towards city), are eroding the banks and have resulted in decrease in land that has to be allotted to seers and different religious organisations. The mela authorities are witnessing the challenge, similar to the one they faced in the year 2004 where the ‘Sangam’ of the two rivers had shifted eastward forcing people to walk long distances to take the holy dip in the Sangam. To combat the continuous erosion by the river, the mela administration is working day and night. “The current of the river is quite strong and our experts are working tirelessly to minimise the erosion. We are keeping a tight vigil on the currents and situation is under control,” said Mela Adhikari for Magh Mela 2022, Shesh Mani Pandey. Expert carpenters, known as ‘Bind-Mallaha, are making crates, the structure made by bamboo and tree trunk, day and night and placing the same at carefully selected points at the banks where the river is causing erosion. “We are placing two crates one behind the other and both are tied with strong ropes. These are filled with gunny bags having sands of the bank”, informed a senior official of the flood control department working on the erosion site. Because of the strong currents, the mela authorities are fighting day and night to control the erosion of land between Treveni and Mahavir marg pontoon bridges. The JCB is pressed into service which is making points for fixing the crates to confront the erosion. The erosion of the river is nothing new, but the difference this year is the fact that there is an increased level of water in the river, as compared to earlier years, and as Ganga is shallow (not as much deep as Yamuna), the currents are strong. But, at the same time, more water also means clean river, which is a welcome development”, said head of TikarMafi Math, Mahant Hari Chaitanya Bhramchari, known for fighting for the cause of clean Ganga.  “It has become challenging for the mela authorities to control the currents of the river and with Ganga known for strong and unpredictable direction of its current, there needs to be continuous efforts to face the challenge”, said Someshwar Pandey, a purohit at Sangam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/authorities-face-challenge-as-strong-currents-of-ganga-erode-banks/articleshow/88462503.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi govt to increase salary of guest teachers in schools: Arvind Kejriwal||NEW DELHI: A day after one of the guest teacher groups working at Delhi government schools held a press conference highlighting how they were happy being part of the education system, Delhi government on Thursday said they would increase their salary as a “token of gratitude”. “I am happy to announce that the government has started the process to increase the salary of guest teachers,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. A delegation of ‘Dilli Atithi Shikshak Sangh’ had met Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday and submitted a representation on behalf of all guest teachers posted in the schools. About 22,000 guest teachers are working in over 1,000 Delhi government schools. Sisodia said, “I thank them for their contributions and significant role in supporting the education of students alongside regular teachers.” “Keeping inflation, increase in cost of living, and hardship of families due to Covid in mind, Delhi government has directed the education department to increase the remuneration of guest and contract teachers,” said a statement issued by the government. Highlighting how the condition of guest teachers has improved since the Kejriwal government came to power, Sisodia stated, “The department is working on the details of the same and will submit us the proposal for increment soon. This will enable them to live their life with dignity and continue to render their services wholeheartedly at Delhi government schools. Delhi government is the only government, which spends its 25% of annual budget on education. This includes the welfare of all the teachers who are dedicatedly working on development of a sustainable education model in the country.” Meanwhile, another group of guest teachers, All India Guest Teachers’ Association, issued a statement and said, “We are asking for a policy on regularisation of the guest teachers working in Delhi government schools. Salary was never our demand.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cm-govt-to-increase-salary-of-guest-teachers-in-schools/articleshow/88462497.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Most rape complaints to make partners fall in line: Hyderabad cops||HYDERABAD: In most rape cases reported in the Hyderabad police commissionerate limits in the last few years, police said majority of them were related to sexual exploitation of minors or reneging on marriage promise, after being in a physical relationship. However, social activists feel it is still a matter of concern since cheating is the crux of most rape cases. Hyderabad police on Wednesday said they registered 328 rape cases in the city so far in 2021. They claimed that except three cases, the remaining were “technical rape cases”. “It is a fact that some complainants, after being in a physical relationship, levelled rape charges to achieve their objective. For them, getting married (to their partner) was their first choice and, in worst-case scenario, get compensation. They were not interested in conviction and punishment. Except in genuine rape cases, in most cases, we found there was a delay even in lodging complaints,” a senior police officer told TOI. In some recent cases, courts had convicted the accused for sexually violating minor girls, a majority of the complainants. Sexual relationship with a minor girl, even if it is consensual, is a crime. In June, 2021, a man was awarded 10-year imprisonment for sexually abusing a minor girl by promising to marry her. She was exploited on multiple occasions. Later, when he reneged on his promise, a case was registered against him for kidnap and rape besides slapping chargers under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. In another case reported from Jawaharnagar, a local court had awarded life imprisonment for marrying and later sexually violating a 16-year-old girl. In this case, the girl’s parents had lodged the complaint. In another case, a divorced woman had a physical relationship with a man after he promised to marry her. Later, she filed a complaint accusing him of abusing her on multiple occasions besides refusing to keep his promise of marrying her. In this case too, the LB Nagar court convicted him. Officials and experts said in many cases, the complainants hoped their partners, who breached their trust, would fall in line and honour their commitment. “Awareness campaigns should be taken up in schools and students must be sensitised about the laws. Apart from cheating, the accused will face rape charge too,” activist Sunita Krishnan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-rape-plaints-to-make-partners-fall-in-line-cops/articleshow/88461919.cms||---

---||Delhi||Festive Low: Delhi's excise department looks to iron out issues on liquor stocks||NEW DELHI: Taking note of a TOI story highlighting shortage of alcohol during the festive season, Delhi government’s excise department on Thursday met restaurateurs, wholesale licence holders, liquor brands, retailers and the IT team handling the department’s portal. “The department meets all stakeholders regularly, but the purpose now was to iron out issues and clear any confusion about liquor stock. During festival time, the demand for liquor goes up and that is why we brought all stakeholders together,” said an official. The official added that measures were being taken to ensure more transparency and curb any confusion between retailers and wholesale L1 suppliers. “Now, it will be easy to know which vend has what liquor, apart from availability with stockists,” he said. Admitting that all 850 liquor vends should have opened by now, the official said there were different reasons for the failure. “However, nearly 500 vends have opened and the rest will also open soon,” he added. Sources said the department had urged manufacturers to register their brands as soon as possible and wholesale operators and brands were asked to improve supplies. Retail vendors were instructed to procure the most options available rather than merely stock only those brands that sell. A restaurant representative said they procured from retailers having L7 licences. Most retailers were only stocking popular categories. As a result, restaurants and consumers were facing shortage in the premium category or finding drinks of their choice. The department instructed retailers to ensure premium spirits and wines were better stocked. The representative of wholesalers said the department urged every stakeholder to work together and ensure most issues were sorted out and supply streamlined within a fortnight. The original idea of the policy was to ensure people bought the best quality liquor in Delhi at the lowest price, but the glitches were turning them away to Gurugram and Noida. The restaurants also raised the issue of not being able to see stock availability online. Because of this, they had to visit retailers and pick whatever was available with them. Apart from ironing out the glitches, the tech team assured to put up stock availability online every day so that people knew which outlet had what brands in what quantity. New licence holders were assured that inspections at their sites would be completed soon and most stores would open within a month. The issue around draught and imported beer was a policy matter and would take time to be sorted, said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/festive-low-excise-dept-looks-to-iron-out-issues-on-liquor-stocks/articleshow/88462511.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The woman died on the spot and the accused sustained over 90% burns. The deceased was identified as K Venkata Lakshmi, a contract sweeper at ESI Hospital, Nacharam. According to Kukatpally police, Lakshmi, a widow, had been in a live-in relationship with a welder, P Venkatesh, 52, of Jagadgirigutta for seven years. “Venkatesh is a widower,” Kukatpally inspector T Narsing Rao said. Seven months ago, Venkata Lakshmi moved away from Venkatesh as he started harassing her. “Lakshmi started staying in a room at Prakash Nagar in Kukatpally. She was avoiding Venkatesh, but he used to visit her once in a while and exert pressure on her to stay with him,” the inspector said. On Wednesday night, Venkatesh went to Lakshmi’s house. Around 8.45 pm, locals saw smoke emanating from the house and people screaming from inside. “We received a Dial 100 call from locals saying that two people were engulfed in flames in a house. We rushed to the house and by that time, locals put out the flames by opening the door and throwing water on the two people. CLUES Team examined the two victims and said that Venkata Lakshmi died and we shifted Venkatesh, who suffered over 90% burns to OGH for treatment. His condition is critical. Lakshmi’s son alleged that Venkatesh set ablaze Lakshmi and attempted suicide. However, Venkatesh stated that both of them attempted suicide. We have registered a murder case,” the inspector said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/man-burns-alive-live-inpartner-torches-himself/articleshow/88461934.cms||---

He said every drop of water from all the reservoirs of the state should be used in public interest and every person in the department concerneed will have to stay committed for the next two years. To fulfill the intention of chief minister Ashok Gehlot, department officers and employees should work with team spirit for preparing proposals related to the construction of dams and canals. At the meeting many important decisions were taken and the progress of works in the division and the current status of the ongoing projects were reviewed. Malviya said in the coming years, 100 anicuts would be constructed by the government and there was a need to make an action plan to save every drop of water in the area. He emphasised on efforts to fulfill the departmental commitment of providing adequate water to farmers along with drinking water in the entire area. Malviya said the action plan is to build two big canals inside Mahi one costing Rs 1,500 crore and the other Rs 800 crore.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: SIT to investigate death threats to Aaditya Thackeray, ministers||MUMBAI: The state government has ordered an SIT (special investigation team) probe into the threats received by ministers and legislators after the death threat received by Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray was discussed in the state assembly on Thursday. State home minister Dilip Walse Patil informed the state assembly that a man living in Bangalore named Jaisingh Rajput had been arrested in connection with the death threat to Thackeray and had been brought to Mumbai. He is in police custody for three days. “In view of the sentiments expressed in the assembly, we will set up an SIT to inquire into the death threats received by leaders and to formulate a policy regarding this,” said Patil.  Earlier, Shiv Sena MLA Sunil Prabhu informed the assembly that Thackeray had received a death threat on WhatsApp from a man in Karnataka. “Since personalities like Dabholkar, Gauri Lankesh and Kalburgi were killed by people from Karnataka, which has a BJP government, we need to see if there is a conspiracy,” he said. Others, including Nawab Malik from the NCP and Sudhir Mungantiwar from the BJP, also said that they had received threats.  Both Malik and the NCP’s Chhagan Bhujbal demanded action against the Hindutva outfit Sanatan Sanstha. “After the Sushant Singh Rajput case, there have been attempts to defame the MVA government. I have also received threats and there is a Twitter handle that it doing propaganda against the government and receiving funds of up to Rs 30 lakh,” alleged Malik.  He alleged that the Sanatan Sanstha was behind the killing of Dabholkar, Gauri Lankesh and Kalburgi. “Several ministers have received threats.  An SIT probe by an IPS officer is needed,” said Malik. Bhujbal demanded a ban on the Sanatan Sanstha. “This is a very serious issue and strong action should be taken. In the past, the Congress-NCP government had asked for a ban on the Sanatan Sanstha. The organisation is found in several states. If other states make the same demand, then the Centre should intervene,” he said.  BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar added that if legislators were being threatened, it reflected poorly on the state home department. “I have received threats and so has Sena leader Milind Narvekar,” he said.  Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that although the threat to Aaditya Thackeray was a serious matter, the state government was trying to politicise the issue. “We condemn such threats. Serious action should be taken against organisations behind such activities. Investigate the organisations, be it the one behind the Twitter propaganda, or the Raza Academy. I am happy to seek the cooperation of the Karnataka government in this case,” he said.  However, he pointed out that if the MVA felt the Sanatan Sanstha was a dangerous organisation, they had done little to act against it in their two years in power. “It is not enough to ask the Centre for a ban. The government has to provide conclusive proof against it, which it failed to do,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bluru-man-arrested-for-death-threat-to-aaditya/articleshow/88463305.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

---||Hyderabad||70% rape cases in Hyderabad are offences against girls aged 15-18: Additional CP||HYDERABAD: About 70% of the rape cases registered in Hyderabad this year are for offences committed against girls aged 15-18, said Shikha Goel, Additional Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad City, (Crimes &SIT). Speaking to TOI, Goel revealed that of the 328 rape cases registered in 2021, in 228 cases victims are minors. “Even if they consented for the sexual act, it is treated as rape as they are minors,” said Goel, who is also in-charge of SHE Teams and Bharosa Centres, Hyderabad, adding that most of these cases are filed by parents of the girls. She said that in the remaining hundred cases too, the offenders were known to the women. “None of these women were raped by strangers or in public places. The offenders are someone they trusted or were in a relationship with,” she added. While a total of 328 rape cases are filed in Hyderabad this year, in 2020 and 2019, the figures stood at 265 and 281, respectively. When it comes to cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, as many as 357 cases were registered this year as against 211 in 2020. In 2019, 339 cases were registered under POCSO for crime against children. Revealing the reasons behind more number of rape and POCSO cases registered this year, Goel said that it is the result of awareness programmes and initiatives started by the city police. “We started taking complaints at victim’s doorstep, through barcodes, among other modes,” she said, adding that lockdown and Covid-19 pandemic can also be a reason for more cases registered this year as it might not have been possible for some women to step out and lodge a plaint last year, especially in the case of domestic violence. The additional CP said that this year, they have ensured that about 8 to 10 offenders got life sentences or more than 20 years of imprisonment in POCSO cases. Goel said that even during the pandemic, they provided telephone or video counseling to victims. She said they are also working with companies to address workplace harassment and conducting online safety awareness programmes for students of 100 schools in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/70-rape-cases-in-city-are-offences-against-girls-aged-15-18-addl-cp/articleshow/88461930.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

The discrepancy was revealed after the administration began compiling data and documents to be sent to the state government for processing of the ex gratia amount of Rs 50,000 that the kin of the each Covid deceased will get. Pruthviraj told TOI, “There have been some cases in which people recorded as deceased are found to be alive. They have been reported from two talukas and also from the Latur Municipal Corporation limits. I have sought a report.” He said in one case, it has been found that a person who died, as well as another villager, had identical names. “The data was filled through government as well as private hospitals, but we are yet to find out if there was a mistake while filling data in Indian Council of Medical Research,” he said. Despite repeated attempts, Latur Municipal Commissioner Aman Mittal could not be reached for his comments. The ICMR authorities have sent a list of 724 people, who died of Covid-19 during the said period. Of these, 410 were residents of Latur city, while the remaining 314 were from rest of the district. The list also has contact number of the relatives and their addresses. As the civic staff started contacting the numbers earlier this week, they came across at least six cases, wherein the persons recorded dead due to covid-19 were found to be alive. The health authorities have also found that in about 150 cases, people fearing sealing of houses and areas, gave wrong addresses and contact numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/names-of-living-found-on-list-of-covid-dead-in-latur-district-investigation-on/articleshow/88460164.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||Leg break and work from home||The year 2021 began with ‘good news’ as the obstetricians and gynaecologists society in Nagpur decided to confer its biannual award for health reporters on this diarist. It was a crucial time post-first wave and Covid-19 vaccination was all set to start in the following week. It was one of the firsts and a very few functions held ‘offline’ or in ‘physical’ manner in between the first and second wave. So, anybody would have been eager to meet the fraternity, with the award being a cherry on the cake. Call it over-enthusiasm or destiny, but a simple slither while reaching the stage to receive the award led to five fractures in the foot and almost a month-long strict ‘Work from home’ for this diarist. It was more painful than the injury to stay at home with the leg under the plaster on January 17, 2021 – a historic day during the pandemic which marked the beginning of Covid-19 vaccination in India. In normal times, it would have been a month-long workless, and ‘worthless’ period for a reporter. But like a blessing in disguise, Covid-19 made ‘Work from home’ possible in the ‘field-work’ dominated domain. A month without face-to-face meetings, field visits, interviews and formal meetings began in the first week of January for this diarist. By February-end, this working style became a ‘new normal’ for many others too as the second wave set in and many restrictions on visits, movements and travelling followed. It was the same ‘leg break’ period when the Central government announced the names of Padma Shri recipients and one of them was Dr Dhananjay Sagdeo – who hails from Nagpur but works in Kerala for more than three decades now. As Dr Sagdeo was in Kerala, a phone call was the only way to contact him. Photographs were exchanged on email, information on WhatsApp, and quotes were taken on the phone – it was a full-fledged feature created completely in ‘Work from Home’ mode. Even native Nagpurians were unaware about Dr Sagdeo who left the city more than 30 years ago and they were surprised to see the details in TOI’s edition on January 28. When Dr Sagdeo came to Nagpur, he said every minute detail was covered so well in the piece that he forwarded the clipping of the article (which was also featured in the Kerala editions of TOI) to all journalists who called him for details. The second wave reached its peak in March, April, and May. At the same time vaccination for common people also began. Thankfully, the ‘leg break’ was over by this time when being on the field was most important. Apart from stories, this phase gave many fulfilling experiences while helping others and reporting about those who went out of the way and helped those in need. Finally, at the end of the year, Zonal Transplant Coordination Center (ZTCC) felicitated health reporters as ‘Organ Transplant foot soldiers’. All memories of the January came back. This time, the diarist walked to the stage with the highest level of care one can take. After all, however fruitful it may be, no one can afford another ‘Leg Break’, another ‘Work from Home’, and another wave.

---||Pune||Pune: Fast track court sentences man to 25 years in jail for raping 13-year-old kin||PUNE: The fast track court of special judge (POCSO Act) K K Jahagirdar on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a 23-year-old man to 25 years’ rigorous imprisonment, besides imposing a fine of total Rs60,000 on him for raping his 13-year-old cousin on April 1, 2019. Special public prosecutor Arundhari Bramhe told TOI on Thursday, “The accused was initially charged, among other offences, for rape on a relative but the court omitted and replaced the same with a charge under Section 376 (3) of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with rape on a girl below 16 years age. Last year, Section 376 (3) was amended with a provision of minimum 20 years of punishment for an accused in case of a conviction.” The court referred to the evidence recorded by witnesses and citations in details and observed that the survivor’s evidence remained intact even after cross-examination. As such, the accused had failed to rebut the charges and the presumption lies in favour of the prosecution. The fine amount is to be given to the survivor once recovered from the accused. As per the prosecution’s case, the survivor had been to her maternal aunt’s home for summer holidays. Her paternal aunt, too, stays nearby. Around 4.30pm on April 1, 2019, the survivor had gone to her paternal aunt’s home for watching television and the accused, who is her cousin, was then alone at home. While the girl was watching TV, the accused came near and touched her inappropriately before forcing himself on her. He went on to rape her despite the girl’s resistance. The accused had denied the allegations and claimed he was falsely implicated owing to a property dispute within the family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fast-track-court-sentences-man-to-25-years-in-jail-for-raping-13-year-old-kin/articleshow/88461971.cms||Vishwas Kothari

---||Kochi||Kochi: Consumers feel the heat as veggie prices remain high||KOCHI: Vegetable prices continue to pinch the pockets of public with the general prices of most of the items going north. Households have cut their monthly budget and adjusted the platter as price of tomatoes continues to be on the upper side of Rs 90. Since the third week of November, continuous heavy rainfall destroyed crops and disrupted transports due to cyclonic storms in both Tamil Nadu and Kerala. While the price of tomato is around Rs 95-115, fresh drumsticks are scarce and those available touch a steep Rs 231 per kg. “Even though prices of common use vegetables like bhindi, beans, tomato, drumstick and brinjal have risen, at the Horticorp markets, we are offering a subsidy of 15-20%,” said Horticorp Ernakulam manager Priyadarshini P. She said that the heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka disrupted the expected stock for both wholesalers and retailers. Prices of vegetables like cabbage, bitter gourd, onion, carrot and okra have seen a hike and the wholesalers in all major markets fear it will affect their sales even more in the future. “The wholesalers and retailers who used to purchase at least five sacks of daily use vegetables are leaving our shop with barely two sacks,” said Aabida, an employee at KKS Wholesale & Retail store market, Maradu. Following the hike, the rush has come down in wholesale markets which normally see an early morning or weekend rush of household customers. Sacks of vegetables lie unsold at the Agricultural Urban Wholesale Market at Maradu. “The rate of seasonal fruits also has increased. Customers are only purchasing one-fourth of what they used to buy earlier and the average amount spent is around Rs 300-350 even though they purchase 6-7 items barely,” said Abdul Kareem, an employee at Triple V Fresh, Kakkanad. The agriculture department has launched ‘Thakkali Vandis’ which sell tomatoes at Rs 50 per kg. Officials said that 28 such mobile markets have been launched with the help of Horticorp and locally sourced tomatoes are being sold after purchasing from farmer clusters through the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK). Horticorp has signed an agreement with seven farmer producer organizations at Tenkasi, which comes under the Tamil Nadu agri-marketing and horticulture department, to purchase vegetables directly from them for the next 11 months. This step aims to eliminate agents and middlemen and to sell vegetables to consumers directly through their units. “We are currently not facing any shortage of goods as people purchase les due to the skyrocketing prices,” says a shopkeeper at Vazhakkala. Housewives are forced to make revisions in their purchasing habit. “Usually I do not prefer tomato puree but now I find it as a cheaper option than the fresh vegetable,” said Beena K B, a housewife at Kaloor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consumers-feel-the-heat-as-veggie-prices-remain-high/articleshow/88461102.cms||---

Moreover, the students have made a huge cake, which is nearly 10ft long, on the campus. The cake was the main attraction of the celebrations as it was themed around the campus featuring the photos of various parts of the institution. Six different cakes were made by each branch and later they were joined together into a single one which weighed more than 6kg. Aisat manager Fr Denny Mathew said that cake was made as part of an interdepartmental competition in the college as part of the Christmas celebrations. “The Christmas celebrations was the first celebration in the college in nearly one-and-a-half years.

She was nabbed by a Customs officer at the green channel of T3.“The passenger had concealed the narcotics in the form of capsules,” said an officer. The woman was being observed by the Customs officer and he found her way of talking to be suspicious, sources told TOI. Sources close to Customs officials revealed to TOI, “After being nabbed, she has been kept under medical observation at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where the narcotics will be extracted from her body. Then only the exact quantity will be determined.

Last week the court had granted interim relief to Khan till Thursday. Khan’s lawyer Milan Desai last week argued that Khan is an Indian national and the allegations levelled against her are false. “Our argument was that Reshma Khan is an Indian, born and brought up in India. We even produced her school leaving certificate, voter ID and her parents’ IDs before the court. The matter has been adjourned for January 3 and till then interim protection will continue.’’ said Desai. Advocate Nitin Satpute intervened on behalf of Deepak Kurulkar, a retired police inspector who has lodged a complaint against Khan.

---||Chennai||To Periyar’s ideas, Tamil Nadu owes its growth||By Salem Dharanidharan Chennai: Revolutionary, reformer and champion of social equality — E V Ramasamy Periyar’s ideologies remain the foundation of Tamil Nadu’s social, cultural, political and economic growth even today, 48 years after his death.His fight to end caste discrimination and for women empowerment made Tamil Nadu’s growth model unique in the country. While states such as Kerala and Himachal Pradesh have done well in socio-economic development, others like Maharashtra and Gujarat have done exceptionally in terms of economic growth. Tamil Nadu, however, has been able to achieve success in both socio-economic development and industrial growth, with much lower index than that of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Though states such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have had caste mobilisations, they could not obtain the results of horizontal mobilisation of the entire gamut of oppressed castes. It is because of the inability to aggregate the subaltern groups to arrive at a common consensus and fight for a common cause. Renowned philosopher Ernesto Laclau says the most difficult challenge of any movement, across the world, is to unite the left-behind collective identities to aggregate themselves into one popular entity and represent their collective consciousness. One of the biggest achievements of the Periyar and Dravidian movement was to unite all those left behind horizontally under the common theme of dignity and provide them with the aspiration to achieve more. If Periyar was a movement, then what the successive Dravidian governments did was to implement laws and policies to realise the broader vision of Periyar and the Dravidar Kazhagam. When Tamil Nadu, under M Karunanidhi in 1989, passed the Hindu succession (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 1989, giving women equal access to property as that of her male siblings, it bestowed her with dignity and put her on an equal footing with her male counterparts. Such interventions played a major role in women empowerment — TN has one of the highest participations of women in the labour force at 30% in comparison to the Indian average of 19%.Another achievement was the ability to bring about a paradigm shift in societal thought — a deviation from one that accepted irrational existing social norms to one that questioned societal irrationality. This is significant because mere passing of legislation does not bring about intended results. A legislation is effective only when there is a broader consensus within society for it. That is the reason why the Congress government that was in power in Tamil Nadu until 1967 implemented policies in a limited sense, in conformity to the Dravidian ethos — such as extending the mid-day meal scheme introduced by the Justice Party and founding of state-level PSUs. Such policies were not pursued by the Congress government in other states. Increased aspiration led to education for people belonging to different social strata (TN has a gross enrolment ratio of 51%, while the pan-India average is 29%).Democratisation of bureaucracy along with demand for services from people, was one of the reasons that helped in alignment of bureaucracy with the interests of the public. This is one of the important differentiating factors that could explain the success of the mid-day meal scheme or ‘Amma’ kitchens in Tamil Nadu and failure of such similar schemes in some poorer states. Though the scourge of caste still exists, the state has made significant progress. And in this season of political polarisation and hate, Periyar’s legacy brings hope — if all countrymen could unite under the theme of dignity and social justice.(The writer is the executive coordinator of the Dravidian Professionals Forum)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/to-periyars-ideas-tamil-nadu-owes-its-growth/articleshow/88461996.cms||---
---||Delhi||DDMA clears the air, religious places will stay open with curbs||New Delhi: Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) clarified on Thursday that religious places would remain open for visitors for Christmas and New Year prayers and celebrations with strict compliance of the Covid safety norms. “Various communications are being received seeking clarifications about the status of permission for celebrating Christmas festival and New Year’s Eve in the territory of Delhi in view of the DDMA order as well as instructions issued,” DDMA said on Thursday while issuing the clarification. On Wednesday, the authority issued detailed directions to the district authorities in view of the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases and the presence of the new Omicron variant. It asked for strict enforcement of all DDMA orders, including the December 15 one that prohibited all social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and festival-related gatherings and congregations. The order had mentioned that district authorities “shall ensure that no cultural event/gatherings/congregations takes place for celebrating Christmas or New Year in NCT of Delhi”. DDMA clarified that as per the December 15 order, all religious places were already permitted to open for visitors/devotees to offer prayers/devotion/celebrations subject to strict compliance of the related standard operating procedures to prevent Covid-19, such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, regular handwashing and use of sanitiser. It further clarified that no separate permission was required for this. While many of the churches across the city had already planned to restrict the number of people in the Christmas congregation to 200, DDMA’s clarification came as a relief to all. Father Lawrence of Sacred Heart Cathedral said, “We will only be having a prayer service and no visitor will be allowed. We are also working in coordination with Delhi Police to ensure people do not crowd outside.” He added that only those who had registered online would be permitted to enter and even that number would be less than 200. “We have a capacity of 800, so technically we are not even going up to 50%.” Reverend Baldev R Sandhu, the presbyter-in-charge of Old Delhi’s St Stephen’s Church, said that unlike prior plans, visitors would be restricted. “We will follow the government directives and restrict the number of attendees to 50% of the capacity. Outsiders will also not be allowed,” he said. Before the government issued the clarification, senior officials of a few churches pointed out how controlled gatherings inside churches were being banned while markets were crowded. In the meantime, a senior citizen, Kamlesh Jacob, moved Delhi High Court through advocate Manoj V George, saying he is aggrieved by the “ban” issued without any prior notice. The plea challenging the order is likely to be heard on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-clears-the-air-religious-places-will-stay-open-with-curbs/articleshow/88462584.cms||Shinjini Ghosh
---||Aurangabad||Rail activists: Speed up Ahmednagar-Parli link||Aurangabad: Railway activists have demanded an official push to the rail route between Ahmednagar and Parli in Beed district. While the state government recently released Rs 90.13 crore towards its share of the project, the activists have pressed for concerted efforts to speed up the lingering work. Notably, even though the project was approved in the early 1990s, it is yet to be completed. The nearly 261-km route is scheduled to connect Ahmednagar to Parli via Beed. The rail route will have 17 stations and around 400 bridges. Of the total project, the work on around 64-km track from Ahemdnagar to Ashti in Beed district is nearing completion. The project has proposed a financial outlay of Rs 3,800 crore, out of which the state government is bearing 50% of the cost. As per the latest government resolution (GR), the Centre has so far spent Rs 1557.92 crore towards the project, while the state has disbursed Rs 1322.87 crore. Railway activist Gautam Nahata said the desired rail route has emerged as one of the slowest railway projects in the country. “The lack of political will as well as official apathy is responsible for sluggish progress of the project. The delay is hampering the overall development of Beed district,” he said. Another railway activist, Raj Somani, said both Centre and the state government should focus on speedy construction of the desired rail route. “Three generations of citizens from Beed are only hearing about the rail route from Ahmednagar to Parli. If the official neglect continues, few more generations will also experience similar wait,” he said. When contacted, authorities concerned from the Central Railway refused to comment on the progress of the project. The public relations officer of the Central Railway could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rail-activists-speed-up-ahmednagar-parli-link/articleshow/88460239.cms||---

The ADGP told reporters in Alappuzha on Thursday that the police teams have gone out of the state and are after the accused. He also confirmed that the killers have got help from outside the state. “It is a cat and mouse game. The accused are hiding. We will nab them,” he said. Since the accused are not using mobile phones, police are finding it difficult to track them. Around 17 people are suspected to be directly involved in both the murders. Of them, five are involved in the murder of Shan and 12 in the murder of Ranjith. Sakhare said that the probe teams have confirmed the identity of all these people from the CCTV footage. “We had only information about them from the CCTV footage. We have identified them from the footage. We are conducting raids at places where there are chances that they will hide. They are being chased continuously,” Sakhare said. He also said that he was confident of nabbing all the culprits. “But it may take some time,” he added. Regarding the continuous raids in Mannanchery panchayat, Sakhare said that the most important aim was to maintain law and order. “Law and order shouldn’t break down. We need to do a lot of preventive action for that. As part of investigation we need to interrogate many suspects. For that raids are necessary,” the ADGP said. Regarding the conspiracy behind the murders, Sakhare said that the probe team have some information, which he can’t reveal. “All those who are involved in the conspiracy will be found and booked,” he added. So far, eight arrests have been made in both murders. All those arrested are not directly involved in the murders. Meanwhile, one more person was arrested in connection with the murder of Shan on Thursday. Akhil, 30, a Cherthala native who helped the assailants to escape is the one who was arrested. He was the driver of the ambulance of Sevabharati in which the killers escaped after they abandoned their car in Kanichukulangara. The ambulance has been taken into custody. The probe team had got the custody of Rajendraprasad and Ratheesh, the two who were remanded in the case. They were taken to various places on Wednesday as part of evidence collection in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/alappuzha-murders-accused-have-left-the-state-says-adgp/articleshow/88461201.cms||---

The convicts, including a woman, were charged with several sections of Indian Penal Code including attempt to murder. The victims — Nilesh Patil and Vasant Patil — were badly assaulted and had sustained injuries on their skulls for which they were admitted to a private hospital for several days. Manjusha Patil, public prosecutor, said, “The court upheld the statements of the doctors from CPR hospital and private hospital along with several villagers to pronounce the sentencing. We examined 17 eyewitnesses during the hearing. The court has imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the convicts.” Anticipatory bail rejected Kolhapur district judge P M Vithalani on Thursday rejected the anticipatory bail application moved by Mansing Bondre who is an accused in the attempt to murder case lodged by his cousin at Juna Rajwada police station. Bondre was seen firing six rounds of bullets from his weapon aiming at the house of the complainant. Bondre’s two friends made the video of the incident and circulated it on social media. Police have nabbed the two who recorded the video, but Bondre is still absconding.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Police cannot be blamed for planned murders: CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Thursday said that the cold-blooded murders in Alappuzha were meticulously planned political killings and police could not be blamed for such planned murders. “It’s impossible to avert murders of this type as they are planned and executed by a political outfit. Police can only pre-empt a violence that happens as part of a tension in an area,” Balakrishnan said, adding that “the delay in nabbing the accused in such murders is quite natural. Those behind the incidents should have made every arrangement to escape the police net. But police are after the culprits and we are confident that all the accused would be booked at the earliest”. He was addressing a news conference after the party state secretariat meeting here. He said the murders in Alappuzha were intimidating. Both the SDPI and RSS were trying to wreck the communal harmony in the state. “They are not isolated, but purposeful murders. Attempts to scare people are made across the state. A heightened awareness on such nefarious designs of the ultra-groups should come up in the society,” he said. Balakrishnan said the CPM has decided to organize meetings at the local level on January 4 against violence unleashed by regressive forces. He said the BJP and RSS were making efforts to flare up communal feelings, especially after BJP’s assembly poll debacle. Extremist Muslim outfits were also taking stand that could help the agenda of the RSS-BJP. Both want to create chaos. “CPM asks the government to take strong action against such forces,” he said. He rejected the allegations that SDPI cadres have sneaked into the party. “This is part of a larger design to alienate minorities from the CPM. There is no truth behind the allegation that Ambalapuzha MLA H Salam has SDPI links. CPM is not the kind of an organization into which extremist elements can easily sneak in. If at all it happens, we have the mechanism to weed them out of the organization,” Balakrishnan said. On a statement by an SDPI leader that they were not sad, but only elated about the martyrdom of their slain leader, Balakrishnan said such statements were part of the renewed energy exhibited by extremist outfits after Taliban wrested power in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-cannot-be-blamed-for-planned-murders/articleshow/88461215.cms||---

Rahul paid homage to the departed leader at Ernakulam Town Hall, where the body was kept for the public to pay homage. He spent around 10 minutes at the venue and consoled the leader’s family. The Congress MP had arrived at Calicut airport on a two-day trip to his constituency on Wednesday morning but he cancelled his programmes as a mark of respect to Thomas and proceeded to Kochi. At Town Hall, apart from a few bouquets of flowers arranged in a platform in its courtyard, no wreaths were placed on the body as per the leader’s wishes. Musicians performed the Vayalar song live here. Meanwhile, Pinarayi Vijayan, accompanied by ministers P Rajeeve and Roshy Augustine, paid his respects at Thrikkakara community hall around 5.15pm. The district administration had declared a regional holiday in Thomas's constituency Thrikkakara in the afternoon. “PT always acted according to his conscience. He used to take a stand only after understanding the subject and ascertaining the correct position. PT has left a huge gap in Kerala politics,” said senior Congress leader Oommen Chandy. Other Congress leaders paid their respects to Thomas at Ernakulam district Congress committee office. Opposition leader VD Satheesan, KPCC president K Sudhakaran, former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala were among those present with Chandy. Earlier, the body, which reached his ancestral home in Thodupuzha on Wednesday night, was brought to his residence in Palarivattom around 11am with crowds gathering on the sides of the road. The body was kept there for a short while, when actor Mammootty paid his respects. Hundreds paid their homage to the leader at Muvattupuzha Nehru Park also. Earlier, Bishop of Idukki diocese Mar John Nellikkunnel, who visited Thomas’s ancestral home, recalled PT as Idukki’s pride and a role model for the new generation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rahul-pinarayi-pay-homage-to-pt/articleshow/88461212.cms||---

There were as many as five passenger trains from Kolhapur before the pandemic. Of them, only one has resumed after the second wave. Also, with the ongoing MSRTC strike and no passenger trains available, the locals, especially students and working professionals, are facing difficulties in travelling and reaching their desired places in time. Shivnath Biyani, member of advisory committee of Pune railway division, said, “Currently only one passenger train — Kolhapur to Satara — has resumed since November 16 and the ticket prices are high as it got a special train status. From Kolhapur passenger trains to Miraj, Sangli, Pune are also there, but haven’t resumed yet. Lack of communication between Railway board and state government is causing inconvenience to the commuters.” Vijay Kulkarni, a banker from Rukdi village, said, “I need to travel daily to Miraj to reach the bank where I am currently posted. The passenger train was convenient for me as it used to halt at small stations like Rukdi and its timing was such that it was perfect for the passengers and their job timings. The express trains need prior online bookings which is not possible for a daily travellers and also the fares of express trains are quite high.” Girish Chandwani, a trader from Gandhi Nagar, said, “Gandhi Nagar is a big cloth market. As the express trains are not halting here and with no passenger trains running, we and our customers are facing difficulties.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/start-passenger-trains-from-kolhapur/articleshow/88460252.cms||---

Samant said the SNDT University, Mumbai and Pune, has not filed its audit reports since 2015-16.He was replying to supplementary questions raised by MLCs during a calling attention motion on a Rs127-crore financial scam in the Dr B R Ambedkar Marathwada University, which was unearthed in 2018. Samant said a high-powered committee will be set up at the government level to prevent such malpractices in the future. Members complained of large-scale misuse of position by vice-chancellors in purchasing vehicles for their personal use, as well as financial misappropriation. Many demanded that all recruitment must be done by the government and not by the vice-chancellor. MLC Vikram Kale also raised the issue of vice-chancellors purchasing Rs40 lakh vehicles when they are allowed a limit of only Rs12 lakh. TOI was the first to report on vehicles being purchased at exorbitant costs by vice-chancellors. On the financial scam in Dr B R Ambedkar Marathwada University, MLC Satish Chavan asked why, after all these years, no action had been initiated against the guilty when it was a government report that had unearthed the scam. Samant assured the House that a First Information Report would be filed within a fortnight. Also, the current vice-chancellor would be asked about delay in taking action. “As for purchasing vehicles, the excess money shall be recovered from the vice-chancellors themselves,” said Samant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-university-sndt-havent-filed-audit-report-in-years-minister/articleshow/88463395.cms||---

He had alleged that the two made obscene gestures at his wife on September 28 and also used foul language and passed lewd comments. The complainant claimed that he had earlier provided documentary evidence against the accused to the police, but no action was taken. The SSP marked the complaint to the Sector 34 police station and the complainant met the SHO and the ASP (south division), but no action was taken against the accused.The complainant alleged that the accused had installed CCTV cameras to record their movement or keep an eye on them and it was a case of breach of his privacy. He said the UT police were working under pressure, as the accused had links with a national political party. When the complainant did not get justice from police, he filed a complaint with the SDM, who issued a reminder to police. However, when the cops did not act again, he reached the door of the Right to Service Commission. After verifying the facts, the commission said this service should be provided to the applicant by the designated officer within 30 days, failing which it will be presumed that the latter has nothing to say and further action will be taken as per the provisions of the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/right-to-service-panel-serves-show-cause-notice-on-sho/articleshow/88462037.cms||Pawan Tiwari
---||Hubballi||Churches told hold X’mas prayers indoors: Bishop||Mangaluru: Christmas Eve and Christmas day prayers in Dakshina Kannada will be held inside Church premises following all Covid-19 protocols. No additional events such as cultural programmes will be held, said Most Rev Peter Paul Saldanha, Bishop of Diocese of Mangalore. “The state government has come up with new guidelines for Christmas and New Year celebrations in wake of the Omicron variant cases being reported. Churches will strictly follow government guidelines. The Christmas eve and Christmas day mass will be held only inside church premises. All the protocols will be maintained. On December 24,the masses will commence from 7pm and churches can hold it open air. On December 25, churches have been directed to hold more masses,” the bishop said on Thursday. Fr John Baptist Saldanha, public relations officer of the diocese said the church is discouraging children and elderly (even if they are vaccinated) from attending prayers. “As per our knowledge, close to 85% of eligible beneficiaries under our diocese have been vaccinated with one or two doses. However, we are discouraging elderly and children from partaking in prayers,” he said. Give up indifferences and hate: Bishop’s message Bishop Peter Paul Saldanha in his Christmas message called upon people to give up indifference and hate, both within families and outside. “Today, the greatest tragedy is that the culture of indifference is growing. It is worse than hate. If we love someone,that person has a place in our heart and if we hate the person, he will be in our mind. But if we foster indifference, that person does not exist for us. We do not care whether he is alive or dead. This is the danger we are in, for many promote division, violence and death. Jesus teaches us by example to care and share, to give and forgive the enemies, and never to hate anyone. Hatred and indifference will burn us before it burns others. It destroys our conscience. It destroys the goodness within us,” he said. Bishop Peter Saldanha said, “Just like the go green initiative or Swachh Bharat, we need to foster Swachh mind and pure heart without hatred and indifference. Let this Christmas be for us, a challenge to foster a pure heart so that we see God in our neighbour and in nature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/churches-told-hold-xmas-prayers-indoors-bishop/articleshow/88460612.cms||---

Sources told TOI that Rawat will either be announced as the party’s CM face for Uttarakhand after the meeting or be given more power to lead the election campaign.  Sources also said that senior Congress leaders including Priyanka Gandhi had a word with the former Uttarakhand chief minster on Thursday. A number of senior leaders of Uttarakhand Congress, including a majority of the party’s MLAs and Rajya Sabha MP Pradeep Tamta, rallied behind Harish Rawat, pressing for him to be declared the CM face of the party ahead of the polls. His supporters started posting “Jahan Harda, Wahan Hum” on social media, indicating they are not averse to splitting from the party if the situation comes to that. Uttarakhand Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal told TOI that the meeting with senior leaders is about “certain issues in the state unit which have been bothering Harish Rawat.” “I have already informed the national leadership about the issues and they are being resolved. We will come out with a positive outcome in Friday’s meeting," said Godiyal, adding that they will press for Rawat to be made the CM face of the party. “He is the senior-most and most accepted leader of Uttarakhand. He is a ray of hope for the state.” In the past few days, differences between Harish Rawat and Devender Yadav, the party’s election in-charge for Uttarakhand, had come out in the open, with both the camps having differences mainly over ticket distribution, according to sources. Rawat is also believed to not see eye-to-eye with Pritam Singh, leader of opposition, and their respective factions are often at loggerheads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/day-after-tweet-indicating-unhappiness-with-party-organisation-rawat-likely-to-be-made-cm-face-of-congress/articleshow/88461222.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Police crack down on hate messages||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Police have launched a crackdown on those individuals who are spreading hate and communal messages aiming at creating communal polarization in the society through social media. As many as 30 cases have been registered by the police across the state since last Sunday for spreading hate messages and messages instigating communal tension in the society. Of the 30 cases, as many as 14 cases have been registered in Ernakulam rural, including at North Paravur, Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Aluva, Nedumbassery and Perumbavoor, while four cases have been registered at Palakkad, three in Malappuram, two each in Alappuzha, Kozhikode rural and Kasaragod and one each in Thiruvananthapuram rural, Kollam city, Kottayam and Thrissur rural. The cases have been registered under sections 153 of the Indian Penal Code and 120 (o) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. Of late, the state police have intensified the surveillance on social media for using them for creating communal tensions. In 2018, after the hartal that was instigated in the state using the cover of Kathua rape and murder using the social media, the police had zeroed in on some WhatsApp groups, especially based on northern Kasaragod and southern Karnataka that were trying to further create communal division under the guise of police action against the perpetrators of hartal. Some of such groups had created digital hate posters in the name of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) alleging that there is a nexus between the RSS and the CPM. Similarly, when the verdict on Sabarimala led to tensions in the state, the police had to depend on its IT cell in a big way for surveillance on social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-crack-down-on-hate-messages/articleshow/88461223.cms||---

The GSPCB also granted relaxation in the buffer zone around the SWMF. The technological interventions proposed at the facility include double door system for tipping floor coupled with bio-filters, in-feed bunker system instead of open tipping floors, all waste to be handled and stored in enclosed sheds, two digester tanks to facilitate treatment of waste during maintenance, solar drying shed for compost and RDF moisture removal and storage shed and effluents treatment plant. The GWMC has submitted an application for renewal of consent to establish (CTE) and the same is under process. The Curchorem-Cacora Municipal Council (CCMC) had informed the board that it had convened a special meeting on November 26 to discuss and decide on the buffer zone for the SWMF at Cacora. The CCMC had requested the board to depute staff to brief the council about the matter. Accordingly, the board staff briefed the CCMC regarding the “guidelines on the provision of buffer zones around waste processing and disposal facilities” at a meeting. The council was told that as per the guidelines ideally a distance of 500m should be maintained as the buffer zone, however on case to case basis a distance of minimum 200m from the facility can be considered subject to the condition that such facility meets the stipulated standards prescribed by the state pollution control board. The CCMC submitted the minutes of the special meeting on December 8 to the board and said that it had resolved that the buffer zones should be frozen taking into account that no nearest standing structure, including houses or government polytechnic college property comes within the SWMF’s buffer zone at Cacora. As per the minutes of the meeting, the CCMC asked the board to consider its proposed buffer zone as dwellings and other structures existed prior to the government acquiring the land for setting up the SWMF at Cacora and the SWMF has been setup on land which has been reclaimed after remediation and disposal of old waste dumped at site. “After deliberations, members accepted the proposal submitted by the CCMC with regard to amendment of the buffer zone for the SWMF. Further it was observed that the consent for the facility had expired and while granting the renewal for consent to establish the above conditions should be prescribed,” GSPCB said. The technological interventions proposed at the facility include double door system for tipping floor with bio-filters, in-feed bunker system, two digester tanks , solar drying shed for compost and RDF moisture removal and storage shed and effluents treatment plant||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pollution-board-permits-tech-intervention-at-cacora-plant/articleshow/88482595.cms||Murari Shetye

The educational institutions created by Christian missionaries have played a significant role in Dharwad's designation as a educational hub.Dharwad has approximately 7,000 Christian families, 70% of whom are Protestants and the rest are Catholics.What makes Christmas in Dharwad unique is that local customs and culture have a strong influence on the festivities, while some Christian families are influenced by their counterparts in neighbouring Goa.The Hebich Memorial Church on the Basel Mission compound, the Holy Christ Church on the premises of Saint Joseph's School, and the All Saints Church on Haliyal Road are all decked out up and bustling with activity. The Basel Mission compound, which houses many Christian families, has been brightly illuminated and attractively decorated with colourful balloons, bells, ribbons, stars, glitters, and buntings. The week-long festivities will begin on Friday with 'Children's Christmas,' followed by midnight prayers. Members of Christian households would visit churches early in the evening to join in mass prayers.In the same way as Hindus celebrate Deepavali, Christians light sky lamps and cook delicacies such as Chakkuli, Avalakki, Karchikai, and laadu. On Saturday, after the special prayer at the Churches, the Bishop and the Pastors will deliver the Christmas address. Special discourses will be held on Jesus and Christianity. Bishop’s messageNew Bishop of Church of India’s northern diocese Rev. Martin C Borgai in a message said special prayers will be held in honour of Covid warriors and those who lost their lives during the pandemic. Jesus Christ preached peace and harmony in society over 2000 years ago and his preachings bear relevance even now. Christmas celebrations will be meaningful only when all the members of the society irrespective of their religion, caste and creed live in harmony and celebrate all the festivals together, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/christmas-celebrations-to-be-grand-this-year/articleshow/88460273.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

The accused has been handed over to the Government Railway Police in Manmad,” Kshitij Gurav, the divisional security commissioner, Bhuswal, said. The incident occurred at Naydongry railway station where the train had halted for technical reasons. When the train started at 6 am a 37-year-old man, named Jaglal Paro Yadav, pulled the alarm chain alleging a woman had kidnapped his three-year-old daughter. The RPF and railway employees brought the complainant to the Manmad police station and at the same time, alerted the control room. One of the guards at the station had seen a woman boarding the Nanded-bound ‘Sachkhand’ Express that was standing at Naydongry station. The guard, Sarvesh Yadav, who got suspicious, shared the photo of the woman with the station superintendent and the RPF personnel. After confirmation of the child’s identity, the RPF staff quickly alerted the train escort party. The woman was located in one of the coaches and was made to deboard at Manmad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/rpf-team-foils-attempt-to-kidnap-3-yr-old-girl/articleshow/88460270.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Lakdawala, police informer Maharaj held for extortion||MUMBAI: The City Crime Branch on Thursday arrested gangster Ejaz Lakdawala and police informer Salim Penwala alias Maharaj in an alleged threatening and extortion case. The Anti Extortion Cell of the Mumbai Police took the custody of Lakdawala and Maharaj from the Arthur Road jail where they have been lodged since 2020 under the stringent MCOCA. While Lakdawala was arrested from Bihar, Maharaj and another gangster, Tariq Parveen, were arrested for their nexus with Lakdawala. The fresh arrest pertains to the complaint lodged by businessman Abbas Ratanshi, one of the partners in Foxlight India Private Limited, which supplies equipment and accessories for Bollywood film shootings. Ratanshi has a 33% stake in Foxlight and has been locked in a dispute with his partners in the company for some time. According to police, in June 2019, gangster Chhota Shakeel aide Riyaz Bhati summoned Ratanshi to his office in Juhu and threatened him to quit the company in exchange for Rs 5 crore. Ratanshi did not agree. Within a few days, Ratanshi received a call from an unknown international number. The caller, who claimed to be Lakdawala, threatened the complainant with dire consequences and said that if he wanted his business to run smoothly, he should cough up Rs 5 crore as ‘good luck’ or he would be killed, police said. “The complainant got scared and he first went to Bandra and later to Khar police station to lodge a complaint against Lakdawala. But within a few hours, Lakdawala called him up and yelled at him, asking why he approached the police,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lakdawala-police-informer-maharaj-held-for-extortion/articleshow/88463419.cms||Ahmed Ali

They have also been asked to consider steps like imposing night curfew or other curbs to contain the spread. As per health department, over 3,000 people have come to Uttarakhand since November. “Of them, 1,800 have already completed their 14-day mandatory quarantine while some are still under isolation. “We are trying to track the remaining 1,000 returnees. Chances are that they may not be in the state,” said Dr Tripti Bahuguna, director-general, family and health welfare department, Uttarakhand. Sources said most of the returnees have come to Dehradun, followed by Udham Singh Nagar, adding that most are from European countries. Health officials said by Monday the genome sequencing report would be in. It seems that people are not sharing their travel history or co-operating with authorities. The department has urged international travellers to co-operate. “We urge all international travellers to provide their travel records to their district Covid-19 help centres through our helpline numbers. And stay under quarantine for at least 7 days and on the 8th day get a sample tested again, and continue following covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Dr Pankaj Singh, IDSP State Nodal Officer, health department. TOI had earlier reported that health authorities have contacted the crime branch of police to track travellers who had mentioned Uttarakhand as their destination post arrival at Indira Gandhi International Airport.

The drive which started in November had recorded visits of health officials across 56,000 villages till December 21 to identify the vaccination status of the eligible adults. People of at least 4,000 villages were found to be completely immunised with both the doses. Sachin Desai, the state immunisation officer, told TOI, “Some of the districts which include the villages having 100% second dose vaccination status are Ratnagiri (152 villages), Kolhapur (38), Nagpur (35), Satara (36), Solapur (78), Washim (144), Yavatmal (8), Gondia (5), Nashik (59) and Jalgaon (6). There could be many other districts as well.” The report stated that over 20,000 villages across the state had reported 100% first dose vaccination. The drive found that around two crore beneficiaries did not take even a single jab across the state and around 2.7 crore beneficiaries were yet to get their second dose. A health official said the survey findings would change significantly because the drive was under way from November and the health authorities were able to make unvaccinated people aware about the importance of vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-of-4000-villages-in-state-fully-vaccinated-report/articleshow/88462069.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Such pleas are for minor corrections, in spellings, names or suchlike. On Thursday, a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar said the HC can’t pass orders or even hear th-em on merit given the nature of application. Advocate Sudeep Pasbola said the accus-ed would withdraw their app-lication and in January, file a proper petition for review of order.

---||Chennai||Nivethan is grabbing his chances with both hands||Prasad.RS@timesgroup.comChennai: It was just a few weeks ago when Mumbai-born Ajaz Patel became a part of cricket history taking 10 wickets in an innings for New Zealand. Ajaz’s success is not a case in isolation. In countries such as Australia, England and New Zealand, cricketers from the Indian diaspora are making a mark.Chennai boy Nivethan Radhakrishnan — an ambidextrous allrounder — is the new kid on the block. The 19-year-old, who had earlier featured in the Tamil Nadu Premier League, has been selected to play for the Australian team for the U-19 World Cup in West Indies next month. He started off as a pacer but now bowls off-spin with his right-hand while the one leaving the right-hander after pitching is his stock-ball with the left-hand."Representing Australia in a World Cup is the biggest achievement yet in my career. I will try and win the trophy by contributing equally with bat and ball," Nivethan told TOI from Sydney.Ever since his family shifted base from Chennai to Sydney in 2013, Nivethan’s skills have improved and the steady performances in age-group cricket have kept him on the Australian junior selectors’ radar. While Nivethan is an ambidextrous bowler, he bats left-handed — literally grabbing opportunities with both hands.The first prominent signs of Nivethan’s superior skill set Down Under came with the New South Wales (NSW) junior team. In 2017, Nivethan made a mark in NSW’s Moore Shield. His sturdy performances with the bat and ball earned him the "Best Moore shield player of the year in NSW’. Two years later, Nivethan shone for the Australia U-16 team against Pakistan U-16 on their UAE tour. During that series, Nivethan led his side’s bowling charts with seven wickets in four outings and also scored 145 runs. Nivethan’s allround abilities fetched him contracts with TNPL sides Karaikudi Kaalai and Dindigul Dragons. In the first phase of IPL held in India this year, Nivethan was one of the net bowlers with the Delhi Capitals. The year 2021 got better for Nivethan when he signed up for Tasmanian Tigers to feature in the Sheffield Shield in June.Nivethan’s cricket journey began early in Chennai.Before he turned five, Nivethan had played his first game. "My friend S Prabhu, who runs the Swaraj Cricket Academy, took Nivethan to watch the Blue Star U-12 tournament, where his team was playing YMCA Nandanam. As luck would have it, a player wasn’t available and Nivethan got to play. He went on to score 18 runs opening the innings," Nivethan’s father Anbu Selvan, a former Tamil Nadu junior player, reminisced.Prabhu, who works with the postal department, describes Nivethan as a gutsy cricketer. "Nivethan is many players rolled into one. I remember him being hit on the head during a match when he was eight. It required quick medical attention and Nivethan was back on his feet in no time and went on to hit the same bowler for a boundary an over later," Prabhu recalled. As an eight-year-old Nivethan also got a hat-trick in a TNCA lower division encounter turning out for Gopalapuram Cricket Club. "He is blessed with great game awareness and Nivethan has shown it time and again," said V Suresh, who coaches at the Future Stars Cricket Academy. "My coaches — Prabhu and G Ravichandran — have had a great role to play in my initial years in the game," said Nivethan. The promise Nivethan showed in his game prompted Anbu — who has real estate investments in Sydney — to migrate to Australia.Nivethan didn’t find it too difficult to find his footing and soon enough he was playing club cricket. While he had learned the basics of the game in India, coaches in Australia helped him blossom, allowing him to be himself with his out-of-the-box skillset. "The best thing about coaches in Australia is that they don’t tinker with your skills unless necessary," the teenager said.The fact that Nivethan’s elder brother Nikethan — who represented Tamil Nadu in U-14 level — too plays the game, has only helped him with his cricket. "Nikethan, though, has made academics his priority and is pursuing medicine," Nivethan said.While Nivethan has rubbed shoulders with the likes of R Ashwin, Ricky Ponting and Marcus Stoinis — his all-time favourite remains the West Indies great Sir Garry Sobers. "I have only one idol — Sobers. He is the finest allrounder the game has ever seen. I am looking forward to meeting him in Barbados when I go there to play the Under-19 World Cup," said Nivethan.Email your feedback with name and address to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/nivethan-is-grabbing-his-chances-with-both-hands/articleshow/88462070.cms||---

A large police contingent — around 100 cops led by an ACP — will check all revellers who step out of hotels, bars and pubs to take the driver’s seat on Friday evening. While 75 cops will hit the street at 9am, others will carry out anti-drink driving checks from 4pm. On Christmas day, around 125 cops will be on the road. “Since putting up nakas will delay traffic flow, we plan to carry out the checks outside restaurants and pubs . This will reduce chances of drink-driving on the roads around Park Street-Maidan-Park Circus,” said an officer. The checking, said sources, will be held in close proximity to each other so that erring drivers do not manage to give cops the slip. According to the plans, traffic cops will be present at the Birla Planetarium crossing, Victoria Memorial Hall north gate, Rabindra Sadan crossing, Jeevandeep building and JL Nehru Road-Park Street crossing. Cops will also be deployed at Park Street-Russell Street crossing, Park Street-Camac Street crossing and Park Street-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road crossing. There have been 185 cases of drink-driving this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-warning-against-drink-driving-on-festive-days/articleshow/88461279.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Local tourism in Kolkata gains from international travel curbs, ‘O’ scare||KOLKATA: International travel curbs, Omicron scare and good connectivity have diverted tourists to destinations in the forests, beaches and hills within the state with homestays, hotels and guest houses booked to 65%-80% of their capacity. Various accommodations belonging to various government organisations like the fisheries department, tourism department, forest department and public health department are also witnessing heavy rush due to their prime locations and reasonable tariff. Various families and groups prefer travelling during the Christmas-New Year break but many seem to have abandoned the plans of travelling to other states and international destinations and opted for places within the state due to international travel curbs and Omicron scare. Eco-tourism in the Junglemahal or the forest areas is the hot spot this year. Several travellers are preferring to stay in the small hamlets where local villagers have turned their homes into small homestays. These homestays provide a complete rural living experience. “Barring a few weekdays, we have bookings till the second week of January. Most of the guests are families who want to go on local sightseeing, visit local temples and see the tribal lifestyle firsthand during their stay,” said Suman Mandi of Akhrasol village, who has converted one of his huts in the village into a homestay. “We decided to travel to Purulia to avoid the crowds,” said Madhulina Chanda, a resident of Lake Town. Several tourists are also headed to the cold environs of the hills with homestays and hotels in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Lepchajagat and other destinations recording 80% occupancy. “The mercury has dipped and the Kanchenjunga can be seen clearly from several points and this has created excitement among the tourists. They have already started coming and most homestays and hotels are full. Tourists can be seen everywhere in the Darjeeling town,” said Prashant Chettri, a member of the Homestay Association of Darjeeling. A big portion of tourists are also headed to beaches in Mandarmani, Digha and Tajpur for the Christmas and New Year’s weekend. Almost all the hotels and government accommodations are full on both the weekends. “Last year, we had a very lean season due to the pandemic. But this year, we have a good number of bookings as the cases have been low for months and people have been vaccinated. There are bookings during the weekdays too,” said a hotel owner in Mandarmani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/local-tourism-gains-from-intl-travel-curbs-o-scare/articleshow/88461265.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Every second Sunday of the month, when there would be a break in film shootings, he would sit down with them at their Ramavaram Gardens home, eating out of a big silver platter with a gold flower etched in the centre. Maruthur Gopala Ramachandran would make small balls of rice, curry, vegetables and meat and hand it around to his children.Many have memories of MGR — as an actor, benefactor and politician, who founded the AIADMK. Few, except wife Janaki and his foster children – Appu Appu (K Ravindran), Radha, Latha, Sudha, Geetha and Janaki — had a close-up view of the family man who instilled in them life’s values besides being a real-life hero to them. But 34 years after his death, MGR’s material legacy is still a bone of contention; and hovering like a shadow is V K Sasikala trying to stamp her claim on his political legacy.On October 17, when Sasikala unveiled a plaque at the MGR memorial in Chennai to mark the AIADMK’s golden jubilee celebrations. Etched on it was her name as the ‘party general secretary’. It was greeted with mixed feelings at Ramavaram Garden. Memories tumbled out and so did political sentiments kept away from the MGR household."MGR ensured we had nothing to do with the film industry and he was not in favour of us joining politics either," recalled Radha Gopalakrishnan, who lives in a portion of Ramavaram Garden with her husband and grandchildren. It’s an uneasy coexistence between the cousins and siblings, a forced geniality to conceal their discomfort. While Radha and Appu are children of Janaki’s cousin, the others are her brother P Narayanan’s children.Once, when Radha was 10 years old, she accompanied MGR to Brindavan Gardens for the shooting of a film with Saroja Devi. "I was upset that he was acting with another woman. So, he took me aside and said jocularly, ‘Unn ammave katti pidicha yaaru thuttu tharava (If I hug your mother, who will give me money)?’ I was mollified." Radha has never gone to the MGR memorial. "I believe my father is still alive," she said.Appu’s wife Nirmala, who now lives in Palakkad in Kerala, has some fond memories of her father-in-law. "He loved my chicken curry and would often ask me to cook it," said Nirmala. "MGR must have wanted all of us to live together, having bequeathed the house to all of us. But rest whatever he had, he gave it to the party and the people. That is why he is still revered as God," she said.The once close-knit family is divided now. There are walls running across the Ramavaram bungalow, dividing it into five portions. Latha Rajendran, the oldest of the siblings, has assumed responsibility as the temporary trustee of MGR’s will after the death of her husband. She manages the MGR Deaf and Dumb School on the residential premises, the MGR memorial in T Nagar and a few other properties.MGR was fond of jotting in his diaries, a habit which he inculcated in his children. "He taught us silambattam and swimming; he also helped us with our lessons," said Sudha Vijayakumar, whose son Ramachandran is an AIADMK functionary. "He would give us diaries and ask us to write about our day’s happenings," said Sudha.In January 2017, after former chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death, Sasikala visited the MGR Ramavaram residence to unveil a plaque that for the first time identified her as party general secretary. "This was MGR’s home. Anyone is welcome. When Sasikala came, I welcomed her with tender coconut water," said Sudha.But her siblings chose to distance themselves from the AIADMK and Sasikala. In 2015, Geetha Madhu Mohan and Appu’s wife Nirmala opted to join the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit. "I was nine years old when the AIADMK was launched. My sister Janaki, who now lives in the US, and I danced to the song ‘Namadhu vettriye naalai sarithram sollum’ (from the MGR film ‘Ulagam Suttrum Valiban’) to mark the inauguration of the party flag," said Geetha. That’s as close as the children got to AIADMK politics.As his children quietly prepare for MGR’s 34th death anniversary on December 24, it’s far from the togetherness their ‘cheycha’ would have hoped for. "He wanted us to be friends forever," said Geetha. Every death anniversary, the siblings would visit the MGR memorial on the Marina beach to pay their respects at dawn. But property disputes and political affiliations have soured the bonds. Now, not even MGR’s memory can bring them together.Email your feedback with name and address to southpole.toi@timesgroup.com||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/the-divided-house-of-mgr/articleshow/88462079.cms||Jaya Menon

Homes, malls, shops and establishments are ushering the Yuletide celebrations with lighting, decoration and music. The city is decked up for the celebrations amidst Covid-19 (Omicron variant) cases being reported. Mabel Lobo, a retired office assistant, said, “If last year was a simple celebration with only the family, this year, we have a lot of guests from far off places visiting us. I am overwhelmed because I became a grandmother only a few days ago, adding to the celebrations.” Linet Menezes, a banking professional said that carol singing is back and so is decorations across the city. “Since our relatives settled abroad could not travel last year, we had not prepared kuswar (traditional Christmas sweets). However, this year, it has turned out to be more meaningful, as most of them who have arrived from abroad are involved in Kuswar preparation, though we are also scared of the Omicron variant,” she shared. The shopkeepers who sell decorations, kuswar, flowers, cakes, garments and other essentials have noticed an improvement in business. “This year, people have gone back to buying cakes to gift their loved ones. We have received orders from a lot of NRIs who have come home on vacations,” said Michael Saldanha of Crave Desserts and Bakes, Mangaluru. Flower vendor Shekar said the price of Shankarapura Mallige has increased due to weddings and the festive season. At schools, Christmas celebrations are back in offline mode. Sister Melissa, principal, Mount Carmel Central School, said last Christmas, staff members had conducted a programme and it was telecast online to students. This time, a lot of activities for students are being held offline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/rome-of-east-all-set-for-a-grand-christmas/articleshow/88460769.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

This has been done to facilitate construction of the double-decker flyover and Pune Metro viaduct at the junction, and a sizeable number of traffic police personnel were deployed to ensure smooth flow of traffic. Commuters who travelled on the stretches on Thursday said presence of cops, wardens and guards at all key junctions on diversion routes should continue to manage vehicles, restrict violations. Construction of the flyover and Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar line viaduct is being executed by the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) here. Various measures were introduced in the area on Thursday as part of the plan. Direction boards have been displayed at SPPU Chowk and the turn of Abhimanshree link road to assist commuters. Barricades are also up at SPPU Chowk to prevent entry towards Baner Road. Akhil Jadhav, who travelled on the changed route, said, “Most vehicle owners only realised about the plan after reaching SPPU Chowk.The authorities should display boards well in advance to alert people about the changes, which will reduce confusion, especially at night.” Another traveler, Vaishali Raut, added, “Instances of wrong-side driving on both Pashan and Baner roads must be curbed. On day one, many such violations were seen. There should be some check on speeding vehicles. More barricades may help.” A traffic police warden said, “We are urging all commuters to not indulge in wrong-side driving and trying to ensure minimum disruptions to traffic flow at SPPU Chowk.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/smooth-launch-of-one-way-plan-at-sppu-chowk-baner-pashan-roads/articleshow/88461281.cms||---

MGP said that they will win Pernem, Mandrem, Bicholim and Mayem seats. MGP president Pandurang Dhavalikar said that BJP workers are trying to get Arlekar to join BJP. Recently, MGP Mayem candidate Premendra Shet joined BJP. Dhavalikar said some people are trying to defame Arlekar. “Since the last two years, Arlekar has been working in Pernem and BJP is trying to take him. Whenever I have met him, he has never told me that he has ever met any BJP people. Today he is with us and he will contest the upcoming assembly election from Pernem on an MGP ticket.” The MGP president said that with his statement the rumour of Arlekar joining BJP should be put to rest. He said that BJP will be defeated in Mandrem, Pernem, Bicholim and Mayem constituencies. “MGP candidates will get elected in these constituencies. TMC is with MGP and the next government will be formed by the MGP-TMC alliance,” Dhavalikar said and added that in 2017, MGP had won the Pernem seat. The MGP president said that BJP is master in spreading rumours and that people of Goa need change because of sex scandal, job scam and Covid mismanagement among others. Arlekar said that there was opposition to the MGP-TMC alliance in Pernem, and added that he had convinced his supporters about it. “BJP thought that I’m a winnable candidate and that is the reason they spread the rumours of me joining them. Last two years I've been in MGP and now I will start my campaign aggressively,” he said. The MGP candidate said that he has never met any BJP Pernem mandal representative. “I challenge anyone to prove that I have met any BJP member,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/not-joining-bjp-clarifies-mgps-pernem-candidate/articleshow/88482117.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at the general body meeting of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the corporators said the vehicles deployed for the garbage transport were irregular and many vehicles always remained off the road for repairs or maintenance work, hampering the lifting of waste. They asked the vehicle department to function more efficiently so that a maximum number of vehicles were deployed on roads. Haridas Charvad, a corporator from the Sinhagad Road area, said, “Garbage handling should be improved in the fringes and in recently merged areas. Huge garbage is piled up at most spots where PMC’s jurisdiction starts.” Corporator Madhuri Sahasrabuddhe from the Erandawane area said the vehicles either remained under maintenance or were busy completing the RTO formalities. “The vehicle department should look into these things.” “The commissioner and the heads of the departments should pay surprise visits at the depot ”, said Pravin Chorbele, a corporator from the Market Yard area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/corporators-demand-more-vehicles-to-lift-garbage/articleshow/88461300.cms||---

Observing that the matter concerns the safety of a woman employee and the sanctity of the court, Justice G R Swaminathan also directed the police to register an FIR regarding the incident based on the complaint given by petitioner S Ramanathan, an advocate practising before the judicial magistrate-cum-district munsif court at Kamuthi.Justice Swaminathan observed that there are prima facie materials to show that Muniyasamy, in a drunken condition, misbehaved with a woman court staff on the court premises during working hours. The incident is said to have taken place when the victim was on turn duty alone in the office during a holiday. He said the principal district judge in his report has confirmed that the victim had categorically stated that the allegations made by her against Muniyasamy are true. The report further states that the incident was captured on CCTV and the footage is very much available. The report also contains the final report of the Ramanathapuram Gender Sensitization and Internal Complaints Committee. The complaint was closed by the committee since the victim did not pursue the matter.However, the judge observed that the allegations are extremely serious. The victim did not want to pursue the matter because she has been granted the relief of transfer. The court cannot be a mute spectator to the incident and gloss it over. The materials available on record clearly make out offences under Sections 353 and 354 of IPC and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act, 1998. Hence, the judge directed the police to register an FIR on the incident, based on the complaint given by the petitioner.Petitioner S Ramanathan came to know about the incident during May and took up the matter with the in-charge magistrate. He also spoke to some fellow advocates for initiating action against Muniyasamy. Instead of acting on the petitioner’s request, the petitioner was implicated in a case for offence under Section 294(b) of IPC, based on the complaint of Muniyasamy. Since his complaints did not elicit any response, the petitioner had filed the present writ petition before HC Madurai bench directing the police to register a FIR on the complaint preferred by him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sexual-harassment-hc-asks-cops-to-book-bar-assn-prez/articleshow/88462082.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The last year and a half was spent focusing on the pandemic because of which the project took a back seat. We will soon see what could be done,” said Dr Manoj Upreti, chief medical officer. The idea of installing the GPS in ambulances was to monitor them in real time, keep an eye on the response time, check for unscheduled and unnecessary stoppage and also to save treatment time. However, that hasn’t happened yet with the district ambulances of health department. On the other hand, all 32 ambulances with Dial 108 have the facility. “This includes the seven advanced life support ambulances and 25 basic ones as well. The GPS helps with better coordination and monitoring. Currently, one of our ambulances is dedicated to ferrying Covid patients,” said an official at the ambulance service. Officials claim that private ambulances have their own monitoring systems. “We don’t care about the facility either way. Our job will still remain the same. The only difference will be that instead of using maps separately, we will be able to share directions on a single platform,” said the driver.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gps-ambulances-a-distant-dream/articleshow/88461297.cms||Tanmayee Tyagi

The government has introduced curbs for Christmas and New Year celebrations recently. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra told reporters that the maximum number of guests as per the previous government circular is 400 people. People should be more responsible and follow the guidelines of the government during weddings, he said, adding that respective GPs and ULBs have been asked to monitor functions. “People should adhere to the restrictions of the government strictly. It is up to the GPs and ULBs to monitor the Covid-19 restrictions in their respective areas. Meanwhile, people should also should be responsible and hold weddings within the framework of government restrictions. We have instructed authorities in the GPs and ULBs to initiate action against those who violate the norms during weddings. As per the government circular, the maximum number of people allowed in any function is 400,” the DC said. He said that many religious functions are also held at temples, churches and mosques. “Self-regulation is important, rather than going for lockdowns and other severe restrictions that will affect the economy further. Don’t be irresponsible just because the district administration is not acting tough,” the DC said. “All malls and multiplexes have been asked to verify vaccine certificates at the entrance. In the next phase, identity cards of people will also be checked at the entrance of malls and other public places, if the number of Covid-19 cases, especially the Omicron variant, increases,” he said. The DC also cautioned all students who travel to their homes in Kerala during Christmas to be careful. “Bring RT-PCR negative report compulsorily and remain in quarantine for 7 days. They also should not mingle with other students while being in quarantine. The positivity rate in Kasaragod is around 6% and it is 8-9% in Kerala. In Dakshina Kannada, it is less than 0.2% and the district has 164 active cases,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/authorities-keeping-a-close-watch-on-weddings-in-dk/articleshow/88461293.cms||Vinobha K T

Shirodkar was welcomed into the party in the presence of Rajya Sabha MP and TMC national vice-president Luizinho Faleiro and TMC leader Derek O’Brien, at the party office in Panaji. Speaking on the occasion after his induction, Shirodkar took a dig at Kamat. “‘There has been no attention paid to the fish market, bus stands, parking lots, railway station in Margao, and on top of that the MLA of Margao is himself involved in match-fixing. He has done no work for the area over the last few years and the people are waiting for a change in governance,” he said. He further said that TMC was “the only force that can wipe BJP out from Goa.” Shirodkar who had won the civic polls for three terms, parted ways with Kamat after the latter didn’t consider his candidature for the top positions in the council. Eight other businessmen from the area, Prasad Navelkar Taquee Sayed, Suresh Karapurakar, Moosa Sheikh, Amar Kantak, Minhazuddin, Abdul Khadar Gazi and Arjun Hatriki also joined the party. Welcoming Shirodkar into the party, Faleiro said, “People of Margao have been waiting for change since long, and it is time we vote for a party that actually works for Goans.” Meanwhile, another councillor of MMC, Mahesh Amonkar, also joined TMC on Friday .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kamats-former-aide-ghanashyam-embraces-tmc/articleshow/88482119.cms||---

This machine measures the body temperature and displays it on the screen and it has the provision to sanitize hands of visitors using a dispenser unit without touching the surface. This machine is also capable of giving feedback signals like an alarm whenever the temperature crosses the prescribed limits. Sharma was guided by Ashwinkumar Mahindrakar. “This machine has the capacity to sanitize around 500 people using one litre of sanitizer liquid under the condition of one cycle of sanitization per person. This machine can be used in two different versions as a wall mounted as well as table mounted machine, depending on the requirement. This machine can be kept at the entrance to offices, malls, institutions or shopping complex.” Mangesh Karad, executive president of MIT-ADT University, said, “This automatic temperature screening and sanitizer dispenser will help frontline workers fight the virus more effectively. When the entire nation is fighting the pandemic, Harshit’s revolutionary contribution will help a great extent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mit-student-designs-temp-sanitizer-machine/articleshow/88461316.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Spl court snub for ED, bail for hawala accused Jain||Mumbai: A special court on Thursday granted bail to Delhi-based hawala operator Virendra Kumar Jain, brushing aside arguments of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) that it now wanted his custody since he allegedly “collected huge cash” from former home minister Anil Deshmukh through hawala. “Till date there is no judgment in any ED case pending in this court since beginning,” PMLA Judge M G Deshpande said. “I strongly feel that the stand taken by ED is feigned.” The special judge said there was absolutely nothing to take the accused in custody “and put him behind bars for endless period” and that too when the “ED wishes to allow him to wander scot-free since long till now and now wishes to send him to jail”. Jain is a co-accused along with 13 others in the ED case. Deshmukh is a co-accused but the chargesheet against him is not filed till date and he is in judicial custody. Jain’s counsel Ejaz Khan argued that the ED had not arrested his client during investigation and he had cooperated with the probe and appeared after summons were issued after the court order of September 16. On his appearance in court, he filed the bail plea while the ED opposed it strongly. ED special public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves opposing his bail plea said Jain is a director of many companies which are just paper-based companies and that he along with Surendra Jain, a co-accused in the case, channelised the cash “through web of various shell companies to Deshmukh;s trust in garb of donations”. The ED said Rs 4 crore was diverted to Shree Sai Shikshan Sanstha controlled by Deshmukh’s family, whom Jain “directly and knowingly assisted in layering the proceeds of crime”. The court referred to the Supreme Court ruling which said if an accused has been on bail during investigation merely because a chargesheet has been filed cannot be the reason for his arrest. The court said: “Had the ED any apprehension they would have arrested (Jain) way back during the course of investigation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spl-court-snub-for-ed-bail-for-hawala-accused-jain/articleshow/88463448.cms||---

When it became known that a huge conference was held at Nizamuddin Markaz, New Delhi, in March 2020, there was a hysterical reaction all over the country, including in the media. The Tablighi event was uniformly characterized as a superspreader. As a prominent commentator dealing with current affairs, the petitioner on his YouTube channel spoke on the subject. His intention was that the spread of the pandemic must be stopped, the judge said.The petitioner nowhere spoke in a divisive manner. In fact, he did not even challenge the ideology of Tablighi Jamaat, which has now been proscribed as a terrorist organization by Saudi Arabia, Justice Swaminathan said. He was directing his criticism only at a section of the attendees. In the case on hand, the petitioner has nowhere targeted Islam or the religious beliefs of Muslims as a class. In fact, the petitioner has given several disclaimers in his video and repeatedly cautioned the viewers that his presentation should not be misconstrued as criticism of Muslims. “One cannot lose sight of the fact that India is seen as a soft target by global terror networks. Terrorism can take any form. When pandemic struck, it was seen as another form of bio-warfare. Such reports were very much made even in the mainstream media," observed the judge. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be blamed or faulted for having voiced his apprehensions. The petitioner held aloft icons such as Azim Premji. This shows that the petitioner never intended to cause any feeling of alienation in the Muslim community. A reading of the entire transcript of the video in question gives an impression that the petitioner wanted everyone to stand together with the administration in a time of grave health emergency, observed the judge. The judge observed that the petitioner as a YouTuber actively commenting on current issues is entitled to the protection of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The petitioner has relied solely on the news resources then available in the public domain. The judge said that the very registration of the FIR is illegal and hence quashed it. The Melapalayam police registered a case against Maridhas following the complaint lodged by Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam functionary Mohammed Kadhar Meeran on April 4, 2020. The Madurai city cyber crime police had registered a case and arrested Maridhas on December 9, for posting a tweet questioning 'Is Tamil Nadu turning into Kashmir under DMK rule?, after the IAF chopper crash in Coonoor that claimed the lives of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and 13 others. The case was quashed by HC on December 14. There is another criminal case pending against Maridhas for forging the email of a private news channel. He was recently remanded in judicial custody in this case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/criticism-of-outfit-not-criticism-of-islam-hc/articleshow/88462093.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Malls, pubs and eateries stare at huge losses as party’s called off||NEW DELHI: A mall in Saket had planned an alfresco market for the weekend. This was to celebrate Christmas in the open, while food stalls were to be put up by leading restaurants, artisanal products were to be on display and visitors could have had mulled wine and beer under the sun. Till Wednesday afternoon, efforts were on in full swing to get all the permissions and licences in place and plan how to best manage the high turnout expected over the weekend. But on Thursday, mails were being sent to all vendors, outlets, artistes and participants informing them about cancellation of the event due to the DDMA order prohibiting celebrations in public. From hoping for a sold-out week, bars, clubs, malls and markets are now staring at a washout. Most live music events planned in clubs have been cancelled, artiste performances dropped, gigs at banquets removed from the roster and brunches turned into a mellow sit down affair without music or celebration. The restaurant industry that was expecting one of its biggest fortnight ahead is now busy counting its losses. Priyank Sukhija of First Fiddle Restaurants, who is also the Delhi chapter head of National Restaurant Association of India, said the combined losses would run into hundreds of crores. Every place had signed up artistes for special nights, planned various themed events and invested in promotions. All this has come to naught due to the ban on celebrations. Busy with opening two new outlets in Mehrauli, Sukhija rued that the restaurant industry was being singled out, while there were no such restrictions on local markets or election rallies. Rahul Singh of The Beer Cafe said cancellation of events was a huge blow to the industry. Rather than a festive week, there would be sleepless nights for most entrepreneurs. This was also the time when thousands of temporary jobs were generated due to hundreds of events, but everything had been cancelled. Ashish Begwani of Toy Room and Ophelia said from thinking about getting the best artistes to perform till last week, the owner’s mind was now on cancelling the event. He added that effort should have been on ensuring better implementation of protocols, rather than cancelling events as that has resulted in huge losses to them. “Every place employs at least 50 people, but now they are all grappling with uncertainty again,” he said. Most five-star hotels are now promoting their food options over their banquet events as Christmas Eve and New Year’s parties stand cancelled. Fabled Christmas brunches are not expected to have any live singing and will have table service and pre-recorded music. Lavish meals at Megu, Le Cirque at The Leela Palace to lunches at Bukhara, Dum Pukht and Ottimo at ITC Maurya are again in focus over music gigs. Most hotels said their food places had not seen too many cancellations. Ajit Shah, partner, White Panda Hospitality, said the new restrictions simply meant revenue shortage for the F&B industry. While his teams were treading with caution and following all Covid protocols, the bookings for Christmas and New Year’s were not as promising as they seemed at the beginning of December. He is optimistic about clocking good sales as his regular customers have not cancelled their bookings. Sukhija said Noida and Gurgaon had no such restrictions. He added that the industry shouldn’t have been singled out and the same rules should apply to every sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/its-a-washout-malls-pubs-and-eateries-stare-at-huge-losses-as-partys-called-off/articleshow/88462666.cms||Amin Ali

Official sources said that as many as eight special teams have been formed by Virudhunagar district police to nab Bhalaji. The first case is against Bhalaji and two of his accomplices for collecting money from 23 people on the promise of getting them government jobs in Aavin and government departments. The second is based on a complaint from K Nallathambi, a co-accused in the first case, who claimed that Rajenthra Bhalaji had used him as a tool to collect money from people promising jobs in Aavin. The former minister has been booked under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 506(i) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. Bhalaji had led his party’s protest in Virudhunagar against the DMK government on December 17. When he was informed that both his anticipatory bail petitions were dismissed by Madras high court, he left the spot by switching a few cars and absconded. Bhalaji had also filed a special leave application before Supreme Court challenging the dismissal of his anticipatory bail petitions. The lookout notice is an attempt to prevent him from leaving the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/police-issue-lookout-notice-against-former-min-rajenthra-bhalaji/articleshow/88462098.cms||---

You may hate Congress and you may hate Nehru, but you can’t hide history. Keep it before the people. Only the people of Goa and people of India will hold you in esteem,” he told Modi. He further slammed chief minister Pramod Sawant over his statement that temples destroyed by Portuguese will be rebuilt, and questioned why BJP failed to do so during the last 10 years it was in office. “People don’t need the government to build temples,” he said. He also criticised the government over “jobs for sale”, inflated water bills and bad roads. In reply to a query, Sardinha said he wasn’t interested in contesting the Curtorim assembly polls, and said he would work for the candidate nominated by the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sardinha-credits-nehru-for-goas-liberation/articleshow/88482123.cms||---

However, the 17 fishermen who were on board the boat are awaiting compensation from the shipping firm. The boat that left Colachel harbour on October 22 was hit by the cargo vessel 19 nautical miles away that night, badly damaging its front portion. All its crew members were thrown off in the impact but miraculously escaped death. Boat owner P Rajamani had moved the Madras high court which directed the shipping firm to hand over a compensation of Rs 70 lakh for the damages caused to the boat. The firm gave a bank guarantee of Rs 50 lakh to hold talks and settle the compensation for the fishermen who were on the boat, following which the ship was released from Mumbai port.Two months after the tragedy, the boat has been repaired with the compensation received and released into sea. “It will be taken for fishing after Christmas,” Rajamani told TOI. The fishermen are yet to get compensation from the shipping firm as fruitful talks are yet to be held. As an ad hoc measure, the boat owner has financially supported the families with a portion of the relief he got.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/boat-hit-by-ship-back-at-sea/articleshow/88462101.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Crowd starts to swell at Kolkata’s winter hot spots||KOLKATA: Swelling of revellers at various leisure points of the city prior to Christmas has raised concerns among the authorities in the wake of the Omicron threat, a new variant of Covid-19. Thousands of revellers, many of whom who are from districts, have already been visiting winter hot spots like Victoria, Maidan, Alipore zoo, Indian Museum, New Market and the Christmas Carnival at Park Street even before the Christmas Eve. The crowd surge has prompted the authorities to take a relook at the measures to handle the rush on big days. Cops said they will be deploying more police personnel and volunteers to control the crowd and ensure that it doesn’t become unmanageable at any point of time. They have started making arrangements like putting up barricades and making provisions for thermal scanning and sanitisation. But in private, they admitted that none of these will work once several thousand revellers descend. An official of Alipore zoo said footfalls have surged since the last one week and it has been increasing in the run-up to Christmas. “Weather has been conducive, and people stayed away from outdoors for many months. These could be the reasons of such high footfalls over the past few days. But more people are expected to visit on Christmas and New Year,” said the official. The authorities have set up barricades to segregate the crowds. “If crowds increase inside, we might need to stop the entry for some time and wait for the place to clear up.” Victoria Memorial, St Paul’s Cathedral and Maidan are other hot spots for revellers during this part of the year. Indian Museum, too, attracts a lot of visitors. “We are scanning temperature and insisting on sanitising. Only those wearing masks will get entry but when so many people enter the premises, it gets difficult to track everybody. But our guards will keep an eye,” said an official. New Market, too, is witnessing a spike in visitors with long queues outside shops selling cakes, candies, Christmas decorations and the meat section. “Senior officers will be present at all these spots along with officers from local police station and even the reserve force. The idea is to make people keep moving so that it doesn’t get too crowded,” said a senior police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/crowd-starts-to-swell-at-citys-winter-hot-spots/articleshow/88461322.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Health dept directs 13 dists to scale up testing||Pune: The state public health department has directed 13 districts, including Akola, Buldhana, Bhandara and Gadchiroli, to scale up testing, after they were found to have had a sample collection of less than 5,000 in the December 13-19 week. A state health official said testing should only be scaled up against the backdrop of the Centre’s directive to all states and districts to increase surveillance. “Districts have been given funds to scale up their infrastructure for laboratories and there is no reason why they should be testing less,” he said. The 13 districts lagging in testing were directed to scale it up in a meeting. “Below-5,000 weekly testing is not acceptable. It has to improve,” said the official. Some local authorities claimed that they were not reporting too many Covid cases. But the Centre has asked the districts to conduct door-to-door case searches and test of all SARI/ILI and vulnerable/co-morbid people, besides ensuring right proportion of RT- PCR tests are conducted daily and contact tracing of all Covid-positive persons. Last week, a total of 7.6 lakh tests were conducted in the state. Experts stressed that no laxity should be shown in testing, especially in the wake of Omicron variant. The authorities stated that the contacts of an infected person should be tested immediately. Former state health director Dr PP Doke said it was known that Omicron spread more though it might be less virulent. “No district can take it easy on testing. Some people do not even approach laboratories for testing. There should be proper surveillance, especially because it is the winter season now,” he told TOI. Doke said the testing rules might change if cases increased eventually. “As of now, only international passengers are being tested. There is no community transmission yet, but we cannot be lax,” he said, stressing on scaled up vaccination. The Centre issued specific guidelines to the states against the backdrop of “initial signs of surge” in cases of Covid-19 as well as increased detection of the variant of concern (VoC), Omicron, in different parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-directs-13-dists-to-scale-up-testing/articleshow/88462102.cms||Nisha Nambiar

We have asked the Centre for the right to extend the quota limit beyond 50%. This will clear the path for the reservations for Marathas and Muslims. Unless this is done, Muslim reservation cannot proceed,” Malik told the state assembly. The former Congress-NCP government had issued an ordinance providing 5% quota for Muslims in jobs and education. Although a final ruling was awaited by the SC, its judgements had made it clear that the quota limit in a state cannot cross 50%, Malik pointed out. BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis said the MVA government was trying to mislead the public. “The SC ruling on the quota limit is very clear. The Centre cannot make an amendment on this,” he said. He also said that the BJP’s stand was clear that it did not support religion-based quotas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/cant-proceed-with-muslim-quota-till-centre-extends-50-cap-in-mumbai-malik/articleshow/88463456.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

We must make a shift. We need to change all of these leaders, ministers, and chief ministers, as well as the old parties. It’s time for an honest government. From now on, power will be directly in the hands of the people in Goa,” Kejriwal said. On health minister Vishwajit Rane announcing that he would contest against his father Pratapsing Rane and defeat him, Kejriwal said, “The state of Goa is rife with power madness. A power-hungry son challenging his father for a contest! Prabhu Shri Ram went into 14-years exile at the behest of his father. This is what our Hindu religion teaches us. Vishwajit Rane should be ashamed of his decision.” “I don’t understand politics and Goa’s politics I don’t understand at all. There is a minister in the BJP government who is trapped in a sex scandal and had to resign recently. There is a minister who was involved in ventilators and oxygen scams at the time of pandemic. A minister has been accused of a power sector scam and another minister has been accused of a labour scam. Some other minister takes bribes for government jobs. A minister is also accused of a garbage scam,” he said. He said that the key to change the political system lies with the people of Goa. In a press note, AAP state convener Rahul Mhambre slammed chief minister Pramod Sawant over complaints of inflated water bills. “This proves he can’t even copy Kejriwal properly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/revamp-political-system-by-booting-out-corrupt-politicians-says-kejriwal/articleshow/88482128.cms||---
---||Pune||‘RTI activist’ held for attempt to extort Rs 50L||Pune: The city crime branch on Wednesday night arrested ‘RTI activist’ Sudhir Ramchandra Alhat on the charge of attempting to extort Rs50 lakh from the wife of an event management and entertainment businessman from Kothrud. The police are also searching for three accomplices of Alhat in the case. Police said that in 2018, Alhat had approached the woman after her husband was arrested in a cheating case lodged by one of his business partners at the Deccan Gymkhana police station. Her husband is now out on bail. Alhat had offered his help to the woman to get the matter settled with the police. Later, he had also filed a complaint application against the Deccan Gymkhana police’s then police sub-inspector (PSI), who was investigating the cheating case, as well as a police constable, accusing them of irregularities in the probe. The PSI and constable were then placed under suspension. Recently, the woman directly approached the PSI, expressing her willingness to withdraw the allegations. Alhat did not take to her dealing with the police kindly, and started demanding money from her, cops said. Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-crime) Gajanan Tompe, police inspector (PI) Abhay Mahajan and their team arrested Alhat from his Shivajinagar residence late on Wednesday night. “A case of extortion and three cases under the provisions of assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of duty are already registered against Alhat in the past,” Tompe told TOI, adding, “We have appealed to the public to come forward with their complaints if Alhat has threatened them and tried to extort money.” PI Mahajan said, “The woman’s husband ran a healthcare company in Pune before venturing into event management and entertainment. There were some disputes within the company and the other partner approached the Deccan Gymkhana police with a complaint of cheating. The complaint was registered and her husband was arrested.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rti-activist-held-for-attempt-to-extort-rs-50l/articleshow/88461328.cms||---

Additional commissioner of PCMC, Vikas Dhakane, told TOI, “The structural audit was necessary to get to know the feasibility of the structure, which was erected in August 2020. As per the audit, we have been told that it is fit to operate as a makeshift hospital till May 2022.” Dhakane added that even though the jumbo hospital is fit to function, it is the last priority to resume amid the pandemic. “Even if Covid cases unfortunately see a rise in coming weeks, we will prioritise opening of our civic hospitals first, such as Thergaon hospital, Jijamata hospital, Akurdi hospital, New Bhosari hospital, and others, to cater to patients. If the patient load rises much more than these civic hospitals can bear, only then will we think of the jumbo unit and 200-bed Autocluster facility. Our major facilities have oxygen generation plants and oxygen storage plants, which can come in handy if required,” he clarified. When asked about the shifting of beds and other medical equipment from the jumbo unit to the civic hospitals a few months ago, Dhakane admitted that the civic body did do the needful, but added that if the need arises, the beds and equipment will be made available again at the jumbo unit without fail. Notably, the Magar stadium jumbo unit has served over 5,000 patients till date. The hospital had remained in controversy for poor medical facilities and theft of valuables during the second wave of the pandemic earlier this year in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/800-bed-hospital-fit-to-operate-till-may-pcmc/articleshow/88462112.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Venkatesan had cited the minister as saying that making Madurai the fourth international airport in Tamil Nadu is not justified since north Indian states have only one international airport. “The GST paid by TN last year is higher than those collectively paid by 21 states and union territories,’ the MP tweeted, marking the Union minister also, who was quick to respond. “Shocked and disappointed by the gross misrepresentation of facts here,” Scindia began his series of tweets. “Some States in both North (Uttar Pradesh) and South India (Kerala) have more than one international airports,” he said. “Decision to grant international status depends on several factors like passenger demand and proximity to other international airports in the state. In fact, we aim at multiplying the current number of airports in India,” he said. Since international flights are already operational at Madurai airport, the MP’s insistence on according international status is incomprehensible and contrary to the allegation, Scindia said. He concluded that his ministry promised support to increasing the number of international flights for Madurai by requesting Indian carriers to fly abroad from the city.Venkatesan responded that he shared with the media the minister’s efforts to operate flights to Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur from Madurai and welcomed it. “We are committed to transparency and we did not hide any information in our media briefing,” he said. “He (Scindia) said that at least five chief ministers demanded a second international airport and their demands were still not met. Our question is: What is the problem in declaring Madurai as an international airport,” the MP asked.The number of passengers who flew aboard from Madurai last year was larger than that from the two international airports in Uttar Pradesh – Varanasi and Kushinagar. But in UP, Kushinagar airport was launched in October 2021, foundation laid for one at Noida in November and it is declared that Ayodhya will have an international airport next year, Venkatesan added. Meanwhile Agrofood Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has strongly objected to Scindia’s refusal to upgrade Madurai airport as an international one. Calling it a rude shock, chamber president S Rethinavelu said the “provision of infrastructure is need-based and not sugar candy distributed equally to the children in a classroom.” Tirupathi and Varanasi airports were declared as international airport on the grounds of pilgrimage centres despite both having very less international passengers compared to Madurai. Kerala with only a third of the GST contribution of Tamil Nadu has four international airports. Tamil Nadu leads the chart of the most industrialized states in our country, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-minister-spar-over-intl-status-for-airport/articleshow/88462114.cms||---

The cathedral is run by the archdiocese of the Roman Catholic Church. Banerjee has been attending midnight mass here for a few years and is blessed by archbishop Thomas D Souza. re in our lives and how important it is to restore what we take from her are coming up on the premises. The exhibition is being put up by Church Art, an organisation from the city that had designed a crib depicting the birth of Jesus in a manger which finds place among 223 other cribs from 93 countries at the International Nativity Museum of Bethlehem. The exhibition will highlight St Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of the archdiocese, who, in 1223, celebrated the Feast of Nativity by bringing in the concept of the crib and baby Jesus in the manger lying between the donkey and the ox, with his parents by his side. “This was the first time the symbolism of the crib was celebrated in the woods of Greecio near Assisi on Christmas Eve. Saint Francis was inspired by his visit to the Holy Land in1219 and his thoughts metamorphosed into the crib he got designed to bring to life what people read in gospels about Jesus’s birth,” said Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the Archdiocese. Saint Francis wanted to send the message that it is the forest that is the giver of the life force we enjoy. “We are trying to spread that original message of green Christmas through the exhibition. We are grateful that the CM has agreed to inaugurate the exhibition,” said Franklin Menezes, parish priest of the cathedral. The CM will arrive at the cathedral at 9.45pm and inaugurate the exhibition before the mass starts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-to-inaugurate-nativity-exhibition/articleshow/88461332.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Leader of the opposition (LOP) and senior Congress leader Sukhram Rathwa said, “Gujarat government needs to conduct a judicial inquiry through a sitting high court judge on the series of exam paper leaks, which amount to cheating the youth of Gujarat.

The statements were made during a three-day 'Dharam Sansad' held in Haridwar, which was a closed-door event addressed by over 50 seers. Uttarakhand director general of police (DGP) Ashok Kumar told TOI that a case has been registered against one named and several unnamed persons under section 153-A (offence of promoting disharmony, enmity or feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was registered on the complaint of Gulbahar Khan, a resident of Jwalapur in Haridwar, who in his complaint, alleged that Jitendra Narayan Singh Tyagi, formerly known as Waseem Rizvi, and others present at the event made "highly objectionable and provocative" statements.” When contacted, Tyagi alias Rizvi dismissed the allegations and said that "no such provocative statements were made by any speaker at the event", while adding that “speakers did express their opinion on a particular community and its religious symbols.” Incidentally, Trinamool Congress member Saket Gokhale has also filed a complaint against “provocative and communal speeches made against minority communities at the event.”  The three-day 'Dharam Sansad', held from December 16 to 19 at Ved Niketan Dham at Bhopatwala in Haridwar was organised by Yati Narsinghanand, priest of the Dasna temple in Ghaziabad, who has often courted controversy with his provocative statements. When contacted, Narasinghanand said that a few speakers at the conclave had “spoken out what they felt.” When queried specifically about Mahamandaleshwar Dharm Das from Patna, who had made provocative remarks against Manmohan Singh for his statement that minorities in the country have the first right over the country's resources, Narasinghanand said that this was Das’s personal opinion. He however added that "being a supporter of Nathuram Godse. I do not oppose such statements."

He is among five leaders who joined the party this year and put in papers before 2022 Assembly polls. Alleging that the TMC tried to divide the people of Goa on religious lines, five primary members of the TMC, including Mamledar, resigned from the party. Mamledar had joined AITC along with former Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro, former Congress spokesperson Yatish Naik and former Goa Congress general secretary Vijay Pai on September 29. A strong critic of MGP president Deepak Dhavalikar and his brother Sudin, the Madkai MLA was expelled from MGP two years ago for indulging in anti-party activities. “We had thought that AITC is a secular party, but with deep regret, we would like to bring to your notice that AITC has tried to divide Goans on the basis of religion by aligning with Sudin Dhavalikar,” Mamledar said in his resignation letter addressed to party president Mamata Banerjee, signed by four others – Sujay Malik, Kishore Parwar, Komal Parwar and Ram Mamledar. “AITC’s move to polarise Hindu votes towards MGP and Catholic votes towards AITC is purely communal in nature. We do not want to continue with a party which is trying to divide Goans. We will not allow AITC to break the secular fabric of the state and we shall protect it.” Mamledar said he was disillusioned with the party. “We had joined AITC with the hope that it would bring brighter days for Goa and Goans. But it is unfortunate that AITC has not understood Goa and Goans,” he said in the letter. Mamledar was hopeful of contesting against his arch rival Sudin Dhavalikar from Madkai constituency. However, with AITC now having forged a pre-poll alliance with MGP, Mamledar’s hopes of getting a ticket from AITC were almost dashed. Besides, he would now have had to campaign for Dhavalikar, something that would have caused him acute embarrassment. Mamledar told TOI that he had raised his objections against TMC’s alliance with MGP. “I told them in no uncertain terms that I wouldn’t be able to share any platform, stage or photograph with Dhavalikar. They argued that with MGP being our alliance partner, I couldn’t opt out of the campaign. This was when our differences reached a flashpoint and I decided to resign.” Mamledar, a resident of Porvorim, said, he had initially expressed his desire to contest from Porvorim, when he joined TMC, but “when it appeared that (Porvorim MLA) Khaunte could join Congress and considering the possibility of a TMC-Congress alliance, I offered myself to contest from Madkai so as not to pose any hurdles in the alliance plans. However, I was kept in the dark by TMC about its plans to forge an alliance with MGP.” Mamledar said he is willing to contest from Madkai if any party gives him the ticket. Madkai is traditionally a stronghold of MGP with Dhavalikar representing the constituency since 1999. Mamledar, who earlier was in MGP, also accused TMC of making false promises during the campaigning for Goa assembly polls. "TMC launched 'Laxmi Bhandar' scheme, promising Rs 500 per month to West Bengal women. But in Goa, they promised Rs 5,000 per month, which is next to impossible. When a party feels defeated, they make false promises. I won't be a part of a party who fools people," he said. Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) aggressively started campaigning for the upcoming polls after former Goa Chief Minister Luizinho Faleiro joined the party. Earlier this month, the TMC supremo was embarked on a three-day visit to the coastal state. Goa is scheduled to go for the Assembly polls in early 2022.

Parents who were earlier eager to send their children back to school are now strictly against it. They are more concerned as children are yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19. Mohit Goel, a parent of two children — one in Class IX and the other in nursery, is particularly worried about the new Omicron variant. “There is panic among parents as we do not know how this variant is going to affect children,” said Goel, who has decided against sending his elder child to school. For the younger one, the school is still fully online. Most private schools reopened from December 20 after they were shut on December 3 due to pollution. For junior students, the schools can reopen from December 27, though no order has come yet from the directorate of education. “In my school, out of the approximately 1,900 students, 279 came on Thursday. For Class XII students, the exams have just got over. Even for Class X, the attendance is low. Among parents, the virus concern is one reason, another one is transport,” said Minakshi Kushwaha, principal of Birla Vidya Niketan at Pushp Vihar. The winter vacation starts from December 25, so it will not call junior school children before reopening on January 4. Another parent, whose child is a Class VI student at a private school in south Delhi, feels the government should not have closed schools due to pollution after opening them in November. “The government should have allowed them to function without disruption. At least there was no scare of Omicron; pollution was there but all of us know there is no solution to it,” said Akanksha Gulati. At Manav Sthali School, the attendance has not picked up since its reopening on Tuesday. According to an official at Delhi Public School, “Some children were turning up in November. Now the consent from parents is very less.” Some schools like Tagore International, Vasant Vihar have decided to reopen only after the winter break. Many parents said even vaccinated people were getting infected by Omicron. Janani Sethi, a mother of two children, said, “At one point, we heard about vaccines for children, now there is no talk about it. As long as there is no vaccine, I am not ready to send my child to school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fresh-covid-fears-hit-attendance-at-private-schools/articleshow/88462692.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Pune||2 ZP pupils complain about teacher’s improper touch||Pune: A Pune Zilla Parishad school teacher has been booked under the POCSO Act provisions after the parents of two Standard VII girls lodged a complaint accusing him of sexually assaulting as well as harassing their daughters. The girls had narrated their woes to the parents, police said. “The incident happened on Tuesday on the school’s premises. We have registered an FIR against the teacher under Sections 8 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment) of the POSCO Act. The teacher has not been arrested yet as he is absconding. We are searching for him,” investigating officer from the police station said. The Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has appointed a three-member committee to conduct an inquiry and have suspended the teacher. Pune ZP CEO Ayush Prasad said, “The teacher, who is also the in-charge headmaster of the school, touched the two girl students inappropriately in class. The students told their parents about it who immediately registered a complaint in the police station. We have constituted a team of three officials from the taluka, to inquire and have immediately suspended him for three months.” Increased awareness about POCSO and good touch-bad touch has helped as many cases are being reported. “This has led to the increase in cases in Pune filed under POCSO. We have tied up with various NGOs and others to provide awareness. Child abuse is a big concern. This year, we are going to have a larger mission on creating awareness in villages also. We are in the process of appointing master trainers for POCSO. We are also getting content from NGOs. We are trying to create awareness about social evils which are unfortunately socially accepted by people such as domestic violence, beating up children etc, but now are criminal offences under the law,” he added. Prasad said while there are SC orders which say that after three months of suspension, teachers or other staff, need to be reinstated in service, the Pune ZP is taking a conscious decision not to recommend them for reinstatement till the court decision is made. “People can challenge it in court, but we have not reinstated them and we will not till the court has made its final decision,” he added . Schools across Pune rural areas have begun functioning with a healthy attendance after almost 18 months of closure due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-zp-pupils-complain-about-teachers-improper-touch/articleshow/88461352.cms||Ardhra Nair

In a statement on Thursday, he pointed out that the building that crashed on two policemen, killing one of them, in East Veli Street on Wednesday was 110 years old. Panneerselvam called for speedy identification and demolition of such buildings and initiation of stringent legal action against the owner to avert such accidents. He also urged the government to enhance the compensation of Rs 25 lakh announced for the relatives of the deceased head constable Saravanan, as he died while on duty. He also urged the government to bear the full medical expenses of the injured Kannan who is undergoing treatment.Solatium to kin of SSI: Tamil Nadu IPS Officers’ Association on Thursday handed over Rs 4.98 lakh as solatium to the kin of special sub-inspector (SSI) S Boominathan, 50, who was killed by goat thieves. On behalf of the association, additional director general of police (ADGP)-operations A Amalraj handed over a cheque to Boominathan’s wife and son at the office of the inspector general of police, central zone. IGP V Balakrishnan, deputy inspector general of police A Saravanasundar and superintendent of police Sujith Kumar were present. Boominathan, attached to Trichy rural police, was murdered by three people including two juveniles on November 21.Cloth bags distributed: As part of the awareness building measures to do away with single-use plastic carry bags, NGOs and college students distributed hundreds of yellow cloth bags in Trichy on Thursday. Launching the ‘Save Cauvery’ campaign near Srirangam Cauvery bridge, the organisers briefed the onlookers on the impact of plastic waste in the water bodies. “After the Covid-19 pandemic, the usage of plastic carry bags has drastically increased despite the ban. Plastic waste dumped in drains clogs them and lead to stagnation during monsoon,” K C Neelamegam, working president of NGO Thanneer, said. Students from MAM Business School formed a human chain on the Cauvery bridge to create awareness among the motorists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/demolish-dilapidated-bldgs-ops/articleshow/88462119.cms||---

A private company was arranged to lift the loco for Rs 15 lakh. The loco remained at the spot for 63 days as the railways did not have appropriate crane and other equipment to lift and transport the loco, which was too heavy for the crane available with the Ambala division. The locomotive will now be transported to the electric loco repair depot in Ludhiana, said a senior official of the Ambala division. The loco, which was heading towards Ambala from Kalka, derailed near Chandimandir railway station late on October 20 evening. Three persons, including the driver of the loco, sustained injuries when it derailed and fell into a ditch along the tracks. Ambala division of the northern railways made an attempt to lift the locomotive but found it to be too heavy. The crane at the disposal of the Ambala division can only lift up to 70 tons while the derailed loco weighed 140 tons. The railway officer said that the average life span of a loco is 35 years and since the loco which derailed was just 10 years old, it will be shifted to the Ludhiana yard for repair. Ambala division has suspended three members of the derailed locomotive crew and initiated proceedings under the Railway Servant (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1968 (D&AR Rules) after being chargesheeted. The control staff of Ambala as well as Ferozepur division has also been taken up under D&AR rules. The action came after an enquiry found that the three crew members of the loco, including the driver, ignored the warning of Kalka yard maintenance staff and drove the loco to the Ambala yard, resulting in its derailment. It derailed near Chandimandir railway station when the brakes failed and the driver could neither stop the engine, nor reduce its speed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/derailed-loco-being-lifted-after-63-days-at-cost-of-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/88461363.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Pune||New compound that limits carbon footprint invented||PUNE: A new compound, a metal-organic framework (MOF), that can capture carbon dioxide at an unprecedented scale from industrial emissions was invented and scaled up by a group of researchers from the University of Calgary, University of Alberta, and University of Ottawa in Canada, and then engineered into an adsorption technology with the help of gas separation industries. Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune faculty member R Vaidhyanathan is among the contributors to this paper published in the international journal Science, recently. MOFs are porous, crystalline structures made by linking metal ions with organic ligands. The pores can accommodate gases and small molecules. Moreover, their organic backbone can be designed to bind preferentially to some molecules, making MOFs ideal molecular sieves for separation of gaseous mixtures Earlier in 2010, when working at the University of Calgary in Canada prior to joining IISER Pune, Vaidhyanathan was involved in developing a metal organic framework (MOF) azolate compound with excellent carbon capturing properties. The compound developed and tested in the current paper, CALF-20, is a variant of this azolate compound, as a scalable CO2 selective MOF, with even superior carbon capture ability. Currently, in industries, two types of adsorption technologies are used. However, there are drawbacks, which the scientists say, the new MOF has an edge over. One technology uses liquid amines to capture CO2. However, after capturing it, to reuse the CO2, one needs to heat this liquid which is time and energy-consuming. The other technology uses porous substances like zeolites but when used in humid conditions, zeolites also adsorb water, and to prevent this, heating columns are required which again cost extra in both money and energy. “This MOF adsorbs the CO2 quickly, more effectively and can also release it quickly by just lowering the pressures. While the MOF is more expensive than other porous absorbents, this can run millions of cycles without degradation, which means cost evens out in the end. Trials are still going on to see how many cycles we can go before the filter requires maintenance,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-compound-that-limits-carbon-footprint-invented/articleshow/88461374.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Kolkata||Take guard if you plan a night out in Kolkata||KOLKATA: It will be a bit hazardous to go for a night-out on Christmas Eve with the city's air turning the foul at night. Thermal inversion is refusing to allow dispersal of pollutants and thousands of goods vehicles are leaving a trail of noxious fumes. The tiny particles of pollutants can travel to your blood vessels and lungs to affect your health adversely. The city’s ambient air has remained poor (AQI: 201-300) and at night, it is moving closer to very poor (AQI: 301-400) across the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations. Worse, with the progress of the night, the air quality declines further. Since, thousands of people congregate at Park Street and other party zones in the city on the Christmas Eve, on December 25 and 31, people are likely to be affected adversely. Moreover, the cases of influenza are rising. It is very difficult to distinguish between Covid and non-Covid patients. Large gatherings should strictly be avoided, said pulmonologist Arup Halder. Track the pollution level in your city“Unlike 2020, the number of patients with breathing distress is sharply rising in our clinics and hospitals, which are indicative of the declining AQI. Since the city’s AQI is driven by PM2.5, the fear is more. The problem is thermal inversion, which is slowly setting in. It lowers the vertical wind movement because of lower radiative temperature at the ground level. If the wind speed goes down below 2m/second, the dispersal of pollutants from the lower strata of the atmosphere becomes insignificantly small. As pollutants pile up in the breathable height, people face serious health impacts, said a WBPCB scientist. Mercury may rise by a notch: MetThe minimum temperature dropped to 13.1°C in Kolkata and could spiral up to 14°C as the northwesterly winds slow down. A western disturbance could pull the mercury up further to around 15°C by Christmas, said the Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/take-guard-if-you-plan-a-night-out/articleshow/88461377.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Arrangements will be boosted at health centres as well as crematoria in the wake of the increasing Omicron cases. North Delhi Municipal Corporation has issued orders to deputy health officials for taking immediate steps and submitting action taken reports after regular intervals. It has also ordered for checking facilities at crematoria. “We have offered to extend all help to the district administration and executive magistrates in checking 50% occupancy at restaurants and ban on New Year’s celebrations,” said a north corporation official. The civic body has issued 14,723 challans from April to December 21 for not wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and spitting in the open. Twelve crematoria, burial grounds and cemeteries have been designated for Covid casualties and directions have been issued to zonal offices to arrange wood stock and safety gear for staff. South Delhi Municipal Corporation has already started taking action and issued 90 challans for violations within a day. “This time, the directives have been given to the district administration and not to the corporation’s deputy commissioners. But we have issued directions to our staff to ensure 100% vaccination, regular checks of weekly markets and intensifying challans,” said an official. A senior SDMC official said they had made arrangements for a 100-bedded Covid ward at Tilak Nagar Hospital and a 60-bedded ward at Purnima Sethi Hospital. In east Delhi, the health department has created 70 oxygen beds (45 for adults and 25 for children), 20 ICU beds with ventilators, 15-bedded casualty, 6,000 kilolitre liquid medical oxygen plant, 25 oxygen concentrators and adequate B and D-type oxygen cylinders for Covid patients. While 35 conventional pyres and four CNG units have been created at Karkardooma, Ghazipur and Seemapuri crematoria, two burial grounds have been made at Buland Masjid and Mulla Colony. “Additional pyres can be added, if needed. A green cremation system (using dung cakes) has been set up at Jwala Nagar and one unit at Seemapuri crematorium,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-to-up-vigil-in-mkts-to-ensure-compliance/articleshow/88462695.cms||Vibha Sharma

So far, only 30 magnetars have been spotted in the Milky Way. Shashi Bhushan Pandey, a scientist at Nainital-based Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), was also a part of this team. Talking to TOI, he said, “For many years, researchers have been trying to find out more about the violent energy eruptions from magnetars. The transient X-ray pulses of energies from magnetars are several thousand times greater than what the sun emits. We have been able to find some important clues to understand these violent short-duration flares from magnetars.” The team of scientists was able to achieve the breakthrough after studying a magnetar eruption, Pandey said. The scientists managed to measure different oscillations at the instants of the highest energy, which are a crucial component in understanding giant magnetar flares during the eruption. This first extragalactic magnetar study has also been published in the ‘Nature’ journal. Pandey, who co-wrote the journal’s article, said, “Even in an inactive state, magnetars can be several thousand times more luminous than the sun. Our research was based on a flash that lasted for around one-tenth of a second but the energy emitted during the eruption was equivalent to the energy that the sun radiates in 1,00,000 years.” He went on to add, “Continuous monitoring of magnetars in nearby galaxies will help in understanding this phenomenon. It will also pave the way to learn more about fast radio bursts, one of the most enigmatic phenomena in astronomy today.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aries-scientist-part-of-team-that-traced-first-clues-to-understand-high-energy-pulses-from-magnetars/articleshow/88461381.cms||---

The education officials had contended that the teachers had obtained graduation degrees from Maulana Azad National Urdu University, which is outside Gujarat and their degrees were not recognised for the jobs. The teachers had approached the high court after concerned education officers decided to terminate their services and issued recovery notices. The education officers claimed that the teachers had got salaries though they were not eligible for the jobs with degrees of BA and MA from the Maulana Azad University. One of the petitioners, Ruksanabanu Pathan, was dismissed by the Surat district education officer from the school she had joined in 2014 on a five-year contract to be regularised in service in 2019. The teachers requested the court to quash education authorities decisions and reinstate them in services. Since the issue reached the HC, the University Grants Commission filed an affidavit and asserted that the Maulana Azad National Urdu University was a recognised one and that the degree obtained from it was a valid one. After hearing the case, Justice Nikhil Kariel allowed the petitions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-allows-plea-by-sacked-teachers-with-degrees-from-maulana-azad-urdu-uni/articleshow/88461380.cms||---

The HC also said that the trial court should not unnecessarily give chance to accused to complain about delay in trial. In a case in which an accused is behind bars for last five years, the NIA added number of witnesses in its list for examination, but after the HC’s observations that proceedings should be expedited by the trial court, the prosecution curtailed the list to 34 witnesses and assured the HC that their examination would be over within two months. The bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice Niral Mehta posted the bail plea on February 24 for the hearing and directed the NIA court to conduct the case on day to day basis. “We don’t want any excuse of any nature at the end of the trial court,” the court said. For another bail plea in a case, which is pending before another NIA court, the judges said, “We expect the NIA court to have some planning. We are sure, with appropriate planning, this problem of delay in trial can be cured.” The HC further commented, “Why unnecessary give chance to accused persons charged with serious offences to complain about fundamental right under Article 21 of Constitution?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-directs-nia-courts-to-avoid-delay-in-trials/articleshow/88461388.cms||---

The petition, filed by Nehandpur-resident Sonu Kumar, states that a private firm, Gurukripa Traders, bagged the contract to develop a pond in the area in June 2021. However, the company, under the guise of developing a pond, is carrying out illegal mining on the Bandh Ganga and village society land in Nehandpur Tehsil, according to the petitioner. Kumar goes on to add that when a complaint was made to the district magistrate, the owners of the company threatened to kill the complainants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plea-against-illegal-mining-haridwar-dm-asked-to-submit-spot-report/articleshow/88461401.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court orders CBI to probe Deshmukh role in docu leak||New Delhi: A Delhi court has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the role of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in a document leak case. The CBI in its FIR alleged that the central agency’s sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari had entered into a criminal conspiracy with Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga and unknown persons, and disclosed sensitive and confidential documents to Daga. Tiwari, the FIR said, did this for subverting CBI’s investigation in an extortion case allegedly related to Deshmukh, in lieu of undue advantage and illegal gratification to himself. Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal said that from the reading of the chargesheet as a whole, and relevant record, it appears that other accused persons were closely associated with Deshmukh, and may have been acting in tandem with him, who may be the controlling mind of the larger conspiracy. It said that other accused persons might only be hands, as Deshmukh would have been and was the main beneficiary from the leakage of the documents. The court also pulled up the CBI for forsaking the “man pulling the strings” and directed it to thoroughly probe the role of Deshmukh. “The CBI seems to have left the engine/horse pulling the cart, thereby only arraigning those travelling in the cart. Without the pull of the engine or horse, the ride of the cart or conspiracy would not have been possible. Despite a mountain of apparent evidence, CBI seems to have forsaken the man pulling the strings or the controlling mind or master mind or head while only chargesheeting the hands, for reasons best known,” the court said in an order dated December 22. It asked the CBI to discreetly and thoroughly investigate Deshmukh’s role with utmost alacrity and in a time-bound manner. The court also directed the CBI to file a status report in this regard within four weeks. On August 29, a report that was allegedly part of a preliminary enquiry conducted by CBI got leaked in the media. The report allegedly mentions that the probe agency had concluded that “no cognizable offence has been committed by Anil Deshmukh.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-orders-cbi-to-probe-deshmukh-role-in-docu-leak/articleshow/88463484.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||State extends Nargol port bid deadline to Feb 4||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat government has once again revisited the deadline to submit bids for developing the greenfield port of Nargol and extended it till February 4. “The last date for bid submission was December 21. This has been revised and an extension of forty-five days have been given to those willing to participate in bidding process. The decision has been taken after there were requests from prospective bidders that they require more time to collect reliable data from the site and come up with firm proposals,” said government sources close to the development. Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB), the state’s maritime regulator had earlier set October 21 as the deadline for inviting global bids to develop the port with an initial investment of Rs 3,800 crore. This was extended to December 21. Companies like Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), DP World, JSW Steel and Essar group have evinced interest in the project by participating in the pre-bid meetings, said sources. Located about 140km north of Mumbai and 120 km south of Surat, Nargol was proposed to be a multi-function port capable of managing solid, liquid, and container cargo. It was confirmed as the new port site after a port project at Maroli, approximately 10 km away from Nargol, was abandoned in the wake of protests from local fishermen. GMB has provided the prospective bidders with some pre-feasibility reports, however the companies want to conduct in-depth site surveys to confirm financial viability, connectivity and other aspects before submitting their bids,” said an industry official. About two years ago, GMB cancelled the work awarded to a consortium of Cargo Motors Pvt Ltd and Israel Ports Co for the development of Nargol port project in 2012. This was after the company missed several deadlines for project execution. Gujarat government has put the greenfield project on fast-track at a time when plans are underway for a new port to be developed at Vadhavan in neighbouring state of Maharashtra, about 50kms away from Nargol. To make the project attractive, GMB has for the first time offered a discount of 20% for the waterfront charges as per its Schedule of Port Charges (SoPC). Also, the concession period under the state’s Build Operate Own and Transfer (BOOT) policy has been extended from 30 years to 50 years. The option of discount will lead to better feasibility parameters and shall facilitate the developer in raising capital at a lower cost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/state-extends-nargol-port-bid-deadline-to-feb-4/articleshow/88461400.cms||---

The major one is a 50% cut in stamp duty and registration fees, which represents a sizable chunk of government revenue. Representatives of the Gujarat chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), and a number of other associations of realtors, met top government functionaries recently with their demands. The state government indicated that it will look into all the demands and consider the feasible ones.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Bank centre loot was planned by teen, 3 arrested||LUCKNOW: Three men, including the 19-year-old mastermind, were arrested on Thursday for the loot at State Bank of India’s customer service centre on December 15. Two armed and masked miscreants had looted Rs 70,000 from a customer, and the mobile phone of an employee at the centre in Bakshi Ka Talab. They had held employees hostage at gunpoint. The mastermind of the crime, Adarsh Gupta, had planned the loot in detail and used social networking sites to recruit the two accomplices. Gupta, 19, has studied till Class 10. He had identified the two other accused—Sambhal residents Jitendra Singh and Satendra Yadav—through social media and asked them to come to Lucknow. The duo has a criminal record. “The loot was planned by Adarsh who had also conducted a recce of the centre and drawn a map with details like the distance of the nearest picket, police patrol, and the route they would take after the heist,” said BKT CO Navina Shukla. The officer added that Adarsh was pursuing the goal of quick money and a luxurious lifestyle. He had lured Satendra and Jitendra with offers of stay in swanky hotels of Delhi and Mumbai. A day before the crime, Adarsh had asked his accomplices to visit the centre posing as customers to know the number of guards and other security arrangements. “On the fateful day, Jitendra and Satendra entered the premises wielding guns while Adarsh waited outside on a bike. However, they could not succeed in looting more cash as villagers had started approaching . The duo opened fire in the air when they saw the crowd and escaped,” said BKT SHO Arvind Kumar Rana. Later, the trio reached a hotel, changed into expensive clothes and left for Delhi by bus. According to police, CCTV footage from the centre helped trace them. It showed a man (later identified as Adarsh) outside the centre at odd hours. “His details were cross-checked and it was found that he was not a customer,” said the police. This led to suspicion and police zeroed in on him. On Thursday, the gang was planning another loot. Cops recovered country-made pistols and Rs 35,000 from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bank-centre-loot-was-planned-by-teen-3-arrested/articleshow/88462708.cms||---

The candidates who completed these courses from platforms such as upGrad, GenNext among others said that they were offered an annual package of Rs 25 lakh on an average by employers. The candidates were hired across sectors such as technology, banking, financial services and insurance, media and entertainment among others. Ashwin Nair, a student who completed masters in computer management and added a data analytics course from an edtech online company, said, “I recently joined a multi-national company as a fresher but my skills in data analytics fetched me the job. I was offered a good package too so whatever I invested in taking additional course was taken good care of.” Director at the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Linkages at the Savitribai Phule Pune University, Apoorva Palkar, said that, “Industrial certifications are becoming more useful during hiring these days. This is a newer part of skill sets required but it also depends on what type of a course one has done.” Apoorva added, “If business students take courses in specific skill sets, they can find a place in the marketing and communications field. No longer is traditional marketing used especially after the pandemic. Digital and virtual space are gaining importance in traditional marketing parlance.” Mayank Kumar, co-founder and managing director, upGrad said, “The report reflects two key edtech trends witnessed in the year gone by. One underscores the significant capital inflows into edtech leading to consolidation, emphasizing the huge opportunity and value it presents in terms of being future-ready. The second is the influx of universities going online, which has overcrowded the market with courses while bringing up the age-old challenge of quality over quantity.” Shrushti Mundada, a candidate, who bagged an offer of Rs 28 lakh per annum at a Bengaluru-based multinational, said, “The employers are offering a good price for learners who have taken the effort to take up additional skills apart from their degree that are a demand of the industry. There is a war among companies to hire the best talent. The hiring scene in the industry has changed drastically and the compensation approach is also pushing learners to upskill themselves to leverage the opportunity at hand.”  Educators said students must use the online platforms to learn more skills that will keep them job ready and relevant in their jobs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/data-analysts-digital-marketers-top-hiring-list/articleshow/88461418.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

All political and social organisations need to join hands and form an HEC Bachao Sangharsh Samity to lend more teeth to the HEC workers’ agitations,” Sahay stressed at the rally organised at HEC Sector 3 roundabout here on Thursday. The Union government is out to destroy HEC. The state government in Jharkhand needs to come to the aid of HEC workers immediately. HEC workers have not received wages for the past six months. The state government should come to the aid of HEC workers and their starving families and thereby save HEC from imminent closure,” the Congress leader thundered. Representatives of all major HEC trade unions — INTUC-affiliated Hatia Project Workers Union, Citu-affiliated Hatia Mazdoor Union, Hatia Kamgar Union, HEC Karmchari Union, HEC Shramik Sangh, Hatia Mazdoor Lok Manch and Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, who were invited, turned out at the Congress rally in full force. Nearly 3,000 HEC workers have been on an indefinite strike since December 2 to demand full payment of their wages, that have remained unpaid since June 15. The strike has led to a complete shutdown of all the three HEC plants of Foundry and Forge, Heavy Machine Tool Plant and Heavy Machine Building Plant, adversely affecting execution of work orders from railways, defence, space, steel, coal, mining and other sectors. So far, the HEC workers’ agitation has remained apolitical with workers, irrespective of their trade union affiliations taking the lead. To ensure that their rights remain protected, HEC workers even went a step ahead to keep leaders of their respective trade unions at arm’s length and insisted that all major decisions would be jointly taken by the workers themselves. However, groups of HEC workers have submitted petitions to MLAs and MPs of all political parties from Ranchi, requesting them to take up their cause with the Union government and save HEC. MPs from the BJP as well as the Congress have also raised the HEC issue in Parliament.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-jumps-into-hec-fray-calls-for-mass-movement/articleshow/88460666.cms||Tapas Biswas

The bright winter sun is likely to hide behind a cloudy sky from December 26, courtesy a fresh bout of western disturbances which is advancing towards Jharkhand from western India. Under its effect, light rains and foggy mornings will be experienced across most parts of the state, excluding the southern and south-eastern districts. “The induced western disturbances will cause cloud cover over Jharkhand from December 27. Light showers are expected in isolated parts in western, northern and central Jharkhand. Ranchi and its adjoining areas will also experience cloud cover, which is likely to last till December 29,” Abhishek Anand, scientist at IMD Ranchi, said. Besides the overcast conditions, fog cover is also likely to engulf the early hours. While day-time temperatures will drop by a few notches, nights will become warmer by at least 3-4 degrees Celsius. However, weather scientists cautioned a fresh bout of chilly nights once the western disturbances blow over. “Once the skies clear out, there will be an abrupt drop in night time temperatures by at least four degrees,” Anand said. Night time temperatures in Ranchi and across the whole of Jharkhand are hovering below the double-digit mark for nearly a week now, courtesy the northerly winds blowing in from the Himalayas and the northwesterly winds from the Hindu Kush mountains. Daltonganj and Bokaro recorded night-time temperatures of 6 degrees Celsius on Thursday while Ranchi and Hazaribag recorded 7 degrees Celsius. Chaibasa, Deoghar and Giridih recorded night-time temperatures of 8 degrees Celsius while Jamshedpur and Godda recorded 9 degrees Celsius. As per IMD, night-time temperatures across Jharkhand are currently below normal by 2-5.7 degrees Celsius. However, with the cloud cover setting in, night-time mercury in Ranchi is likely to rise to 12 degrees Celsius while Jamshedpur will also experience warmer nights around 14-15 degrees Celsius. Night-time mercury will rise gradually from December 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/nights-to-get-warmer-post-christmas-rainfall-likely/articleshow/88460778.cms||Dhritiman Ray

"This Christmas comes after two years of heavy Covid-19 losses. Thousands of lives were lost, and many have lost their livelihood and families. All our parishes have been directed to decorate their churches in a simple way and shun all unnecessary expenditures. Do not burst crackers or indulge in any expensive merry making," Theodore Mascarenhas, auxillary bishop of Ranchi cum Apostolic administrator of Daltonganj, said at a Christmas function organised at Archbishop House here on Thursday. To set an example, the Archbishop House, the official residence of the Ranchi archbishop, has just put up a simple crib describing the scene of nativity to commemorate Christmas. No other decoration has been allowed, Bishop Mascarenhas said. "When Covid struck, the Catholic Church was in the forefront serving people in distress, irrespective of their race or religion. It distributed food amongst the hungry, the poor and needy, distributed blankets and medicines among the sick and needy, set up shelter homes and even helped transport people stuck in distant places to reach their homes safely,” he said. “Continuing the charitable work, the Catholic Church has decided to gift 20 cycle rickshaws and 32 sewing machines to the poor on December 26. This Christmas, we urge all to donate more to charity," he appealed. Ranchi Archbishop Felix Toppo too stressed that after two years of suffering due to Covid-19, this year, people should take steps to maintain communal harmony, reach out to the neighbours in distress and help everybody. "Decorations at our churches and fireworks have been strictly forbidden," the Ranchi archbishop said. When asked if Ranchi churches would follow the Jamshedpur example of doing away with the midnight Christmas mass, the Ranchi archbishop said that to prevent overcrowding at churches, all parishes have been given the choice of replacing the midnight mass with an evening mass at 7 or 8pm. “We have not cancelled any celebrations. However, all Covid-19 norms such as maintaining social distancing, wearing of masks and installing sanitisers at churches would be strictly adhered to," he added. Johan Dang, Moderator, Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Church, the oldest church in Chotanagpur, now 176 years old, said that to prevent overcrowding and enable those who are physically not in a condition to attend services in person, GEL Church would be hosting live streaming of the midnight mass on December 24 as well as the church services on December 25.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/churches-call-on-people-to-have-an-austere-christmas/articleshow/88460617.cms||Tapas Biswas

The Chatra deputy commissioner Anjali Yadav has sought a report on the death from the district civil surgeon, Shyam Nanda Singh. Taking cognisance of the incident, the district administration has also lodged a missing person’s report at the Kunda police station. Kunda block development officer Murli Yadav confirmed that Lakhan Baiga died on the campus of the Hazaribag Medical College and Hospital soon after he was referred there from the Chatra sadar hospital. “It was sheer negligence on the part of the Hazaribag hospital,” he said. However, sources in the health department said the Chatra sadar hospital was also equally negligent as it has referred Lakhan to the Hazaribag hospital without any medical attendant. According to the Hazaribag hospital medical record, Lakhan was admitted on October 22 and walked out of the hospital on the same day. On October 24 morning, he was found dead in front of the hospital’s new building. After a post mortem, his body was kept in the hospital mortuary for four days. On October 29, the funeral of the body was performed after declaring it as unclaimed. Lakhan hailed from Jagarnathpur village in Kunda block of Chatra district and on October 20, when he was returning home along with his wife, Sunita Baiga, his health suddenly deteriorated. Soon after, the mukhiya of the local panchayat, Rekha Devi, contacted the health officers concerned and Lakhan was rushed to the Chatra sadar hospital on a 108 ambulance. Sunita, who was left at the place, began searching for her husband and went from pillar to post in vain. Meanwhile, the mortuary’s caretaker, Mohammad Khalid, who is also a social worker, conducted the last rites of Lakhan. Talking to TOI, Khalid said, “I always clicked pictures of the bodies before performing the last rites. On Wednesday, Kunda police came here and took my statement. They also confirmed the identity of Lakhan through the pictures I showed them.” The incident has brought to the fore the suffering and the negligence suffered by the vulnerable tribal group despite funds being provided to uplift the community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/chatra-man-died-on-hosp-campus-cremated-in-hbag/articleshow/88460640.cms||---

Gupta, who also holds the portfolio of disaster management, said, “We are not planning to introduce any fresh curbs or impose restrictions for Christmas and New Year festivities. But we will remain vigilant and whatever advisory the government had issued as part of its Unlock guidelines ahead of Diwali will remain as it is.” Prior to Diwali in November, the government had issued a fresh set of unlock guidelines, as part of which all commercial and social activities were given the green signal and in-person classes were allowed to resume for all students, except those in the primary section. Amid growing concerns of the Omicron variant, Delhi has banned Christmas/New Year bash. When asked, Gupta said, “Jharkhand has not detected any Omicron case yet. But we have stepped up Covid testing at all our transit points and we are also working on upgrading our medical infrastructure. The overall Covid situation is under control.” While no case of Omicron has been reported in Jharkhand so far, the state’s active caseload is once again witnessing a surge. Jharkhand’s total number of active cases stood at 201, as per Wednesday night’s Covid bulletin, which is double compared to the figure of four weeks ago. With 51 cases on Wednesday night, the state reported the biggest surge in the last few weeks and Ranchi alone accounted for 25 new infections. The authorities are yet to ascertain if the recent surge in cases has any trace of the Omicron variant since the results of genome sequencing are yet to arrive from the Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) in Bhubaneswar. Three weeks ago, the state had sent over a dozen samples of Covid patients to ILS to find out if the new variant is responsible for the surge in cases. When asked, Gupta said a genome machine will be set up in Jharkhand very soon. He added, “Right now our focus is on the inoculation drive and we plan to vaccinate as many beneficiaries as possible and we are doing so through various methods. We are already holding month-long vaccination drives across all districts.” Out of the approximately 2.41 crore beneficiaries, the state’s first dose coverage is 74% while its second dose is 43%. While agreeing that there are many challenges when it comes to pushing up the vaccination coverage, Gupta said that one of the reasons for the low turnout of those taking the second dose is because such beneficiaries have migrated to other places. He urged the Union government to consider giving booster dose and vaccinating people below 18 years to prevent another wave of Covid-19 in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/no-new-curbs-ahead-of-x-mas-new-yr-assures-banna/articleshow/88460965.cms||ASRP Mukesh
